<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Acting president Vladimir Putin held a narrow majority
of the vote early Sunday in Russia's presidential election, poised
for the outright victory that the Kremlin had pursued with growing
desperation to avoid a runoff next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's anticlimactic triumph was huge in absolute
terms _ some 20 percentage points ahead of his closest rival, the
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ it also appeared likely to fall
considerably short of expectations. And that further elevated
doubts, which had begun to surface in the campaign's final days,
about the depth of Putin's popular support.
</P>
<P>
   With 93 percent of the ballots counted by early Monday morning,
Putin had captured 52.4 percent of the vote, compared with 29.69
percent for Zyuganov. The head of the liberal Yabloko party, the
legislator Grigory Yavlinsky, was in a remote third place with 7.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television stations proclaimed Putin the victor, saying
that a runoff would be unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The final pre-election polls, released a week before Sunday's
election, indicated that Putin was backed by as many as 57 per cent
of respondents who said they intended to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a postmidnight news conference, Putin seemed to give a nod to
the narrowness of his majority, noting that with a potential
electorate of 108 million, ``even a half percentage point is a huge
credit from the population.''
</P>
<P>
   More telling, he seemed to suggest that he might invite
political rivals into government in an apparent effort to build
political support for whatever programs he proposes.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was especially solicitous of Zyuganov, whose support
appeared almost one-fifth greater than pollsters had estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, Putin stated with surprising bluntness
that Zyuganov's showing, especially in the face of a relentlessly
hostile government and private press, was a warning that the
Kremlin was not adequately addressing the problems of the working
class and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered tributes to his bitter rivals, the former prime
minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, saying
that they had helped hold Russia together by supporting the war
against separatist rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they or any other outsiders will be brought to the
Kremlin ``is subject matter for negotiations,'' Putin said. But he
added, in an allusion to a classic Russian fairy tale, that he
would not allow his team to resemble ``the notorious troika, where
one is pulling into the water, another one backwards and the third
one to the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's intentions may well depend on whether the bare majority
to which he clung in Moscow's predawn survives the counting of the
final ballots. If it does, Putin can accurately claim a mandate
from Russian voters, paper-thin though it might be, to carry out
new policies.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, the law requires that he face the second-place
finisher, Zyuganov, in a runoff scheduled for April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one doubts that Putin would win such a contest
handily; Zyuganov, also the Communist candidate in the 1996
presidential election, could muster only 40 per cent of the vote in
a runoff that year against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear that Putin would emerge from that runoff a
diminished leader, stripped of the image of infallibility and
inevitability that has cloaked him almost since Yeltsin named him
prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the spare, dour 47-year-old former chief of domestic
intelligence, has captivated the public and utterly confounded
political sages since his vault from near-total obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected a man unschooled in politics and so bland in
personality and appearance to seize the Russians' imagination. Most
predicted that Putin's first and only action of profound importance
_ the launching of an all-out war on secessionist rebels in the
province of Chechnya _ would be an act of political suicide.
Yeltsin's decision in 1994 to conduct a Chechen war that went
disastrously awry for the Russian army almost cost him the 1996
election and was one cause of his impeachment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But in both cases Putin confounded the political pundits. His
calm decisiveness, apolitical manner and comparative youth
contrasted favorably with the bombast, Kremlin maneuvering and
indecision of the final years of an increasingly infirm Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   And the second Chechen war turned out to galvanize ordinary
citizens, stung by the loss of Soviet empire and industrial might,
who were looking for some evidence of Russian heft to boost their
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   At times this winter, polls indicated that close to three in
four Russians supported Putin's conduct as prime minister and _
after Yeltsin abruptly quit on New Year's Eve _ as acting
president. His support was so robust that Primakov, once seen as a
formidable opponent for the presidency, quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last month, some of that support began to fade. The
reason is not completely clear: It may be in part that Putin has
drifted out of the honeymoon phase that is granted new leaders, and
in part that voters began to focus on the election and discovered
other candidates they liked.

</P>
<P>
   ``The decline is among those people who like Putin but do not
vote for him,'' said Leonid Sedov, who directs the Public Opinion
Foundation, a major Moscow polling organization. ``They have
nothing against him; they think his policies are quite all right.
But they were going to vote for other persons anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of the campaign, during which it was forbidden
to publish opinion polls, Putin's backers launched a furious effort
to recapture some of that support, in part by launching negative
attacks on those politicians who were perceived as siphoning it
away.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the focus was on Yavlinsky. In the final days
of the race, as Putin garnered much media attention by flying a
combat fighter to Chechnya on an ostensibly official visit,
Yavlinsky was investigated by the government on suspicion of
illegally campaigning on a military base.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the state television network ORT, controlled in part
by the financier Boris Berezovsky, who is close to the Kremlin,
broadcast a series of news reports identifying Jews, homosexuals
and foreigners as principal supporters of Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Putin's chief campaign strategist denied any
role in those reports, which were clearly designed to stir
smoldering Russian biases against minorities to Yavlinsky's
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many mysterious and silly things happen during the campaign,''
the strategist, Gleb Pavlovsky, said in an interview on the
privately owned NTV network. ``I know nothing about Yavlinsky's
sexual orientation, and I know nothing about events that take place
in the gay community. If it was staged, it did Putin nothing but
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky, long regarded as a leader of Russia's Western-style
democrats, said Sunday night that his campaign ``achieved what we
wanted _ we have demonstrated that there are millions of people
behind us who support what we are talking about.'' He indicated
that he hopes to form a broader coalition of right-wing critics of
the Putin government.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what that coalition might be. Many of
Yavlinsky's ideological allies, such as the Yeltsin government
veterans who comprise the new Union of Right Forces, have cast
their lot with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   In geographic terms, Putin swept every region of the nation. But
he apparently avoided a runoff by piling up votes in European
Russia to offset a comparatively disappointing showing in Siberia
and on the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   In vast parts of the less populous east _in the enormous central
Siberian province of Krasnoyarsk, and far eastern regions like
Chukotka and Primoriye _ Putin failed to reach the 50 percent mark.
He also fell well short in the city of Moscow, which gave him only
46.3 percent of the vote and Yavlinsky 18.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in his hometown of St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest
city, Putin collected more than six of every 10 votes. And in
northwestern provinces like Kaliningrad and Karelia, he did almost
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The election commission stated that some 67 percent of voters
had cast ballots, slightly below the turnout in the nation's first
post-Soviet presidential election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That alleviated one of the Kremlin's secondary concerns: that
unanimous predictions of Putin's victory would depress turnout
below the legally binding level of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout fell below that floor, a new election would have been
required in four months. Since it did not, Putin will almost
certainly be sworn in, in May, for a full four-year term as
president.

the Academy Awards. He sings the next day's most talked-about
songs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rundown of his takeoffs on the nominees for best
picture:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' to the tune of
</P>
<P>
   ``Green Acres'':
</P>
<P>
   ```Green Mile' is the place to be. Tom Hanks is there but he
can't pee.
</P>
<P>
   Then as he walks his late-night watch, the big, tall, dark and
handsome man grabs his crotch.
</P>
<P>
   Bright lights.
</P>
<P>
   Last rites.
</P>
<P>
   Sponge dry.
</P>
<P>
   You fry.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong,
</P>
<P>
   but it was a little bit long.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours: Tell me why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' to the tune of ``People'':
</P>
<P>
   People,
</P>
<P>
   kids who see dead people
</P>
<P>
   are the spookiest people in the world.
</P>

<P>
   so if you see Uncle Doug,
</P>
<P>
   tell him I didn't pull the plug
</P>
<P>
   You see things that ain't there
</P>
<P>
   like Bruce Willis with hair.
</P>
<P>
   You're in ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   You were so great in ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   You may go home with Oscar and with Cher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' to the tune of ``The Minute
</P>
<P>
   Waltz'':
</P>
<P>
   I am gonna go on ``60 Minutes,''
</P>
<P>
   I am gonna go on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   I am gonna go and spill my guts on
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes,'' in ``60 Minutes'' I'm gonna tell them everything
I know.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope they put it on the show.
</P>
<P>
   I'll hate to risk my life by saying I'm gonna be on ``60
Minutes.'' Then tuning in to find that I'm not even there. It's
just Mike Wallace and an empty chair.
</P>
<P>
   So I can't keep it in and I'm gonna tell the truth and say you
done it. I'll just pray to God they have the guts to run it.
Someone tell Don Hewitt he has got to do it. Even though I know I
have my faults, I know everybody there thinks I'm a loony.
</P>
<P>
   They have got their nerve, they hired Andy Rooney. Hey Morley
Safer I am gonna sing the ``60 Minutes'' waltz. You can tell the
big guns up at BMW, I have some information that will trouble you.
Spare us from your friction, you know the cigarette addiction is
the thing that fill your vaults.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care that they all say I'm a wacko.
</P>
<P>
   Watch this little wacko bring down big tobacco. I'm a fighter
yes ``The Insider'' and I just sang the ``60 Minutes'' in waltz.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine and ``The Cider House Rules'' to the tune of
``Mame'':
</P>
<P>
   He never met a script that he didn't like, Caine.
</P>
<P>
   He's made a lot movies, first ``Alfie,'' then he kept making
more.
</P>
<P>
   He won for Woody Allen, but why did you have to go and make
``Jaws 4.''
</P>
<P>
   How many movies can one actor make, Caine.
</P>
<P>
   He'll make one in the next station break, Caine.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight you're dressed to kill and you may be going home the
prince of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   I'd gladly cross a bridge too far,
</P>
<P>
   to be the actor that you are,
</P>
<P>
   you're such a classy movie star, Caine.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' to the tune of ``That's Why the Lady Is a
Tramp''
</P>
<P>
   He just turned 40, but he digs a teen. Loves to shower but never
gets clean. The guy next door is a closeted marine.
</P>
<P>
   That's why this ``Beauty'' is a champ.
</P>
<P>
   There's always roses all over the floor. He gets his reefer from
that nut case kid next door. His wife is adulterin' and looking for
more.
</P>
<P>
   That's why this ``Beauty'' is a champ.
</P>
<P>
   He's now a free, fresh, high, hamburger-selling cat.
</P>
<P>
   He's lifting weights. She's throwing plates. She fled. He's
dead.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't a feel-good, but, boy, is it great.
</P>
<P>
   That's why this movie can win eight.

   The hottest colors at the Oscars were lilac, silver, gold and
black, paired with a bared back.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar hair? It's back up in fancy 'dos or long with loose curls.
Hair sparkles were out, but tiaras are still in. But those 'N Sync
guys sported the youthful trend of brightly dyed locks in red and
blue.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds were everywhere, on loan from famous jewelers Asprey &AMP;
Garrard, Bulgari and, of course, Harry Winston. But the Pamela
Dennis gown covered with 2,000 Lazare diamonds worn by talk-show
diva Leeza Gibbons was the biggest dazzler.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's department, the big sparkler was ``Green Mile''
star Michael Clarke Duncan, who wore huge diamond studs plus a
Concord wrist watch with a diamond-covered mouse on top.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of rumors about women in pants, only a few wore them,
including Best Actress nominees Meryl Streep and Janet McTeer.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion police Joan Rivers looked smashing in her Vera Wang
purple gown, but daughter Melissa missed the boat in a two-piece

RUSTY WALLACE GEARS UP FOR TEXAS WITH 50TH VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ With his 50th NASCAR Winston Cup victory in the
books and his mouth running almost as fast as his race car, Rusty
Wallace has drawn a circle around this weekend at Texas Motor
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace moved into a three-way tie for eighth-place on NASCAR's
all-time winner's list via his victory over Johnny Benson in the
Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway yesterday. It was Wallace's
first Victory Lane visit since he won on the high-banked,
0.533-mile oval here last April, a span of 32 races. An
acknowledged short-track specialist, Wallace said he had been
pointing to this bullring, site of his first Cup victory in April
1986, as the perfect place to pump some gusto into his 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a big bull's-eye on this racetrack and told my guys this
is ridiculous now,'' said Wallace, driver of the No. 2 Miller Lite
Ford Taurus. ``I won seven freaking times at Bristol. It's the site
of my very first win. There were 147,000 people in the grandstands.
It's the most exciting track on the circuit. That's one of the
reasons I came here and had a real in-depth test for two days here.
We learned a lot, and I think it helped in the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The racetrack at BMS requires a completely different setup than
the one Wallace will employ on the 1.5-mile quadoval in Fort Worth,
where first-round qualifying for the Sunday's DirecTV 500 is
scheduled for Friday afternoon. But after an appropriate
celebration last night, Wallace said he is excited about heading to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great car there last year,'' said Wallace, who
finished fourth and on the lead lap in a race won by native Texan
Terry Labonte. ``At the very end of the race, my car was flying. I
finally got a second groove worked in. I think I was the only one
up there running a second groove, and while I'm up there I'm
thinking, `What am I doing here?' But the car was running pretty
good. We really thought that if we could have got another caution
flag maybe we could have won the thing with a little track
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love going there. I stay in Fort Worth at a great hotel.
Got some great restaurants there, and the speedway is big and
beautiful. And since they rebuilt it \Rthe racing surface in
1998\S, it's great now. So I am excited to get to go to Texas next
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had only the third-best car on paper yesterday, as
three-time Cup champion Jeff Gordon dominated the day by leading
five times for 225 of the scheduled 500 laps. Wallace's
Penske/Kranefuss Racing teammate, Jeremy Mayfield, led four times
for 124 laps. But Wallace said he fine-tuned a setup he had hit
upon during Saturday's final Happy Hour practice, during which he
solved a front-end push that had made it difficult to turn through
the 36-degree banked corners.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, the 1989 Cup champion, took the lead for the third and
final time on Lap 425, when he passed reigning series champion Dale
Jarrett and began pulling away from a pack that also included Ward
Burton, the winner at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway last Sunday, series
points leader and native Texan Bobby Labonte, big brother Terry and
polesitter Steve Park.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the lead, Wallace withstood restart challenges posed by
the afternoon's ninth, 10th and 1lth caution flags to beat Benson
and his upstart Tyler Jet Motorsports team by 2.622 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, whose winning average speed was 88.018 mph, said he was
honored to join NASCAR legends Ned Jarrett and Junior Johnson at
the 50-victory level.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit 47 and 48 wins and 49, I started thinking, `Man,
I'd really like to have that 50th. That would be a special deal,'
'' said Wallace, who now has won at least one Cup race for 15
consecutive seasons. ``And I really wanted to get it accomplished
during NASCAR's 50th anniversary season \Rin 1998\S. And when I got
my 49th win last year here, I thought that was my 50th win. I
miscounted, but it still was a special deal. It was my own personal
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this stuff forever and been lucky to do pretty
good at it. It's a big relief, and now it's a green flag to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson, meanwhile, continued to impress in his first season as
driver of the No. 10 Lycos.com Pontiac Grand Prix owned by Tyler
businessman Tim Beverley. Benson's second-place result here, after
starting 33rd, was the best in his 133-race Cup career. Completing
the top five in a race that produced 18 lead changes among nine
drivers were Burton, Mayfield and Terry Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, who began the day with a nine-point championship
lead over Mark Martin, finished sixth here and will carry a
41-point advantage over Burton into Fort Worth.

BU FROZEN OUT IN FOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If it had ended in the first overtime Sunday, St.
Lawrence coach Joe Marsh's words would have aptly and artfully
described the NCAA East Regional game when he called it ``one of
the greatest ever played in college hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   If it had ended in the second overtime, paeans could have been
sung praising Boston University's Rick DiPietro and St. Lawrence's
Derek Gustafson, a pair of freshmen goaltenders who dueled and
dueled, save after save, stopping everything coming their way.
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro, ``trying to end it as fast as possible,'' also was
looping passes from behind his net to the red line, ``hoping,'' he
said, ``to start a breakaway.'' Which he did once, sending Carl
Corazzini in alone on Gustafson in the first OT. But Gustafson, of
course, made the save.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was quite a show, wasn't it?'' marveled BU coach Jack
Parker. ``Just who was going to blink. It was simply a great game
to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it had ended in the third OT, it might have sufficed to
simply call this the longest NCAA hockey tournament game ever,
surpassing the Maine-Michigan semifinal in 1995, which ended 28
seconds into the third overtime. A laurel wreath or two could have
been borrowed from the Boston Athletic Association and placed on
the brows of this marathon's survivors, because that's what this
was about _ as Marsh put it, ``a matter of who survived.''
</P>
<P>
   But the game superseded all that, going on and on and on and on
and on, finally ending 3:53 into the fourth overtime with St.
Lawrence a 3-2 victor when Robin Carruthers banged home a rebound
of his own shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Terriers and Skating Saints had played and skated and
endured and survived 123 minutes 53 seconds of hockey, two full
games and then some, leaving both teams ``legless'' in the final
OT, as Parker put it.
</P>
<P>
   It took until the fourth OT _ when cramps had reduced BU to only
``eight half-forwards,'' as Parker described his dehydrated but not
dispirited squad _ for Carruthers to turn on the red light after 72
minutes 3 seconds of darkness. He was assisted by Jim Lorentz, son
and namesake of the former Buffalo Sabre, who somehow found the
energy to scrum the puck loose from two BU players and feed his
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   When the second-chance shot went in, DiPietro collapsed in his
crease, not from the cramps that had bedeviled him, he said, ``but
from despair and disappointment. It was just heartbreaking to lose
a game like that.'' Especially after an NCAA-record _ and
mind-boggling _ 77 saves.
</P>
<P>
   But tales of the human body's endurance were as much a part of
the postgame words from players and coaches as comments on the
scintillating hockey. Parker recounted how Dan Cavanaugh collapsed
with cramps in the second OT, how Jack Baker's cramps laid him low
a little later, how it seemed his players barely ``had energy to
get over the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   BU trainer Larry Venis described the remedies employed to aid
the pain and misery of the players. ``We just loaded up on Gatorade
and water and were keeping cool with wet towels between periods,''
he said. ``We gave them water and Gatorade and vitamins and we gave
them pills to help with dehydration. Two guys missed time on the
ice, but everybody else had little epsidoes where they were
cramping up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Terriers were perhaps more susceptible to physical
breakdowns as the game wore down, having played a first-round game
just 24 hours earlier while St. Lawrence enjoyed a bye. But the
Saints were feeling it, too. In the third overtime, referee Duke
Shegos skated over to the St. Lawrence bench to say that Gustafson
was cramping up in net. But when someone on the bench held up a
water bottle, the goalie signaled ``no.'' (``I don't like water
bottles on top of the net.'') A little later the cramps got worse,
however, and the goalie was given some pills and water. He took a
sip, and slid the water bottle back to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The game wore out Shegos as well. Later in the third OT, he
skated over to Venis ``and asked for some Gatorade and some
dehydration pills for him,'' said the trainer. ``And we gave him
some vitamins for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was the longest in NCAA tournament history, but not the
longest college game. Colorado College and Wisconsin played 9:30
into a fourth OT in a conference tournament game in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But records did fall. The 77 saves by DiPietro broke the record
of Providence College's Chris Terreri, who had 62 in a 1985 NCAA
tournament game against Boston College. Terreri's total now is
third best, as Gustafson had 72 saves. The goalies' combined 149
saves set a record, obviously, as did the 154 shots on goal
(breaking the mark of 106 set by Maine and Michigan in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   The win makes St. Lawrence the first Eastern College Atlhetic
Conference team to make the Frozen Four since Vermont in 1996. No
ECAC team has won the national championship since Harvard in 1989.
St. Lawrence will meet Hockey East's Boston College in one
semifinal April 6 in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   The first 60 minutes Sunday can be described shortly and
concisely: St. Lawrence jumped out to a 2-0 lead but BU fought back
to tie the score on Brian Collins's tip-in of a Chris Dyment shot
from the right circle with 8:10 left in regulation. ``I think it
was great we came back from being down, 2-love,'' said Parker,
adding that these Terriers are ``one of the most resilient teams
I've ever coached.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the overtimes began.
</P>
<P>
   The second 60 minutes were scoreless simply because of the
goalies. Fatigue set in, legs began to fail, but neither team
played cautious hockey, as both had supreme chances. As an
indication, Gustafson had 31 saves during the 60 minutes of
regulation but made 41 in the next 63:53, while DiPietro had 43
saves in the first 60 minutes and 44 in the next 63:53.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best chances was when BU's Dyment let loose a
one-timer that hit the left post at 17:12 of the opening OT. ``I
gave the pipe a tap with my stick,'' said Gustafson in thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Twice BU had man advantages, and in the second OT St. Lawrence
had a power play for 3:37, but DiPietro and Gustafson stopped all.
</P>
<P>
   There were breakaways.
</P>
<P>
   There were 2-on-1s.
</P>
<P>
   There were 3-on-1s.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no goals in the first three overtimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to my team after the first overtime, `Hey, we'll do
this as long as it takes,' '' said Marsh, who is from Lynn, Mass.
``But I just didn't think it would take this long.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the paths of longtime friends Marsh and Parker crossed
at game's end, marathon's end, the coaches hugged and Marsh joked,
``Hey, you're not tired, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   No, ``exhausted'' is the word. The players, coaches, and
officials, but also the fans _ all exhausted by a marathon of
hockey.

NUMBING WAY TO BE LEFT OUT IN COLD 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Nearly six hours later, Rick DiPietro's motor
skills were all but turned to stone. He wasn't so much playing net
as surviving it, remaining upright on his skates but sinking ever
so slowly into the quicksand of exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' said Boston University's prized freshman goalie.
``My whole body was cramping. Catching glove. Stick hand. You can
drink water and stuff, but after a while you lose so much fluid,
and there's only so much you can drink.''
</P>
<P>
   Both hands and forearms were cramping. DiPietro's legs were
tired, heavy, still responsive but a split second behind optimum
performance. Ultimately, DiPietro couldn't snap his legs together
in time to stop a Robin Carruthers shot in the fourth overtime, and
that split-second delay spelled the end of BU's hockey season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made that first save,'' said DiPietro, replaying that final
second of the longest hockey game in NCAA tournament history,
Sunday's 3-2 St. Lawrence victory in the East Regional. ``I knew
the rebound was out there, but I thought it was past the shooter. I
didn't see it go by me, but I heard the yelling and everything, so
right there I was sure it was in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   BU and St. Lawrence played 123 minutes 53 seconds at Pepsi
Arena, and for the Terriers it proved to be a long exit ramp to the
dead end of a season. Gone was their hope of reaching the NCAA
championship game for the fourth time in 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 hours after dismissing St. Cloud in the opening round,
the Terriers were forced to play a virtual doubleheader against a
fast, aggressive St. Lawrence club that had a bye in the first
round. The Saints, champions of the ECAC, were rested and ready.
The Terriers were tired, hoping to rely on momentum and the elusive
second wind of tournament time to carry them to Providence for the
Frozen Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to be a war,'' said BU coach Jack Parker. ``For us, it
got to be a war of attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   With 5:32 gone in the second overtime, BU sophomore center Dan
Cavanaugh went down in a heap behind the goal line in the Terrier
end. He needed help leaving the ice. Done for the day. Or so Parker
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we go in the room for the intermission,'' said Parker,
``and he's getting dressed for the next period. A lot of guys were
hurting. Jack Baker had to leave the bench five or six times, his
legs were cramping so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey and overtime are a strange concoction, especially in the
playoffs. As the game drags on, skill and finesse give way to
lethargy and the loss of electrolytes. Plays don't end in a
flourish, they just end, a string of unfinished symphonies. The
best players eventually turn into Silly Putty, and it's usually
left to third- and fourth-liners to write the end chapter of
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Petr Klima, Edmonton's little-used Czech forward
who shot down the Bruins in the third OT during the 1990 Stanley
Cup finals. Here it was Carruthers, a third-line right wing from
Virden, Manitoba, who picked up a puck deep in BU's end, eluded
three Terriers, and needed two tries to push the winner between
DiPietro's wickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably after the second overtime, we were starting to get
doubts in our head,'' said Carruthers, ``and wondering when it was
going to end.''
</P>
<P>
   The clubs combined for 238 attempts at net, 154 of which landed.
They may have been tired, but they somehow kept regenerating enough
drive and stamina to keep the action from dissolving into a mid-ice
quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, both sides were spent by early in the third OT.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was getting monotonous,'' said DiPietro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to be cautious,'' said Parker, whose club battled back
from a 2-0 deficit, forcing OT with a pair of power-play strikes.
``I thought we were legless and they were legless, and not a lot of
opportunities were created.''
</P>
<P>
   The bands played on without skipping a beat. The BU trumpeters
and the St. Lawrence drummers, perched high in the stands, tooted
and banged their way from high noon to early evening.
</P>
<P>
   The players for the day's other game, from Michigan and Maine,
impatiently poked their heads out portals to see if their 3:30
start was meant to be a.m. or p.m. The rink turned into a ballroom
and the skaters marathon dancers. By the third OT, a few of the
Maine Black Bears were limbering up with a game of indoor street
hockey, passing the puck back and forth outside the press room at
the arena's floor level.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, when the shot by Carruthers swept between DiPietro's
legs, the abrupt ending segued to BU's long faces and St.
Lawrence's jubilant grins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great ride by my club,'' said Parker, the Terriers finishing
at 26-10-7. ``We had a lot of fun. I don't feel bad or sad. I feel
gratitude for having the chance to coach these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it meant coaching for a little longer than he wanted to
one day, and not enough for a next.

BLAME CANADA?

 THE SCENE-LADN  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Oscar wouldn't be Oscar without a little controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park's'' Trey Parker and Matt Stone provided the
controversy and the laughs in their mock frocks. With just the
right wig, Parker revived the famous Versace dress with the
plunging neckline that Jennifer Lopez wore to the Grammys. Only
this time, the sequined hot pants and midriff-bearing dress left a
little to be desired. Stone sported a look-alike to Gwyneth
Paltrow's Ralph Lauren pink gown of last year's awards. While Stone
is a thin man, he doesn't quite perfect the waifish glamour of a
Hollywood star. You gotta love the two for trying.
</P>
<P>
   They were accompanied by Marc Shaiman as their pimp. The
co-writer of the Oscar-nominated song ``Blame Canada'' wore a very
non-Oscar-like white leisure suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this your first year at the Oscars?'' fashion maven Joan
Rivers asked Stone and Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, and probably last,'' the duo answered.
</P>
<P>
   In a cruel twist for the fans, there was no Jennifer Lopez. But
the 72nd Academy Awards preshow was hectic, nevertheless. If you
don't believe it, just try sitting among hundreds of screaming,
pushy, overwhelmed fans who seemed they would die happy if they
could just get that one photograph of Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow
or Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for the fans, they did snap many of those coveted shots.
But there was so much screaming going on, nobody knew which way to
look.
</P>
<P>
   One young girl wearing a T-shirt with messages scrawled to her
favorite actors nearly burst a vein screaming for `N Sync's Justin
Timberlake. Timberlake finally turned to face the girl, who nearly
fainted at the gesture.
</P>
<P>
   In the company of stars like Meryl Streep, Michael Caine and
Anjelica Huston, that pop-y boy band `N Sync provoked more screams
than any of the stars combined. They dominated the Grammy Awards;
couldn't they sit out just this once? Not this year _ the
five-member teen heartthrobs were singing a duet with Gloria
Estefan for the Oscar-nominated song ``Music of My Heart.'' Next
year, expect the Backstreet Boys to be up for an Oscar in a short
film about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Michael Clarke Duncan and Haley Joel Osment who wowed
the crowds the most. The two Supporting Actor nominees may have
gone home empty-handed, but their presence on the red carpet proved
their effect on their fans. Duncan came out towering over the
crowd. He whooped, he hollered, and he even stopped to give
autographs to at least a dozen fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remember that I love you guys,'' he shouted to his
adoring fans. ``I wouldn't be here without your support.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Haley Joel Osment, barely visible among the throngs of
people, proved to be a photographer's and a fan's dream. He was
ear-to-ear smiles as reporters, photographers, publicists and
academy crew members pushed and pulled him along the red carpet.
The sixth-grade wunderkind took it all in stride. Just another day
in the life of an 11-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   As the classic and not-so-classic beauties and stars rushed to
fill their seats inside the Shrine Auditorium, the chaos died down,
but the excitement remained.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone involved in this year's historic Academy Awards _
from the die-hard fans, who camped out for weeks only to sit in
nosebleed seats, to the winners themselves _ the 72nd Academy
Awards proved that, in this town, our stars are our royalty.

PLAYERS WAITING TO BE SPRUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ On their way to work Sunday morning, the Red
Sox passed one small airport, a couple of steakhouses, a few strip
malls, about 75 fast-food restaurants, and, unfortunately, not a
single Mariner, Angel, or Devil Ray.
</P>
<P>
   On their way to work Friday morning, the Red Sox . . . did the
same thing as Sunday. On the Friday morning before that, the Red
Sox . . . did the same thing. And on the Friday morning before
that, the Red Sox . . . did the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard Jimy Williams say that his team ``plays the
schedule.'' What the manager doesn't add is this: By now, that
schedule can turn a baseball player into a metronome.
</P>
<P>
   It's the last week of the Grapefruit League and the Sox are sick
of Florida. Many of the players tried to break up their spring
routine by watching the NCAA tournament. But since this state has
trapped the Sox on a treadmill, guess what team the Sox saw as they
stared at the screen? The University of Florida Gators, of course.
</P>
<P>
   If you approached a Boston player this morning and told him he's
won a trip to Alabama, he would respond as if he were a winner on
Oscar Night. (``I'd like to thank God. My family. My friends. My
fans. I mean, Alabama! Wow, this is such an honor . . .'') It's
nothing against Florida. Spring training and spring break are cool
for a week, two weeks, or even three. But by Week 6 you find
yourself saying, ``82 and sunny again? Damn!''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gaetti is Boston's spring master. The 41-year-old infielder
has been through this 19 times. ``I've done them both,'' he said
Sunday, ``Florida and Arizona.'' This is how it works:
</P>
<P>
   There is family-reunion excitement in February. A slight lull
emerges 10 days later. The energy returns in early March when the
exhibition games begin. By late March, you find yourself longing to
be booed in Yankee Stadium, Safeco Field, and, let's be realistic,
Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are the bus rides, back and forth, back and forth,''
Gaetti said. ``A lot of it all is the same. It's time (for the
season to start).''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, John Valentin leaned in a chair and talked
about the real games of the regular season. It didn't matter that
he was speaking of unpleasantries like being booed and being
trashed by the media. Just the idea of playing games that count _
and the accompanying criticism _ seemed to excite him.
</P>
<P>
   The third baseman, who had two doubles Sunday in a 5-4 loss to
the Pirates, said he is ready for the prep work to stop. He wants
to play serious American League games. He wants the challenge of
blocking out all the reports that praise or slam his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players can read the paper and not be bothered by it; it
fuels them,'' he said. ``I heard that Michael Jordan used to read
the paper all the time.'' Valentin tries not to because, he said,
extreme reactions either way might affect him. ``Even when things
are going well and everybody says, `You're the bomb,' you can't
believe that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin spoke for a while. He even took the time to wonder what
would happen if players produced the season previews that appear in
just about every sports publication this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be a lot different,'' he said with a smile. He
eventually excused himself. I didn't even have to ask where he was
going. Wherever it was, I knew he would have to pass at least one
steakhouse, a strip mall, and an obligatory Publix.
</P>
<P>
   The extended spring is, and always has been, for pitchers. As
Pedro Martinez announced Sunday, ``Spring training is all right.
They've been doing it this way in baseball for the last 120
years.'' The theory is that pitchers need the time to strengthen
their arms. Ramon Martinez did that Sunday, throwing 73 pitches in
five innings. One of those 73 pitches was a fat, Grapefruit League
grapefruit that Bruce Aven sent deep over the left-field wall at
City of Palms Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are now 8-16. That's another frustrating thing about the
last week of spring training: No one gets excited or disappointed
by records. Ramon Martinez simply said his arm feels good, he
doesn't worry about his surgically repaired shoulder, he's throwing
in the high 80s, and on some days during the regular season, ``I
know I'll get my ass kicked.'' He also said he is resilient, so an
occasional bad start won't destroy his psyche.
</P>
<P>
   I believe Martinez. I think he'll be a fine No. 2 starter. But
here in the Late Spring Training Asylum, Opening Day can't come
soon enough.

KINGS BEAT THRASHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One team is going to the playoffs, the other is going
home. But for the Los Angeles Kings and Atlanta Thrashers, there
was more than the sight of old teammates that bonded them Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Both are learning the importance of hard work at a time in the
season when it might be easier to sit back and watch others skate
by.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings regrouped from Saturday's embarrassing tie in Boston
to defeat the expansion Thrashers 4-1 in front of 15,857 at Philips
Arena. It gave them five out of a possible six points on their
three-game East Coast trip and 86 for the season with six games to
play.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the victory also extended the Thrashers' home winless
streak to 16. They have just two victories in their last 32 games.
But this is a point in the year when players continue to sweat in
order to make the team next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is no fun for them,'' said Bob Corkum, who
assisted on Brad Chartrand's second-period goal that gave the Kings
the lead for good. ``I was on the Ducks in their first season
(1993-94) and it was tough. But Atlanta was the perfect team for us
because they are playing for their futures. After Saturday, we
needed to get shaken a little. Wedid that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The game already presented plenty of emotion when Kelly
Buchberger and injured Nelson Emerson, acquired from Atlanta at the
trade deadline, returned. Buchberger was the Thrashers' captain and
scored the first goal in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Buchberger, who addressed the Kings before the game, received a
thunderous ovation between the first and second periods when an
interview was shown on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   And Donald Audette, disgruntled almost all season before the
Kings sent him to the Thrashers, assisted on Atlanta's only goal.
</P>
<P>
   The best sign for the Kings was their return to form after
taking off the first two periods of Saturday's game in Boston.
After the seldom-used Chartrand gave them the lead, the Kings
finished off Atlanta with a goal by Glen Murray (four in four
games, No. 27 for the year) and an empty netter by Ian Laperriere.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important was the performance of goaltender Stephane
Fiset, who was pulled in Saturday's game. He will be the Kings
starter when the playoffs start in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray made a point Saturday that he wasn't
blaming Fiset for the team's meltdown in Boston. And Fiset said
Sunday he did not hold ill feelings toward teammates for laying
down on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never blamed them,'' said Fiset, who refused to speak after
Saturday's game. ``I was angry at myself. I was a little nervous at
first tonight. It's always a little strange when you come back
after getting pulled. I have confidence in my play and after a
couple of shots I was right in the game. I knew things were going
to go well after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille scored first for the Kings, just five minutes
into the second period. After going nine games without a goal, he
has three in his last three games and 36 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hnat Domenichelli tied it less than two minutes later after
Audette passed in front of Fiset. But the Kings were in no mood for
another letdown. For Chartrand, who broke his jaw in the minors in
January, it was his sixth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of jump from our third and fourth lines,'' Murray
said. ``I was very pleased with the way we played tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray couldn't say that after Saturday's game, when the Kings
came back after spotting Boston a three-goal lead. He yelled
between the second and third period of that game and even threw a
stick against the wall. Even though the Kings tied that game,
Murray refused to speak to them afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke one of my rules,'' he said. ``I always talk to the
team no matter what. But tonight I think we've learned you can't
take any games off.''

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A team from the Atlantic Coast Conference will
be traveling to Indianapolis for the Final Four this week. It's a
team from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the people on Tobacco Road wrote the script when
the NCAA tournament began two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But most people, other than a few loyalists residing in Chapel
Hill, figured the team would be Duke, No. 1 in the country and
top-seeded in the East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the script was changed dramatically by a North Carolina
team that simply refused to accept its casting as bit player.
</P>
<P>
   In a back-to-the-future performance at the Erwin Center, the Tar
Heels acted like, well, North Carolina with a vintage performance
that resulted in a 59-55 win over Tulsa in the South Regional
final, earning the program its 15th trip to the Final Four and
third in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   That North Carolina got there as an eighth seed _ with a 22-13
record some considered more befitting the NIT than the NCAAs _
matters not an iota to the Tar Heels, who will face East Regional
champion Florida in the RCA Dome on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   That North Carolina is two wins away from its third national
championship, while Duke is back in Durham following its loss to
Florida Friday night in an East semifinal, makes it even more
surreal and satisfying for the Heels and coach Bill Guthridge,
making his second Final Four appearance in his three years as head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long, strange trip,'' said sophomore forward
Kris Lang. ``We have been considered underdogs in every game, and
we have been proving people wrong during the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the latest case in point. Tulsa, despite its low
(seventh) seed, was as hot as any team in the country. The Golden
Hurricane entered the game with 32 wins in 36 games, the most
victories of any team in the tournament. And their four losses had
been by a combined 7 points, each coming in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Carolina took control from the start, setting the
pace largely because of the play of guard Joseph Forte, the first
freshman to lead Carolina in scoring.
</P>
<P>
   All the 6-foot-4-inch Forte did was score a game-high 28-points
in 39 minutes, displaying more poise than anyone else on the court.
He was named the Most Outstanding Player of the regional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go home,'' said Forte, who made 10 of 17
shots and pulled down eight rebounds. ``I shoot the most, so I
should make most of my shots and take us to Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come easy. Very little does when playing Tulsa.
Earlier in the tournament, the Hurricane had taken apart bigger
teams such as Cincinnati and Miami with first-half scoring binges
that hit with the ferocity of the storm for which the team is
named.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels didn't let that happen to them, however, as a half
in which there were 17 ties or lead changes ended with Carolina
leading, 31-30.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Hurricane used up a lot of energy in containing a
Carolina front line that included 7-foot, 264-pound Brendan
Haywood, 6-8, 224-pound sophomore Jason Capel, and 6-11, 243-pound
Lang. Outside of 6-10 Brandon Kurtz, Tulsa didn't have a man in its
rotation taller than 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't bother me that much,'' said Kurtz, who had 11
points and nine rebounds and more than held his own against Haywood
(8 points, 8 rebounds). ``We've been playing against bigger teams
all season. By no means were we intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither was Carolina, which had faced a tougher brand of
competition all season. After 15 minutes of serious jousting to
start the second half, the Tar Heels had a 51-41 lead, the biggest
advantage anyone had built on Tulsa all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tulsa is a good team,'' said Capel, the only player on the
floor who played all 40 minutes, scoring 8 points and pulling down
six rebounds. ``I knew they weren't going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Stunningly, it was Carolina that almost went into a tournament
death spiral, starting with senior point guard Ed Cota.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Carolina fans among the crowd of 16,731 were
starting their ``Final Four'' chants, Cota had the ball stripped
twice in the final 30 seconds by Tulsa freshman Dante Swanson.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, with 20.7 seconds left, Carolina's lead was down to 2,
at 57-55. And when Cota made only one of two foul shots with 18.0
seconds left, Tulsa had a golden opportunity, trailing by 3 with
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tired at the end,'' said Cota. ``One of the turnovers, I
lost on my own. The last one Swanson did a great job. I'm not going
to blame it on being tired. I could have let Joseph bring the ball
up, but I wanted to take control.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes took control out of his hands, but when Tulsa's
David Shelton was pressured into a poor shot with 5 seconds left,
the Tulsa ride had come to an end. Carolina's, meanwhile, was
continuing to a place not even the most diehard Tar Heels fan had
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to death,'' said Guthridge, who flew to Kansas
immediately after the game for the funeral of his 96-year-old
mother. He paid tribute to his players, saying, ``They really hung
in there all year through some difficult times and helped keep me
going. To be going to the Final Four is a real thrill for all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   So Carolina, with more losses than any Tar Heels team since
1990, has reached its sixth Final Four in the last nine seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Heels win two more? ``They're two good shooting nights
from winning it all,'' said Tulsa coach Bill Self. ``So they can
win it.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish to rule them out.

EMOTION KEEPS GATORS IN MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ All season long, he preached fearlessness to
his players, but when his precocious and talented basketball
players faced the biggest game of their lives against third seed
Oklahoma State in Sunday's NCAA East Regional final at the Carrier
Dome, Florida coach Billy Donovan was fearful his fifth-seeded
Gators would not be able to reprise the physical effort they
submitted in Friday night's momentous victory over top-seeded Duke
in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   So Donovan appealed to his team's sense of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Using a motivational tactic that he came up with Sunday morning
after talking by phone with Ray Pelletier, a friend of the program
who is a motivational speaker, Donovan huddled with his players and
asked each to single out a loved one, someone near and dear. He
asked each player to dedicate Sunday's game to them by having them
write the name of that person on a piece of tape and wrap it around
their ankles.
</P>
<P>
   When times got tough on the court, they were to refer to it for
a little inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Splendid sophomore forward Mike Miller scrawled ``My Family'' on
his piece of tape, as did freshman guard Justin Hamilton. Sophomore
guard Teddy Dupay wrote ``Mom and Dad.'' Major Parker dedicated his
game to ``Grandma'', while sophomore center Udonis Haslem honored
his deceased brother, Sam, who was the first person to put a
basketball in his hand and taught him not to be afraid of the older
and bigger guys on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you're playing or doing something for someone you
love, you have a tendency to try to dig down a little bit deeper,''
said Donovan, who knows of such things after doing the same in
Providence College's improbable run to the 1987 Final Four. ``And
with eight minutes left in the game _ a 3-point game _ they reached
down inside and found a way to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about the Big Dig. With 7:57 remaining and Florida clinging
to a 56-53 lead, the Gators dug deep and found the resolve to
withstand Oklahoma State's 20-6 run that whittled a 17-point lead
to 3. The Gators held on for a euphoric 77-65 victory that lifted
Florida to its second Final Four in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators, who got a team-high 14 points from Miller, voted the
regional's most outstanding player, will face No. 8 seed North
Carolina, a 59-55 winner over Tulsa in the South Regional, in a
Final Four gathering of the lowest seeds in tournament history at
the RCA Dome in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, we were right there, but physically we had a tough
time getting it done,'' said Donovan, who will become the sixth
person in NCAA history to play and coach in a Final Four. ``We gave
up three or four 3-point shots right in a row, just because we
could not get there physically. Now against Duke, they spaced us
out, but we got there. It's a tough thing, and I knew it going
through it as a player and I knew it going through it as a coach at
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care how deep you are. The emotional and physical part
of playing in a regional semifinal and regional final is an
emotionally and physically draining experience. It's a tough
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half Florida's talented players, coming off the
bench in wave upon wave, inundated Oklahoma State with a
suffocating press. The Cowboys, despite having seven seniors on
their roster, twice trailed by as many as 15 points (33-18 and
35-20) in the first half before pulling within 43-31 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on we looked like our team was in a daze,'' said
Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton, whose team (27-7) got 14 points
from Fredrik Jonzen, 13 from Glendon Alexander, and 12 from Joe
Adkins. ``We did a poor job on the boards (OSU was outrebounded,
35-28). I thought the press didn't bother us that much other than
it speeded us up. We told our team to attack the press.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's precisely what Oklahoma State did in the second half,
when the Gators stretched their halftime lead to 50-33. The Cowboys
went on that 20-6 run, hitting 7 of 11 field goals, and getting
timely treys from Desmond Mason (9 points), and Alexander, who hit
one with 7:57 remaining that pulled Oklahoma State within 56-53.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its first-round squeaker over Butler, that's as close as
Florida allowed the game to get. The Gators scored on their next
seven possessions to take control. Miller fueled a 14-4 run by
hitting a pair of free throws and a top-of-the-key trifecta, but it
was Donnell Harvey who punctatuated it with a pair of thunderous
slams, including a particularly vicious lefthanded tomahawk that
gave the Gators a 70-57 lead and sparked a Final Four celebration
from Syracuse to Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we understand what's going on,'' said Miller, when
asked about Florida's relatively subdued celebration. ``Coach does
a good job of motivating us before every game. Today was a classic
way of motivating us. He can prepare us for everything. We know
what's going on.''

JACKSON DIDN'T WANT KINGS TO GET TOO COMFORTABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Of all the statistics to emerge from the Los
Angeles Lakers' dramatic victory over the Sacramento Kings on
Sunday, the one that might matter most is 1-1. Especially as an
alternative to 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had lost two of their last three games at Arco Arena,
including their prior trip here in December. With the Kings
hovering between the bottom two seeds in the West, and the Lakers
at the top, they might be headed for a first-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers might want to win a game or two in these
unfriendly confines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to send them a message,'' coach Phil Jackson said.
``They have a feeling like they can beat us, and they have our
number, and things have gone well for them in fact in the past. But
we need to let them know we're going to beat them regardless of
whether they finish eighth (seeded) or whatever they're going to be
in the playoffs. And this is a good signal (to send) them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are still searching for answers to two matchups in
particular - at power forward, where Chris Webber (28 points) had
his way for most of the day, and at guard, where quick and
unpredictable Jason Williams (21 points) again hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were also playing with a hobbled Vlade Divac and
without injured swingman Peja Stojakovic, who also has had good
games against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well, but we played well enough to get a win
down the stretch,'' said Shaquille O'Neal. ``If we meet this team
in the playoffs, we just have to bring our `A' game every time. And
we will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers again left impressed, however, with both their
opponent and the intensity of the fans at an arena that has become
one of the most intimidating atmospheres in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough arena,'' Glen Rice said. ``Their crowd gets into
the game. It's a tough team also. They've got a lot of talent, they
work very well together....
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big win for us. It's going to help us as far as
confidence-wise, knowing that we can come in here and beat them on
their floor.... I don't think we've played up to our potential each
time we've played them, so if we can execute a lot better on both
ends of the floor, I think the outcome will be even a little easier
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Rookie swingman Devean George and assistant coach
Tex Winter, both suffering from the flu, did not make the trip.

JEFF GORDON, NEW TEAM CLOSING IN ON SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ Jeff Gordon and his revamped Rainbow Warriors
pit crew returned to familiar territory _ the top 10 of the NASCAR
Winston Cup points standings _ with their most impressive
performances of the season in the Food City 500 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's eighth-place finish at Bristol Motor Speedway matched
his season-best result recorded the previous Sunday at Darlington
(S.C.) Raceway. But Gordon, who began the day wallowing in 13th in
points, had the dominant car on the high-banked, 0.533-mile oval.
Gordon started third and led five times for a race-high 225 laps,
nearly half of the 500-lap distance, before a mishap in the pits
cost him what would have been his first victory of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon pitted as the leader under caution on Lap 386, when he
clipped a stray tire in the box of Steve Park while heading back to
the track. The shot bent the corner of the left front fender of
Gordon's car, prompting him to return three times during the
caution for repairs. That dropped Gordon to 17th on the restart and
doomed an otherwise strong performance for the struggling
three-time Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my fault,'' said Gordon, driver of the No. 24 DuPont
Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo. ``I was just trying to
get out of there and beat the 12 \RJeremy Mayfield\S or the 2
\RRusty Wallace\S, and I drove right into it. It wasn't very
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon lost five members of his pit crew to reigning Cup
champion Dale Jarrett's No. 88 Ford Taurus team at the end of last
season. Yesterday, Gordon said crew chief Robbie Loomis and crew
gave him an ``awesome'' race car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were clicking off awesome pit stops and keeping us
out front,'' said Gordon, who had not been in the top 10 in points
during the season's first five races. ``I'm not ashamed of having
to change pit crews at all right now. These guys are consistent and
confident.'' Benson impressive Johnny Benson overcame a 33rd-place
start and a backstretch pit box at BMS to notch a career-best
second-place finish. Benson delivered a terrific morale boost to
the team owned by Texan Tim Beverley heading into the DirecTV 500
at Texas Motor Speedway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said his steady drive to the front _ he moved into second
on Lap 490 of the 500 _ was the result of solid strategy by crew
chief James Ince and a series of super stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took four tires every stop,'' said Benson, driver of the
No. 10 Lycos.com Pontiac Grand Prix. ``We weren't going to try to
gamble on two \Rto gain track position\S _ not where we were at.
And we were just able to stay out of trouble.'' Earnhardt
sideswiped Seven-time Cup champion Dale Earnhardt spent 206 laps
working his way into the lead yesterday before his designs on a
second victory of 2000 came to a grinding halt after an incident
involving Kenny Irwin Jr. in Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin crashed between turns 3 and 4 on Lap 206 and slid down the
36-degree banking. Earnhardt, who had spent the previous eight laps
setting up Jeff Gordon for a pass into the lead, tried to dodge
Irwin's car by running down on the apron. But Irwin's disabled
machine clipped Earnhardt's car in the right rear wheel and
quarter-panel, throwing the rear end housing out of alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt returned after lengthy repairs on Lap 362, en route to
a season-worst 39th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he \RIrwin\s had just held the brakes on, I would have been
all right,'' said Earnhardt, driver of the No. 3 GM Goodwrench
Service Plus Chevy. ``I'd done committed myself to the low side,
and that's all I could do. I went down there and got whacked.''
Kenseth on a roll Matt Kenseth will race at Texas Motor Speedway
next weekend as a double-leader.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth sits atop the NASCAR Busch Grand National points chase
heading into the Albertson's 300 in Fort Worth on Saturday. And
Kenseth retained his lead in the Winston Cup Raybestos Rookie of
the Year competition with his 12th-place finish in the Food City
500.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal goal is to try to finish in the top 15 every
week,'' said Kenseth, who leads Dale Earnhardt Jr. by eight points
(64-56) going into the Winston Cup DirecTV 500 on Sunday.

STARS LOSE A CLOSE ONE TO AVALANCHE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Put your thumb next to your index finger. A little
closer.
</P>
<P>
   As close as you can get without letting them touch.
</P>
<P>
   That tiny space, where light barely sneaks through, is the fine
line separating winning and losing for the Stars on most nights.
Now, squeeze them closer, and realize exactly just how fine that
line got yesterday against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand it's a fine line right now,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``Hell, we played a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas played a better-than-good game up until just that moment
when Avalanche winger Milan Hejduk scored with 1:43 remaining in
overtime. In that second, the Stars' good game turned into a 2-1
loss to the Avalanche at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a fine line for us,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher
said. ``When you are banged up and don't have a healthy team, that
fine line usually does get thinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Try Ally McBeal thin.
</P>
<P>
   So thin that a disallowed goal, a not-quite-yet-jelled second
line and an impotent power play derailed a performance that both
Stars players and coaches characterized as solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played the game we wanted to play,'' Stars forward Mike
Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   They did. Right down to Modano's one-time blast of a Jamie
Langenbrunner pass at 6:02 of the first period for a 1-0 lead. It
was the margin of error until 10:28 of the second period, when
Stars winger Brett Hull looked to have scored his 609th career
goal. Only, the goal didn't count.
</P>
<P>
   The whistle already had blown. The referees nabbed Stars winger
Kirk Muller for goaltender interference. The Avalanche had a power
play coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have been the right call,'' Muller admitted. ``I went
for an opening. Patrick \RRoy\S turned to kind of make the play and
kind of bumped into me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Muller in the penalty box, the Avalanche once again tried
its] fourth-ranked power play against the best penalty kill in the
league. Thirty-four seconds later, No. 4 beat No. 1, Avs center Joe
Sakic corralling a rebound and lifting it over a sprawled-out Stars
goalie Ed Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour had been spectacular until then, with him and Roy
engaging each other in a game of goaltender chicken. One would make
a big save. The other would answer with a bigger save. Belfour
finished with 22. Roy finished with 29. Not including, of course,
the one that didn't count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it was big,'' Roy said of the disallowed goal. ``I think
I would be in time for the play if Kirk didn't hit me. ... That's
the dangerous thing if you pass in the crease you can interfere
with goaltenders. The crew made the right call.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a 2-0 lead, the Stars would find themselves once
again tied with the Avalanche. Which is nothing new when these
teams play. In the past five meetings between the Stars and
Avalanche, the games have either been tied or one goal apart for
all but eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, that explains Hejduk's NFL-like celebration of his
game-winner. He skated to center ice, did a belly flop and then
took a couple of fake strokes. It was almost as good as the move he
put on Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out of my mind happy,'' Hejduk said.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say Belfour wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He outwaited me a little bit and made a nice shot,'' Belfour
said. ``I would like to have it over.''
</P>
<P>
   He may just get his chance, too.
</P>
<P>
   They play again in a week. And the way things are looking, the
Stars and Avalanche will meet again in the second round of the
playoffs. If the Edmonton Oilers, who are only four points back for
the Northwest Division lead, were to overtake the Avalanche, the
meeting would get bumped up to the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly the matchup Colorado wants, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Avalanche coach Bob Hartley said.
``Especially the way the season has gone, you can't pick and
choose. Whoever is in front of you, you have to raise your arms and
fight. Every team is good and every team has its weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   And the difference between winning and losing is often as small
as the space between your fingers. nn

SHAQ'S HEROICS SPARK LAKERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Some day, perhaps, this kind of thing won't be a
surprise anymore. Eventually, every second of the footage will seem
familiar, expected, routine. Possibly, it's already moving into
that realm.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, game-tying shot. Shaq, game-winning free
throw. Shaq, game-saving blocked shot.
</P>
<P>
   Bing. Bang. Boom.
</P>
<P>
   For the Los Angeles Lakers, a comeback victory is as now as easy
as spelling ``M-V-P.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers on the edge of a loss Sunday, in the most
hostile of arenas, against a potential playoff opponent, O'Neal
made a stand - and took one giant leap toward unquestioned
superstardom.
</P>
<P>
   His three-point play with 6.5 seconds left, followed by a swat
of Vlade Divac's potential game-winning shot with time expiring,
lifted the Lakers to an awe-inspiring 90-89 comeback victory in
front of 17,317 stunned faces at Arco Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Layups are nothing new to O'Neal, and blocked shots are a
standard. But for the career 53 percent foul-shooter, a
game-winning free throw meant everything for a
championship-aspiring team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's big-time,'' teammate Glen Rice said. ``The big fella's
always said, in the crunch time, when it's time to step up and hit
the free throws, he's going to come through. And he's been doing
that. He's been improving on his free-throw shooting. We have all
the confidence in the world with him at the free-throw line.... And
he has a lot more confidence in himself going to the free-throw
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreso since the All-Star break, with O'Neal having settled into
a 60 percent-plus clip. But he was just 3 for 7 on Sunday, when the
Kings foolishly abandoned defending O'Neal in favor of chasing down
Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   With 17.4 seconds remaining, the Kings were clinging to an 89-87
edge after Darrick Martin hit 1 of 2 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Bryant dribbled around the top of the key,
drawing a wave of Kings defenders, including Divac. Bryant stopped,
popped up and zinged a two-hand overhead pass to O'Neal under the
basket, guarded only by 6-foot-1 Jason Williams, who wrapped O'Neal
too late.
</P>
<P>
   The layup dropped through, and O'Neal followed with a free-throw
swish to complete a 34-point night and send the Lakers (59-12) to
their sixth consecutive win and 25th in 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably their plan to hack-a-Shaq. Kobe made an
excellent pass and I got it,'' O'Neal said. ``Me being the type of
player I am, I quicked it to the basket. I knew I was going to make
the free throw all along.''
</P>
<P>
   He trotted back to a bench of proud teammates and a greeting
line of high fives and hugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's happy for him,'' Robert Horry said. ``When he
first came in the league, everybody was wondering if he was going
be a dominant player. He's showing now he's going to be a dominant
force.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings were stunned by O'Neal's clutch three-point play,
the Lakers were surprised only by the ease with which it unfolded,
with Divac leaving O'Neal alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, absolutely (surprised),'' Bryant said. ``I was like,
damn, there's Shaq all the way under the basket!''
</P>
<P>
   As for making big free throws, it's starting to become an
expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our confidence in him has grown as his confidence in
himself has grown as well,'' said Bryant, who finished with 24
points and 14 rebounds. ``When he was on the free-throw line, I
didn't even go for the rebound. I felt pretty comfortable he was
going to make the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Lakers were even in position to win was amazing. They
shot just 38.2 percent and had trailed from the opening tip, abused
for most of the game by Chris Webber's 28 points, 15 rebounds,
eight assists and four blocks, and a 21-point game from Jason
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers held Webber to just six points in the second
half, and he fouled out on a questionable offensive foul with 1:51
to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we didn't earn respect yet,'' said Divac, held to six
points.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson was unhappy with everything but the
final outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either team played or shot as well as they'd
have liked to in the course of a game like that, but the end result
is dramatic,'' he said. ``(O'Neal's play) is a big
confidence-builder. It's big for us to have him in there at the end
and be a go-to guy that can complete the play.''

RAIN HALTS SUTTON'S MOMENTUM AT TPC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Hal Sutton, not Tiger Woods, had his
right fist pumping and final-round momentum on his side yesterday
at The Players Championship.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sutton, not Woods, who played 11 bogey-free holes at the
TPC at Sawgrass. It was Sutton, not Woods, who carved out a
three-stroke advantage before the rains came and suspended play
until 8 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sutton, who has preached a fear-no-Tiger gospel to PGA
Tour peers since arriving at the event, who appeared ready to land
a knockout blow to the game's top-ranked player when the horn
sounded with Woods facing a 40-foot birdie putt on the 12th green
and Sutton preparing to chip from the 12th fairway in the day's
final pairing.
</P>
<P>
   How well Sutton's momentum carries over after a fourth
consecutive night to sleep on the lead at the season's richest
event ($6 million) remains to be seen. Sutton left the course
disappointed but exuding confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I would have liked to have kept playing. Everything
was going well,'' said Sutton, who drained a 25-foot birdie putt at
the 11th hole to break a string of 10 consecutive pars. ``It was
going the way I wanted it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, in turn, sounded like a man who welcomed the opportunity
to regroup. After taking a birdie on the first hole to square
matters with Sutton, he logged consecutive bogeys after missed
greens at Nos. 3 and 4. When Sutton dropped his 25-foot birdie putt
at No. 11 to improve to 10 under par for the tournament, Woods
followed by pulling a five-footer off line to remain at 7 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things aren't going exactly the way I wanted, but I've still
got a good chance of winning,'' Woods said. ``It's much easier to
come from three behind on this golf course. There is a lot of water
and a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods knows a little something about final-round comebacks,
especially at tournaments that have been extended to Monday because
of weather concerns. He rallied from seven strokes back over the
final seven holes Feb. 7 to win the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Woods reeled in Matt Gogel, a tour rookie. This time,
he's chasing Sutton, a teammate on the 1999 U.S. Ryder Cup team.
Among the 20 players stranded one the course when play was
suspended, none were within six strokes of Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, at 4-under, finished as the leader in the clubhouse.
Essentially, said Sutton, he has seven more holes of one-on-one
combat with Woods. He looks forward to the ongoing challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here looking for an easy win,'' Sutton said. ``I
am not going to look for a way to say poor, pitiful me because of
all this. We still have work to do, and I feel good about the way
I'm swinging at it and the way I'm putting.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Woods, Sutton is well-versed on Monday finishes. Especially
at this course. His victory at the 1983 TPC came after a rain
delay, when competitors played the final round Monday. Until today,
it stood as the only Monday finish in tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in the locker room thinking about that, right
after \Rplay was called\S,'' Sutton said. ``We finished that year
on Monday, and I won. I don't know if that has anything to do with
anything. But it was nice to think about.'' Red in reserve Tiger
Woods, who wears a red shirt during the final round at tournaments
where he competes, said his wardrobe rotation will not be thrown
off by yesterday's suspension of play. He packed an extra one, just
in case. Now, said Woods, he's got a choice.
</P>
<P>
   He can wear his backup red shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or a lot of cologne,'' Woods said, glancing at the
sweat-stained crimson shirt he wore yesterday. Super save Hal
Sutton said his sand save at the eighth hole, when he was forced to
stand on a hill outside the bunker while hitting his approach to 12
feet, ranks ``at the top of the list'' in terms of bunker blasts he
has authored on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have dreamed it any closer than that,'' said
Sutton, who made the 12-footer for par. ``As I'm taking my stance,
I'm thinking, `This could be a real turnaround, one way or the
other.' And I just flushed it. That was real big.'' Briefly Fort
Worth resident Mark Brooks gave back nine strokes to par on the
back nine, including a watery quadruple-bogey at No. 18, to close
with a 79. Brooks' back-nine fade caused him to drop 32 places on
the leader board, into a tie for 57th, pending completion of play
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Tryba and Joe Ozaki recorded aces at No. 8, a 226-yard
par-3, during yesterday's final round. Tryba used a 4-iron, and
Ozaki used a 3-iron.

 &HT;    Oscar moments: Lots of laughs, emotion
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some of the Oscar moments we'll be talking about
today:
</P>
<P>
   Billy Crystal, predictably sly in scenes that inserted him into
``The Exorcist,'' ``The Godfather,'' ``Psycho,'' ``Casablanca'' and
other films. Jane Fonda, looking superb with her perky short hair.
Supporting actor winner Michael Caine, speaking generously of his
fellow nominees. And Antonio Banderas good-naturedly dragging
director Pedro Almodovar offstage at the end of his rambling
Spanglish acceptance speech. (``He makes (Roberto) Benigni look
like an English teacher,'' quipped Crystal.)
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest moment of the 72nd annual Academy Awards was
also the most fun: Robin Williams singing ``Blame Canada'' from the
``South Park'' movie, accompanied by a comic chorus line and
Mountie-Rockettes. It was a blast of garish fun and a breath of air
in a ceremony that has become tasteful to the point of
petrifaction.
</P>
<P>
   As if determined to maintain the show's punishing length, new
producers Lili and Richard Zanuck padded it with several
self-congratulatory montages of old movie clips, plus a medley of
Oscar-winning tunes. At times it felt like a long commercial, as if
the Zanucks felt it necessary to convince the worldwide viewers
that movies are Fun and Good and Good for You.
</P>
<P>
   Though they were a laughable low point in previous years, the
tacky, overblown interpretive dance numbers were sorely missed.
</P>
<P>
   So don't blame ``Canada.'' Thank heaven for it. It kept us
entertained, at least for a few minutes of the show. Long enough
for Jack Nicholson to come out and introduce his old colleague in
revolutionary filmmaking, Warren Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's acceptance of the Irving G. Thalberg Award was the
evening's other major moment. Part of his rep has been that of the
libido that conquered half of Hollywood. But his real legacy is a
career of pushing the envelope as a multihatted filmmaker. As a
pretty-faced actor in the '60s, he challenged the fossilized studio
way of how things worked. He not only starred in ``Bonnie and
Clyde,'' he developed the script, produced it, pushed Warner Bros.
to release it the right way and walked off with a big chunk of its
profit.
</P>
<P>
   That 1967 film was among a handful that signaled the passing of
the old guard into edgier work reflecting the unease of the Vietnam
War and the emergence of younger filmmakers whose work would flower
in the '70s (Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven
Spielberg). Now, he's considered establishment. But as his edgy,
underseen ``Bulworth'' proved: He may be in his 60s, but he's still
a maverick.

TIE LEAVES BRUINS' STOMACHS IN KNOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins booted away a three-goal lead Saturday,
allowing the Los Angeles Kings to climb back into a game they
appeared long out of. In the end, it wound up a 4-4 tie _ the
league-high 18th time this season Boston has ended a contest in a
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   The third period, in which the Bruins surrendered three goals,
was a microcosm of this season. Blown leads, fragile confidence,
shaky execution, and inconsistent goaltending.
</P>
<P>
   Seven games remain in this
unforgettable-for-all-the-wrong-reasons year. If it were a horse,
someone would've shot it a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a three-goal lead, they should be dead in the water,''
said forward Steve Heinze, whose two-goal, one-assist performance
in his first game back from an injury was tarnished by the
collapse. ``We should go out there confident and have a flow and
play well. We didn't do that. They get that goal early and maybe, I
hope not, but it's `Woe is me, here we go again.' Instead of
playing the game, you just start thinking too much. A three-goal
lead in the third period. Shame on us. We shouldn't lose that lead
against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Too true. But this 1999-2000 edition of the Bruins can't get out
of their own way. Blown leads are commonplace. One only needs go
back to March 16, when the Bruins blew two-goal leads three times
on the way to a 5-4 overtime loss to the Blackhawks in Chicago.
Saturday's meltdown was another pretty sour finish to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no excuse for it,'' said center Brian Rolston.
``Through two periods, we played very, very strong. In the first
period, we outshot them, 17-4. The second period we came out and
played very strong. We were up by three goals and it's unacceptable
to let a team back in the game like that. We stopped forechecking
in the third period, we didn't have as many chances. We seemed as
if we were back on our heels. I think LA came out strong in the
third, but regardless of that, we needed to do a better job, to say
the least.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no game plan to change strategies at the end of two
periods. Why, with a three-goal lead, would you want to? And yet,
the Bruins began backing up and backing up some more, allowing the
Kings to swarm them in the attacking zone.
</P>
<P>
   Rolston said he could sense trouble when the Kings came out
firing in the third, pulling to within 4-2 at the 48-second mark on
a goal by former Bruin Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the Murray coach Pat Burns had in mind when he
addressed the media after the game, saying this was like the Bill
Murray movie ``Groundhog Day,'' in which Murray's character lives
the same day over and over again. In Burns's case, the Bruins were
blowing leads over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got the power-play goal at the beginning of the
period, everybody starts looking at each other,'' said Rolston. ``I
don't think there's a whole lot of confidence. The first two
periods we were playing with plenty of confidence. Then in the
third, it was like a hand grenade out there, including myself. It's
a matter of being confident in the team and going out there and
doing the job. In the third period, we just weren't really there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rolston, who also played for the Devils and the Colorado
Avalanche this season before coming to Boston, said the Bruins
don't corner the market on going into a defensive shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on teams where it's happened before,'' he said.
``It's not anything (unique to Boston). When I was in New Jersey,
we used to do the same thing; you get up by a couple of goals and
then you go into the conservative mold and try to hang on. We
didn't hang on enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to get out of that is to go out in the third and
have a strong effort. If you play 60 minutes strong, those things
aren't going to happen. I think that's one of the most important
things.''

DISPIRITED CELTICS BUCKED OFF TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ This was not the time or place to deliver what Rick
Pitino charitably called ``a clunker.'' But that's what the Celtics
did Sunday in a performance more reminiscent of their
earlier-season road debacles.
</P>
<P>
   Boston dropped a 99-84 decision to the Bucks and now is on the
playoff ledge, three games behind Milwaukee and 4 1/2 behind
Orlando, a team it faces Tuesday night in Hooterville. The Celtics
have lost four in a row. They have 12 games to play.
</P>
<P>
   They all understood the importance of this one. They all knew
they had, basically, no margin for error. So instead of coming out
spirited, determined, and defiant, they instead went the full 48
under water.
</P>
<P>
   They never led. They never were even tied. They never were
closer than 8 points in the final 28 minutes. They allowed the
Bucks free access to the basket as Milwaukee shot 51 percent. They
didn't move the ball (16 assists) or shoot it well (41 percent).
</P>
<P>
   They were, dare we say it, never really in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we were into it emotionally or physically,''
said Paul Pierce, who, like everyone else, struggled. He was 4 for
16 from the field. ``That's something I can't understand. The
playoffs are on the line. I was surprised by the way we came out.
It didn't seem like we wanted to be in the game or compete for a
playoff spot from the first jump ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sad, but true. This one looked a lot more like the games the
Celtics played on the road when they were free falling in November
and December. But this is March, the Celtics are playing better,
and they are talking about the playoffs, even though they're closer
to the 12th spot than they are to the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Some MIT professor might be able to create a scenario that has
Boston sneaking in on the last day. Pitino believes his team can
lose once more the rest of the way, which would mean an 11-1
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of that are not very good for us,'' the coach
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino thought Sunday's stinker was as much because of circuit
overload than anything else. The team had lost a devastating,
double-overtime game in Philadelphia Friday night. Two nights
earlier, there had been the crushing last-second home loss to
Minnesota. Two nights earlier than that, another loss, this one in
Phoenix to the Suns. It adds up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the result of four or five back-to-back
wars,'' Pitino said. ``Unfortunately, you can't let it happen
because every game is monumental. You can't use those five wars as
an excuse because there's too much at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Where to start in this one? The Bucks made a defensive switch,
putting Ervin Johnson on Antoine Walker. You may recall Walker
abused the undersized Darvin Ham the last time these teams met
(Johnson did not play because of back spasms). Walker was limited
to 22 inconsequential points, including a trey in the closing
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Milwaukee got its transition game going, feeding off
turnovers (19, leading to 22 points) and long rebounds from missed
shots (Boston was 4 for 23 from international waters. The Celtics
don't do transition defense and they paid for it, big time. The
Bucks had a 16-2 edge in fast-break points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them too many easy baskets,'' said Walker. ``You can't
do that against them because they are a great offensive team and
have a lot of weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   They do, indeed. Ray Allen led the way with 27. Sam Cassell
added 22, including three straight post-ups in the fourth quarter
over Kenny Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to play him aggressive, but I didn't do a good job,''
said Anderson, who had only two assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassell hoops were huge because the Celtics had pulled
within 78-70 with 9:01 to play. They had a chance to get closer,
but Cassell swiped an Adrian Griffin pass and fed the streaking
Allen (12 for 20) for an easy basket. That was the first of four
Boston turnovers in a stretch of 2:23. By the time the smoke
cleared, Cassell, who also had 11 assists, was hitting his third
straight jumper over Anderson, blowing the lead out to 14, and
ending whatever hopes the Celtics thought they might have had.

 &HT;    An original `Beauty,' hopeful sign for films
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel-Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Everything came up roses Sunday night for ``American
Beauty,'' a satirical and sometimes surreal portrait of suburban
malaise that ends on a curious note of optimism.
</P>
<P>
   What sets this deserving best-picture winner apart is that
there's never been anything quite like it. True,
America-the-Not-So-Beautiful has been a recurring theme in
Hollywood for decades. It probably reached its peak in the
anti-establishment early '70s. However, even then, gifted
filmmakers ranging from Martin Scorsese to Robert Altman only knew
how to say what was wrong with the American Dream. There's nothing
in their work _ wonderful as it is _ that suggests the transcendent
hopefulness of ``Beauty's'' dominant image.
</P>
<P>
   Not the velvety rose petals Kevin Spacey's character summons up
from his long-dormant libido, but the video of that white plastic
bag dancing in the wind. It's an ineffable image of mystery and
joy.
</P>
<P>
   Director Sam Mendes isn't better than a Scorsese or an Altman.
He simply sees things in his own way, and he's able to make us see
them that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' is unique. It's an original. That it
should've been the favorite as well as the eventual winner Sunday
is good news for any of us looking for signs of intelligent,
creative life in the Hollywood universe.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is exactly what its title says: American and a beauty.

RAMON MARTINEZ HAS SOUND STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ There will be days, Ramon Martinez said, when
he will fall far short of what paying customers demand. And he
knows what that means in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get booed back in Boston,'' he said after giving
up four runs in five innings in a 5-4 loss to the Pittsburgh
Pirates before another sellout (6,348) at City of Palms Park.
``They booed my brother Pedro when he had some rough times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a little bit about how Boston fans are. If you don't
do too good, they'll boo you. I expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro the Younger, dressing in the next cubicle, muttered an
aside. ``That's why they call it Boos-Town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Pedro the Younger was struggling, he said
that as much as he'd like to be reunited with Ramon, he wouldn't
want that to happen if it meant hearing his brother booed like he
was.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon the Elder doesn't sound too worried. In 1995, he was stung
when he heard his first boos during his long reign as a Dodger, and
responded by throwing a no-hitter against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very important year,'' he said. ``You
guys don't know the way I pitch. Maybe you've seen me on TV, and
Joe Kerrigan saw me in Montreal, but I know myself. I know
sometimes I get my butt kicked. The next time I come back again.
I'm very competitive that way. I never give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be games when I walk four guys, five guys. Who
knows, it's happened before. You may see some great games, too. You
can expect anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who gave up seven runs on eight hits and a walk
against the Twins Monday, breezed through the first three innings
Sunday, allowing just an infield hit by Warren Morris in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Aven hit a slicing double to left-center to open the
fourth and scored on John Vander Wal's double to right-center.
Wilfredo Cordero scored Vander Wal with a line single that Martinez
just missed (``I closed my glove too soon.'').
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Mike Benjamin, the ex-Sox infielder with the Elvis
sideburns, beat out an infield hit and scored on a home run by
Aven, who jumped on a hanging changeup from Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Martinez threw 73 pitches. He averaged 86-88 miles an
hour on his fastball, touching 90 a couple of times. He
occasionally overthrew his rising fastball, but otherwise
pronounced himself satisfied with his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not quite there yet,'' he said, ``but it's a matter of
time.''

UCONN IS THE HUNTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND _ Sue Gunter, the Louisiana State University women's
basketball coach, doesn't have the intensity of Tennessee coach Pat
Summitt, the glamour of former Purdue coach Carolyn Peck (she's
with the WNBA now), or the name recognition of Connecticut coach
Geno Auriemma.
</P>
<P>
   But Gunter has one thing over all of them _ longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Gunter, 58, has been a college coach for 36 years, the past 18
at LSU. She's the fourth-winningest coach in the NCAA with 613, is
a two-time Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year, and guided
the Olympic teams in 1978 and 1980. She played guard at Nashville
Business College and was a member of the national team from
1960-62.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I've had a love affair with this game for that many
years,'' Gunter said. ``My office is a gymnasium.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gunter is the first to acknowledge that all of her
experience on the court won't make a difference when her team faces
UConn in the NCAA East Regional final Monday night. Her team (25-6)
is young (only one senior) and short (its two tallest starters are
5 feet 11 inches), and never has made it beyond the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   So how does she plan on neutralizing the Huskies (33-1), who
have made it to Final Four three times, and were national champions
in 1995?
</P>
<P>
   You just try, she said, noting that only one team _ Tennessee _
has been successful this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to dictate the tempo of a game, but I don't
know how you do that with UConn,'' Gunter said. ``You want to be
aggressive enough to try to get them to be in a little bit of foul
trouble. But their depth is so good, that's almost of no
consequence to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the size, the speed . . . '' she said, as her voice
trailed off. ``The thing is, I don't have an answer to that
question. And you know what? I don't feel bad about it at all,
because there are a whole lot of other coaches who haven't had the
answer, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunter said her team knows what's in store. ``The players know
what they're faced with,'' she said. ``UConn is on a mission.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly the way Auriemma sees it. ``It's like the Holy
Grail, what everybody wants, what everything leads up to,'' he
said. ``Just the stakes that are involved _ at the beginning of the
season everyone talks about the Final Four. It's kind of like
climbing Mt. Everest. You climb and climb, but the last couple
hundred yards are unbelievably hard, probably the hardest that you
have. And that's probably the way it should be. The closer you get
to something you really want, the harder you have to fight to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For Auriemma, the game has even more significance when he thinks
back to a year ago. After the team won the first two NCAA tourney
games on its home court, the Huskies got knocked out of the East
Regional by Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Auriemma said, the team that played without point guard
Sue Bird all last year is healthy and prepared. ``I feel pretty
good, because we're even better than we were in December. We've
made giant strides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If LSU presents any problem, Auriemma said, it's in that the
Huskies and Lady Tigers never have played. ``I know LSU's not going
to be an easy team in a lot of ways, because we don't know that
much about them, so they're hard to get a handle on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he should be worried. The Huskies, who had all 12
players enter Saturday's 102-80 win over Oklahoma, are averaging
100.3 points in their first three NCAA games.
</P>
<P>
   LSU, ranked 15th nationally, defeated Duke, 79-66, in the
semifinal game Saturday behind Marie Ferdinand's 22 points. The
Tigers led the SEC in field-goal percentage (49.2) and assists
(20.2), and had the fewest turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   But Gunter said she's pragmatic. ``Sure, we're going to try to
come up with something, but I'm not about to broadcast that we're
going to have an upset,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to UConn, Gunter said, there's no reason to mince
words. ``I'm too old for hype; they are damn good,'' she said.

STARS FIND THAT SECOND LINE STILL A TOUGH ONE TO FILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The season has been like a Rubik's Cube in progress.
</P>
<P>
   One day, the Stars hope, the pieces will fall magically into
place, their planets will become mystifyingly realigned, and they
will be the team that they are supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, however, there are days like Sunday. ...
</P>
<P>
   Once Mike Modano staked the home team to a 1-0 lead over the
Colorado Avalanche, the Stars could not find another piece of the
puzzle to fall into place. The 2-1 defeat was punctuated further by
a golden two-on-one chance in overtime that Joe Nieuwendyk and
Brett Hull could not cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great pass,'' Nieuwendyk said afterward in a locker
room that seemed roundly annoyed to have let the day slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm sharp and focused, that's a goal.''
</P>
<P>
   On a steal at center ice, Hull had found himself leading the
two-on-one with Nieuwendyk slicing down the left side and only
defenseman Jon Klemm to beat. Hull made the right decision, but the
puck somehow found the air under Nieuwendyk's stick.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, there was Colorado's Milan Hejduk working his
stick, sending the Stars' Darryl Sydor sprawling, and scoring the
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Reunion Arena crowd let out an audible arrrgh.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, it was a decent day, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
tried to say. He cited his team's ``effort'' and ``good strong
play,'' and chose not to dwell on any festering issues.
</P>
<P>
   Issues such as his second scoring line, for instance. For
various reasons, it continues to underachieve.
</P>
<P>
   But at playoff time, you can't leave home without it. (See
``Stars, 1998 playoffs, post-Bryan Marchment''.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You need depth,'' Modano said Sunday. ``You need scoring not
only from your second line, but your third line, too. Depth at this
point in the year is crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the night Hull became the 12th player in NHL history to
score 600 goals, he has scored seven times _ seven goals in three
months. Nieuwendyk, meanwhile, missed 34 games due to injury and
has exactly three goals since the week before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock won't stop working the Rubik's Cube. Sunday, he spun
the blocks again and sent out a second line of Hull, Kirk Muller
and Aaron Gavey. Nieuwendyk was relegated to the fourth line,
alongside Jon Sim and Grant Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   But by the second period, the cube had been shifted again.
Nieuwendyk was back skating alongside Hull on the second line.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Nieuwendyk was hampered by the flu Sunday. His
season, on the whole, has been a medicine cabinet of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's starting to slowly get it back,'' Modano observed. ``I
think everything is going to be coming together at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's the plan, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be good if we would get it established so we could have
more punch in that area,'' Hitchcock said, politely.
</P>
<P>
   To the coach, however, lines seem made to be tinkered with, to
be juggled, to be mixed and remixed like an ongoing chemistry
project. Most players hate that.
</P>
<P>
   But Nieuwendyk defused the line-juggling question Sunday almost
before it left the interviewer's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good, to be honest,'' he said. ``I just need
some more time. But I feel good out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The deeper the scoring punch, the more match-up problems that
the Stars will cause in the playoffs. Hitchcock is getting more
than ample scoring chances from the line of Modano, Jamie
Langenbrunner and Brenden Morrow. The three have 68 goals between
them.
</P>
<P>
   But somebody else is going to have to step up in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if we see these guys again,'' Hitchcock mused, ``the
difference is going to be how much our second-wave attack improves
and gives us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, of course, could be host to the Avalanche again as
early as the first round of the playoffs. A more likely scenario
would have the teams meeting in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fine line,'' Hitchcock said. ``For 60 minutes, it
was a 1-1 hockey game. That's just how close the competition is
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   As close as an inch, the Reunion crowd was reminded Sunday. The
Stars came that close Sunday to being the overtime winners and
being asked about the bold message they had just sent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Joe Nieuwendyk and Brett Hull are still trying to find
each other, not to mention the net.
</P>
<P>
   They have two weeks to solve the puzzle.

Ruben Mateo turns cookie monster at plate with diet rich in chips 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Outfielder Ruben Mateo has stumbled on a
revolutionary new dietary supplement, more powerful than the
androstenedione Mark McGwire was taking during his record-breaking
home- run season.
</P>
<P>
   The chocolate chip cookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' Mateo said yesterday, standing in a clubhouse
that soon could be swept by a cookie craze. ``I started eating a
couple of cookies, and that's when I started to hit. Now I eat two
every day. I'm going to keep doing it during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Mateo smiled and held up two fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, two cookies,'' Mateo said. ``I'm going to break the
hitting record. I'm going to hit in 162 straight games.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo ate two more yesterday, then went 1-for-3 with his fifth
home run in the Rangers' 7-6 victory over the Philadelphia
Phillies. The Cookie Monster has now hit safely in seven
consecutive games since going on the cookie craze and is batting
.393 for the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they need to give me a truckload of those things,'' said
second baseman Luis Alicea, who is hitting .214.
</P>
<P>
   The only controversy surrounding the chocolate-chip-hitting
binge is who turned Mateo on to it. Both shortstop Royce Clayton
and manager Johnny Oates claim credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in one day, saw Ruben eating a salad,'' Oates said.
``I said, `Ruben, you ever have a pulled muscle?' He said, yeah. I
said, `You ever have a pulled fat.' He said no. I told him, `You
better starting eating chocolate chip cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clayton insists that's not the way it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up in Dunedin \RFla.\S,'' Clayton said. ``He's walking
around with no body fat. I said, `Ruben, you brush up against a
fence, you're going to be out a month. You need to start eating
some cookies.'''
</P>
<P>
   Retorted Oates, ``I was onto this five years ago. I said it to
the replacement players. They actually believed me. I told them,
did eating salad get you to the big leagues?''
</P>
<P>
   Clayton's testimony is made suspect by the fact that he's
hitting just .319, clear proof he's not hitting the chocolate chip
cookies hard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mixing them in,'' Clayton insisted. ``I'm waiting for the
season to start. It's a veteran move. You can't eat them all down
here, you have to save some for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mateo tried to push some off on first baseman Rafael Palmeiro
but so far has failed to get anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need chocolate chip cookies,'' Palmeiro insisted. ``I
drink chocolate protein shakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yummy.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Gabe Kapler, sitting next to Palmeiro in the
clubhouse and eating a green apple, was more receptive. Kapler is a
fitness guru with jars of the latest nutritional drinks sitting
above his locker.
</P>
<P>
   But when he heard about Mateo's secret, Kapler said, ``Bring 'em
on, I'll eat them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you talking about, you're hitting .900,'' Palmeiro
said, pointing to Kapler's jar of Triple Whey Shake. ``I need to
get me more of that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Palmeiro doesn't realize chocolate chip cookies may be
just what the Rangers need to turn the tables on the New York
Yankees in October. Serious investigative reporting has revealed
the Yankees feast on chocolate chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm that,'' ex-Yankees player Chad Curtis reported.
``All cookies are big over there. Those guys are always gorging on
cookies. Scott Brosius is the king of all cookie eaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what. For all the serious advances in medical
technology, the Yankees are a throwback to teams of 20 years ago.
They gorge themselves on anything they want to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They do?'' Palmeiro said when hearing this tidbit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well then, bring on the chocolate chip cookies.''

THIRD PERIOD IS CHARM FOR BLACK BEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Deja vu?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   When the University of Maine defeated Michigan, 5-2,
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night in the NCAA tournament East Regional at Pepsi Arena,
it became the second Hockey East representative to qualify for the
Frozen Four in Providence, joining Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Bears will play North Dakota April 6 at 2 p.m.; BC
faces St. Lawrence at 7.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Maine, which won it all, was one of three Hockey East
color-bearers, along with New Hampshire and BC.
</P>
<P>
   Maine, the Hockey East tournament winner, was a tower of
strength as it eliminated CCHA entry Michigan with a five-goal
third period, out-slugging a team that was in the regionals for the
10th consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   The contest was schedued to start at 3:30, but because of the
four-overtime game between Boston University and St. Lawrence, it
didn't get under way until 7:02.
</P>
<P>
   Maine simply blitzed the Wolverines in the third. Ben Guite's
second goal made it 2-2, and then Chris Heisten took a feed from
brother Barrett and scored what proved to be the winner. Matthias
Trattning and Brendan Walsh added insurance tallies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the possibility of repeating, Maine coach Shawn Walsh said,
``We're closer to a legacy. I feel we're in a golf match _ we won
the first three holes and we have six to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was not upset when his team was down after two periods.
``We've been behind in five of our last eight games,'' he said.
``We just kept rolling, and it paid off. Our game plan was to keep
throwing four lines on the ice, and we knew something good would
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did was to stay focused. We knew Michigan was tired
after that Colgete game Saturday and we hadn't played because of
our bye. It all worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan was indeed a tad slow following the 4-3 overtime win
over Colgate and the loss of defenseman Dave Huntzicker. While the
Wolverines were toiling Saturday, the Maine delegation looked on,
the bye being the perk of the top seed.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, Michigan's Hobey Baker Award candidate, Mike
Comrie, was flying around the rink trying to make something happen.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Brad Fraser was sent off for holding at 17:09. His
team down a man, Comrie sped in alone on Matt Yeats and beat the
Maine goalie with a neat backhander from 15 feet out. For Comrie,
it was his 23d goal and 58th point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Jay Vancik was caught for interference at 4:21 of the
third, and the Maine power play finally worked. Guite rammed home
an 8-footer from the left of the crease at 5:14, his 21st goal.
Niko Dimitrakos assisted.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Heisten was caught cross-checking at 6:21, and it proved
costly. The elusive Comrie scored his second at 6:52 when he tipped
in a shot by Mike Cammalleri. Jed Ortmeyer also assisted.
</P>
<P>
   Maine bounced right back and Guite hit again at 8:01 with a
rapid 10-footer with help from Cory Larose and Cliff Loya. It was
2-2, the house was alive, and the Black Bears weren't done yet.

EAGLES ARE ON FAMILIAR PERCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Boston College already had used its one timeout
and there was less than a minute to play against Michigan State
Friday night. Still, as they had most of the night, the Eagles
trailed.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for a third straight trip to the NCAA Frozen Four looked
grim. A season that started with the Eagles the top-ranked team in
the nation was about to end well short of that.
</P>
<P>
   And then Michigan State, eager to close out the Eagles and maybe
with one hungry eye on the empty BC net, from where Scott
Clemmensen had departed for an extra attacker, got caught with too
many players on the ice and took a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmensen stayed on the bench so BC had a six-skaters-to-four
edge. As the call was made, the Eagles' big guns got a chance to
take a quick break. Defenseman Mike Mottau, who does not get many
of those, went to the bench for just a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny,'' Mottau said. ``I was sitting there and
I'm thinking, `Something has got to happen. This isn't my last
shift in college hockey.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Something did. It wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   And the Eagles are headed for their third straight Frozen Four.
It's the first time BC has been there three times in a row since
the first three years of the tournament in 1948, '49, and '50. It
was in 1949 that the Eagles won their only national title, beating
Dartmouth, 4-3, in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' Mottau said. ``We've been there the last two
years and this year I think we're going to get over the hump with
that experience factor. We're just due.''
</P>
<P>
   It was near midnight Saturday now and Mottau and his mates were
all smiles as they packed to leave Minneapolis. Early word was
their charter flight didn't have room for their equipment and it
might be late getting home so they might not practice until
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Much had happened since that desperate last minute against
Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles scored to send the game into overtime. Scored again
to win it. Mottau, who earlier Friday passed David Emma as BC's
alltime assist leader and now has 130, helped set up both. Then BC
came out and beat up on the Badgers from Wisconsin for a 4-1 win
Saturday night that delivered a spot in the Frozen Four next week
in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   BC plays St. Lawrence in one semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles were loose and flying against Wisconsin, and Mottau
hopes they will be again in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into this game, I really felt like there was no pressure
on us,'' Mottau said. ``They were the No. 1 team. We had all the
pressure on us at the beginning of the year with the No. 1. There
is a little bit of pressure. Everyone is saying you're No. 1 and if
you get behind in a game or whatnot, you hear the `overrated'
chant, stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans did yell ``overrated, overrated'' Saturday night late
in the BC-Wisconsin game _ likely aimed at Wisconsin and led by the
North Dakota fans who hung around after their team beat Niagara.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was for them,'' Mottau said with a laugh. ``I
hope it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Wisconsin coach Jeff Sauer had it figured, the BC-Badger
game was the next best thing to a title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it as for the national championship,'' Sauer said. ``I
felt that if we could win, we would have a good chance at winning
the national title.''
</P>
<P>
   Mottau may think his team is due, but he's not as bold as Sauer.
He just hopes his team uses the same approach it took against
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just excited to be here,'' he said. ``We're just
having fun. Instead of letting the pressure get to you, play loose
and play with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked last weekend. The Eagles will try to make it work for
two more games.
</P>
<P>

   Blake Bellefeuille, BC's sometimes-overlooked big-play maker,
was named Most Valuable Player of the West Regional. Bellefeuille
had a shorthanded goal and won the draw that set up the last-minute
tying goal against Michigan State, and had the first goal against
Wisconsin. ``He's a strong, hard-nosed player. Very, very gifted,''
said BC coach Jerry York. ``You can only have so many Hobey Bakers.
He was certainly a candidate for that.'' . . . For only the second
time, one school put three players among the Hobey Baker finalists
when BC's Brian Gionta, Jeff Farkas, and Mottau made the cut . . .
Farkas and Mottau both were named to the all-tournament team in the
West and Gionta just as easily could have made it. North Dakota
forward Jeff Panzer and defenseman Mike Commodore both made the
all-tourney team.

COATES DEAL ON TAP

   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ben Coates may be a Tennessee Titan before
you finish your coffee this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Reese, general manager of the American Football Conference
champion Titans, said Sunday at the NFL owners' meetings that he
could finalize a deal for Coates within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with his agent and gave him two contract offers for
Ben,'' said Reese. ``If there are no problems, we expect to sign
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates was released by the Patriots after the season, and there
was little interest in him until the Titans' starting tight end,
Jackie Harris, opted to go to the Dallas Cowboys in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run a lot of our offensive stuff with three tight ends, so
when we lost Harris, we had to find another one,'' said Tennessee
coach Jeff Fisher. ``We had Ben in to talk last week and had a good
visit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans had some interest in former Dolphin Troy Drayton, but
word is his knees are so bad, unless a team was desperate, he
wouldn't be able to pass the physical.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It appears instant replay will be a slam dunk to return for the
2000 season when the owners vote on the issue this week. Replay
passed, 28-3, last year, and one of the no votes came from the
Jets. Word is they will vote yes this year. That means any
opposition would have to change six yes votes from last year to no
votes this year, and that isn't going to happen. The opposition
needs eight votes to reject it.
</P>

   The top of the draft appears to be shaping up. The first pick
will be defensive lineman Courtney Brown of Penn State, to
Cleveland. Washington has the second and third choices and will
take linebacker LaVar Arrington of Penn State and tackle Chris
Samuels of Alabama. Peter Warrick, the highly publicized wide
receiver from Flordia State, probably will go north to Cincinnati.
Ravens GM Ozzie Newsome has the fifth pick and says he will take
either the best running back or wide receiver still on the board.
Baltimore owner Art Modell says his team will not trade its pick.
It was speculated that pick would be part of a deal with the Jets
to bring wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson to Baltimore.

   Some veteran owners will be pushing commissioner Paul Tagliabue
to bring all of the possible misuses of the salary cap to the floor
for discussion at Monday's owners-only session. The heat will be on
Tagliabue to punish the San Francisco 49ers for cap violations, or
penalize former team president Carmen Policy and former GM Dwight
Clark. Policy and Clark now are with Cleveland. Also, some owners
want to hear more about Denver possibly having circumvented the cap
by deferring some salaries of veteran players. John Elway's name
has been involved in this issue. Pittsburgh turned itself in for a
possible cap violation, and has agreed to a sanction, which has yet
to be decided, pending the outcome of a court action in Minnesota
over the entire cap issue.

   Despite what ABC might say, former Jets coach Bill Parcells
turned down a job as an analyst on ``Monday Night Football.''
Parcells and his agent both talked with ABC officials, and Parcells
decided that he didn't need the travel or the scrutiny that goes
with being on the Monday night game each week. ABC reportedly
denied it offered the job to Parcells.

   The Miami Dolphins have big plans to honor retired quarterback
Dan Marino. Sometime early in the 2000 season, hopefully during a
nationally televised night game, Marino will have his No. 13
retired. There also will be a statue of him placed in front of the
Dolphins' stadium, joining those of original Miami owner Joe Robbie
and Hall of Fame coach Don Shula. The Dolphins also are thinking of
having another day for Marino during which fans who are not season
ticket-holders can come to the stadium to honor the quarterback,
with the proceeds going to charity.

SKATING WORLD IS WHIRL OF ACTIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France _ The global toe-pick crowd was supposed to be Down
Under this week, introducing the compulsory dance to baffled
Australians.
</P>
<P>
   Then the International Skating Union decided the Aussies
couldn't be trusted to telecast triple axels to the rest of the
planet, so it yanked the World Figure Skating Championships out of
Brisbane and dropped them here just as the topless season is
starting on the Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone is complaining. Once the endless qualifying
rounds are done (eight hours for the men Monday, seven for the
women Wednesday), there'll be ample time to take in the salt air
along the Promenade des Anglais, haggle over violets at the Marche
aux Fleurs, wolf down salade nicoise, and try to break the bank up
the road in Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are better here at the Palais des Expositions, where
all four crowns are likely to change hands by Saturday night. That
never has happened in midquadrennium, but two switches are certain.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, the two-time pairs
champions, were pulled out Sunday by the Russian federation after
Berezhnaya tested positive for a banned substance at last month's
European championships in Vienna. (She claimed she accidentally
took medication for bronchitis.) And dancers Anjelika Krylova and
Oleg Ovsyannikov, also two-time champs, are down for the season
because of her aching back.
</P>
<P>
   The other two defenders, Alexei Yagudin and Maria Butyrskaya,
both are coming in as underdogs to countrymen Evgeny Plushenko and
Irina Slutskaya. As for the Americans, they'll be happy to hang on
to what they got last year _ a silver from Michelle Kwan and a
bronze from Michael Weiss. The four-medal days are over.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at this week's events:
</P>
<P>
   MEN:
</P>
<P>
   Yagudin hasn't been the same since getting kicked off last
year's Champions on Ice tour for alcohol-related misbehavior.
Plushenko, the 17-year-old springbok, has gone from nowhere to
bronze to silver in three years. This time, he should be golden.
Canada's Elvis Stojko, the three-time champ, is back on form after
his Olympic miseries. If he skates clean, the Americans could be
crowded off the podium. Weiss will have to hit the quad to have a
chance at a medal. The better shot may belong to Tim Goebel, who
landed three quads at the US nationals but has since split with
longtime coach Carol Heiss.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN:
</P>
<P>
   Butyrskaya, who became the oldest women's champion in history
(at 26) when she lifted Kwan's crown last year in Helsinki, now
looks like a one-night wonder. Slutskaya, who didn't even make the
Russian team last year after getting fat and formless, has won
everything in sight this season. The X factor is Kwan, who is
trying to become the only woman in history to regain her crown
twice. If she skates two clean programs, she can win. But Kwan,
who's been juggling skating with her UCLA studies, hasn't managed
that in a major event since the Olympics. Sarah Hughes, who was
seventh last year at age 13, could crack the top five now.
</P>
<P>
   PAIRS:
</P>
<P>
   Even if Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze had competed, they weren't
favored. China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo should have beaten them
last year and did beat them at the Grand Prix final. Poland's
Dorota Zagorska-Mariusz Siudek, Russia's Maria Petrova-Alexei
Tikhonov, and France's Sarah Abitbol-Stephane Bernardis will scrap
for silver and bronze. No chance for US champs Kyoko Ina-John
Zimmerman, who were ninth last year. If Tiffany Scott of Hanson,
Mass., and partner Philip Dulebohn can crack the top dozen, it'll
be a solid world debut.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE:
</P>
<P>
   The Russians haven't lost this event since 1991, but they will
this time. With Krylova-Ovsyannikov and Canada's Shae-Lynn
Bourne-Victor Kraatz both out, it's a walkover for France's Marina
Anissina-Gwendal Peizerat, the two-time runners-up. And if Italy's
Barbara Fusar-Poli-Maurizio Margaglio and Lithuania's Margarita
Drobiazko-Povilas Vanagas are on form, the Russians could be shut
out of the medals for the first time since 1968. US champs Naomi
Lang-Peter Tchernyshev, 10th last year, should climb up to eighth,
but no higher.

SUTTON LEADS RAIN-DELAYED TPC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ For Hal Sutton, this morning's
breakfast will feature coffee, cereal, and a sand wedge from 82
yards.
</P>
<P>
   That is the shot that awaits him in his quest to put a stop to
Tiger Woods's domination on the PGA Tour. He was doing quite well
Sunday, thank you, until he ran into an opponent that is
unquestionably unbeatable _ Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   A severe thunderstorm moved in and pounded northern Florida late
in the afternoon, putting a stop to the final round of The Players
Championship. Sutton, after making 10 straight pars, drained a
cross-country birdie putt at the par-5 11th to get to 10 under and
led Woods by three shots when play was halted.
</P>
<P>
   When action resumes at 9, Sutton faces a short approach to the
358-yard, par-4 12th, with Woods already on the green staring at a
putt that doesn't exactly give him visions of birdies. ``A
straight-forward putt,'' said Woods, with a slight grin. ``I think
I saw it as either a double- or triple-breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   He could afford to be somewhat lighthearted, as his reputation,
shall we say, precedes him. It wasn't long ago that Woods came from
seven shots down with seven holes to play to win the AT&AMP;T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am, and there is the small detail of 10 wins in
his last 16 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, (Sutton) is feeling pretty good at having a
three-shot lead,'' said Woods, ``but if I can go out there and hit
some solid shots and convert some putts, hopefully I can make this
thing a little interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The halt was disappointing, said Sutton, because ``everything
was going well. It was going the way I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention that it required an added round of questions
about his mind-set in taking on Woods, a subject that is beginning
to tax some Tour regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said this about as many different ways as I can say
this,'' said Sutton, carefully choosing his words. ``This is not a
Tiger Woods-Hal Sutton duel. You all can make of it what you want,
but I am playing the golf course. I am not going to say any more
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before rain rudely interrupted, he was saying it with his clubs.
As good a ball-striker as there is on Tour _ Woods included _
Sutton hit every green through 11 holes except one. And the one he
missed, the par-3 eighth, resulted in what could prove to be the
key shot if he prevails.
</P>
<P>
   His long iron to the 219-yard hole had come in hot and ran
through the green into the very back of a greenside bunker that
slopes forward. ``I couldn't even stand in the bunker to hit the
shot,'' said Sutton. ``I was thinking: `This could be big here.' I
just made sure that I stayed in the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He had all he could do to keep from falling forward, but Sutton
played it brilliantly. ``I just flushed it. It came out with some
really good spin on it,'' he said. ``I couldn't have dreamed it any
closer (10-12 feet) than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton had missed birdie putts inside of 15 feet on the first
five holes, but this time he nailed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great shot he played out of there,'' said Woods, who
followed that sand save by missing a birdie chance from about 9
feet. ``I completely misread the putt, and I consider myself a
pretty good green-reader. But I played it out there about a foot
and it broke 2 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods had read his putt at the first hole perfectly, a 15-footer
that dropped and tied him with Sutton at 9 under. Any thoughts that
it was an indication of things to come were quickly dashed as, at
the par-5 second, Woods missed a 5-footer for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   He dodged what could have been serious trouble at both the par-3
third and par-4 fourth, however, when Sutton could not convert
short birdie putts on top of bogeys that dropped Woods to 7 under.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looked like I was going to lose two shots (at the fourth),''
said Woods, whose approach was long and came to rest in thick rough
20 feet from the pin. When Sutton's 8-footer slid by, Woods, who
had done well to make bogey, breathed a sigh of relief.
``Definitely a gift,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps thinking he should return the favor, Woods _ now two
shots behind _ knocked it much closer than Sutton on the fifth,
sixth, and seventh holes, but failed to drain any of them. When he
didn't birdie the par-5 ninth or par-5 11th, Woods was stuck in a
gear to which he is unfamiliar _ neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously things aren't going exactly the way I wanted,'' said
Woods, staggered by Sutton's momentum until he was saved by the
horn to signal lightning, ``but I am only three back. There's a lot
of golf to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton is well aware of that. In 1983, he won this tournament
with a Monday conclusion. ``I was just thinking about that,'' he
said after play had been officially suspended. ``I don't know if
that has anything to do with anything, but it was nice to think
about, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   If he holds it together for seven more holes, there may be
something more enjoyable to think about.

REVOLUTION SHOW PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ After five years of season-opening road trips, a pattern
is emerging. The Revolution project an image of being rejuvenated
and motivated, but experience some difficult circumstances and
return home with little to show.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern appears to be continuing. The Revolution lost, 1-0,
at Tampa Bay Saturday night and next will visit Los Angeles, which
crushed three-time MLS champion D.C. United, 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution have some of the same weaknesses as in the
past, they appear to be developing an effective style of play.
Coach Fernando Clavijo is stressing a possession game, and the
Revolution appear comfortable with the philosophy. They dominated
the second half against Tampa Bay, but were disturbingly inaccurate
in the goal area, and surrendered a 51st-minute goal to Raul Diaz
Arce.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolution seldom have dictated the tempo of a
match in such a skillful manner. This is a team that is not relying
solely on work ethic, but appears capable of playing a technical
game and varying the pace of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early in the season,'' captain John Harkes said.
``But our defense was sound and we moved the ball well. If we
continue to play like this, I have no worries about this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution kept the Mutiny off balance until the final
seconds, pressuring the goal and remaining composed. The level of
their performance likely would have produced at least a tie in
previous seasons, but MLS opponents are becoming more settled
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dominating, we were aggressive, and we wanted it
more,'' Harkes said. ``We played the ball decisively out of the
back and created chances. But the name of the game is to put the
ball in the back of the net and we were unlucky. It could have been
2-nil in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing is a mature team. We were patient. We
weren't rushing things. We weren't just kicking the ball anywhere,
but we were keeping possession. You are going to have games when
you are the better team and you walk away with nothing. But we
dominated a team which had won its last game, 5-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tampa Bay seemed eager to impose its Carlos
Valderrama-dependent game on the Revolution. And the Mutiny were
confident after a four-goal victory over Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Revolution must contend with the frustration of having
performed well twice, but gaining only one point in the standings.
They have two more road matches before the April 15 home opener
against D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles showed they can play,'' Clavijo said. ``But I like
our chances against them. We have a difficult schedule at the
beginning but we will grow as a team. This team will not get
discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution will travel to Los Angeles Wednesday . . .
Eduardo Hurtado will rejoin the Revolution after the
Ecuador-Venezuela World Cup 2002 qualifier in Quito Wednesday.

Award: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank my profession for giving me freedom and access - the
freedom to live a much fuller life apart from the movies and the
access to get out and get to know the world and then come back and
go back to making movies,'' Beatty said. ``Please forgive me for
not making more of them, I'll try to do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you so much for encouraging my voice in public affairs.

As a screenwriter, I'd never sit still for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you can't have the husband up here getting this
thing and the wife down there maybe getting that thing and she's
having a baby at the same time. It doens't work.

<P>
   DALLAS _ For the entertainment buck, four-on-four overtime
hockey has produced the big bang the NHL craved. A five-minute
overtime period suddenly turns a 60-minute game of clutch-and-grab
into a dynamic speed-and-skills competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be more scoring chances and better scoring
chances,'' Stars goalie Ed Belfour said. ``So you have to be ready
for that challenge in overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Stars' perspective, it's time to bring on the playoffs
and bring back five-on-five overtime, where the ice shrinks instead
of expands and the checking becomes tighter, not looser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy it's not going to be played in the playoffs,
really happy, because we have had a tough year four-on-four,''
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said after yesterday's 2-1 overtime loss
to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche winger Milan Hejduk victimized the Stars with a fake
to get by Darryl Sydor, who went down for the block, and then fired
a quick wrister, sending the game-winner buzzing past Belfour with
1:43 left in overtime. It was vintage four-on-four hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's final odd-man rush followed a failed three-on-two
rush by the Stars. Shortly before that scoring chance, Brett Hull
and Joe Nieuwendyk led a two-on-one, but Nieuwendyk couldn't find
the handle on Hull's crossing pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good for the game and good for the fans,'' said
Stars forward Aaron Gavey, who was on the ice when Hejduk scored.
``It's unfortunate we lost. He made a great move, let's not take
anything away from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had ample opportunities to prevent overtime in what
was a hotly contested and physical game. Hitchcock praised his team
for a hard-fought battle, accepted the point for finishing
regulation tied and otherwise had little use for the statistic that
says the Stars are 3-5-8 in overtime games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four-on-four is skill and speed,'' Hitchcock said. ``We
haven't had a couple of people like \RBlake\S Sloan, and \RJere\S
Lehtinen all year, and it showed again today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars haven't won an overtime game since downing the New
York Rangers, 4-3, on Dec. 29. Since then, the Stars have lost four
and tied three in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we get caught up in, trying to make the
conservative play rather than taking the gamble,'' center Mike
Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   And while the new overtime system is certainly fun to watch,
it's a faulty way of judging a team. Of the 10 teams who have the
best overtime records, only half are currently holding down playoff
spots.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Islanders rank second in the NHL with a 5-1-8
overtime record, but they aren't even sniffing the playoffs.
Calgary leads the league with 11 overtime wins, but is five points
out of a playoff spot. On the other side, the Edmonton Oilers
(2-8-16) have used the regulation-tie rule to remain in contention
for the Northwest Division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the playoffs it shouldn't be in place,'' Stars defenseman
Derian Hatcher said. ``I don't even really like it right now. It's
fun, but I don't think a losing team should get a point.''

`AMERICAN BEAUTY' CAPTURES 5 OSCARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Capping what many regard as among the strongest
recent years in motion pictures, ``American Beauty'' took home five
Oscars on Sunday, including best picture. The Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences could hardly restrain itself from tossing
rose petals at the bayonet-edged comedy about a pair of the most
dysfunctional suburban households in movie history.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey won best actor as the film's narrator, a lovesick
40-something man going through his painful second adolescence.
``This is the highlight of my day,'' Spacey said. Sam Mendes, an
acclaimed stage director who brought the most recent revival of
``Cabaret'' to Broadway, won the director's prize for his first
film, while veteran television writer Alan Ball won the original
screenplay award for his first produced film. Conrad L. Hall, one
of the most respected cinematographers in Hollywood, won his second
Oscar. (His first, 31 years ago, was for ``Butch Cassidy and the
Sundance Kid.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're all part of a wonderful, wonderful dysfunctional
family called the human race,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad evening for DreamWorks, the mini-studio formed by
Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen that made
``American Beauty'' and was having its best Oscar night ever. And
quite a difference from last year, when the studio lost the best
picture award for its ``Saving Private Ryan'' to ``Shakespeare in
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Swank, 25, in her first significant movie role, won best
actress for playing a young woman who pretended to be a man in the
independent film ``Boys Don't Cry,'' providing ``American Beauty''
with its main disappointment of the evening when the actress honors
did not go to Annette Bening as Spacey's adulterous wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules,'' an adaptation by the director Lasse
Hallstrom of John Irving's novel about the residents of a Maine
orphanage, won awards for Michael Caine's supporting performance
(his second Oscar) as the orphanage's kindly doctor and for
Irving's adapted screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's biggest loser was ``The Insider,'' Michael Mann's
thriller about the collision between the worlds of big tobacco and
big media that came into the night nominated for seven Oscars and
went home with none.
</P>
<P>
   The academy handed out its 72nd annual Academy Awards at the
Shrine Auditorium here, with a pregnant nominee about to give birth
in the audience, a series of recent Oscar mishaps to be chewed over
by the host, Billy Crystal, and an unusually large number of major
categories with no clear front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   American bought more than $7.5 billion worth of movie tickets in
1999, an eight percent increase over the previous year, and a
record number of films earning more than $100 million, including
three of the nominees for the best picture Oscar: the preawards
favorite, ``American Beauty,'' ``The Sixth Sense'' and ``The Green
Mile.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early going, the awards were a bit of a mix, with no
clear trend developing except that ``The Matrix,'' a
science-fiction thriller about a machine-dominated future with some
of the jazziest effects of the year, was extremely popular in some
of the less heralded categories, winning for best film editing,
best sound, best sound effects editing and best visual effects.
</P>
<P>
   When he won, Caine said: ``I wasn't here the last time, so it's
very different when you're here than being told over the phone.
That is very nerve-wracking out there.'' His previous Oscar was for
Woody Allen's ``Hannah and her Sisters'' in 1986. Caine hefted his
Oscar as he spoke to journalists backstage after winning. ``It's
heavy,'' Caine said. ``But it fits kinda nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelina Jolie, a first-time nominee who played an
ostentatiously rebellious mental patient in ``Girl, Interrupted,''
won the award for best supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   Among others, she thanked her father, Oscar-winning actor Jon
Voight. ``I've never actually held an Oscar before,'' Jolie said
backstage just after accepting the award. ``It's quite amazing. My
dad's mother had his in a goldfish bowl way up on a mantelpiece,
and I've never held it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Award for a
lifetime of achievement in the movie business and was introduced by
his friend, Jack Nicholson, while his wife, an extremely pregnant
and about-to-deliver Annette Bening, sat beside him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the dignity of the occasion, Miss Bening's delicate
condition and the recipient's advanced age, there will be no sex
jokes,'' Nicholson said. ``And I'm very sorry for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty paid tribute to his fellow actors, to the friends who led
him through his wilder single years and to his wife, and made
reference to his recent flirtation with a campaign for president.
``If you had your choice and, say, could have the Thalberg Award
or, oh, the White House, I'd stick with this,'' Beatty said.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Almodovar won the award for the best foreign language film
for ``All About My Mother,'' and had to be dragged from the stage
by a co-presenter, Antonio Banderas, when his acceptance speech
rambled on too long.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary filmmaker Arthur Cohn won his third Oscar, this
one for ``One Day in September,'' a film he made with Kevin
Macdonald, about the attack on Israeli athletes during the Munich
Olympics. What was noteworthy was that this was the first awards
ceremony since the academy reformed its procedures for nominating
documentaries, in part to make it likelier that popular box-office
hits would be nominated. Yet ``One Day in September'' is a film
that has not yet even been released and was up against such
box-office successes as ``The Buena Vista Social Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Collins won the best original song award for ``You'll be in
My Heart'' from the animated Disney film, `Tarzan.'' John
Corigliano scored a surprise by winning an Oscar for ``The Red
Violin's'' musical score, beating out more heavily favored
composers for ``American Beauty'' and ``The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The costume design Oscar went to Lindy Hemming for Mike Leigh's
``Topsy Turvy,'' a sumptuous recreation of Gilbert and Sullivan's
collaboration on ``The Mikado.'' The film also won for best makeup.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a rocky road to this year's ceremonies. First, 4,200
Oscar nominating ballots disappeared and new ballots had to be
rushed out and the voting deadline extended by two days. (The
ballots had mistakenly been put into a third-class mail storage
area at a postal warehouse.) Then a shipment of 55 Oscar statuettes
were stolen off a loading dock operated by Roadway Express, which
was driving them from their factory in Chicago. A Roadway Express
employee was charged with stealing the statuettes, which were
discovered beside a trash container in the Koreatown section of Los
Angeles by a self-employed repairman and scavenger, who was later
invited to join Sunday night's ceremony.

 &HT;    `Beauty' of a night
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thank God nobody stole Billy Crystal and left him in a
dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Oscars,'' Crystal began his telecast-saving work as host
of Sunday night's eerily ho-hum 72nd annual Academy Awards. ``Or as
ABC likes to call it: Regis' night off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This just in,'' Crystal deadpanned a little later. ``The pope
has apologized for `Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just thinking,'' Crystal said after the ethnically tinged
appearances of Polish director Andrzej Wajda and presenters Chow
Yun-Fat and Salma Hayek. ``John Rocker must be going nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The night was ruled by ``American Beauty,'' which won five
awards, including best picture, best actor for Kevin Spacey (``This
is the highlight of my day'') and best director for Sam Mendes.
Hilary Swank won best actress (``Boys Don't Cry'').
</P>
<P>
   Crystal opened the show with a series of ``Gump''-like
appearances in a dozen different movies _ a tried-but-true device
that never fails to make us think that this year's Oscar ceremony
will be the one worth staying up for. Alas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godfather, I don't know what to do,'' Crystal said transported
into a scene from ``The Godfather,'' opposite Marlon Brando.
``These producers don't want any dance numbers. ... It's on a
Sunday, but it'll end on Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   Produced as if under water by Richard and Lili Zanuck (producers
of the Oscar-winning ``Driving Miss Daisy''), this year's awards
telecast threw out the dance numbers as part of a promise to move
things along. But with the dances gone, there was nothing to
replace them _ goofy or not, with the hilarious exception of Robin
Williams performing the nominated song ``Blame Canada.'' And the
show still didn't end until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Not only did these Oscars not give us much to love,
they didn't even give us much of what we love to hate. Even Cher
felt terrible for showing up, as a presenter, in the kind of thing
an Earthling might wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've probably noticed I've dressed as a grown-up,'' she
said. ``I apologize to the academy, and promise I will never do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jack Nicholson, called by Crystal ``still the coolest guy in
the room,'' was no longer that. With his spiked, receding hair and
bloated, neckless head, he looked headed toward the Mickey Rooney
zone of aging badly.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty was stuttering, sputtering and only occasionally
worth listening to while accepting the Irving G. Thalberg Award,
which Rooney, er, Nicholson presented.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked his wife, Annette Bening, due any second with their
fourth child, who, he noted, ``could actually join us any minute
right here in the second row if I don't wrap it up.''
</P>
<P>
   When Crystal wasn't joking, there was little to keep us watching
(``OK,'' Crystal joked just before midnight, with most of the major
awards still to be presented. ``We're halfway done.'').
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine was visibly moved by his supporting actor Oscar
for ``The Cider House Rules'' (though not nearly as moved as Hilary
Swank's husband, Chad Lowe, who bawled like a baby when she won for
best actress). Caine acknowledged his fellow nominees individually,
telling Tom Cruise (``Magnolia''), one of the highest-paid leading
men, ``Tom, if you had won this, your price would have gone down so
fast. Do you have any idea what supporting actors get paid?''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise nodded in his seat, and with wife, Nicole Kidman, by his
side, suddenly seemed very, very happy not to have won.
</P>
<P>
   The most moving moment came unexpectedly, when the Oscar for
documentary short was given to ``King Gimp.'' The subject of the
film, Dan Keplinger, who has cerebral palsy, slipped from his
wheelchair when the award was announced, then rolled and contorted
in ecstasy in the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fathered Dan Keplinger for 13 years,'' producer Susan
Hannah Hadary said as Keplinger continued to squirm in happiness in
his wheelchair. ``He's an amazing spirit in a body that society may
not have included. But tonight he is included and honored as an
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   When it finally did end, around 12:40 a.m. today, Crystal noted
blearily, ``Thank you for watching the shortest Oscar show ... of
this century.''

DUCKS BEAT COYOTES
</HEADLINE>

By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Twenty minutes into Sunday evening's game
versus the Phoenix Coyotes, the Anaheim Mighty Ducks looked like
dead ducks. Trailing by two goals Anaheim's playoff hopes appeared
to be all but dead.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to Oleg Tverdovsky's game-winning goal at 3:47 of
overtime the Ducks are still alive and kicking in the Western
Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The come-from-behind 4-3 victory before 17,174 at the Pond
vaulted Anaheim (78 points) into a ninth-place tie with Vancouver
and pulled them within three points of Phoenix, Edmonton and San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at it as if it was do-or-die,'' said center Matt
Cullen, who found Tverdovsky in the slot after Teemu Selanne had
kept the puck alive in the Phoenix zone. ``We we lose and we are
done, we knew we needed two points.''
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky got the Ducks the much-needed extra point by snapping
a shot past Sean Burke for his 15th goal of the year. Burke had
denied the Ducks a victory in regulation when he made a brilliant
save to stop Selanne from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy we came back (to tie), but we felt the job
wasn't done,'' said Cullen of the Ducks, who outshot the Coyotes
28-7 over the last 43:47 of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, who were coming off an embarrassing 8-1 loss in
Vancouver on Friday night, looked like they might embarrass
themselves again Sunday when Phoenix scored at the 1:02 mark of the
first period and wound up taking a 3-1 lead to the dressing room
after 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out slipping and that can't happen,'' said Tverdovsky.
``It's a good thing we woke up and showed some pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Ducks did shake themselves, the Coyotes could do
virtually nothing to contain Anaheim. The Ducks, led by an
inspirational effort from Teemu Selanne, totally dominated the
final two periods on the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne, who just three shots in the last three games, had nine
shots, scored twice and assist on the other two goals as he
manhandled the Phoenix defense down low.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on a mission to get us a win,'' said Anaheim coach
Craig Hartsburg. ``That as strong one-on-one as I've seen him all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes have lost seven straight games and 6-16-1-2 in their
last 23, and Sunday they squandered yet another lead. Benoit Hogue,
Trevor Letowski and Greg Adams scored in the first period when
Phoenix outshot the Ducks, 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne began to turn the tide in favor of Anaheim when he
scored his second goal of the game at 3:48 of the second. The Ducks
were able to get anything else past Burke in that period, but the
momentum had shifted for good and Fredrik Olausson scored on the
power play to tie the game, 3-3, at 1:17 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was all Phoenix could do to hang for overtime and the
one point that goes with it. And the reason they were able to do so
was Burke, who robbed Mike Leclerc, Kip Miller and Antti Aalto
before denying Selanne a hat trick with 21.5 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate we had to give Phoenix a point,'' said
Hartsburg. ``But the main things is that we get two points in all
of our games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have five games remaining and Hartsburg said he tried
to lift the spirits of his downcast team on Saturday by reminding
them a win would get them right back in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to move on and stay positive,'' said Selanne, who like
the rest of the Ducks now has something positive to think about for
the next five days.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Acting president Vladimir Putin won a narrow majority
of the vote Monday in Russia's presidential election, gaining the
outright victory that the Kremlin had pursued with growing
desperation to avoid a runoff next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's anticlimactic triumph was huge in absolute
terms _ some 20 percentage points ahead of his closest rival, the
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ it also appeared likely to fall
considerably short of expectations. And that further elevated
doubts, which had begun to surface in the campaign's final days,
about the depth of Putin's popular support.
</P>
<P>
   With 92.5 percent of the ballots counted early Monday morning,
Putin had captured 52.6 percent of the vote, compared with 29.5
percent for Zyuganov. The head of the liberal Yabloko party, the
legislator Grigory Yavlinsky, was in a remote third place with 5.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The final pre-election polls, released a week before Sunday's
election, indicated that Putin was backed by as many as 57 per cent
of respondents who said they intended to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a postmidnight news conference, Putin seemed to give a nod to
the narrowness of his majority, noting that with a potential
electorate of 108 million, ``even a half percentage point is a huge
credit from the population.''
</P>
<P>
   More telling, he seemed to suggest that he might invite
political rivals into government in an apparent effort to build
political support for whatever programs he proposes.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was especially solicitous of Zyuganov, whose support
appeared almost one-fifth greater than pollsters had estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, Putin stated with surprising bluntness
that Zyuganov's showing, especially in the face of a relentlessly
hostile government and private press, was a warning that the
Kremlin was not adequately addressing the problems of the working
class and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered tributes to his bitter rivals, the former prime
minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, saying
that they had helped hold Russia together by supporting the war
against separatist rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they or any other outsiders will be brought to the
Kremlin ``is subject matter for negotiations,'' Putin said. But he
added, in an allusion to a classic Russian fairy tale, that he
would not allow his team to resemble ``the notorious troika, where
one is pulling into the water, another one backwards and the third
one to the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's intentions may well depend on how bare majority he won
turns out to be after the counting of the final ballots. If it
does, Putin can accurately claim a mandate from Russian voters,
paper-thin though it might be, to carry out new policies.
</P>
<P>
   Had he not garnered more than 50 percent, the law required that
he face the second-place finisher, Zyuganov, in a runoff scheduled
for April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one doubted that Putin would have won such a
contest handily; Zyuganov, also the Communist candidate in the 1996
presidential election, could muster only 40 per cent of the vote in
a runoff that year against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But it also seems clear that Putin would emerge from winning a
thin majority as a diminished leader, with a tarnishing of the
image of infallibility and inevitability that has cloaked him
almost since Yeltsin named him prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the spare, dour 47-year-old former chief of domestic
intelligence, has captivated the public and utterly confounded
political sages since his vault from near-total obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected a man unschooled in politics and so bland in
personality and appearance to seize the Russians' imagination. Most
predicted that Putin's first and only action of profound importance
_ the launching of an all-out war on secessionist rebels in the
province of Chechnya _ would be an act of political suicide.
Yeltsin's decision in 1994 to conduct a Chechen war that went
disastrously awry for the Russian army almost cost him the 1996
election and was one cause of his impeachment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But in both cases Putin confounded the political pundits. His
calm decisiveness, apolitical manner and comparative youth
contrasted favorably with the bombast, Kremlin maneuvering and
indecision of the final years of an increasingly infirm Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   And the second Chechen war turned out to galvanize ordinary
citizens, stung by the loss of Soviet empire and industrial might,
who were looking for some evidence of Russian heft to boost their
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   At times this winter, polls indicated that close to three in
four Russians supported Putin's conduct as prime minister and _
after Yeltsin abruptly quit on New Year's Eve _ as acting
president. His support was so robust that Primakov, once seen as a
formidable opponent for the presidency, quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last month, some of that support began to fade. The
reason is not completely clear: It may be in part that Putin has
drifted out of the honeymoon phase that is granted new leaders, and
in part that voters began to focus on the election and discovered
other candidates they liked.

   ``The decline is among those people who like Putin but do not
vote for him,'' said Leonid Sedov, who directs the Public Opinion
Foundation, a major Moscow polling organization. ``They have
nothing against him; they think his policies are quite all right.
But they were going to vote for other persons anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of the campaign, during which it was forbidden
to publish opinion polls, Putin's backers launched a furious effort
to recapture some of that support, in part by launching negative
attacks on those politicians who were perceived as siphoning it
away.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the focus was on Yavlinsky. In the final days
of the race, as Putin garnered much media attention by flying a
combat fighter to Chechnya on an ostensibly official visit,
Yavlinsky was investigated by the government on suspicion of
illegally campaigning on a military base.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the state television network ORT, controlled in part
by the financier Boris Berezovsky, who is close to the Kremlin,
broadcast a series of news reports identifying Jews, homosexuals
and foreigners as principal supporters of Yavlinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Putin's chief campaign strategist denied any
role in those reports, which were clearly designed to stir
smoldering Russian biases against minorities to Yavlinsky's
disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many mysterious and silly things happen during the campaign,''
the strategist, Gleb Pavlovsky, said in an interview on the
privately owned NTV network. ``I know nothing about Yavlinsky's
sexual orientation, and I know nothing about events that take place
in the gay community. If it was staged, it did Putin nothing but
harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky, long regarded as a leader of Russia's Western-style
democrats, said Sunday night that his campaign ``achieved what we
wanted _ we have demonstrated that there are millions of people
behind us who support what we are talking about.'' He indicated
that he hopes to form a broader coalition of right-wing critics of
the Putin government.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what that coalition might be. Many of
Yavlinsky's ideological allies, such as the Yeltsin government
veterans who comprise the new Union of Right Forces, have cast
their lot with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   In geographic terms, Putin swept every region of the nation. But
he apparently avoided a runoff by piling up votes in European
Russia to offset a comparatively disappointing showing in Siberia
and on the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   In vast parts of the less populous east _in the enormous central
Siberian province of Krasnoyarsk, and far eastern regions like
Chukotka and Primoriye _ Putin failed to reach the 50 percent mark.
He also fell well short in the city of Moscow, which gave him only
46.3 percent of the vote and Yavlinsky 18.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But in his hometown of St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest
city, Putin collected more than six of every 10 votes. And in
northwestern provinces like Kaliningrad and Karelia, he did almost
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The election commission stated that some 67 percent of voters
had cast ballots, slightly below the turnout in the nation's first
post-Soviet presidential election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That alleviated one of the Kremlin's secondary concerns: that
unanimous predictions of Putin's victory would depress turnout
below the legally binding level of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If turnout fell below that floor, a new election would have been
required in four months. Since it did not, Putin will almost
certainly be sworn in, in May, for a full four-year term as
president.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Acting president Vladimir Putin won a narrow majority
of the vote Monday in Russia's presidential election, gaining the
outright victory that the Kremlin had pursued with growing
desperation to avoid a runoff next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's anticlimactic triumph was huge in absolute
terms _ some 20 percentage points ahead of his closest rival, the
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov _ it also appeared likely to fall
considerably short of expectations. And that further elevated
doubts, which had begun to surface in the campaign's final days,
about the depth of Putin's popular support.
</P>
<P>
   With 92.5 percent of the ballots counted early Monday morning,
Putin had captured 52.6 percent of the vote, compared with 29.5
percent for Zyuganov. The head of the liberal Yabloko party, the
legislator Grigory Yavlinsky, was in a remote third place with 5.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The final pre-election polls, released a week before Sunday's
election, indicated that Putin was backed by as many as 57 per cent
of respondents who said they intended to vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a postmidnight news conference, Putin seemed to give a nod to
the narrowness of his majority, noting that with a potential
electorate of 108 million, ``even a half percentage point is a huge
credit from the population.''
</P>
<P>
   More telling, he seemed to suggest that he might invite
political rivals into government in an apparent effort to build
political support for whatever programs he proposes.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was especially solicitous of Zyuganov, whose support
appeared almost one-fifth greater than pollsters had estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference, Putin stated with surprising bluntness
that Zyuganov's showing, especially in the face of a relentlessly
hostile government and private press, was a warning that the
Kremlin was not adequately addressing the problems of the working
class and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He also offered tributes to his bitter rivals, the former prime
minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, saying
that they had helped hold Russia together by supporting the war
against separatist rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they or any other outsiders will be brought to the
Kremlin ``is subject matter for negotiations,'' Putin said. But he
added, in an allusion to a classic Russian fairy tale, that he
would not allow his team to resemble ``the notorious troika, where
one is pulling into the water, another one backwards and the third
one to the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's intentions may well depend on how bare the majority he
won turns out to be after the counting of the final ballots. Yet
with a victory in the first round, Putin can accurately claim a
mandate from Russian voters, paper-thin though it might be, to
carry out new policies.
</P>
<P>
   Had he not garnered more than 50 percent, the law required that
he face the second-place finisher, Zyuganov, in a runoff scheduled
for April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one doubted that Putin would have won such a
contest handily; Zyuganov, also the Communist candidate in the 1996
presidential election, could muster only 40 per cent of the vote in
a runoff that year against Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But it also seems clear that Putin would emerge from winning a
thin majority as a diminished leader, with a tarnishing of the
image of infallibility and inevitability that has cloaked him
almost since Yeltsin named him prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, the spare, dour 47-year-old former chief of domestic
intelligence, has captivated the public and utterly confounded
political sages since his vault from near-total obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected a man unschooled in politics and so bland in
personality and appearance to seize the Russians' imagination. Most
predicted that Putin's first and only action of profound importance
_ the launching of an all-out war on secessionist rebels in the
province of Chechnya _ would be an act of political suicide.
Yeltsin's decision in 1994 to conduct a Chechen war that went
disastrously awry for the Russian army almost cost him the 1996
election and was one cause of his impeachment in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But in both cases Putin confounded the political pundits. His
calm decisiveness, apolitical manner and comparative youth
contrasted favorably with the bombast, Kremlin maneuvering and
indecision of the final years of an increasingly infirm Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   And the second Chechen war turned out to galvanize ordinary
citizens, stung by the loss of Soviet empire and industrial might,
who were looking for some evidence of Russian heft to boost their
self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   At times this winter, polls indicated that close to three in
four Russians supported Putin's conduct as prime minister and _
after Yeltsin abruptly quit on New Year's Eve _ as acting
president. His support was so robust that Primakov, once seen as a
formidable opponent for the presidency, quit the race.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last month, some of that support began to fade. The
reason is not completely clear: It may be in part that Putin has
drifted out of the honeymoon phase that is granted new leaders, and
in part that voters began to focus on the election and discovered
other candidates they liked.

CHIEF SAYS DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO BLAME FOR LAPD CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: This is a copyrighted story) 
By BETH BARRETT AND GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Formally responding to District Attorney Gil
Garcetti's recent charges, Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks categorically denies ever ordering investigators not to
cooperate in the Rampart Division scandal probe.
</P>
<P>
   The chief also accuses Garcetti of deliberately setting up the
controversy, the Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   In a detailed, 29-page confidential memo sent to the Los Angeles
Police Commission on Sunday, Parks claims Garcetti seized on the
chief's effort to move the investigation forward by expanding the
U.S. attorney's role. Garcetti did so by having four prosecutors
send memos to five different investigators on March 13 asking for a
long list of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the information already was in the hands of prosecutors
or was being assembled by police when Garcetti went public with his
accusations before his letter of complaint even reached the chief,
the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, a copy of which was obtained by the Daily News, is
largely a litany of details intended to prove Parks' contention
that Garcetti has dragged his feet in investigating the scandal for
more than a year and only took an interest when facing an uphill
fight for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief of police at no time issued any order or in any
manner communicated to any person, public or private, in any
context whatsoever that the department would not cooperate with or
provide investigative assistance to the Los Angeles County District
Attorney in this or any other criminal matter,'' the memo states.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons disputed
the Parks memo and the suggestion prosecutors only recently began
requesting information.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not true,'' Gibbons said. ``We were requesting
information all the time. All I can tell you is that at one point
in time, the LAPD stopped sending us information.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parks memo was written in response to the investigation that
the Police Commission ordered Inspector General Jeff Eglash to
conduct into Garcetti's charge that Parks ordered the LAPD task
force probing the Rampart scandal to refuse to cooperate with the
District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real flurry of political-type requests rather than
investigative,'' a police source said. ``It was a set-up and leaked
to the L.A. Times before it even got to the chief.''
</P>
<P>
   In the memo to the Police Commission, Parks accuses Garcetti of
being slow to join the probe, of removing deputy district attorneys
who wanted to proceed with cases against officers suspected of
wrongdoing and of refusing to make the central figure in the
scandal _ former Officer Rafael Perez _ available in recent weeks
for police interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information regarding the emerging Rampart scandal had been
developed as early as February 1999,'' the memo said. ``Up until
late October 1999, only one deputy district attorney ... had been
assigned to work with the department.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, Parks said the D.A.'s task force was increased to
six attorneys, a law clerk and secretary. Parks said the increases
to other prosecutors occurred only on March 9 and March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation, Parks said information was
provided to the District Attorney's Office, but that no action was
taken even though police had been informed that the task force was
prepared to file two cases.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said no charges were filed, however, after the deputy
district attorneys who were ready to proceed _ George Rosenstock
and Susan Chatsworth _ were removed from the task force and
assigned to other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Daily News has documented how Rosenstock had
developed what he felt was a strong case to prosecute several
officers in a station-house beating as well as how Deputy District
Attorney Michael Krauts' early warnings about Perez were ignored by
his supervisors and he was rebuked.
</P>
<P>
   The District Attorney's Office has backpedaled on statements
Garcetti made Friday that Rosenstock had asked to be taken off the
Rampart task force and that he did not aggressively seek to
prosecute rogue officers last month.
</P>
<P>
   Parks in his memo indicated his complaint that Garcetti was
going too slow in prosecuting cops and freeing framed suspects
became personal after the district attorney accused him and his
officers of refusing to provide information.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti's accusation of police refusal to work with his
officers came on March 14, when he faxed a copy of a letter of
complaint to Parks at 9:30 p.m. when the chief was out of town. A
story containing the accusations appeared the following day in the
Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is noted that Garcetti refers to an interview with Los
Angeles Times reporters 'late Monday evening' that would run on
Tuesday March 14,'' the memo says. ``The article was actually
published on Wednesday and contained a direct quote from Garcetti's
letter dated March 14, 2000, and not faxed to the Chief of Police
until 9:30 p.m. on Tuesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks in which prosecutors had sought little information
from the LAPD, the memo notes the four deputy district attorneys
submitted requests for information on various cases on the same
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of some concern to investigators and managers in the
investigation is that all of the items requested in the letters was
for material that has been previously supplied or in some form made
available to the many and various members of the D.A.'s staff
assigned to assist in this investigation,'' the memo said.

ACADEMY's STRUGGLES CONTINUE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 72nd annual Academy Awards came close to being the showdown
between Oscar-voters' ongoing struggle to really honor the best
that film can achieve and, well, to act like the stodgy old
academy.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Sunday's results, the struggle continues.
</P>
<P>
   Pulled inexorably in the direction of acknowledging ``American
Beauty's'' formal brilliance and relative boldness, and of Hilary
Swank's bravery and uncompromised empathy in the thematically
challenging ``Boys Don't Cry,'' the academy went with genuine
artistry in most of the top categories.
</P>
<P>
   Yet wherever they apparently felt they could get away with it,
the voters followed the path of least resistance to their more
sentimental impulses and outdated traditions.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the best film won the most Oscars, ``Beauty's''
near sweep of the major competitions _ best picture, best actor
Kevin Spacey, director Sam Mendes and Alan Ball's original
screenplay _ wasn't just earned. It was also bought. While rival
studio Miramax got most of the criticism for spending too much
money on its Oscar campaign for the sappy ``Cider House Rules,''
there is no denying that DreamWorks spent all that it could and
more to keep ``Beauty'' a ubiquitous presence on local airwaves and
periodical covers.
</P>
<P>
   And since fellow big spender Miramax's film was the only other
best picture nominee to win awards this year, it's sadly evident
that money drives these races now at least as much as merit.
</P>
<P>
   But the academy did recognize merit, this time in categories in
which the choices have often been embarrassments. Of course, they
could hardly deny the coolest Foreign Language film, Pedro
Almodovar's ``All About My Mother,'' since it has won practically
every other international movie award there is. Nor could they
ignore the kickiest genre film contribution, ``Sleepy Hollow's''
mood-drenched art direction.
</P>
<P>
   The two surprise awards for Mike Leigh's detailed look at
Gilbert and Sullivan's creative struggles, ``Topsy-Turvy,'' spoke
well to the academy's capacity for appreciating analytical cinema _
and to its often less-noble bias for films that flatter Hollywood's
own obsession with show business (in that way, it was a kind of
riposte to criticism of last year's ``Shakespeare in Love'' upset).
</P>
<P>
   No complaints about ``The Matrix's'' sweep of the high-tech
categories, either. Even in a year when George Lucas' ``Star Wars''
sequel achieved a kind of computerized aesthetic perfection, the
blazing energy and ingenuity of the cyberpunk upstart proved that
digitized filmmaking could be as lively as the human imagination.
</P>
<P>
   But then there were the lazy calls. Going with the obvious in
the supporting actress category, ``Girl, Interrupted's'' Angelina
Jolie, continued the academy's fetish for showy portrayals of
mental dysfunction. Still, young Jolie's work was as much a
career-perfect job as Spacey's, and it was fun watching those
famous lips quiver through that tremulous acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   An even easier way was taken in the supporting actor category,
where the most reassuring (if least exciting) choice won _
Hollywood favorite Michael Caine, as the man who loves cute orphans
in ``The Cider House Rules.'' Kudos to previous winner Caine for
rising to the occasion and giving the snazziest acceptance speech,
however.
</P>
<P>
   But let's be honest, it is never right to hand out awards
primarily on the basis of what the winner will say. That was
evidenced by ``Cider House's'' John Irving, whose meek screenplay
adaptation of his sprawling novel was not only the lamest runner in
that field, but whose drippy/demagogic pro-choice remarks belied
the way his film soft-pedaled the reproductive rights issue.
</P>
<P>
   Other middling decisions were made in the music categories. Phil
Collins' bland ``Tarzan'' anthem overcame Aimee Mann and Randy
Newman's much more affecting ballads, not to mention the real
killer toon tune, ``South Park's'' ``Blame Canada.'' And as fine as
John Corigliano's work for ``The Red Violin'' was, it was rather
unimaginative to choose the score for the film that was about
classical music.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the truly award-worthy (looking ahead to the Emmys,
anyway): Billy Crystal's opening montage, superimposing himself
into film classics _ and dragging Spacey, Stephen King and Elian
Gonzales along with him _ was a terrific way to keynote the tribute
to the century of cinema that the 1999 ceremonies closed out. The
world's greatest Oscar host outdid himself onstage throughout the
night, too; if it weren't for Crystal and statuette-finder Willie
Fulgear, there wouldn't have been half the reasons to even tune in.
</P>
<P>
   Well, those two and the Robin Williams' ``Blame Canada''
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   On a final note: Was there irony in the academy's decision to
present this year's honorary Oscar to Andrzej Wajda, whose films,
often made at risks Hollywood artists could never conceive of,
chronicled Poland's struggles against oppression throughout much of
the last century?
</P>
<P>
   Wajda was quoted in the clip presentation as wanting to make
audiences think. Considering this year's Oscar choices, a little
more than half of the academy's members believe that that's a
worthy goal.

LOS ANGELES: memo said. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There appears to be a common thread in all these letters: the
reference to a prior verbal denial by department employees of
access to this material,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The memo said there was a request made on March 9 for four
Internal Affairs investigations and the material was later provided
although there were several days of missed telephone calls between
prosecutors and police investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The memo also asserts that prosecutors refused to give police
access to interview Perez, whose testimony as part of a plea
bargain on a cocaine theft charge started the entire Rampart probe.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said that also was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, he is scheduled to be interviewed on Monday (today)
or Wednesday,'' Gibbons said. ``It is a question of when we can
have his attorney present. He has to have his attorney with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Parks memo said that on March 13, Lt. Pat Gannon of the
Internal Affairs group was meeting with Deputy District Attorney
Richard Rosenthal to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gannon ... expressed his concern that it had been three weeks
since his investigators had been allowed to interview Perez and
asked Rosenthal how soon Perez would be made available for
interviews,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosenthal said that the D.A.'s office would not allow
department investigators access to Perez as long as there was a
perceived lack of cooperation between the D.A.'s office and the
department,'' it said.

   Its cry we were to accept that premise would it not be possible

   Gabriel Prince, a travel writer in the throes of heartbreak,
meets another American in Paris who claims he has a time machine
and asks him to accomplish a mission. Jasper Hudnut is convinced
that the greatest ills in present day society stem from Reagan's
presidency and he wants Gabriel to go back in time and change the
course of history, to adjust things so that it never happens.
Gabriel manages to get back to 1938 but unexpected events conspire
to prevent the plan from going exactly smoothly. Some are the usual
little glitches that happen in anyone's life, like falling in love
and forming friendships. Others are rather more unsettling, such as
finding that knowledge of the future gives him unexpected talents
and powers, which please the ego and distract him from his purpose.
</P>
<P>
   However there is yet another, more sinister development. Gabriel
discovers that there are other time travelers with a claim on the
machine, ruthless men, who will stop at nothing to regain it.
Suddenly life becomes very complicated and he begins to wonder
which world he belongs to. There is the added difficulty that the
machine may run out of fuel and get stuck. Also there seems to be a
slight inaccuracy in the settings, sometimes by several years.
Perhaps time travel is not as simple after all and changing the
course of history merely a hopeless vanity.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Delacorte has a splendid grasp of his material and a light
and amusing touch in handling his characters. At the flick of a
switch we are transported back to Hollywood in the thirties. He has
researched the period well and has a feel for the headiness and yet
the innocence of the times. He provides a fascinating look at the
studio system in its early days, the power, utter crassness and
greed of the early moguls and the limitless possibilities of an
enormous industry still in its infancy.

although for an ape, to keep a baby quiet. I had to do the same
things for my daughter, while traveling in limos and on planes,
trying to keep her quiet. It's not that hard; it's not brain
surgery.'' _ Phil Collins &QL;

the future.'' _ Hilary Swank &QL;

Pedro Almodovar &QL;

   ``The rules for this category are very discriminatory. ...
Really the result, the campaign is very hard very weird. It means

ELEGANT, BUT STILL TOO LONG
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What about that ``Matrix'' sweep, huh? That's what you'd be
talking about today if, like most reasonable folks, you only had
stomach or stamina enough to sit through about half the 72nd annual
Academy Awards ceremony broadcast live on ABC from the Shrine
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' the evening's big winner, didn't start
piling'em on until the last half-hour of a 4-hour, 9-minute show,
another record.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Lily Zanuck, as executive producers of the event,
brought an elan to the production in a number of subtle ways.
First, of course, was the already famous (and much-appreciated)
ditching of the inane dance numbers. They also helped spearhead the
elegant and only slightly garish set design and the welcome trips
behind the set to take in the backstage shmoozing and announcer
Peter Coyote's impersonation of an air-traffic controller.
</P>
<P>
   Credit them, too, with the interactive-entertainment-inspired
multiple-image screens, the artful transitions between clips of the
nominees, the hip-hop and ambient tinges to the music (it sounded
as if Moby scored the evening), and in general the upscale polish
of the production.
</P>
<P>
   But please, next year's goal _ shorten the damn thing.
</P>
<P>
   Host Billy Crystal was, as usual, smart and funny, with
scattershot barbs taking down Miramax and DreamWorks' spending _
and spitting _ match, Halle Berry's driving skills, ``The Green
Mile's'' (and the ceremony's) oppressive length and Erykah Badu's
headgear. If his opening sequence, which placed him in a number of
classic films, from ``The Gold Rush'' to ``Casablanca'' to
``Psycho'' to ``The Graduate'' to ``E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial,''
wasn't as funny as his previous similar montages (though the
``Godfather'' and ``Exorcist'' bits were amusing), it was largely
from overworking the concept. He did, however, pretty much earn his
night's pay during his trademark musical medley simply for his
smooth, rapid-fire delivery of ``The Insider's'' tongue-twisting
``60 Minutes Waltz.''
</P>
<P>
   Combining the Best Song nominees in a segment midshow, where
they were performed back-to-back and back-and-forth on the stage,
was artful _ until, of course, Robin Williams' comically xenophobic
production number ``Blame Canada'' _ and, again, made the evening
seem less like the tawdry Vegas revue it usually resembles. (The
Zanucks cannot be blamed for the fact that Phil Collins won.) The
Burt Bacharach-led medley of past Best Song nominees was
entertaining, too, but could've been ditched in favor of brevity;
the proliferation of movie clip montages _ there were four Sunday
night, including one head-scratcher on (usually dubious) Hollywood
history lessons _ was bewildering in their gee-whiz-ness.
Hollywood, Hollywood _ calm down, you've already got the job as
designated dream factory for the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The Zanucks backloaded the awards in the major categories. The
only big trophy handed out in the first 100 minutes was Best
Supporting Actress (and no, I don't want to know what the deal is
between Angelina Jolie and her brother), which probably forced
people to stay up later than they expected. They also pushed back
the direct competition between ``American Beauty'' and ``Cider
House,'' to delay revealing the former's sweep (which was further
deferred when John Corigliano beat both films for his gorgeous
``Red Violin'' score and ``The Matrix'' beat both in the editing
category).
</P>
<P>
   The acceptance speeches early on tended to be so short one
suspects the nominees were told snipers were perched in the balcony
of the Shrine Auditorium waiting to take out any winner who went
over 45 seconds. Then, of course, came extended, wearying
monologues from Michael Caine, Warren Beatty, Hilary Swank,
cinematographer Conrad L. Hall, director Sam Mendes and director
Pedro Almodovar, who was literally dragged offstage by Antonio
Banderas. Maybe winners !ital!should be encouraged to be political
in their acceptance speeches _ or anything, just to get away from
the dull laundry lists of thanks sprayed out to executives and
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, try as they seemed to, the Zanucks couldn't prevent the
inevitable, the much-expected (though minor by recent standards)
sweep by suburban satire ``American Beauty.'' This points up a
problem in general with the Oscars _ there's never much suspense;
it's more a coronation ceremony confirming what everyone has known
to be inevitable. In the past decade, virtually every film _ and
many actors and actresses _ were ordained Oscar winners a month or
two or more before the ceremony; even last year, when ``Shakespeare
in Love'' mildly upset ``Saving Private Ryan,'' most
prognostication pieces explained in trenchant detail why
``Shakespeare'' would win if ``Ryan'' didn't.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with films of quality coming from every direction, it
was considered a wide-open race for the gold. The first round of
Oscar voting, the nominations process that pared away most of the
adventurous material, largely destroyed what might have been a
truly suspenseful evening. From mid-February on, we were saddled
with a two-horse race between ``American Beauty'' and ``The Cider
House Rules,'' which no one had previously even mentioned as a
front-runner. Eventually, everyone realized that not even Miramax's
mighty marketing machine could drag the nag that was ``Cider
House'' over the finish line, and predictions of last night's
``Beauty'' pageant became more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a modest proposal: Shorten the Oscar season to two or
three weeks from nominations to awards. With most of Hollywood
wired, voting could be conducted online with a minimum of fuss (and
no ballots lost in the mail) and a maximum of swift efficiency,
meaning less shameless studio campaigning and covert tinkering with
the results. It'd mean the media prognosticators would have to be
darn fast on their feet to be right, and might also put the kibosh
on a lot of the meaningless interloper awards ceremonies that have
begun cluttering the late-winter landscape. With less time for the
attendant bluster, there might just be a surprise come Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   As for the pre-show documenting the arrivals, what can you say
about a half-hour of prime-time television in which Keanu Reeves
proves to be the most articulate and thoughtful interviewee?
Co-host Chris Connelly offered some of the most non-committal
opinions of the races anyone could muster, and this exchange pretty
much typifies the experience: Tyra Banks (so effusive, she put
entire cheerleading squads to shame), to Salma Hayek: ``What's your
secret to looking so hot all the time?''
</P>
<P>
   Hayek: ``I don't know.''

ANOTHER SHORT SEASON FOR DODGERS, ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the spirit of the political season, I come to
the beginning of the baseball season mouthing the words of the
Republican nincompoop, George W. (Whoops) Bush: I'm a uniter, not a
divider.
</P>
<P>
   I want the best for the Dodgers and Angels, and that doesn't
mean small games toward a .500 season.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California has been absent from the postseason so long
that area fans have forgotten what it's like to see meaningful
baseball in the fall. We now set our sports clocks to Labor Day, at
which time we tell the kids to put their gloves away and keep Dad's
Sundays clear for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that neither team made the deals and moves
necessary to reach mediocrity. The Raul Mondesi for Shawn Green
deal was great, bringing Orel Hershiser back was a no-brainer, and
the Angels may have a bargain in rookie manager Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   But I quibble with everything else. Oddly, the two teams could
have helped each other if they had thought things through, and made
a few decisions so obvious a sportswriter could see them.
</P>
<P>
   (begin bold)The Dodgers should have gassed Kevin Malone and
Davey Johnson.(end bold)
</P>
<P>
   Former Warner Bros. CEO Robert Daly committed the franchise to
resurrecting Dodger Blue when the Foxies named him the new managing
partner, and I believe he's on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   But he should have given the GM and manager the boot. For
starters, the two aren't on the same page. They aren't even in the
same boat. Ask Malone about his relationship with Johnson, and
he'll speak for hours and make references to Freud, Nietzsche and
Stengel. Ask Johnson about Malone and he'll call him an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has no clue how to handle a major-market team, with
budgets of $70 million or more, and agents like Scott Boras and
Jeff Moorad have used him like a roll of toilet paper in Bobby
Knight's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson arrived with a reputation as a player's manager, but all
he did last season was butt heads with Mondesi, Eric Young and
others. The fact he still thinks Todd Hundley can be an everyday
catcher says all I need to know about his managing.
</P>
<P>
   (begin bold)The Dodgers should have replaced Malone and Johnson
with Dave Stewart and Davey Lopes.(end bold)
</P>
<P>
   Besides being ex-Dodgers, both are aggressive and have
experience with winning. Stewart has been a quick study as a GM in
waiting, and Lopes, just hired in Milwaukee, has been ready to
manage for five years.
</P>
<P>
   They also know that players don't have to love each other to
win. They also would have zero tolerance for players who go through
the motions.
</P>
<P>
   (begin bold)The Angels should have hired Malone as their GM.(end
bold)
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Expo Malone's strength is his ability to seek, sign and
develop young players, and the Angels' farm system needs as much
help as the Angels' rotation.
</P>
<P>
   He is also skilled at operating a small-market team with a J.C.
Penney budget. I can envision Malone looking at the Angels' roster
and telling team president Tony Tavares, ``I can trim $20 million
in salaries before trimming the Christmas tree.''
</P>
<P>
   (begin bold)The Angels should have kept Chuck Finley and traded
Mo Vaughn.(end bold)
</P>
<P>
   A team can never have enough pitching. To a lesser degree,
losing Finley has the same dynamic as losing Nolan Ryan. The Angels
never needed Vaughn. An aggressive GM could have worked a deal
sending Mo to one of those teams with an unquenchable desire to
spend, like the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   (begin bold)The Dodgers should have moved Devon White and
Hundley regardless of cost, and set their sights on Fernando
Vina.(end bold)
</P>
<P>
   One needs to correct mistakes as soon as possible. White has hit
his age wall, and Hundley needs to go to the A.L., where he can DH.
Maybe the Cubs would have sent Terry Adams to L.A. for White. Vina,
who would up in St. Louis, is exactly what the Dodgers need most, a
quality defensive second baseman who bats leadoff and can run.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)The Dodgers should have traded Ismael Valdes and
Eric Young to the Angels for Jim Edmonds.(end bold)
</P>
<P>
   This deal would have made so much sense. The Angels would have
filled a need on the mound and at second, and the Dodgers would
have gotten a full-time left-handed hitting center fielder who can
hit anywhere in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine these lineups the teams could have rolled out next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers: 1, Vina, 2B. 2, Mark Grudzielanek, SS. 3, Gary
Sheffield, LF. 4, Green, RF. 5, Eric Karros, 1B. 6, Edmonds, CF. 7,
Adrian Beltre, 3B. 8, Angel Pena or Paul LoDuca, C. Rotation, Kevin
Brown, Chan Ho Park, Darren Dreifort, Hershiser and Eric Gagne or
Carlos Perez. Closer, Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Angels: 1, Orlando Palmeiro, LF. 2, Young, 2B. 3, Darin Erstad,
1B. 4, Tim Salmon, RF. 5, Garret Anderson, CF. 6, Troy Glaus, 3B.
7, Todd Greene, DH. 8, catcher platoon. 9, Gary DiSarcina, SS.
Rotation, Finley, Valdes, Ken Hill, Ramon Ortiz and Kent Mercker.
Closer, Troy Percival.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers and stuck with Hundley and White. Instead,
the Angels still have too many position players and not enough
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The season begins next Monday. Based on what we see today, it
will end in September. Early September.

 ALTAVISTA SWITCHES WEB PORTAL INTO HIGH GEAR  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Internet portals were compared to cars, AltaVista would be a
Volvo: respected and reliable to some, spartan and a little out of
date to others.
</P>
<P>
   Once a leading search engine, AltaVista has stagnated in recent
years, seemingly frozen in time as competitors like Yahoo and Lycos
prospered by transforming themselves into shopping malls, travel
centers and club houses.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is sprinting to catch up. With hundreds of millions of
dollars in acquisitions, a big marketing effort that includes
actress Pamela Lee Anderson, and an initial public offer expected
in late April, AltaVista is trying to re-emerge from dormancy and
become an Internet leader.
</P>
<P>
   But the company must fight for attention in a sector crowded
with well-known adversaries and must win users without spending too
much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, AltaVista was one of the lost opportunities
on the Internet,`` said Barry Parr, an analyst for International
Data Corp. ``I think they have done good things to get going again,
but the problem is that they've done them very, very late.``
</P>
<P>
   What AltaVista has done in the past few months is to infuse its
Web site with bells and whistles like shopping, free Internet
access, an image library and breaking news reports. Like all
Internet portals, it is trying to give users more reasons to visit
than just offering a way to find information elsewhere on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy is a dramatic change. Until January 1999, its
site featured only an Internet search engine on a utilitarian Web
page adorned with simple yellow and orange graphics.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with AltaVista's transformation under way, Rod Schrock,
AltaVista's president and chief executive, said the company is
poised to dominate its target audience, the so-called ``Web
enthusiasts.``
</P>
<P>
   These are the people, Schrock said, who ``embrace the Web and
make it part of their lifestyle.'' He said that they spend more
time on the Internet and are more likely to shop online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Web enthusiasts are a very active audience that tends to be
very lucrative,`` Schrock said early this month at the company's
new Palo Alto headquarters, a sparsely decorated building filled
with gray cubicles in keeping with AltaVista's conservative image.
``In that target audience, we are No. 2 only to Yahoo.``
</P>
<P>
   To help capture the market, AltaVista has added several features
to its site. They include an ``advanced search engine`` that allows
users to look for information on the Web by date and a library of
MP3 music, video and photography files.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of overall Web users, however, AltaVista's ranking has
changed little for at least two and a half years. In February, it
was ranked 13th behind well-known and not so well-known portals
like Yahoo, ExciteAtHome, About.com and Real.com, according to
Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has managed to increase U.S. users since its
October 1999 relaunch, from 10.3 million in September to 12.3
million in February.
</P>
<P>
   The push has extended worldwide: AltaVista has created sites in
countries like Britain, France and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Schrock, who joined the company in January 1999, said AltaVista
should be measured by its global audience. In that case, he said,
AltaVista is half the size of Yahoo, not one-fourth, as U.S. market
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ron Sege, executive vice president at Lycos, is
unimpressed with AltaVista's efforts. He said AltaVista's
``comeback'' is just an expensive marketing campaign that has so
far been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's tough for folks who are in the second and third
tier to move into the top tier,`` said Sege, whose Lycos network is
ranked fourth in users. ``It's very difficult to buy traffic these
days. There's more marketing dollars being thrown in the
traditional channels and I think that consumers are getting
fatigued with it all.``
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista's origin has a lot to do with its predicament,
analysts agree. The AltaVista search engine was created in 1995 by
Digital Equipment Corp. to show clients how powerful the company's
computers were.
</P>
<P>
   But Digital Equipment never realized that its Internet showcase,
among the most powerful search engines of its era, was a
potentially lucrative business, analysts said. So the company never
spent much money to keep AltaVista competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The investment drought abated after Compaq, the personal
computer manufacturer, bought Digital Equipment in 1998. For a
time, Compaq considered rebuilding AltaVista, but then in August
sold 82 percent of it to CMGI, the venture capital company in
Andover, Mass., for $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under Compaq's and CMGI's stewardship, AltaVista went on a
spending spree. It bought the financial Web site Raging Bull and
the retail Web site Shopping.com.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista was also among the first Internet portals to offer
free Web access. So far, the service has lured 2 million
subscribers, all of whom are directed straight to AltaVista's home
page when they log on.
</P>
<P>
   Another major part of AltaVista's expansion plan is its debut on
the Nasdaq stock exchange. The company's initial public offering,
which will fund its continued development, is expected in late
April.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will almost certainly be looking to see whether
AltaVista eventually earns a profit. So far, it has lost money in
every quarter since it was started.
</P>
<P>
   Though AltaVista still trails many of its competitors, Schrock
is confident that his company can catch up. He said that AltaVista
will eventually broaden from its Web enthusiast audience to go
after every Internet user.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Schrock said, AltaVista's tardiness is irrelevant
in the long run given the history of media empires. For example, he
said, few people can recall which television network trailed in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me, was CBS three years ahead or behind of NBC?``
Schrock asked. ``No idea? So in the grand scheme of things, no one
will care in 10 years whether we were three years before or after
Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Li, an analyst with Forrester Research, was not so
optimistic. She lauded Alta Vista's focus on Web enthusiasts and
e-commerce, but stopped short of predicting that AltaVista would
one day become the Internet's top portal for all users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a general search engine isn't enough to catch up to a
Yahoo because they are so far ahead,`` Li said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schrock at times seems to say that climbing just a few
rungs on the Internet ladder would be a victory. A company that is
among the top 10 or 20 in global traffic, he said, can still be
successful over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be No. 1 in scale to be a successful
player,'' Schrock said. ``There are easily 20 traditional media
companies across the world that are highly profitable.''

BIOSCOPE: GENE MAPS MAY AID DIAGNOSIS, BUT THEY DON'T
SPEED  TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TOM ABATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C. 2000 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As scientists near their goal of mapping the human genome,
the first medical payoff is shaping up as a good news-bad news
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be this tidal wave of diagnostic tests that will
let you know your predisposition'' to various disease, said Trevor
Hawkins, deputy director of the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut
Creek, Calif., a Department of Energy laboratory involved in genome
mapping.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news. The bad news is that it will take years to
find drugs or treatments, and get them approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the problem,'' Hawkins said. ``You'll be able to
tell people what's wrong with them, but you won't be able to do
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This gap between diagnostics and therapeutics is no secret to
biotechnology insiders. Eric Shulse, director of the molecular
diagnostics unit at PE Biosystems in Foster City, Calif., called it
the Humpty Dumpty dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Humpty Dumpty is crashed, that's your diagnostic,''
Shulse said. ``But it's a lot harder to put Humpty Dumpty back
together again.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Duster, a sociologist at the University of California at
Berkeley who has studied people's attitudes toward genome research,
said this diagnostics gap could undermine support for the
gene-mapping effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a kind of sympathetic response to this technology
eight to 10 years ago, but in the ensuing years there has been an
increasing skepticism,'' said Duster, whose studies have targeted
the people who know the most about genetics _ families with the
inherited diseases of cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia and
beta-thalassemia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among this group of the informed lay population you find the
highest level of concern and skepticism,'' said Duster, because
they've already experienced what it's like to know in rich detail
what ails them, without having new therapeutic options.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, skepticism about genetic testing borders on
resentment. Stanford University bioethicist Mildred Cho has looked
at the controversy surrounding the test for Canavan disease, a
brain and nervous system disorder that afflicts one out of every
6,500 children born in Ashkenazi Jewish families.
</P>
<P>
   This inherited condition causes a toxic chemical buildup in the
brain that can lead to disabilities, blindness, seizures and even
death. In 1997, Miami Children's Hospital developed and patented a
test that discloses whether both parents carry the gene defect, and
thus stand a 1-in-4 chance of passing the disease to their
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Cho said the test has been criticized several ways. First, it
may be priced between $60 and $300, including a $12.50 royalty to
the hospital. Second, critics say it should be licensed to more
laboratories in order to make it more available and bring down the
price.
</P>
<P>
   Then's there's the ownership issue. Cho said families with
Canavan sufferers provided blood samples, which researchers used to
discover the gene defect, and now resent that the hospital patented
the tests, giving it complete control over its use.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Children's issued a statement saying it had invested $5
million in the project and considered a moderate financial return
``only fair.''
</P>
<P>
   As gene data continue to gush forth, spawning tests far in
advance of cures, such frictions will inevitably mount, making
anxiety the most likely first byproduct of the genomics revolution.
</P>
<P>
   PATENTING SCENT? Oakland, Calif.'s DigiScents will announce that
it has filed a patent covering 125 of the genes that allow us to
recognize smells.
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents isn't alone in trying to solve the mystery of how we
detect the difference between fresh-brewed coffee and fresh-baked
bread. Ambryx Inc. in San Diego, Calif., is hot on the same trail.
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents chief executive Joel Bellenson and Ambryx scientist
Sergei Zozulya painted this picture of our most primitive sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We evolved as pond scum,'' Bellenson said. ``We had to be able
to sense nutrients. We thrived as life because we were able to swim
toward where the food was.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before the nose was a gleam in nature's eye, primitive
organisms evolved receptors that could detect the chemical pattern
of nearby nutrient molecules. Over evolutionary time, these
receptors congregated deep in the nasal cavity, in a region called
the olfactory epithelium.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Zozulya said, some 300 to 400 receptors, each controlled
by a different gene, try to identify odor molecules as they waft
past. But smell isn't as simple as dogs make it seem. There is no
1-to-1 matchup between smell and receptors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans may be able to recognize 10,000 separate smells,''
Zozulya said. ``Each odor reacts with different receptors.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, two people bent over the same rose may use
different receptors to register the fragrance, or one may have a
sharper appreciation because their receptors are better tuned. This
complexity could complicate the issue of patenting olfactory genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody has a patent on a single receptor, it's hard to
say what it means,'' Zozulya said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, DigiScents is being cagey about its patent claims,
other than to observe that they cover a good chunk of the smell
receptor universe. Zozulya said between 100 and 150 smell receptors
are already in the public domain, put there by government-funded
research.
</P>
<P>
   As private researchers compete to patent whatever smell genes
remain up in the air, they point to a variety of uses for their
discoveries, like detecting dangerous gases in mines (sure to
provoke the canaries' union.)
</P>
<P>
   Creating smells to ship over the Internet is clearly the sexiest
part of DigiScents' mission. But Bellenson hints at medical
applications. Greater knowledge of the smell mechanism may suggest
ways to sharpen our sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A high percentage of people are unable to smell something,''
he said. ``With science and software we may be helping create
corrective lenses for the nose.''

 OUTTAKES: Disney, NBC Bosses Pay Yahoo a Visit 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Stan Bunger &AMP; Jan Boyd &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrimage to Silicon Valley continues.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo President Jeff Mallet says he recently entertained Disney
Chief Michael Eisner and NBC head Robert Wright (that ought to
start some merger rumors). Both were checking out Yahoo's new
broadcast studio.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, broadcast studio. Yahoo has quietly launched a live
financial news broadcast airing every morning from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The company converted the room usually reserved for media
interviews into a small studio with three cameras and
TelePrompTers.
</P>
<P>
   The control room looks like any found in your basic medium-sized
television station, with more than a half-dozen people staffing the
controls.
</P>
<P>
   The only notable difference from a regular control room is the
Globecaster computers from Sacramento, Calif.'s Play TV tucked
under the console, helping transform the action happening in the
studio into bits that can be shoved through the Internet to your
desktop.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting part of the Webcast isn't the content, it's
Yahoo's FinanceVision player, a bit of software you download in
order to see the show.
</P>
<P>
   Mallet says that thanks to the intense competition between Real
Networks and Microsoft, his company was able to cut an
unprecedented deal with Microsoft, &LR;  to license essentially raw code
of the Windows Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filo (Yahoo co-founder David Filo) and his crew then went to
work,'' says Mallet. The technology isn't revolutionary but it
works well, downloads very easily and allows the viewer to access
all sorts of information.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is also running commercials in its show and, unlike
television broadcasters, is able to give its advertisers very
precise information about who watched those ads. The next step will
be direct purchase of an advertiser's product after viewing its
commercial _ just click and buy.
</P>
<P>
   Financial news is just the beginning. Yahoo has plans to branch
into other areas soon. Mallet won't say what will be next, but
sports could be a good bet.
</P>
<P>
   MORE BIG NAMES: Back to big names coming to check out Silicon
Valley's latest and greatest.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton will tour the Women's Technology
Incubator this Wednesday in San Francisco. LevelEdge chief
executive officer Lisa Henderson will be there to greet the first
lady, and explain LevelEdge's Web site, which is aimed at
transforming the college athletic recruiting process. Then
Henderson will be out looking for a new home.
</P>
<P>
   The subsidized rent of the Technology Incubator has helped
LevelEdge get its start, but Henderson's company is rapidly
outgrowing its offices. So, she's doing a little shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Check out these figures -- a building in San Francisco, not on
the market yet, 30,000 sq. feet, 10-year lease required along with
$1.7 million deposit and monthly rent of $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Big bonus: The building comes with parking.

   She was given 24 hours to make a decision.

<P>
   SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE: You've built two big software companies.
You're worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   You have getaway houses in Hawaii and Lake Tahoe to go with your
big home in Santa Cruz County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   You have a fleet of racing sailboats, and hangars full of
airplanes, including a pricey executive jet.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, you're a bona fide digital success story.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you do with your time?
</P>
<P>
   If you're Philippe Kahn, you keep working. Kahn, the founder of
Borland (now Inprise) and Starfish Software (now a Motorola
subsidiary) has a simple reason for continuing to lead and invest
in companies: his kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see their parents building stuff, doing other
things, just like I saw my own parents,'' said Kahn after landing
his Cessna Citation jet at the Watsonville airport. Kahn's late
father, an engineer in France who helped design the supersonic
Concorde's wings, maintained his career into his 80's.
</P>
<P>
   While he's not embarrassed about his wealth or his toys, Kahn
doesn't dwell on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an example, just sitting on the beach doing nothing,
being a consumer of things,'' he said. ``I don't think that's the
way to raise kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn is actively involved in Starfish, where he's still CEO, as
well as startup software companies Lightsurf (working on wireless
digital photography technology) and OpenGrid (creating software
tools to manage the growing flood of wireless communications).
There's also the Lee-Kahn Foundation, which funds environmental and
educational projects.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes his work ethic rubs off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids need to learn about making things happen and
making a difference,'' said Kahn.

   &UR; NOT JUST ONE OF THE BOYS: HILARY SWANK AND `BOYS DON'T CRY' &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (1,400 words) Includes a color slide of Hilary Swank with Chloe
Sevigny in a scene from ``Boys Don't Cry.'' &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN SPELLING &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Swank has done soap opera in ``Beverly Hills 90210,''
shown her athletic prowess in the feature film ``The Next Karate
Kid'' and faced evil in the original film version of ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,'' but her latest film is easily her most
challenging _ and has earned her an Oscar as Best Actress of 1999.
``Boys Don't Cry'' casts her as Brandon Teena, nee Teena Brandon, a
woman who disguised herself as a man and began a new life for
herself in small-town Nebraska, until hatred and intolerance
brought this real-life story to a tragic ending. Swank talks with
New York-based free-lance writer Ian Spelling about the film, the
unique challenges of playing a woman playing a man, her own
experiences with intolerance and why she thinks Brandon Teena's
story had to be told. (slugged:

   Michael Caine has never played an American before _ the accent
took him weeks of coaching to master _ but it was worth it to make
``The Cider House Rules,'' he says. The film casts him as a kindly
doctor who runs an orphanage, and also performs abortions on the
side to prevent unwanted children from being born. Caine talks with
Chicago-based free-lance writer Cindy Pearlman about the new film,
the horrendous experiences from his own childhood which drew him to
the role, why he's happier as an actor now that he's aged out of
leading-man roles and why he didn't want to talk about the Oscar
chances for his performance in ``Cider House Rules.'' (slugged:

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Clinton tilts at foreign windmills
 &HT;    (For release March 29, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Jefferson Clinton is embracing an almost quixotic quest
for a legacy that would put Monica Lewinsky out of our minds. It
won't happen. This not only is a lame-duck president but one with
baggage so heavy that other world leaders see no reason to
genuflect before him.
</P>
<P>
   In his last year as president, Clinton seeks a legacy, pursues a
Nobel Peace Prize that he never will achieve. Likely, if Monica had
not happened, he still would not be able to succeed in bringing
conflicting parties together; the hatreds run too deep.
</P>
<P>
   It is sad, indeed, that Clinton's libido came to dominate his
presidency, but he has no one to blame but himself. His quest to
throw a blanket over it is failing.
</P>
<P>
   He takes on the tobacco industry, the gun industry, educational
problems and the like as a fairly liberal president _ which puts
him at immediate odds with the Republican-dominated Congress. His
chance of pushing through meaningful legislation on anything is
meager.
</P>
<P>
   As he jets around the world seeking peace (and a peace prize),
Clinton finds that he cannot dictate terms or rapprochement. His
visits to India and Pakistan showed that. If that wasn't enough,
his failure to alter the rigid demands of Syria's Hafez Assad for a
peace with Israel not only showed Assad's intransigence but further
weakened Clinton's foreign-policy stature; he dealt with a man who
is on our list as both a supporter and instigator of terrorism. And
that man, Assad, rejected him!
</P>
<P>
   What was thought to be a Clinton-brokered peace in Northern
Ireland is not.
</P>
<P>
   He rescued the Albanians from the Serbs, and now has to rescue
the Serbs from the Albanians. He tempts Iranian favor with the
lifting of an embargo on pistachio nuts and caviar.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere he turns, however, is there visible success. Perhaps
some seeds have been sown, but there will be no buds during the
Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy will not be peace in the Middle East, or on the Asian
subcontinent. His legacy will not be the condition of the domestic
economy either, although that is one of the few successes
attributed to his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   His legacy is, and always will be, Monica Lewinsky _ and others.
And the subsequent impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he took his first oath of office as president, he has
been hounded by his own foibles: first, Gennifer Flowers, then
Paula Jones, then Monica Lewinsky _ and maybe a couple of others in
between.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, his enemies were fixed and his sexual appetite
gave them further succor.
</P>
<P>
   Still a relatively young man as outgoing presidents are seen,
Bill Clinton must deal with his future. To enhance it, he'd love to
be remembered as a man who brought peace to ... you name the place.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that people still are wondering if Hillary will
dump him after the White House days, and whether he is going to be
disbarred from practicing law because of his lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame, too. Bill Clinton is a bright man, highly
educated, with considerably good ideas. But his presidency is and
has been paralyzed by that exotic moment near the Oval Office; it
effectively ended the day he looked us in the eye and said he did
not have sex with that woman.
</P>
<P>
   His domestic agenda repressed, he turns to foreign affairs. He
needs a legacy and maybe it will come of that. But it doesn't. The
world is no more at peace today than it was when he became
president. In fact, it may be less at peace.
</P>
<P>
   He wanders the globe trying to find the breakthrough, but it
does not happen. In a way, Bill Clinton is a pathetic person. He
has all the mental talent to have been a great president. He is
capable of becoming a valued resource as the ex-president.
</P>
<P>
   Following Watergate, Richard Nixon eventually emerged as an icon
of foreign policy. It took many years, however. Whether Clinton's
transgressions _ the Gennifer/Paula/Monica affairs _ ever can be
overcome is unclear. He's got some books to write, some admissions
to make, some culpability to express.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, and not before, perhaps Bill Clinton can regain some
respect.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The pope as politician
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Paul II's trip to Israel was billed as a personal journey
of faith and it was no doubt that as well. The pope's passion was
manifest and moving.
</P>
<P>
   But the papacy is not apolitical. No pope can travel without
making political waves, least of all this one, who has had active
political and human rights agendas. So it was in Israel and in the
West Bank, which Israel has been ceding to Palestinian control in
increments.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, everything there _ business, study, archaeology _ is
political, so John Paul's presence and comments could not have been
read as innocent of political implications and purpose even if he
had wanted them to be. And clearly, he did not want to go unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   The pope strongly advanced the ministry he has brought to the
renunciation of Christian denigration of Jews and Judaism, on which
his own church's authorship has been writ large. John Paul has
devoted to this healing task a unique sensibility and strength of
commitment. His commentary at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial, was historic.
</P>
<P>
   The pope pulled up short of acknowledging church and papal
complicity-by-indifference in the Holocaust, a disappointment, but
the burden of that history weighed in his words. The confession was
little less palpable for being implicit.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis necessarily negotiate in clear-eyed calculation of
their security, but in a state founded in no small part as a refuge
from 2,000 years of a Christian animus broken only by spells of
``tolerance'' here and there, credible assurance of Christendom's
religious goodwill can broaden the context in which those
calculations are made.
</P>
<P>
   That said, on the ground, the Vatican's tilt toward the
Palestinian side remains clear and unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican refused to recognize Israel until 1994. It rejects
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. John Paul in February held his
ninth meeting, no less, with Yasser Arafat and asserted ``the Holy
See's solidarity with the Palestinian people.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's expressions in the West Bank of sympathy for the
plight of the Palestinians were apt as far as they went but were
empty of any apparent recognition of the culpable intransigence of
Palestinian leadership and its Arab-state backers.
</P>
<P>
   With thousands dead from another war and from decades of
terrorism against Israel, Palestinians are only now near to getting
from their begrudged negotiations something akin to what Israel
freely offered after the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   There's realpolitik mixed with John Paul's human-rights plea for
Palestinians. The Vatican no doubt foresees Palestinian
sovereignty, and the pope is putting the church in a position then
to protect the remnant Christian population and access to Christian
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Perversely, Israel's good record of stewardship over the shrines
of all faiths, contrasted to the spotty record of Arab regimes,
works against the Vatican's willingness so far to put itself as
square with Israel as the pope has worked to put his church with
the Jewish people.

   PAPAL APOLOGIES FOR ALL BUT GAYS. Recently, Pope John Paul II
celebrated Mass in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. In an
unprecedented gesture he bowed his head and asked forgiveness for
sins committed by Roman Catholics. Those sins included religious
intolerance toward Jews, ``rejection and exclusion'' of women and
misdeeds committed against the poor, immigrants and indigenous
people. Columnist Chuck Colbert writes: ``It was an extraordinary
and timely admission, but there was one gaping omission: an apology
to lesbians and gays.'' (slugged:

   FOR NATIVE-AMERICANS, A FIGHT FOR DIGNITY IN URBANA, ILL. ``Life
for the handful of American Indians living in the college town of
Urbana, Ill., was pretty quiet in 1988 B.C. Yes, 1988 B.C. _ Before
Charlene,'' writes columnist Tim Giago. Charlene Teters of the
Spokane tribe arrived on campus in 1988 along with Marcus Amerman,
a Choctaw, and Norman Akers, an Osage, as part of a recruiting
program by the University of Illinois to bring Indian students into
the arts program. Soon after they arrived, they noticed appalling
images around campus: caricatures of Indians on T-shirts, cars,
store fronts, parking lots and hotel lobbies. It was about the
school's mascot _ a white, middle-class boy dressed up in Indian
attire. In this commentary, Gaigo recounts the problems these three
Indian students faced while trying to earn their degrees _ and
their fight to kill the mascot. (slugged:

 By JULIA WANG  
 &HT;    CoCo Lee looks to be the happiest person seated in the lobby of
the Four Seasons Hotel in New York. After two months of touring in
Asia _ leapfrogging from Hong Kong to the Philippines, eight
countries in all _ she has finally returned to the states, which
explains her beaming expression. After all, for this globetrotting
California girl, the United States means home.
 &HT;    ``But I'm not really home yet,'' the 23-year-old says, a broad
grin spreading across her pixie face. ``My home is L.A. I miss my
bed so much.''
 &HT;    It's the eve of the stateside premiere of her first American
album, ``Just No Other Way.'' It took nine months to produce,
leading Lee to lovingly compare the making of the album to ``having
a baby.''
 &HT;    ``This album is the greatest challenge of my life,'' she says.
``My greatest challenge and my greatest achievement.''
 &HT;    Even though she has just come off a plane from Asia, the
Chinese-American songstress is already preparing to embark on
another whirlwind concert tour. That is, after she spends a few
weeks in her comfortable bed.
 &HT;    A skillfully crafted collection of urban beats, R&AMP;B ballads, and
soul-sister turns, ``Just No Other Way'' is Lee's debut on the Epic
550 label, and the first release in her unprecedented long-term
contract with Sony Music.
 &HT;    The number of Asian and Asian-American artists who've had
breakthrough pop careers in the United States can be counted on
exactly, well ... no fingers. But Sony is convinced that CoCo is
different _ that, given her undeniable beauty and talent, she'll be
able to convert her considerable success in Asia to blockbuster
stardom in America.
 &HT;    In January, radio stations across the country debuted the
high-energy dance track, ``Do You Want My Love,'' the first of
``Just No Other Way's'' 12 tracks. MTV has added the sleek video _
which puts Lee's toned torso front and center _ to its volume
rotation. And if the song's title sounds similar to the breakout
hit of another ``ethnic crossover'' diva _ Jennifer Lopez's ``If
You Want My Love'' _ maybe that isn't a coincidence. After all,
Sony is the music-industry superpower that successfully turned a
trinity of Latin talents _ Lopez, Marc Anthony and, yes, Ricky
Martin'' _ into an unprecedented international phenomenon.
 &HT;    As far as Sony is concerned, CoCo is on deck. They've put the
full weight of their promotional engine behind ``Just No Other
Way,'' and the album is already generating positive buzz. Six weeks
after its debut in October, it went gold in Korea and platinum in
Singapore. In December, it reached No. 4 on Billboard magazine's
new ``Breaking Artist'' chart.
 &HT;    Lee is quick to acknowledge the power of her Asian fan base:
``People there are very supportive; they see that I'm going to be
the first Asian to make this big crossover,'' she says. ``It's
become like a family thing _ they're rooting for me.''
 &HT;    CoCo was ``discovered'' by Michael Caplan, senior vice president
of A&AMP;R for Epic Records at a Sony International Music conference
held in Miami. Although she was already a hugely successful artist
in Asia, it was the first time Caplan had ever seen Lee perform,
and she bowled him over.
 &HT;    ``Even though she sang all her songs in Mandarin, I was really
amazed by her voice,'' Caplan recalls. In no time, he'd made
arrangements to bring her over to the American side of the pond,
already brainstorming a plan to cross CoCo over.
 &HT;    Caplan paired Lee with the industry's top dance and R&AMP;B
producers, among them Rick Wake, Ray Contreras and the ``Godfather
of House'' Frankie Knuckles.
 &HT;    The result was an album that showcases Lee's ability to both
groove and cool it down _ alternating dance tracks and slow jams _
while giving her the urban credibility she would need to break into
America's more jaded market.
 &HT;    ``We'd heard that she was a huge star in Asia, so we really
didn't know what it would be like to work with her,'' says
Contreras, who cowrote and coproduced ``Do You Want My Love.''
 &HT;    Contreras and his partner, Jimmy Greco, had listened to the only
other English-language album Lee has recorded, primarily consisting
of cover songs. They knew she could sing pop.
 &HT;    ``The question was, could she sing R&AMP;B?'' Contreras says. ``This
genre has a lot of improvisational singing.'' After a pause, he
adds: ``And she totally has the flavor.''
 &HT;    High praise for a young woman who never intended to be a singer
in the first place. In fact, Lee's original career goal was to
become a doctor like her mother, and she says it's still in her
game plan.
 &HT;    Born in Hong Kong, Lee emigrated with her family to San
Francisco at the age of 10, where she effortlessly mustered up the
academic chops needed to pursue her medical dreams. She graduated
fifth grade with top honors, despite having only been in the United
States for a year. She was nominated class president three years in
a row.
 &HT;    By the time she was a senior, she'd won the titles of Miss
Teen-age Chinatown and Winter Ball Princess. After graduating high
school with distinction, Lee was prepared to attend the University
of California at Irvine to pursue pre-med studies.
 &HT;    What happened next was a textbook example of overnight success.
In the summer of 1994, Lee, then 18, vacationed with her family in
Hong Kong. On a whim, her mother entered her in a singing contest,
which happened to be the Hong Kong equivalent of ``Star Search'' _
a launch pad for aspiring entertainers.
 &HT;    At high school singing gigs and weekend outings to karaoke
clubs, Lee was capable of belting out songs from her favorite
childhood artists, such as George Michael, Mary J. Blige and Mariah
Carey. But she'd never formally trained to be a singer, nor had any
singing aspirations.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `No way can I make it,''' Lee recalls. ``I had the
attitude that I just wanted to sing. I wasn't there to win.''
 &HT;    She didn't. She took second place instead, crooning Whitney
Houston's ``Saving All My Love.'' The following day, a Chinese
record label called to sign her up. The first-generation parents
who had encouraged Lee and her two sisters to ``study and get good
grades'' suddenly about-faced, advising the baby of the family to
pursue a singing career.
 &HT;    These days, Lee's mother, whom she says is her ``biggest fan,''
travels with her, acting as her advisor, critic and, of course,
personal physician. ``My mom flies with me all over the place and
takes care of me,'' Lee says.
 &HT;    It's a lot of responsibility for a girl in her early 20s. ``I
try not to think about all that,'' she says carefully. ``When you
start thinking about the pressure, that's when you start messing up
and you go off focus. Right now, it's all good.''
 &HT;    Still, she does concede that she's begun shattering some
misperceptions already.
 &HT;    ``There's always been something of a stereotype that when Asians
sing in English, there's an accent,'' she says. ``When I walk into
that studio, I want everyone to feel that even though I'm Asian,
Coco's got a voice.''

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Recently, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass in St. Peter's
Basilica in Rome. In an unprecedented gesture he bowed his head and
said, ``We forgive ... and we humbly ask for forgiveness.''
 &HT;    His sweeping papal apology covered approximately 2,000 years of
sin and wrongdoing. He bravely acknowledged Roman Catholic sins
``committed by some of our brothers,'' which included religious
intolerance toward Jews, ``rejection and exclusion'' of women and
misdeeds committed against the poor, immigrants and indigenous
people.
 &HT;    It was an extraordinary and timely admission, but there was one
gaping omission: an apology to lesbians and gays.
 &HT;    I attended a local reflection of the Pope's pardon in Boston's
Cathedral of the Holy Cross. The evening's service were offered in
the spirit of reconciliation. Cardinal Law of Boston expressed
remorse for the shortcomings of Catholics in the Archdiocese of
Boston since 1808.
 &HT;    ``Now is the acceptable time,'' he said. ``The church should be
a sign of unity, of hope, of justice and of love.''
 &HT;    Law referred to the discrimination Catholics have suffered. ``We
ourselves have suffered as a community of faith the effects of
discrimination and prejudice. All the greater should be our
sorrow.''
 &HT;    Law openly spoke of ``intolerable situations,'' naming ``the
obvious cases of sexual abuse, which have seared us all.''
 &HT;    Calling on all Catholics to abandon exclusivity, he acknowledged
the presence of Orthodox Christians at the service, referring to
them as our ``beloved brothers and sisters with whom we are not yet
in full communion.''
 &HT;    His litany of acknowledgment continued: For ``our revered Jewish
brothers and sisters with whom we share the memory of
discrimination and persecution ... For our Islamic friends with
whom we share the memory of the crusades ... For brothers and
sisters from many racial, ethnic and national backgrounds.''
 &HT;    For everyone but gay and lesbian Catholics, his brothers and
sisters in Christ.
 &HT;    His jarring omission disheartened me _ a faithful gay Catholic.
 &HT;    A few blocks away stands the Jesuit Urban Center where hundreds
of gay Catholics worship each week. Nearby, another inclusive Roman
Catholic community confirms lesbian and gay men members of their
congregation. But these Catholics must hold their liturgical
celebration in an Episcopal church. They were banned from Catholic
church property years ago.
 &HT;    Many lesbian and gay Catholics attend mass in parishes
throughout the Archdiocese of Boston _ and all across America. Yet,
in a prayer service of reconciliation, our spiritual leader
bypassed an opportunity to express sorrow and seek pardon for the
ways in which gays remain the brunt of _ to use the cardinal's own
language _ ``harsh words, unjust treatment, prejudice and
discrimination.''
 &HT;    Out west, however, things were different.
 &HT;    In Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony's apology included the gay
and lesbian community.
 &HT;    ``I ask pardon of our Catholic homosexual and lesbian members
when the Church has appeared to be non-supportive of their
struggles or of falling into homophobia,'' he wrote in a Lenten
message to his archdiocese, dated March 6. ``The Archdiocese has
tried to make amends by establishing a special outreach ministry to
our homosexual and lesbian brothers and sisters, by including them
fully in the life of our parishes and by being attentive to
protecting their civil rights.''
 &HT;    Mahony instituted the ``Ministry with Lesbian and Gay
Catholics,'' which operates from his archdiocesan offices. In his
archdiocese, inattentiveness and homophobia have given way to
acknowledgment and redress.
 &HT;    Now is the acceptable time for gays in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Why not the Archdiocese of Boston? And the other dioceses and
parishes throughout the United States?
 &HT;    When will all God's children be embraced?

CARL WARE'S ASCENSION TO LEADERSHIP AT COKE

 By ERNEST HOLSENDOLPH  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Carl Ware, a veteran executive at the Coca-Cola Co., had gained
almost legendary stature in the corridors of the world's leading
marketing company. Though he is the first African-American to
become so prominent at the company, his accomplishments transcend
race.
 &HT;    He was the man who bailed the company out at crucial times, such
as in the early 1980s, when the company was challenged by Black
leaders for not providing more opportunities for African-Americans.
Later in the decade, he persuaded Coke and other American
industries to take on antiapartheid leadership.
 &HT;    Last year, when the company was hit by an embarrassing
discrimination lawsuit, Ware, who had urged the company previously
that it needed to do more to promote minorities in the supervisory
ranks, became co-chair of a new advisory committee on diversity.
 &HT;    Through his activities and his standing, Coca-Cola was able to
be one of the favored industries on the agenda of the young Mandela
administration, resulting in significant business advantages in
Southern Africa. Ware, personally, as president of the Africa
operation, was able to establish a model way of doing business on
the continent _ by including Africans in the operation of the
business.
 &HT;    With all of this background, who would have expected that Carl
Ware, of all people, would have been demoted, in effect, last year
by M. Douglas Nester _ and at a time when the company needed to
work on its image? Yet, that's what happened when Ivester, Coke
chairman and chief executive officer, called Ware in and said he
would no longer be reporting directly to the chairman as before.
 &HT;    Ware announced he would retire, moving down to his Coweta
County, Ga., farm where he grew up, to start a new life of writing
and lecturing. Publicly reported to be worth more than $15 million
in Coke stock, Ware didn't really need the aggravation. Just weeks
afterward, however, the tables were turned. Nester got the gate,
when the Coke board of directors stunned the global business
community with the announcement that Australian-born Douglas Daft
would become the next chief executive. Within hours after his
elevation, Daft knocked on Ware's door and sat down with his fellow
group president.
 &HT;    He sought Ware's thoughts and ideas about new directions for the
company, and he then invited Ware to stay on board to help launch
the new administration. Ware, promoted from group president to
executive vice president, now sits on the powerful six-member Coke
executive committee, which guides the company's major decisions.
 &HT;    He will oversee global communications, corporate external
affairs, governmental relations and corporate services. Ware
assumes his new role at a time en the company is trying to put
behind it a nightmare year of public relations embarrassments,
regulatory challenges, an equal employment lawsuit, stagnant sales,
and a long slide in the company stock price _ which undoubtedly
played a role in the company's ouster of Nester.
 &HT;    In his new role, Ware is challenged to formulate and carry out
policies that can begin to turn around the tarnished Coke image,
and its frayed relationships with customers and communities. He is
also charged with the task of revitalizing employee morale.
 &HT;    It is decidedly bigger than a public relations job, and much
bigger than the mere improvement of Black opportunity in the Coke
world.
 &HT;    ``My principal job is to see that our company is welcome
everywhere around the world, and out of all the things I do, that
is my primary, principal task,'' Ware says. ``We simply must
improve relations with everybody. ``I also hope to make Coca-Cola a
place where employees find this to be a more pleasing place to
work.''
 &HT;    Ware, who came to Coca-Cola 26 years ago from his position as
president of the Atlanta City Council, is an old hand at government
relations. But much more will be required of him in his new role,
and on a grander world stage.
 &HT;    Among his major tasks, Ware must be in touch with governments in
more than 200 countries where the company does business. Among his
challenges, he is to make sure the company no longer gets
blindsided _ as it was last year, when a product scare in Belgium
stirred fears across Europe that the company fiercely fought to
allay. Coke products bottled in Belgium were pulled from store
shelves in several countries after scores of consumers became ill.
 &HT;    Experts like Frank Mankiewicz, vice chairman of Hill &AMP; Knowlton,
say Ware appears to have the power and position to carry out his
role. Says Mankiewicz: ``I think he can make a difference _ he has
the keys.''

Indian students faced while trying to earn their degrees _ and

 By TIM GIAGO 
 &HT;    URBANA, Ill. _ Life for the handful of American Indians living
in the college town of Urbana, Ill., was pretty quiet in 1988 B.C.
Yes, 1988 B.C. _ Before Charlene.
 &HT;    Charlene Teters of the Spokane tribe arrived on campus in 1988
along with Marcus Amerman, a Choctaw, and Norman Akers, an Osage,
as part of a recruiting program by the University of Illinois to
bring Indian students into the arts program.
 &HT;    When the three Indian students arrived on campus, they strolled
the grounds looking for the Indian community. They asked about
Indian student organizations and Indian studies departments. There
were none.
 &HT;    They soon discovered that they made up the Native community.
According to Charlene, ``We stuck together like glue because we
soon began to feel out of place, even unwelcome.''
 &HT;    This uncertainty was brought about in part because of the images
of Indians they saw on and off the campus. They saw caricatures of
Indians on T-shirts, cars, store fronts, parking lots and hotel
lobbies.
 &HT;    They wondered what this was all about. Soon enough, they
discovered it was about the school's mascot _ a white, middle-class
boy dressed up in Indian attire. His name is Chief Illiniwek. The
university's sports and social life seemed to revolve around this
hideous impostor.
 &HT;    Over time, the Indian students observed fraternities and
sororities sponsor events like the Miss Illini Squaw Contest.
 &HT;    ``The neon sign at a local bar featured a dumb caricature of a
cartoon Indian with buck teeth and a bent feather, crosses for
eyes, falling down drunk over and over again,'' Charlene recalled.
``This is also the bar at which fraternity brothers donned their
colored paper headdresses and went to get drunk.''
 &HT;    The peaceful town of Urbana was permeated with such demeaning
caricatures of Indians. Any local event brought out the local
artist's interpretations of cartoon Indians _ usually of drunken,
fat and ugly Indian characters. These hideous pieces of art
decorated T-shirts, cars, businesses, sidewalks and any post or
pole that would hold a poster.
 &HT;    Marcus was the first to explode. When he saw Chief Illiniwek
used as a local celebrity to cut ribbons at mall openings and new
businesses or to greet visiting celebrities, he became incensed. He
wrote a letter to the local student newspaper: ``Perhaps the
inhumane treatment and near genocide of my people hasn't satisfied
your need to humiliate and destroy the image of the original
inhabitants of this country. It makes me wonder how members of
other ethnic and racial groups would react to an environment
saturated with derogatory caricatures of their people,'' he wrote.
 &HT;    Marcus became an immediate pariah. He was threatened and
harassed to such an extent that he left school in the middle of the
night without so much as a goodbye to Charlene and Norman.
 &HT;    One of the professors who helped recruit the three Indian
students broke the news to Charlene and Norman by singing, ``One
little, two little, three little Indians ... two little Indians are
left.''
 &HT;    ``We were crushed by the sheer insensitivity of what was
happening around us _ especially when we were told to keep our
mouths shut and get our degrees and then get out of here,''
Charlene said.
 &HT;    It wasn't in the nature of this Spokane Indian woman to remain
silent. Her children's self-esteem had been badly damaged by the
things they saw at basketball and football games. The constant
demeaning of themselves as Indians began to take its toll.
 &HT;    One day when Chief Illiniwek was giving a talk, Charlene showed
up and challenged him. The Daily Illini reported, ``A Native Indian
graduate student went on the warpath Wednesday,'' and other
newspapers and radio stations soon picked up on it, often making
Teters the butt of jokes.
 &HT;    Charlene soon became a target just as Marcus. Her phone rang off
the hook with obscene and threatening calls. She and her children
were harassed by the local police. Her school-age children became
the targets of other students.
 &HT;    Charlene couldn't go anywhere in this once peaceful town without
drawing the stares and the ire of the local population. She was so
discouraged she was ready to quit school.
 &HT;    She called me one day and we had a long talk because I had been
writing about the use of Indians as mascots for several years. She
also called Ken Sterns of the American Jewish Committee. We both
told her the same thing: ``Charlene, if you quit, they win.''
 &HT;    She stayed and fought. Soon banners began to appear around
campus on walls and vans. ``Keep the Chief. Shoot the Indians.''
Since there were only two Indians left on campus, they knew exactly
who the signs intended to disparage.
 &HT;    Despite her continued efforts, on Oct. 11, 1990, the Board of
Trustees voted to keep the Chief as their mascot.
 &HT;    Charlene graduated and left the campus in August of 1991.
 &HT;    Was her fight worth it? Drive around Urbana today at homecoming
and you no longer see the hideous displays that demeaned the Indian
people. You no longer see the Chief paraded around like some sort
of god. Her selfless efforts did bring about some degree of
sensitivity that did not exist, BC _ Before Charlene.
 &HT;    But as Charlene said this week, ``The battle is far from over.''

 By JULIA WANG  
 &HT;    CoCo Lee looks to be the happiest person seated in the lobby of
the Four Seasons Hotel in New York. After two months of touring in
Asia _ leapfrogging from Hong Kong to the Philippines, eight
countries in all _ she has finally returned to the states, which
explains her beaming expression. After all, for this globetrotting
California girl, the United States means home.
 &HT;    ``But I'm not really home yet,'' the 23-year-old says, a broad
grin spreading across her pixie face. ``My home is L.A. I miss my
bed so much.''
 &HT;    It's the eve of the stateside premiere of her first American
album, ``Just No Other Way.'' It took nine months to produce,
leading Lee to lovingly compare the making of the album to ``having
a baby.''
 &HT;    ``This album is the greatest challenge of my life,'' she says.
``My greatest challenge and my greatest achievement.''
 &HT;    Even though she has just come off a plane from Asia, the
Chinese-American songstress is already preparing to embark on
another whirlwind concert tour. That is, after she spends a few
weeks in her comfortable bed.
 &HT;    A skillfully crafted collection of urban beats, R&AMP;B ballads, and
soul-sister turns, ``Just No Other Way'' is Lee's debut on the Epic
550 label, and the first release in her unprecedented long-term
contract with Sony Music.
 &HT;    The number of Asian and Asian-American artists who've had
breakthrough pop careers in the United States can be counted on
exactly, well ... no fingers. But Sony is convinced that CoCo is
different _ that, given her undeniable beauty and talent, she'll be
able to convert her considerable success in Asia to blockbuster
stardom in America.
 &HT;    In January, radio stations across the country debuted the
high-energy dance track, ``Do You Want My Love,'' the first of
``Just No Other Way's'' 12 tracks. MTV has added the sleek video _
which puts Lee's toned torso front and center _ to its volume
rotation. And if the song's title sounds similar to the breakout
hit of another ``ethnic crossover'' diva _ Jennifer Lopez's ``If
You Want My Love'' _ maybe that isn't a coincidence. After all,
Sony is the music-industry superpower that successfully turned a
trinity of Latin talents _ Lopez, Marc Anthony and, yes, Ricky
Martin'' _ into an unprecedented international phenomenon.
 &HT;    As far as Sony is concerned, CoCo is on deck. They've put the
full weight of their promotional engine behind ``Just No Other
Way,'' and the album is already generating positive buzz. Six weeks
after its debut in October, it went gold in Korea and platinum in
Singapore. In December, it reached No. 4 on Billboard magazine's
new ``Breaking Artist'' chart.
 &HT;    Lee is quick to acknowledge the power of her Asian fan base:
``People there are very supportive; they see that I'm going to be
the first Asian to make this big crossover,'' she says. ``It's
become like a family thing _ they're rooting for me.''
 &HT;    CoCo was ``discovered'' by Michael Caplan, senior vice president
of A&AMP;R for Epic Records at a Sony International Music conference
held in Miami. Although she was already a hugely successful artist
in Asia, it was the first time Caplan had ever seen Lee perform,
and she bowled him over.
 &HT;    ``Even though she sang all her songs in Mandarin, I was really
amazed by her voice,'' Caplan recalls. In no time, he'd made
arrangements to bring her over to the American side of the pond,
already brainstorming a plan to cross CoCo over.
 &HT;    Caplan paired Lee with the industry's top dance and R&AMP;B
producers, among them Rick Wake, Ray Contreras and the ``Godfather
of House'' Frankie Knuckles.
 &HT;    The result was an album that showcases Lee's ability to both
groove and cool it down _ alternating dance tracks and slow jams _
while giving her the urban credibility she would need to break into
America's more jaded market.
 &HT;    ``We'd heard that she was a huge star in Asia, so we really
didn't know what it would be like to work with her,'' says
Contreras, who cowrote and coproduced ``Do You Want My Love.''
 &HT;    Contreras and his partner, Jimmy Greco, had listened to the only
other English-language album Lee has recorded, primarily consisting
of cover songs. They knew she could sing pop.
 &HT;    ``The question was, could she sing R&AMP;B?'' Contreras says. ``This
genre has a lot of improvisational singing.'' After a pause, he
adds: ``And she totally has the flavor.''
 &HT;    High praise for a young woman who never intended to be a singer
in the first place. In fact, Lee's original career goal was to
become a doctor like her mother, and she says it's still in her
game plan.
 &HT;    Born in Hong Kong, Lee emigrated with her family to San
Francisco at the age of 10, where she effortlessly mustered up the
academic chops needed to pursue her medical dreams. She graduated
fifth grade with top honors, despite having only been in the United
States for a year. She was nominated class president three years in
a row.
 &HT;    By the time she was a senior, she'd won the titles of Miss
Teen-age Chinatown and Winter Ball Princess. After graduating high
school with distinction, Lee was prepared to attend the University
of California at Irvine to pursue pre-med studies.
 &HT;    What happened next was a textbook example of overnight success.
In the summer of 1994, Lee, then 18, vacationed with her family in
Hong Kong. On a whim, her mother entered her in a singing contest,
which happened to be the Hong Kong equivalent of ``Star Search'' _
a launch pad for aspiring entertainers.
 &HT;    At high school singing gigs and weekend outings to karaoke
clubs, Lee was capable of belting out songs from her favorite
childhood artists, such as George Michael, Mary J. Blige and Mariah
Carey. But she'd never formally trained to be a singer, nor had any
singing aspirations.
 &HT;    ``I thought, `No way can I make it,''' Lee recalls. ``I had the
attitude that I just wanted to sing. I wasn't there to win.''
 &HT;    She didn't. She took second place instead, crooning Whitney
Houston's ``Saving All My Love.'' The following day, a Chinese
record label called to sign her up. The first-generation parents
who had encouraged Lee and her two sisters to ``study and get good
grades'' suddenly about-faced, advising the baby of the family to
pursue a singing career.
 &HT;    These days, Lee's mother, whom she says is her ``biggest fan,''
travels with her, acting as her advisor, critic and, of course,
personal physician. ``My mom flies with me all over the place and
takes care of me,'' Lee says.
 &HT;    It's a lot of responsibility for a girl in her early 20s. ``I
try not to think about all that,'' she says carefully. ``When you
start thinking about the pressure, that's when you start messing up
and you go off focus. Right now, it's all good.''
 &HT;    Still, she does concede that she's begun shattering some
misperceptions already.
 &HT;    ``There's always been something of a stereotype that when Asians
sing in English, there's an accent,'' she says. ``When I walk into
that studio, I want everyone to feel that even though I'm Asian,
Coco's got a voice.''

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Recently, Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass in St. Peter's
Basilica in Rome. In an unprecedented gesture he bowed his head and
said, ``We forgive ... and we humbly ask for forgiveness.''
 &HT;    His sweeping papal apology covered approximately 2,000 years of
sin and wrongdoing. He bravely acknowledged Roman Catholic sins
``committed by some of our brothers,'' which included religious
intolerance toward Jews, ``rejection and exclusion'' of women and
misdeeds committed against the poor, immigrants and indigenous
people.
 &HT;    It was an extraordinary and timely admission, but there was one
gaping omission: an apology to lesbians and gays.
 &HT;    I attended a local reflection of the Pope's pardon in Boston's
Cathedral of the Holy Cross. The evening's service were offered in
the spirit of reconciliation. Cardinal Law of Boston expressed
remorse for the shortcomings of Catholics in the Archdiocese of
Boston since 1808.
 &HT;    ``Now is the acceptable time,'' he said. ``The church should be
a sign of unity, of hope, of justice and of love.''
 &HT;    Law referred to the discrimination Catholics have suffered. ``We
ourselves have suffered as a community of faith the effects of
discrimination and prejudice. All the greater should be our
sorrow.''
 &HT;    Law openly spoke of ``intolerable situations,'' naming ``the
obvious cases of sexual abuse, which have seared us all.''
 &HT;    Calling on all Catholics to abandon exclusivity, he acknowledged
the presence of Orthodox Christians at the service, referring to
them as our ``beloved brothers and sisters with whom we are not yet
in full communion.''
 &HT;    His litany of acknowledgment continued: For ``our revered Jewish
brothers and sisters with whom we share the memory of
discrimination and persecution ... For our Islamic friends with
whom we share the memory of the crusades ... For brothers and
sisters from many racial, ethnic and national backgrounds.''
 &HT;    For everyone but gay and lesbian Catholics, his brothers and
sisters in Christ.
 &HT;    His jarring omission disheartened me _ a faithful gay Catholic.
 &HT;    A few blocks away stands the Jesuit Urban Center where hundreds
of gay Catholics worship each week. Nearby, another inclusive Roman
Catholic community confirms lesbian and gay men members of their
congregation. But these Catholics must hold their liturgical
celebration in an Episcopal church. They were banned from Catholic
church property years ago.
 &HT;    Many lesbian and gay Catholics attend mass in parishes
throughout the Archdiocese of Boston _ and all across America. Yet,
in a prayer service of reconciliation, our spiritual leader
bypassed an opportunity to express sorrow and seek pardon for the
ways in which gays remain the brunt of _ to use the cardinal's own
language _ ``harsh words, unjust treatment, prejudice and
discrimination.''
 &HT;    Out west, however, things were different.
 &HT;    In Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony's apology included the gay
and lesbian community.
 &HT;    ``I ask pardon of our Catholic homosexual and lesbian members
when the Church has appeared to be non-supportive of their
struggles or of falling into homophobia,'' he wrote in a Lenten
message to his archdiocese, dated March 6. ``The Archdiocese has
tried to make amends by establishing a special outreach ministry to
our homosexual and lesbian brothers and sisters, by including them
fully in the life of our parishes and by being attentive to
protecting their civil rights.''
 &HT;    Mahony instituted the ``Ministry with Lesbian and Gay
Catholics,'' which operates from his archdiocesan offices. In his
archdiocese, inattentiveness and homophobia have given way to
acknowledgment and redress.
 &HT;    Now is the acceptable time for gays in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Why not the Archdiocese of Boston? And the other dioceses and
parishes throughout the United States?
 &HT;    When will all God's children be embraced?

CARL WARE'S ASCENSION TO LEADERSHIP AT COKE

 By ERNEST HOLSENDOLPH  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Carl Ware, a veteran executive at the Coca-Cola Co., had gained
almost legendary stature in the corridors of the world's leading
marketing company. Though he is the first African-American to
become so prominent at the company, his accomplishments transcend
race.
 &HT;    He was the man who bailed the company out at crucial times, such
as in the early 1980s, when the company was challenged by Black
leaders for not providing more opportunities for African-Americans.
Later in the decade, he persuaded Coke and other American
industries to take on antiapartheid leadership.
 &HT;    Last year, when the company was hit by an embarrassing
discrimination lawsuit, Ware, who had urged the company previously
that it needed to do more to promote minorities in the supervisory
ranks, became co-chair of a new advisory committee on diversity.
 &HT;    Through his activities and his standing, Coca-Cola was able to
be one of the favored industries on the agenda of the young Mandela
administration, resulting in significant business advantages in
Southern Africa. Ware, personally, as president of the Africa
operation, was able to establish a model way of doing business on
the continent _ by including Africans in the operation of the
business.
 &HT;    With all of this background, who would have expected that Carl
Ware, of all people, would have been demoted, in effect, last year
by M. Douglas Nester _ and at a time when the company needed to
work on its image? Yet, that's what happened when Ivester, Coke
chairman and chief executive officer, called Ware in and said he
would no longer be reporting directly to the chairman as before.
 &HT;    Ware announced he would retire, moving down to his Coweta
County, Ga., farm where he grew up, to start a new life of writing
and lecturing. Publicly reported to be worth more than $15 million
in Coke stock, Ware didn't really need the aggravation. Just weeks
afterward, however, the tables were turned. Nester got the gate,
when the Coke board of directors stunned the global business
community with the announcement that Australian-born Douglas Daft
would become the next chief executive. Within hours after his
elevation, Daft knocked on Ware's door and sat down with his fellow
group president.
 &HT;    He sought Ware's thoughts and ideas about new directions for the
company, and he then invited Ware to stay on board to help launch
the new administration. Ware, promoted from group president to
executive vice president, now sits on the powerful six-member Coke
executive committee, which guides the company's major decisions.
 &HT;    He will oversee global communications, corporate external
affairs, governmental relations and corporate services. Ware
assumes his new role at a time en the company is trying to put
behind it a nightmare year of public relations embarrassments,
regulatory challenges, an equal employment lawsuit, stagnant sales,
and a long slide in the company stock price _ which undoubtedly
played a role in the company's ouster of Nester.
 &HT;    In his new role, Ware is challenged to formulate and carry out
policies that can begin to turn around the tarnished Coke image,
and its frayed relationships with customers and communities. He is
also charged with the task of revitalizing employee morale.
 &HT;    It is decidedly bigger than a public relations job, and much
bigger than the mere improvement of Black opportunity in the Coke
world.
 &HT;    ``My principal job is to see that our company is welcome
everywhere around the world, and out of all the things I do, that
is my primary, principal task,'' Ware says. ``We simply must
improve relations with everybody. ``I also hope to make Coca-Cola a
place where employees find this to be a more pleasing place to
work.''
 &HT;    Ware, who came to Coca-Cola 26 years ago from his position as
president of the Atlanta City Council, is an old hand at government
relations. But much more will be required of him in his new role,
and on a grander world stage.
 &HT;    Among his major tasks, Ware must be in touch with governments in
more than 200 countries where the company does business. Among his
challenges, he is to make sure the company no longer gets
blindsided _ as it was last year, when a product scare in Belgium
stirred fears across Europe that the company fiercely fought to
allay. Coke products bottled in Belgium were pulled from store
shelves in several countries after scores of consumers became ill.
 &HT;    Experts like Frank Mankiewicz, vice chairman of Hill &AMP; Knowlton,
say Ware appears to have the power and position to carry out his
role. Says Mankiewicz: ``I think he can make a difference _ he has
the keys.''

 &HT;    URBANA, Ill. _ Life for the handful of American Indians living
in the college town of Urbana, Ill., was pretty quiet in 1988 B.C.
Yes, 1988 B.C. _ Before Charlene.
 &HT;    Charlene Teters of the Spokane tribe arrived on campus in 1988
along with Marcus Amerman, a Choctaw, and Norman Akers, an Osage,
as part of a recruiting program by the University of Illinois to
bring Indian students into the arts program.
 &HT;    When the three Indian students arrived on campus, they strolled
the grounds looking for the Indian community. They asked about
Indian student organizations and Indian studies departments. There
were none.
 &HT;    They soon discovered that they made up the Native community.
According to Charlene, ``We stuck together like glue because we
soon began to feel out of place, even unwelcome.''
 &HT;    This uncertainty was brought about in part because of the images
of Indians they saw on and off the campus. They saw caricatures of
Indians on T-shirts, cars, store fronts, parking lots and hotel
lobbies.
 &HT;    They wondered what this was all about. Soon enough, they
discovered it was about the school's mascot _ a white, middle-class
boy dressed up in Indian attire. His name is Chief Illiniwek. The
university's sports and social life seemed to revolve around this
hideous impostor.
 &HT;    Over time, the Indian students observed fraternities and
sororities sponsor events like the Miss Illini Squaw Contest.
 &HT;    ``The neon sign at a local bar featured a dumb caricature of a
cartoon Indian with buck teeth and a bent feather, crosses for
eyes, falling down drunk over and over again,'' Charlene recalled.
``This is also the bar at which fraternity brothers donned their
colored paper headdresses and went to get drunk.''
 &HT;    The peaceful town of Urbana was permeated with such demeaning
caricatures of Indians. Any local event brought out the local
artist's interpretations of cartoon Indians _ usually of drunken,
fat and ugly Indian characters. These hideous pieces of art
decorated T-shirts, cars, businesses, sidewalks and any post or
pole that would hold a poster.
 &HT;    Marcus was the first to explode. When he saw Chief Illiniwek
used as a local celebrity to cut ribbons at mall openings and new
businesses or to greet visiting celebrities, he became incensed. He
wrote a letter to the local student newspaper: ``Perhaps the
inhumane treatment and near genocide of my people hasn't satisfied
your need to humiliate and destroy the image of the original
inhabitants of this country. It makes me wonder how members of
other ethnic and racial groups would react to an environment
saturated with derogatory caricatures of their people,'' he wrote.
 &HT;    Marcus became an immediate pariah. He was threatened and
harassed to such an extent that he left school in the middle of the
night without so much as a goodbye to Charlene and Norman.
 &HT;    One of the professors who helped recruit the three Indian
students broke the news to Charlene and Norman by singing, ``One
little, two little, three little Indians ... two little Indians are
left.''
 &HT;    ``We were crushed by the sheer insensitivity of what was
happening around us _ especially when we were told to keep our
mouths shut and get our degrees and then get out of here,''
Charlene said.
 &HT;    It wasn't in the nature of this Spokane Indian woman to remain
silent. Her children's self-esteem had been badly damaged by the
things they saw at basketball and football games. The constant
demeaning of themselves as Indians began to take its toll.
 &HT;    One day when Chief Illiniwek was giving a talk, Charlene showed
up and challenged him. The Daily Illini reported, ``A Native Indian
graduate student went on the warpath Wednesday,'' and other
newspapers and radio stations soon picked up on it, often making
Teters the butt of jokes.
 &HT;    Charlene soon became a target just as Marcus. Her phone rang off
the hook with obscene and threatening calls. She and her children
were harassed by the local police. Her school-age children became
the targets of other students.
 &HT;    Charlene couldn't go anywhere in this once peaceful town without
drawing the stares and the ire of the local population. She was so
discouraged she was ready to quit school.
 &HT;    She called me one day and we had a long talk because I had been
writing about the use of Indians as mascots for several years. She
also called Ken Sterns of the American Jewish Committee. We both
told her the same thing: ``Charlene, if you quit, they win.''
 &HT;    She stayed and fought. Soon banners began to appear around
campus on walls and vans. ``Keep the Chief. Shoot the Indians.''
Since there were only two Indians left on campus, they knew exactly
who the signs intended to disparage.
 &HT;    Despite her continued efforts, on Oct. 11, 1990, the Board of
Trustees voted to keep the Chief as their mascot.
 &HT;    Charlene graduated and left the campus in August of 1991.
 &HT;    Was her fight worth it? Drive around Urbana today at homecoming
and you no longer see the hideous displays that demeaned the Indian
people. You no longer see the Chief paraded around like some sort
of god. Her selfless efforts did bring about some degree of
sensitivity that did not exist, BC _ Before Charlene.
 &HT;    But as Charlene said this week, ``The battle is far from over.''

`RETURN' ENGAGEMENT: MINNIE DRIVER TAKES A CHANCE ON ROMANCE

 (Includes a color slide of Minnie Driver with David Duchovny in a
scene from ``Return to Me.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Minnie Driver is multitasking.
 &HT;    Standing near a window at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel,
Driver sips from a bottle of water, takes a drag on a cigarette,
sings Christina Aguilera's hit song ``Genie in a Bottle'' and sways
to the music in her head. By the time she turns around to greet a
visitor, her face is just a bit flushed with embarrassment.
 &HT;    ``I love `Genie in a Bottle,''' she says. ``The song is so
catchy. What was that other song I liked? Oh, it was `I Think We're
Alone Now.' But I have a feeling Christina Aguilera's career will
last longer than Tiffany's.''
 &HT;    Driver smiles, strides over to a couch and settles in to talk
about her own career _ one that will probably last longer than
either Aguilera's or Tiffany's. Since winning over audiences with
her touching performance in ``Circle of Friends'' (1995), the
British actress has put together a string of movies that includes
``Big Night'' (1996), ``Sleepers'' (1996), ``Grosse Pointe Blank''
(1997), ``Good Will Hunting'' (1997), ``The Governess'' (1998) and
``An Ideal Husband'' (1999).
 &HT;    Beyond her films, Driver has received unwanted attention for her
personal affairs. She very publicly dated her ``Good Will Hunting''
co-star Matt Damon, a relationship that ended in an
even-more-public breakup. Now she's been linked with actor Josh
Brolin, son of James Brolin, but the mere mention of that
relationship or of Josh Brolin's stepmother, Barbra Streisand, has
been known to cause Driver to bolt.
 &HT;    ``It's nobody's business,'' the actress says simply.
 &HT;    The business at hand, then, is ``Return to Me.'' Due for
nationwide release on April 7, ``Return to Me'' casts Driver as
Grace, a gravely ill young woman who receives a new heart from
accident victim Elizabeth Rueland (Joely Richardson).
 &HT;    Time passes, and Grace and Elizabeth's widower husband, Bob
(David Duchovny), struggle to get on with their lives. And, as one
might expect of a romantic comedy/drama, Grace and Bob ultimately
find each other, with a little help from four crotchety old men
(Carroll O'Connor as her grandfather, Robert Loggia as her uncle
and Eddie Jones and William Bronder as cantankerous family
friends).
 &HT;    Schmaltzy as that may sound, the film works magic. Audiences are
laughing and crying in all the right spots, and Driver credits
director/co-writer Bonnie Hunt _ who also plays Grace's best friend
_ with constructing a film that has feel-good sleeper written all
over it.
 &HT;    And, she says, it's refreshingly free of schmaltz.
 &HT;    ``It's very easy to play that card when you're doing a romantic
comedy,'' says Driver, dressed casually in blue jeans and a denim
jacket. ``Fortunately, Bonnie is a very strong director with a very
good sense of humor and an edge.
 &HT;    ``I'm bookended by so much humor, by the wonderful old guys, by
Bonnie's character, by Jim Belushi (as Hunt's lug of a husband) and
by this very sweet, wry relationship she has with David's
character,'' Driver says. ``It's very emotional, but it's very
honest.
 &HT;    ``Getting too sappy was a concern,'' she admits, ``but if you
base everything in truth you can play any cliche and give it a
veracity and newness. If it's based in truth, the audience will
suspend its disbelief and believe in what you're showing them.''
 &HT;    Driver didn't know ``X-Files'' star Duchovny before signing on
for ``Return to Me.'' On the set, however, the two hit it off.
 &HT;    ``He's so good, such a good actor,'' she says. ``He's been doing
the same part for seven years, and it's got to be an enormous bore
to be the same person for seven years. It must have been a great
release to be someone so much lighter.
 &HT;    ``He's really great, so charismatic on screen,'' she adds. ``He
has that old movie-star quality as an actor. As a person, he could
not be funnier and drier, or more articulate or more fun to hang
out with.''
 &HT;    Later this spring, Driver will turn up in two more films,
``Higher Love'' with Rufus Sewell and Nigel Hawthorne, and the
Sally Field-directed coming-of-age drama, ``Beautiful.''
``Beautiful'' is especially important to the actress, who not only
stars but also produced the film with her sister Kate via their
company, Two Drivers.
 &HT;    ``The producing has really been to create work for myself,''
Driver admits. ``I don't like waiting around for things to come to
me.
 &HT;    ``I've been fortunate to have the limitless talents of my
sister,'' she says. ``I don't love the day-to-day of producing, I
love to find material and develop it. Kate is a great dealmaker _
she knows the ins and outs of the business end of producing. So I'd
like to think we complement each other very well.''
 &HT;    One film produced by Two Drivers, namely ``Slow Burn,'' turned
out so horribly that, Driver says, it probably won't ever be
released. And that's despite the presence of herself, James Spader
and Mr. Unmentionable himself, Josh Brolin.
 &HT;    ``We laughed ourselves silly, because everything that could go
wrong did go wrong,'' Driver says with an ``oh, well'' shrug. ``It
was just one of those awful, hilarious filmmaking experiences of
which I think everybody has one.''
 &HT;    Driver can live with the occasional flop _ she survived the
waterlogged ``Hard Rain,'' right? And, she adds, she can handle
fame.
 &HT;    ``I'm fairly comfortable,'' she says. ``I'd be worried if I were
really comfortable. I think one should always be wary of fame _
it's complete ephemera. It's illusory, and not the whole truth at
all. Those photos are airbrushed, you know?
 &HT;    ``There are only a few areas in which you can really utilize
your celebrity,'' the actress adds. ``One is giving your name and
time to causes you feel passionate about, and the other is being
able to do the projects that interest you. I have enough leverage
at this point to guarantee financing on a small picture, or maybe a
bigger picture if I'm with someone else.''
 &HT;    Driver smiles and tugs on her ponytail.
 &HT;    ``Every single part I take will enforce who I am so much more
than my protesting my nobility as an actor or my disinterest in
celebrity,'' she says. ``My work will do all my talking for me. I
have all confidence in that.''
 &HT;    Driver figures that, if she hadn't pursued acting, she might
have gone on to college and tried to make her living as a writer,
perhaps as a novelist or magazine journalist. She chose acting,
however, and admits to no regrets.
 &HT;    ``I think anything you put your passion and your heart into,
that you respect and feel useful in, is noble,'' she says.
``Whatever you do for a living, if you love it and honor it in some
way, then you're in the right profession.
 &HT;    ``By that standard, I think I'm in the right profession for me
and that acting is a noble profession.''

LIVE WIRE: GEORGE CLOONEY DOES `FAIL SAFE' WITHOUT A NET 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a black-and-white slide of George Clooney in a scene from
``Fail Safe.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada before April 8. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's official: George Clooney has returned to television.
</P>
<P>
   But before viewers start picturing Doug Ross swaggering back
onto ``ER'' and setting up house with Nurse Hathaway and their
twins, the actor makes it clear that he's not returning to
television's most popular drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Clooney says affably. ``They haven't even asked me.''
</P>
<P>
   The project that brings Clooney back to the small screen is
``Fail Safe,'' a CBS television-movie remake of his
all-time-favorite film, the 1964 Cold War thriller starring Henry
Fonda, Larry Hagman and Walter Matthau. The remake will be
broadcast live _ and in black and white, no less _ on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, who has had a spotty record on the big screen, despite
the comparative success of his most recent films, ``Out of Sight''
(1998) and ``Three Kings'' (1999), says he came back to television
because it was the only way he could do ``Fail Safe,'' which he
felt driven to do.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the tense environment of the early Cold War, ``Fail
Safe'' traces the mounting tensions between the United States and
Russia after mechanical failures launch an atomic attack on Moscow,
cutting back and forth between American attempts to stop the
bombers and the president's frantic negotiations with the Soviet
premier to prevent World War III.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the movie a year or two ago, Clooney says, he was
struck by the idea that it was ``sort of made for live
television.'' A seed was planted, and before long Clooney had
convinced Walter Bernstein, who wrote the original, to pen an
updated script and had brought director Stephen Frears on board.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clooney stars as Col. Jack Grady, the bomber pilot
who, during routine maneuvers, is suddenly diverted toward Moscow
and ordered to drop the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   It's a meaty, dramatic role, all the more challenging because
Clooney has to pull it off while confined to his plane's tiny
cockpit for nearly every scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the trick of this is that the words play so well,
and the words are what do this,'' the actor says. ``We're telling a
great story here. It's really well written, so I don't think we'll
be focused on whether people are moving around or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney will be surrounded by a mostly male cast that includes
major big-screen names such as Harvey Keitel, Richard Dreyfuss,
James Cromwell, Don Cheadle, Sam Elliot, Hank Azaria and Brian
Dennehy.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mix is a notable small-screen name, Clooney's former
``ER'' castmate Noah Wyle, who will play the president's
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noah and I are good friends,'' Clooney says. ``We play
basketball together. And we'd been talking about it for a long time
_ I used to screen that movie over at my house all the time and
make people watch it, and Noah and I talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men are familiar with the dangers and the thrills of live
television, having worked on the much-hyped live ``ER'' episode two
years back. That broadcast resulted in a ratings bonanza, but
Clooney wasn't happy with the results, particular when he viewed it
again before setting to work on ``Fail Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't necessarily work,'' he says, shaking his head, ``but
it could. And the trick is to do it really right. And that means to
start from the very beginning, building the sets and shooting it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story line for that ``ER'' broadcast included a visiting
documentary-film crew who could be conveniently blamed when things
went wrong _ a precaution that won't be available in ``Fail Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're flying a little bit more without a net,'' Clooney says,
``but we've also prepared differently. With any luck at all we'll
be able to do it better, and hopefully we're learning from things
we've done along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Clooney who insisted that this new version of ``Fail
Safe,'' like the original, be broadcast in black and white _
``which isn't taboo, necessarily,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if ``Fail Safe'' is a success, Clooney would like to do
a regular series of live-broadcast movies, mostly remakes of dramas
from the black-and-white era of 1950s television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure would be nice to be able to get somebody to give us
the rights to `A Thousand Clowns' (1965),'' he adds. ``It would be
nice to get some of the old classics, too. Maybe some old `Twilight
Zones.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Clooney is bubbling over with ideas for future
television projects. About the only thing he isn't planning to do
is to return to ``ER'' _ despite persistent rumors to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' he says, ``I read I was going back for $52
million an episode _ which I'd like to go on the record as saying
I'd go back for $52 million an episode. I'm not an idiot!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been things that ballooned out of somebody making a
joke or something like that,'' he adds more seriously. ``I've never
talked to anyone about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he says, ``ER'' doesn't need his help, either for a
ratings bump or to add to the dramatic mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing is,'' Clooney says, ``they're not going, `Hey,
come on back' and trying to do a ratings thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juliana leaving will be a big enough story line, I think,'' he
adds. ``It's a big blow to that show when you lose Juliana
Margulies, much more so than losing myself. She's the real soul of
that show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show survives, though, because it's a good show and it's
smart writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Clooney admits, he has so much going on these days _
including prepping for his next film, a remake of the Rat Pack
movie ``Ocean's Eleven'' (1960), in which he's assuming the Frank
Sinatra role _ that he seldom has time to watch the new episodes of
``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   But he still sees his former castmates, mostly because he and
they have offices on the Warner Bros. lot _ but even that doesn't
get him itching for a return to his old stamping grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see my friends almost every day, because my office is right
next door to them,'' he says. ``But I don't have any regrets about
not trying to keep reinventing the character that I was playing
after five years. I was kind of running out of stuff, and it was
sort of limiting as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's probably best that I got out when I did, before I
started doing headstands and things to try and think of something
different to do.''
</P>

`GLORY' DAYS: JIMMY SMITS REVELS IN THE BIG SCREEN

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Jimmy Smits in a scene from ``Price of
Glory.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    The last we saw of Jimmy Smits, he and Bobby Simone were
checking out.
 &HT;    Smits was leaving his hit television series ``NYPD Blue,'' and
Simone was dying in a hospital bed, his heart finally giving out.
Truth to tell, while he talked a confident game at the time, Smits
now can admit that he had his share of doubts.
 &HT;    ``My final scene as Bobby Simone has a priest giving me the last
rites,'' the actor recalls. ``I insisted it (be) a real man of the
cloth, because I thought it would make it a little more realistic.
 &HT;    ``Quietly,'' he continues, ``I took the priest to the side and
said, `Listen, father, I've been in this bed for six weeks dying on
television. I'm going into the unknown after I leave the show.
Could you just give me a little blessing, please?'
 &HT;    ``It couldn't hurt,'' Smits says, laughing.
 &HT;    It may have helped, because since leaving the weekly grind of
series television, Smits has been in demand. He already has three
movies in the can, including the boxing drama ``Price of Glory,''
which will open on March 31. Then there's ``Million Dollar Hotel,''
starring Mel Gibson and due this summer, and ``Bless the Child,'' a
thriller co-starring Kim Basinger.
 &HT;    Not bad for a guy many fans think is dead.
 &HT;    ``Man, it's weird,'' Smits says. ``In airports, people still
come up and say, `Are you OK? Jimmy, are you really alive? We wept
when your heart transplant didn't work!'''
 &HT;    Smits laughs.
 &HT;    ``Once I had this older woman come up to me and say, `Jimmy, I
just love the way you die,''' he recalls. ``I said, `Ma'am, I cried
watching myself die, too.'''
 &HT;    The actor, who nowadays wears a tiny beard and, for a
Saturday-morning interview at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel,
dresses in expensive black slacks and a matching cashmere sweater,
understands how much ``NYPD Blue'' fans miss him, but he makes no
apologies for his departure.
 &HT;    ``Look, I fulfilled my commitment to the show,'' he says
matter-of-factly. ``And now I want to concentrate more on long-form
things.''
 &HT;    ``Long-form,'' of course, is code for ``movies.''
 &HT;    ``You have a 120-page movie script and you know you'll bust your
a-- and work really hard for three months,'' Smits says. ``And then
you move on to the next gypsy family and the next character. I like
the idea of moving on. That's why I got into this business _ I want
to show versatility.''
 &HT;    Smits shows that versatility as a tough father obsessed with
molding his three sons into champion boxers in ``Price of Glory,''
which has been dubbed a Latino ``Rocky'' _ much to Smits'
annoyance.
 &HT;    ``This film doesn't need labels,'' he says. ``It's a father-son
story, period. It's about people trying to win, and it's as
mainstream as any other movie.''
 &HT;    Smits loved the idea of playing against type.
 &HT;    ``This is not an idealistic, heroic guy,'' he says. ``He's
basically a man whose dreams have been frustrated in his own
life.''
 &HT;    Smits based the character a bit on his own father, a Surinamese
immigrant who lived with his Puerto Rican wife first in Puerto Rico
and then in Brooklyn, holding a job as a plant manager at a
silk-screen factory.
 &HT;    ``My dad was very strict,'' the actor says, ``but he didn't push
us to play sports. For my dad, the thrust for the family was
simple: It was all about education for him. I guess that has to do
with the fact that he and his family didn't have that advantage of
education.''
 &HT;    As a teen-ager, Smits had what he calls ``major rebellion
problems,'' which infuriated his father.
 &HT;    ``I remember vividly one summer in New York, I was collecting
airplane models,'' he recalls. ``A particular box I had didn't have
the right parts in it, so me and my buddies went to the department
store and opened up all the boxes. We started taking out parts _
and it worked until I got caught.
 &HT;    ``I came home in a cop car,'' he continues. ``My father came out
and grabbed me by the scruff of my shirt.''
 &HT;    He shakes his head.
 &HT;    ``His whole thing is, we didn't come to this country to be
embarrassed in this way,'' Smits says. ``It's this whole thing of
what it is to be American and not get in trouble with the law.
 &HT;    ``I got a whupping,'' he concludes. ``Today it would be child
abuse. Back then it was just a whupping.'''
 &HT;    His father was disappointed when young Jimmy, who already had a
degree in education from Brooklyn College, abandoned his plans to
study psychology and announced that he wanted to become an actor.
 &HT;    ``My father did not understand. He didn't get it,'' Smits says.
``Of course, my family doesn't have an entertainment background. My
Dad was like, `Jimmy, I like those plays, but why does everybody
talk funny in that Shakespeare thing? If you want to be an actor,
why aren't you doing something real, like a toothpaste commercial?
 &HT;    ```That to me is an actor.'''
 &HT;    But a 1984 job on the pilot for ``Miami Vice'' got Smits started
in television, and two years later he was cast in the career-making
role of fiery Victor Sifuentes on ``L.A. Law.''
 &HT;    Television opened some movie opportunities, but so far Smits has
generally been better than his material, and such films as ``The
Believers'' (1986), ``Old Gringo'' (1988), ``Vital Signs'' (1990),
``Switch'' (1991) and ``My Family'' (1995) have not added up to
much at the box office.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have frustrated acting dreams,'' Smits says. ``But I
can be very hardheaded. I always think that your dream is just one
day away from coming true.''
 &HT;    He conveys that lesson to Taina and Joaquin, his children from
his first marriage, which ended in 1987. By his own account, he's a
tough parent, but he's avoided the kind of conflict that plagues
his character in ``Price of Glory.''
 &HT;    ``What I've tried to do with my children is be more
communicative,'' Smits says, ``which is something we didn't have in
my home. In my home you just did it. Why? `Because I'm telling you
to do it. Get in your room and do your homework.'
 &HT;    ``I took psychology courses,'' he adds. ``I know that you reap
much more if you actually talk to people, which is what I try to do
with my kids, because I want them to be able to talk to their own
children.''
 &HT;    For the last decade, Smits has been seeing actress Wanda De
Jesus, about whom he generally refuses to speak in public.
 &HT;    ``She is a great partner in life,'' he says. ``She is also a
great dancer.''
 &HT;    The two spend most of their time out of the public eye. In fact,
Smits says, he even watches his own reruns.
 &HT;    ``I've discovered that you could spend the day watching
back-to-back episodes of `L.A. Law' and `NYPD Blue,''' he says. ``I
see them every once in a while. My first thought is that I'd feel
blessed, but I realize there is a lot more for me to do
artistically.
 &HT;    ``My second thought is that I sit there and say, `Wow, I had so
much more hair in those days!'''

 (Includes a color slide of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker of the
rock band Steely Dan) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Two decades after recording their most recent album as Steely
Dan, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker have decided, in the words of
their first hit, to ``Do It Again.''
 &HT;    ``Two Against Nature,'' the duo's new nine-song collection,
marks the first album of new Steely Dan music since ``Gaucho''
(1980). It was inspired by a heavy spate of touring the group did
during the 1990s _ ironic since, during much of its initial run
from 1971 to 1981, Steely Dan was a reclusive studio outfit that
shunned live performances.
 &HT;    ``When we were out in '96,'' singer/keyboardist Fagen says, ``we
were talking about how we needed some new stuff to play onstage. We
started feeling a little like the material was getting tired for
us. We both had some ideas for songs, so we decided to take some
time off to write and record.''
 &HT;    In typical Steely Dan fashion, that took a few years. In their
heyday Fagen, Becker and producer Gary Katz were known for their
meticulous ways in the studio, agonizing over every detail of their
songs and working with dozens of session players _ including future
Doobie Brothers Michael McDonald and Jeff ``Skunk'' Baxter, future
Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich, rock-guitar heroes Mark
Knopfler and Rick Derringer, and instrumental luminaries Wayne
Shorter, Larry Carlton, Lee Ritenour and the Brecker brothers,
Michael and Randy.
 &HT;    The ends usually justified the means, however. From the early
1970s rock hits ``Do It Again'' and ``Reelin' in the Years'' to the
jazz-pop fusion of their masterful album ``Aja'' (1977), Steely Dan
made its mark with sophisticated arrangements, virtuoso
musicianship, clever _ if oblique _ lyricism and Teflon-smooth
production.
 &HT;    ``As jazz fans, it was amusing for us to play jazz harmonies on
these big, ugly electric guitars,'' says the 52-year-old Fagen, who
met Becker during the 1960s at Bard College in upstate New York,
where they played in a band that included future ``Saturday Night
Live'' star Chevy Chase on drums.
 &HT;    Fagen and Becker formed a songwriting partnership and moved to
Los Angeles, submitting songs for others before launching Steely
Dan during the early 1970s. The group's success peaked with the
multimillion-selling ``Aja,'' but by the time ``Gaucho'' was
finished both men were burned out by their exhausting working
method, drugs and personal neuroses.
 &HT;    They stopped working together _ though Fagen notes that ``Steely
Dan time is a whole different thing. To us, there was no break _
it's all on a continuum'' _ and pursued different therapies and
musical endeavors.
 &HT;    It was playing live that brought the two back together. Fagen
invited Becker, who was co-producing his solo album
``Karmakiriad,'' to join him in the New York Rock and Soul Revue's
North American summer tour during 1992, which led to several
full-fledged Steely Dan outings during the next few years and,
ultimately, the decision to go forward with a new album.
 &HT;    Even after 20 years, however, Fagen says he and Becker found
they still work in the same exacting way.
 &HT;    ``We kind of gravitated toward the way we used to do it,'' says
Fagen, who co-produced Becker's 1994 solo album ``11 Tracks of
Whack.'' ``We worked together on both our recent solo albums, so we
just rolled into it, really. I wish it could have been faster, but
that's how it goes.''
 &HT;    Longtime Steely Dan fans will be pleased to find that ``Two
Against Nature'' picks up where ``Gaucho'' left off, with the same
blend of jazz, soul, pop and blues conventions. The songs are built
atop slinky, sinewy grooves, usually incorporating a warm
combination of Rhodes and Wurlitzer pianos, cushy horn charts and
biting guitar licks.
 &HT;    The difference this time is that those guitar licks are played
almost entirely by Becker, rather than by the all-star corps that
populated previous Steely Dan efforts.
 &HT;    ``Walter had been playing really well, I felt, so I actually
encouraged him,'' Fagen says. ``Before, we'd start calling people,
but I said `Hey, look, why don't you try it?' He's a great guitar
player, but he always had kind of a low confidence level. We've
both improved a lot since the '70s, as far as our technique goes. I
thought he did a great job, and that gives more of a unity to it.''
 &HT;    As to achieving the familiar Steely Dan sound, Fagen says he and
Becker did talk about what the group should sound like after all
this time, and even discussed modern methods of record-making such
as sampling and electronic techniques.
 &HT;    ``But we never really had serious discussion about it,'' he
says. ``We ended up sort of gravitating to doing this very much the
way we used to, except for the fact of new technology, which
enables us to do the same things in a slightly different, and
usually quicker, way.''
 &HT;    Steely Dan's initial blast of promotion for ``Two Against
Nature'' was on television, including episodes of PBS' ``In The
Spotlight'' and VH1's ``Storytellers.'' Next up is a concert tour,
which will begin during May in Japan before coming to North America
for the summer and heading to Europe in the fall.
 &HT;    The repertoire, he adds, will draw heavily from ``Two Against
Nature'' but will also dig into Steely Dan material he and Becker
haven't touched on during their recent tours.
 &HT;    ``We're going to revive and perhaps spruce up some things we
haven't played onstage for awhile,'' Fagen says. ``I know we were
looking at `The Boston Rag,' which we haven't played onstage since
the '70s. We had kind of a funny arrangement of `Dirty Work' we
were looking at, too.
 &HT;    ``Some of the earlier things we did I don't think were
representative of the style that evolved,'' Fagen adds. ``There are
some things that I really didn't like the lyrics as they appeared
on the original records, so I've rewritten some words.
 &HT;    ``I don't think there's anything that, at least with some
rearrangement, we can't make interesting to play.''

`RETURN' ENGAGEMENT: MINNIE DRIVER TAKES A CHANCE ON ROMANCE

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Minnie Driver with David Duchovny in a
scene from ``Return to Me.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Minnie Driver is multitasking.
 &HT;    Standing near a window at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel,
Driver sips from a bottle of water, takes a drag on a cigarette,
sings Christina Aguilera's hit song ``Genie in a Bottle'' and sways
to the music in her head. By the time she turns around to greet a
visitor, her face is just a bit flushed with embarrassment.
 &HT;    ``I love `Genie in a Bottle,''' she says. ``The song is so
catchy. What was that other song I liked? Oh, it was `I Think We're
Alone Now.' But I have a feeling Christina Aguilera's career will
last longer than Tiffany's.''
 &HT;    Driver smiles, strides over to a couch and settles in to talk
about her own career _ one that will probably last longer than
either Aguilera's or Tiffany's. Since winning over audiences with
her touching performance in ``Circle of Friends'' (1995), the
British actress has put together a string of movies that includes
``Big Night'' (1996), ``Sleepers'' (1996), ``Grosse Pointe Blank''
(1997), ``Good Will Hunting'' (1997), ``The Governess'' (1998) and
``An Ideal Husband'' (1999).
 &HT;    Beyond her films, Driver has received unwanted attention for her
personal affairs. She very publicly dated her ``Good Will Hunting''
co-star Matt Damon, a relationship that ended in an
even-more-public breakup. Now she's been linked with actor Josh
Brolin, son of James Brolin, but the mere mention of that
relationship or of Josh Brolin's stepmother, Barbra Streisand, has
been known to cause Driver to bolt.
 &HT;    ``It's nobody's business,'' the actress says simply.
 &HT;    The business at hand, then, is ``Return to Me.'' Due for
nationwide release on April 7, ``Return to Me'' casts Driver as
Grace, a gravely ill young woman who receives a new heart from
accident victim Elizabeth Rueland (Joely Richardson).
 &HT;    Time passes, and Grace and Elizabeth's widower husband, Bob
(David Duchovny), struggle to get on with their lives. And, as one
might expect of a romantic comedy/drama, Grace and Bob ultimately
find each other, with a little help from four crotchety old men
(Carroll O'Connor as her grandfather, Robert Loggia as her uncle
and Eddie Jones and William Bronder as cantankerous family
friends).
 &HT;    Schmaltzy as that may sound, the film works magic. Audiences are
laughing and crying in all the right spots, and Driver credits
director/co-writer Bonnie Hunt _ who also plays Grace's best friend
_ with constructing a film that has feel-good sleeper written all
over it.
 &HT;    And, she says, it's refreshingly free of schmaltz.
 &HT;    ``It's very easy to play that card when you're doing a romantic
comedy,'' says Driver, dressed casually in blue jeans and a denim
jacket. ``Fortunately, Bonnie is a very strong director with a very
good sense of humor and an edge.
 &HT;    ``I'm bookended by so much humor, by the wonderful old guys, by
Bonnie's character, by Jim Belushi (as Hunt's lug of a husband) and
by this very sweet, wry relationship she has with David's
character,'' Driver says. ``It's very emotional, but it's very
honest.
 &HT;    ``Getting too sappy was a concern,'' she admits, ``but if you
base everything in truth you can play any cliche and give it a
veracity and newness. If it's based in truth, the audience will
suspend its disbelief and believe in what you're showing them.''
 &HT;    Driver didn't know ``X-Files'' star Duchovny before signing on
for ``Return to Me.'' On the set, however, the two hit it off.
 &HT;    ``He's so good, such a good actor,'' she says. ``He's been doing
the same part for seven years, and it's got to be an enormous bore
to be the same person for seven years. It must have been a great
release to be someone so much lighter.
 &HT;    ``He's really great, so charismatic on screen,'' she adds. ``He
has that old movie-star quality as an actor. As a person, he could
not be funnier and drier, or more articulate or more fun to hang
out with.''
 &HT;    Later this spring, Driver will turn up in two more films,
``Higher Love'' with Rufus Sewell and Nigel Hawthorne, and the
Sally Field-directed coming-of-age drama, ``Beautiful.''
``Beautiful'' is especially important to the actress, who not only
stars but also produced the film with her sister Kate via their
company, Two Drivers.
 &HT;    ``The producing has really been to create work for myself,''
Driver admits. ``I don't like waiting around for things to come to
me.
 &HT;    ``I've been fortunate to have the limitless talents of my
sister,'' she says. ``I don't love the day-to-day of producing, I
love to find material and develop it. Kate is a great dealmaker _
she knows the ins and outs of the business end of producing. So I'd
like to think we complement each other very well.''
 &HT;    One film produced by Two Drivers, namely ``Slow Burn,'' turned
out so horribly that, Driver says, it probably won't ever be
released. And that's despite the presence of herself, James Spader
and Mr. Unmentionable himself, Josh Brolin.
 &HT;    ``We laughed ourselves silly, because everything that could go
wrong did go wrong,'' Driver says with an ``oh, well'' shrug. ``It
was just one of those awful, hilarious filmmaking experiences of
which I think everybody has one.''
 &HT;    Driver can live with the occasional flop _ she survived the
waterlogged ``Hard Rain,'' right? And, she adds, she can handle
fame.
 &HT;    ``I'm fairly comfortable,'' she says. ``I'd be worried if I were
really comfortable. I think one should always be wary of fame _
it's complete ephemera. It's illusory, and not the whole truth at
all. Those photos are airbrushed, you know?
 &HT;    ``There are only a few areas in which you can really utilize
your celebrity,'' the actress adds. ``One is giving your name and
time to causes you feel passionate about, and the other is being
able to do the projects that interest you. I have enough leverage
at this point to guarantee financing on a small picture, or maybe a
bigger picture if I'm with someone else.''
 &HT;    Driver smiles and tugs on her ponytail.
 &HT;    ``Every single part I take will enforce who I am so much more
than my protesting my nobility as an actor or my disinterest in
celebrity,'' she says. ``My work will do all my talking for me. I
have all confidence in that.''
 &HT;    Driver figures that, if she hadn't pursued acting, she might
have gone on to college and tried to make her living as a writer,
perhaps as a novelist or magazine journalist. She chose acting,
however, and admits to no regrets.
 &HT;    ``I think anything you put your passion and your heart into,
that you respect and feel useful in, is noble,'' she says.
``Whatever you do for a living, if you love it and honor it in some
way, then you're in the right profession.
 &HT;    ``By that standard, I think I'm in the right profession for me
and that acting is a noble profession.''

 (Includes a black-and-white slide of George Clooney in a scene from
``Fail Safe.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be released in Canada before April 8. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's official: George Clooney has returned to television.
</P>
<P>
   But before viewers start picturing Doug Ross swaggering back
onto ``ER'' and setting up house with Nurse Hathaway and their
twins, the actor makes it clear that he's not returning to
television's most popular drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Clooney says affably. ``They haven't even asked me.''
</P>
<P>
   The project that brings Clooney back to the small screen is
``Fail Safe,'' a CBS television-movie remake of his
all-time-favorite film, the 1964 Cold War thriller starring Henry
Fonda, Larry Hagman and Walter Matthau. The remake will be
broadcast live _ and in black and white, no less _ on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney, who has had a spotty record on the big screen, despite
the comparative success of his most recent films, ``Out of Sight''
(1998) and ``Three Kings'' (1999), says he came back to television
because it was the only way he could do ``Fail Safe,'' which he
felt driven to do.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the tense environment of the early Cold War, ``Fail
Safe'' traces the mounting tensions between the United States and
Russia after mechanical failures launch an atomic attack on Moscow,
cutting back and forth between American attempts to stop the
bombers and the president's frantic negotiations with the Soviet
premier to prevent World War III.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the movie a year or two ago, Clooney says, he was
struck by the idea that it was ``sort of made for live
television.'' A seed was planted, and before long Clooney had
convinced Walter Bernstein, who wrote the original, to pen an
updated script and had brought director Stephen Frears on board.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clooney stars as Col. Jack Grady, the bomber pilot
who, during routine maneuvers, is suddenly diverted toward Moscow
and ordered to drop the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   It's a meaty, dramatic role, all the more challenging because
Clooney has to pull it off while confined to his plane's tiny
cockpit for nearly every scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the trick of this is that the words play so well,
and the words are what do this,'' the actor says. ``We're telling a
great story here. It's really well written, so I don't think we'll
be focused on whether people are moving around or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney will be surrounded by a mostly male cast that includes
major big-screen names such as Harvey Keitel, Richard Dreyfuss,
James Cromwell, Don Cheadle, Sam Elliot, Hank Azaria and Brian
Dennehy.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mix is a notable small-screen name, Clooney's former
``ER'' castmate Noah Wyle, who will play the president's
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noah and I are good friends,'' Clooney says. ``We play
basketball together. And we'd been talking about it for a long time
_ I used to screen that movie over at my house all the time and
make people watch it, and Noah and I talked about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men are familiar with the dangers and the thrills of live
television, having worked on the much-hyped live ``ER'' episode two
years back. That broadcast resulted in a ratings bonanza, but
Clooney wasn't happy with the results, particular when he viewed it
again before setting to work on ``Fail Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't necessarily work,'' he says, shaking his head, ``but
it could. And the trick is to do it really right. And that means to
start from the very beginning, building the sets and shooting it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story line for that ``ER'' broadcast included a visiting
documentary-film crew who could be conveniently blamed when things
went wrong _ a precaution that won't be available in ``Fail Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're flying a little bit more without a net,'' Clooney says,
``but we've also prepared differently. With any luck at all we'll
be able to do it better, and hopefully we're learning from things
we've done along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Clooney who insisted that this new version of ``Fail
Safe,'' like the original, be broadcast in black and white _
``which isn't taboo, necessarily,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if ``Fail Safe'' is a success, Clooney would like to do
a regular series of live-broadcast movies, mostly remakes of dramas
from the black-and-white era of 1950s television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure would be nice to be able to get somebody to give us
the rights to `A Thousand Clowns' (1965),'' he adds. ``It would be
nice to get some of the old classics, too. Maybe some old `Twilight
Zones.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Clooney is bubbling over with ideas for future
television projects. About the only thing he isn't planning to do
is to return to ``ER'' _ despite persistent rumors to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' he says, ``I read I was going back for $52
million an episode _ which I'd like to go on the record as saying
I'd go back for $52 million an episode. I'm not an idiot!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been things that ballooned out of somebody making a
joke or something like that,'' he adds more seriously. ``I've never
talked to anyone about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he says, ``ER'' doesn't need his help, either for a
ratings bump or to add to the dramatic mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing is,'' Clooney says, ``they're not going, `Hey,
come on back' and trying to do a ratings thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juliana leaving will be a big enough story line, I think,'' he
adds. ``It's a big blow to that show when you lose Juliana
Margulies, much more so than losing myself. She's the real soul of
that show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show survives, though, because it's a good show and it's
smart writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Clooney admits, he has so much going on these days _
including prepping for his next film, a remake of the Rat Pack
movie ``Ocean's Eleven'' (1960), in which he's assuming the Frank
Sinatra role _ that he seldom has time to watch the new episodes of
``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   But he still sees his former castmates, mostly because he and
they have offices on the Warner Bros. lot _ but even that doesn't
get him itching for a return to his old stamping grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see my friends almost every day, because my office is right
next door to them,'' he says. ``But I don't have any regrets about
not trying to keep reinventing the character that I was playing
after five years. I was kind of running out of stuff, and it was
sort of limiting as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's probably best that I got out when I did, before I
started doing headstands and things to try and think of something
different to do.''

 &HT;    The last we saw of Jimmy Smits, he and Bobby Simone were
checking out.
 &HT;    Smits was leaving his hit television series ``NYPD Blue,'' and
Simone was dying in a hospital bed, his heart finally giving out.
Truth to tell, while he talked a confident game at the time, Smits
now can admit that he had his share of doubts.
 &HT;    ``My final scene as Bobby Simone has a priest giving me the last
rites,'' the actor recalls. ``I insisted it (be) a real man of the
cloth, because I thought it would make it a little more realistic.
 &HT;    ``Quietly,'' he continues, ``I took the priest to the side and
said, `Listen, father, I've been in this bed for six weeks dying on
television. I'm going into the unknown after I leave the show.
Could you just give me a little blessing, please?'
 &HT;    ``It couldn't hurt,'' Smits says, laughing.
 &HT;    It may have helped, because since leaving the weekly grind of
series television, Smits has been in demand. He already has three
movies in the can, including the boxing drama ``Price of Glory,''
which will open on March 31. Then there's ``Million Dollar Hotel,''
starring Mel Gibson and due this summer, and ``Bless the Child,'' a
thriller co-starring Kim Basinger.
 &HT;    Not bad for a guy many fans think is dead.
 &HT;    ``Man, it's weird,'' Smits says. ``In airports, people still
come up and say, `Are you OK? Jimmy, are you really alive? We wept
when your heart transplant didn't work!'''
 &HT;    Smits laughs.
 &HT;    ``Once I had this older woman come up to me and say, `Jimmy, I
just love the way you die,''' he recalls. ``I said, `Ma'am, I cried
watching myself die, too.'''
 &HT;    The actor, who nowadays wears a tiny beard and, for a
Saturday-morning interview at Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel,
dresses in expensive black slacks and a matching cashmere sweater,
understands how much ``NYPD Blue'' fans miss him, but he makes no
apologies for his departure.
 &HT;    ``Look, I fulfilled my commitment to the show,'' he says
matter-of-factly. ``And now I want to concentrate more on long-form
things.''
 &HT;    ``Long-form,'' of course, is code for ``movies.''
 &HT;    ``You have a 120-page movie script and you know you'll bust your
a-- and work really hard for three months,'' Smits says. ``And then
you move on to the next gypsy family and the next character. I like
the idea of moving on. That's why I got into this business _ I want
to show versatility.''
 &HT;    Smits shows that versatility as a tough father obsessed with
molding his three sons into champion boxers in ``Price of Glory,''
which has been dubbed a Latino ``Rocky'' _ much to Smits'
annoyance.
 &HT;    ``This film doesn't need labels,'' he says. ``It's a father-son
story, period. It's about people trying to win, and it's as
mainstream as any other movie.''
 &HT;    Smits loved the idea of playing against type.
 &HT;    ``This is not an idealistic, heroic guy,'' he says. ``He's
basically a man whose dreams have been frustrated in his own
life.''
 &HT;    Smits based the character a bit on his own father, a Surinamese
immigrant who lived with his Puerto Rican wife first in Puerto Rico
and then in Brooklyn, holding a job as a plant manager at a
silk-screen factory.
 &HT;    ``My dad was very strict,'' the actor says, ``but he didn't push
us to play sports. For my dad, the thrust for the family was
simple: It was all about education for him. I guess that has to do
with the fact that he and his family didn't have that advantage of
education.''
 &HT;    As a teen-ager, Smits had what he calls ``major rebellion
problems,'' which infuriated his father.
 &HT;    ``I remember vividly one summer in New York, I was collecting
airplane models,'' he recalls. ``A particular box I had didn't have
the right parts in it, so me and my buddies went to the department
store and opened up all the boxes. We started taking out parts _
and it worked until I got caught.
 &HT;    ``I came home in a cop car,'' he continues. ``My father came out
and grabbed me by the scruff of my shirt.''
 &HT;    He shakes his head.
 &HT;    ``His whole thing is, we didn't come to this country to be
embarrassed in this way,'' Smits says. ``It's this whole thing of
what it is to be American and not get in trouble with the law.
 &HT;    ``I got a whupping,'' he concludes. ``Today it would be child
abuse. Back then it was just a whupping.'''
 &HT;    His father was disappointed when young Jimmy, who already had a
degree in education from Brooklyn College, abandoned his plans to
study psychology and announced that he wanted to become an actor.
 &HT;    ``My father did not understand. He didn't get it,'' Smits says.
``Of course, my family doesn't have an entertainment background. My
Dad was like, `Jimmy, I like those plays, but why does everybody
talk funny in that Shakespeare thing? If you want to be an actor,
why aren't you doing something real, like a toothpaste commercial?
 &HT;    ```That to me is an actor.'''
 &HT;    But a 1984 job on the pilot for ``Miami Vice'' got Smits started
in television, and two years later he was cast in the career-making
role of fiery Victor Sifuentes on ``L.A. Law.''
 &HT;    Television opened some movie opportunities, but so far Smits has
generally been better than his material, and such films as ``The
Believers'' (1986), ``Old Gringo'' (1988), ``Vital Signs'' (1990),
``Switch'' (1991) and ``My Family'' (1995) have not added up to
much at the box office.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have frustrated acting dreams,'' Smits says. ``But I
can be very hardheaded. I always think that your dream is just one
day away from coming true.''
 &HT;    He conveys that lesson to Taina and Joaquin, his children from
his first marriage, which ended in 1987. By his own account, he's a
tough parent, but he's avoided the kind of conflict that plagues
his character in ``Price of Glory.''
 &HT;    ``What I've tried to do with my children is be more
communicative,'' Smits says, ``which is something we didn't have in
my home. In my home you just did it. Why? `Because I'm telling you
to do it. Get in your room and do your homework.'
 &HT;    ``I took psychology courses,'' he adds. ``I know that you reap
much more if you actually talk to people, which is what I try to do
with my kids, because I want them to be able to talk to their own
children.''
 &HT;    For the last decade, Smits has been seeing actress Wanda De
Jesus, about whom he generally refuses to speak in public.
 &HT;    ``She is a great partner in life,'' he says. ``She is also a
great dancer.''
 &HT;    The two spend most of their time out of the public eye. In fact,
Smits says, he even watches his own reruns.
 &HT;    ``I've discovered that you could spend the day watching
back-to-back episodes of `L.A. Law' and `NYPD Blue,''' he says. ``I
see them every once in a while. My first thought is that I'd feel
blessed, but I realize there is a lot more for me to do
artistically.
 &HT;    ``My second thought is that I sit there and say, `Wow, I had so
much more hair in those days!'''

 (Includes a color slide of Donald Fagen and Walter Becker of the
rock band Steely Dan) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Two decades after recording their most recent album as Steely
Dan, Donald Fagen and Walter Becker have decided, in the words of
their first hit, to ``Do It Again.''
 &HT;    ``Two Against Nature,'' the duo's new nine-song collection,
marks the first album of new Steely Dan music since ``Gaucho''
(1980). It was inspired by a heavy spate of touring the group did
during the 1990s _ ironic since, during much of its initial run
from 1971 to 1981, Steely Dan was a reclusive studio outfit that
shunned live performances.
 &HT;    ``When we were out in '96,'' singer/keyboardist Fagen says, ``we
were talking about how we needed some new stuff to play onstage. We
started feeling a little like the material was getting tired for
us. We both had some ideas for songs, so we decided to take some
time off to write and record.''
 &HT;    In typical Steely Dan fashion, that took a few years. In their
heyday Fagen, Becker and producer Gary Katz were known for their
meticulous ways in the studio, agonizing over every detail of their
songs and working with dozens of session players _ including future
Doobie Brothers Michael McDonald and Jeff ``Skunk'' Baxter, future
Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich, rock-guitar heroes Mark
Knopfler and Rick Derringer, and instrumental luminaries Wayne
Shorter, Larry Carlton, Lee Ritenour and the Brecker brothers,
Michael and Randy.
 &HT;    The ends usually justified the means, however. From the early
1970s rock hits ``Do It Again'' and ``Reelin' in the Years'' to the
jazz-pop fusion of their masterful album ``Aja'' (1977), Steely Dan
made its mark with sophisticated arrangements, virtuoso
musicianship, clever _ if oblique _ lyricism and Teflon-smooth
production.
 &HT;    ``As jazz fans, it was amusing for us to play jazz harmonies on
these big, ugly electric guitars,'' says the 52-year-old Fagen, who
met Becker during the 1960s at Bard College in upstate New York,
where they played in a band that included future ``Saturday Night
Live'' star Chevy Chase on drums.
 &HT;    Fagen and Becker formed a songwriting partnership and moved to
Los Angeles, submitting songs for others before launching Steely
Dan during the early 1970s. The group's success peaked with the
multimillion-selling ``Aja,'' but by the time ``Gaucho'' was
finished both men were burned out by their exhausting working
method, drugs and personal neuroses.
 &HT;    They stopped working together _ though Fagen notes that ``Steely
Dan time is a whole different thing. To us, there was no break _
it's all on a continuum'' _ and pursued different therapies and
musical endeavors.
 &HT;    It was playing live that brought the two back together. Fagen
invited Becker, who was co-producing his solo album
``Karmakiriad,'' to join him in the New York Rock and Soul Revue's
North American summer tour during 1992, which led to several
full-fledged Steely Dan outings during the next few years and,
ultimately, the decision to go forward with a new album.
 &HT;    Even after 20 years, however, Fagen says he and Becker found
they still work in the same exacting way.
 &HT;    ``We kind of gravitated toward the way we used to do it,'' says
Fagen, who co-produced Becker's 1994 solo album ``11 Tracks of
Whack.'' ``We worked together on both our recent solo albums, so we
just rolled into it, really. I wish it could have been faster, but
that's how it goes.''
 &HT;    Longtime Steely Dan fans will be pleased to find that ``Two
Against Nature'' picks up where ``Gaucho'' left off, with the same
blend of jazz, soul, pop and blues conventions. The songs are built
atop slinky, sinewy grooves, usually incorporating a warm
combination of Rhodes and Wurlitzer pianos, cushy horn charts and
biting guitar licks.
 &HT;    The difference this time is that those guitar licks are played
almost entirely by Becker, rather than by the all-star corps that
populated previous Steely Dan efforts.
 &HT;    ``Walter had been playing really well, I felt, so I actually
encouraged him,'' Fagen says. ``Before, we'd start calling people,
but I said `Hey, look, why don't you try it?' He's a great guitar
player, but he always had kind of a low confidence level. We've
both improved a lot since the '70s, as far as our technique goes. I
thought he did a great job, and that gives more of a unity to it.''
 &HT;    As to achieving the familiar Steely Dan sound, Fagen says he and
Becker did talk about what the group should sound like after all
this time, and even discussed modern methods of record-making such
as sampling and electronic techniques.
 &HT;    ``But we never really had serious discussion about it,'' he
says. ``We ended up sort of gravitating to doing this very much the
way we used to, except for the fact of new technology, which
enables us to do the same things in a slightly different, and
usually quicker, way.''
 &HT;    Steely Dan's initial blast of promotion for ``Two Against
Nature'' was on television, including episodes of PBS' ``In The
Spotlight'' and VH1's ``Storytellers.'' Next up is a concert tour,
which will begin during May in Japan before coming to North America
for the summer and heading to Europe in the fall.
 &HT;    The repertoire, he adds, will draw heavily from ``Two Against
Nature'' but will also dig into Steely Dan material he and Becker
haven't touched on during their recent tours.
 &HT;    ``We're going to revive and perhaps spruce up some things we
haven't played onstage for awhile,'' Fagen says. ``I know we were
looking at `The Boston Rag,' which we haven't played onstage since
the '70s. We had kind of a funny arrangement of `Dirty Work' we
were looking at, too.
 &HT;    ``Some of the earlier things we did I don't think were
representative of the style that evolved,'' Fagen adds. ``There are
some things that I really didn't like the lyrics as they appeared
on the original records, so I've rewritten some words.
 &HT;    ``I don't think there's anything that, at least with some
rearrangement, we can't make interesting to play.''

 &HT;    Fridge finds final, frosty farewell
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ All mechanical breakdowns are not created equal.
Telephones have gone from being serious business machinery leased
for home use to disposable plastic toys. Toasters, which used to
last forever, now come and go.
</P>
<P>
   But as you move up the food chain of home technology and into
the realm of what economists call ``durable goods'' (whether or not
</P>
<P>
   they prove to be all that durable), people get irrationally
attached to machinery. This is the point when mechanical failure no
longer
</P>
<P>
   feels like the inevitable result of planned obsolescence. It
feels like the inscrutable punishment of an angry god.
</P>
<P>
   The most durable goods of them all are cars, washing machines,
dryers and refrigerators. And on these objects, people get a little
</P>
<P>
   nuts. They give cars names like pets. They identify the sounds
particular to their own home not with the light sound of breezes or
</P>
<P>
   voices of children down the street but with the whir of
compressors and the shake, rattle and spin emitting from the
laundry room.
</P>
<P>
   And the most durable of the durable goods, the most faithful and
most central to home life is the refrigerator. It is the machine
people get most strangely attached to.
</P>
<P>
   Cold storage is to the modern home what the hearth was to homes
centuries ago. The central spot around which all home life spins.
With luck, one might spend an entire childhood leaving the door
open, staring into and emptying a single trusty refrigerator. If
you're not lucky, the switch over can be traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   Even cleaning a refrigerator is a task I associate with
unwelcome change. It is done before moving day, before company
arrives, after the storms when electricity has been off a day. If
you are as devoted to keeping change at bay as I am, you understand
that refrigerator-cleaning is bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there I was, before the open icebox squinting at expiration
dates (''October? October which year?'') and muttering to myself.
</P>
<P>
   My refrigerator, the only one my teen-aged kids had ever known,
was dead. I was kneeling between an ice chest and a garbage bag,
judging lukewarm frozen food. The bag filled faster than the chest.
</P>
<P>
   These were evil substances. The ones sealed airtight were the
most interesting both from an esthetic and scientific point of
view. How did life forms evolve so they could thrive on spaghetti
sauce in a dark, low-oxygen, low temperature environment? And what
cool, non-spaghetti-like colors they come in! The deeper I dug, the
more exotic the finds.
</P>
<P>
   But scarier than the stuff that yields to the natural forces of
decay is the stuff that doesn't. I found Halloween candy that had
Y2K problems. It looked the same as last year. Tasted the same.
What could it be made of? I have furniture that hasn't lasted as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The clean-out phase of abandoning a dead refrigerator puts one
in a utilitarian frame of mind. You are ready for the new. But this
resolve is tested as soon as you undertake the refrigerator magnet
roundup.
</P>
<P>
   I sorted out the damaged ones, picking out only the best for the
gleaming white door of the new unit. I carefully transferred the
one that looks like a space alien and the detailed representation
of the Empire State Building. I kept the one made out of seashells
by a Sunday school class.
</P>
<P>
   Easy enough decisions. But they were decisions that meant
sorting through the icebox's history. Back to its old ice ages.
This was the refrigerator door where I used to store bottles of
baby formula and now I was sending it to the end of the driveway,
never to return. It was all too sad.
</P>
<P>
   The magnets on this door held softball standings, the report
cards that could stand the light of day, crayon drawings of
balloon-like people and birthday party invitations for kids who are
now as big as I am and able to look vaguely dangerous when standing
in groups waiting to be picked up.
</P>
<P>
   A major link to the whole process of growing up: lost.
</P>
<P>
   But the new durable good looks both durable and good standing in
this old place of honor. And with its predecessor's magnets in
place, it already looks a little more homey than it did in the
showroom. When I found chocolate fingerprints on it within hours, I
felt better still.
</P>
<P>
   This may not take as long to get used to as I thought.

 &HT;    Mama makes up her mind
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Scientists have recently discovered a
thumb-size primate species that lived in China 42-million years
ago. It may help resolve missing links in the evolutionary pattern
as well as cast doubt on our exclusively African origins. The tiny
critter weighed only one-third of an ounce and ate bugs at night.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting stuff, but I can tell you right now my mother
wouldn't like it one little bit. If she were still around, she'd be
accusing those
</P>
<P>
   scientists of all sorts of reprehensible motives for their
studies as well as muttering a few ladylike but highly suggestive
comments about the origins of their ancestors. She didn't much like
folks messing with her firmly held opinions on anything, and not
being related to monkeys was definitely one of her firmest.
</P>
<P>
   In the barely post WWI years when Mother was at Queen's College
in Charlotte, N.C., where she majored in sorority and chapel organ,
young ladies attended few (if any) lectures on the theory of
evolution. But even if the study had been mandatory, Mother
wouldn't have bought into it. Information that didn't reconcile
with her firmly held notions would be partially processed and then
discarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do NOT confuse your mother with facts,'' I remember my father
frequently warning during my growing up years when he'd tired of
listening to the two of us heatedly debate everything from the
origin of the species to the color of my nail polish.
</P>
<P>
   Mother would make up her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around my 12th birthday, Mother concluded I was
destined to become a problem drinker based on my refusal to sign an
alcohol abstinence pledge her church was circulating.
</P>
<P>
   There was no big moral issue involved. I was just an average kid
balking at being pressured into making promises I might someday
decide to break. It was a non-issue for me and I promptly forgot
the entire episode. Mother never did.
</P>
<P>
   One noon, 25 years later, she walked into my kitchen and sat
down at the table with my four-year-old son who was having his
lunch. ``What's that'' she demanded, pointing to the suspicious
brown bottle beside his cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginger beer,'' he answered innocently.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the old television series ``Sanford and Son'' And how
Fred, whenever he found himself in a situation he couldn't handle,
would slap one hand over his heart, stagger, and shout to the
heavens, ``This is it, Elizabeth! This is the big one!'' That was
my mother _ almost.
</P>
<P>
   She grabbed the bottle, marched to the sink, and was mid-pour
when my son spoke up, asking her to please give back his ginger
beer and explaining that if she wanted some, there was more in the
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   The bottle clattered into the sink as Mother swayed under the
strain. She made it back to the table muttering about heathen
children and unsigned pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only ginger ale, Mother,'' I said with little hope of
coming out ahead on this one. She ignored me and warned that my
predilection for strong drink was dooming my son to a lifetime of
brown bottles on bartops. I told her I'd never had a beer in my
life. She changed the subject.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Mother called to remind us it was time to
enroll our son in Bible school. My husband told her he'd see to it
since I was in the hospital and wouldn't be driving for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Mother didn't ask what was wrong. All she said was, ``I hope
they can help with her problem.'' My husband asked what problem
that might be and my mother quickly answered, ``Her drinking, of
course. She never did sign that pledge, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, my husband told me he hadn't even tried to explain that
I'd hurt my back and was in traction. Her mind was made up and he
knew better than to argue.
</P>
<P>
   Same with evolution. She would dismiss all studies linking us
with apes, insisting that none of her relatives had ever lived in
trees _ at which point my father would always bring up her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I have no problem being linked to the cute little
critter I saw in the paper, but who knows? Unlike my mother, maybe
I've been confused by the facts.

 &HT;    Web a rich source of sites for sore eyes (runny noses, too)
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is a time of year when even the grass blooms.
There are flowers, sunshine and enough pollen to sneeze at.
</P>
<P>
   The Web itself can't stop your eyes from itching or your nose
from running, but it can lead you to a number of places where
you'll get advice and help that may turn your red eyes back to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Allernet at www.allernet.com/default.asp is a great place to
start because _ unlike some of the other sites we will visit today
_ it's totally devoted to allergies. If you had just one site to
visit for help, this would be the one.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there is a link to a section that explains just
what allergies are in simple terms. That may not stop you from
sneezing, but a basic knowledge of the condition will help you
treat it intelligently. You'll also find pollen forecasts so you'll
know what types of pollen are active now, as well as a section of
hints on treating allergies. There you'll learn that mold is often
a bigger problem for some people than pollen, and you'll find some
ways to avoid exposure to mold.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is at the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of
America's Web site at www.aafa.org/. One nice feature of this page
is a list of questions that you can answer _ sort of a mini-self
test _ that will help you determine if your problem is actually
caused by an allergy. Just as is true with computers and computer
viruses, there are times when other problems are actually blamed on
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   For some, a little in-person understanding and support is
needed. You'll find a link on this page that will take you to a
list of support groups that you can find in your area. If you are a
health professional eager to learn more about allergies, you'll
find a link to specialized material that provides more in-depth
information.
</P>
<P>
   When people think of medicine and disease, the Mayo Clinic often
comes to mind. The famous clinic has a Web site with a section that
deals with allergies. If you go to
www.mayohealth.org/mayo/common/htm/allergy.htm, you'll find what
seems to be a complete and well-organized section on allergies.
</P>
<P>
   POLLEN, MOLD AND FOOD
</P>
<P>
   One of the nice features of this site is the diversity of
allergy information. While _ especially this time of the year _
most people are thinking of pollen and mold allergies, that's
surely not the complete picture of what's out there. You'll find
information on this site about other kinds of allergies, including
allergic reactions to food.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry, you'll also find the expected _ information
about how to keep going when the pollen is flying. If you're a real
allergy maven _ you'll probably qualify if you visit each of the
sites listed today _ you may want to take the interactive allergy
quiz to find out just how much you do know about allergies.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology runs a
terrific site at allergy.mcg.edu/. Since the site is run by
physicians, it's not surprising that one of the features here is a
locator service that will let you specify the area of the country
you live in and get a list of board-certified allergy physicians.
</P>
<P>
   One feature you'll find especially useful is the ability to
search the site. That way, if you're curious about a particular
condition or medicine or topic, you'll have a better chance of
either finding it or discovering immediately that it isn't covered
by this site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is fairly complete, however, and a search for the
medicine Claritin, used as a decongestant, produced four hits with
solid information.

 &HT;    Inventor hopes seat belt indicator will save lives
 &HT;    By Glenn Evans
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILMER, Texas _ Ronald Slaughter has an idea he hopes will be
hitting the road soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've been working on for the last 2 1/2
years,'' the Gilmer resident said before demonstrating the Ace
Safety Device, for which a patent is pending and on which he
anticipates the U.S. Patent Office to bestow full blessing during
2000.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype of Slaughter's invention installed inside his
Cadillac lets him know whether the seat belts inside the car are
being used. Each buckle includes sensors wired to four tiny red
lights mounted on the dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Another four lights, these yellow, are mounted on the rear
windshield. These tell people outside whether the people inside the
car are buckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the number of belts you have, that's the number of
lights you would have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost a brother who was not wearing his seat belt during a
1995 traffic accident, Slaughter's mind naturally steers toward
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The device is named in honor of his brother, Angelo Eugene
Slaughter, whose nickname was Ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the wreck) was the week before the seat belt law was
enforced in Texas,'' Slaughter said, describing the evening his
brother's car pool from Lone Star Steel encountered a semi-trailer
truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one sad story after another. This idea came to me on
Sept. 22, 1997, and I call it a gift from God. I went to my
computer and drew it up, and that's where I got my start.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter said every state has a different approach to seat
belts, and auto manufacturers await a national safety belt bill
before they will be willing to seriously discuss the added feature.
Meanwhile, he said Bill Clinton announced the Presidential
Initiative for Seat Belt Use in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are talking about saving lives,'' he said. ``When a
drunk driver gets in a car, the last thing he is thinking about is
fastening a seat belt. ... ``
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter, a native of Gary, Ind., moved to Gilmer 27 years ago
with the bride he met at Wiley College. Mary Jo Slaughter, a
third-grade teacher at Daingerfield Elementary, is from the Buckeye
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call her my co-inventor,'' Slaughter said.

 &HT;    Syphon Filter returns
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Syphon Filter is back. The
counter-terrorism game (which was meant to be a more action-packed
``Metal Gear Solid'') wowed us with its shooter-type gameplay. It
also had a pretty compelling storyline. 989 Studios's Syphon Filter
2 ($55, Playstation; www.989studios.com) surpasses the old Syphon
Filter in plot, and it offers a slew of new game functions. Your
task is to stop the Syphon Filter virus from being spread to
terrorists. To do this, you need to use brute force and an arsenal
that would make any action hero shout with joy (night vision
rifles, grenade launchers, crossbow, etc.). The game also offers an
addictive, two-player side-by-side mode. In this mode, you can play
the unsinkable Gabriel Logan while your partner in crime plays Lian
Xing. Blast your way to glory and save the world for us all.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   As many video games as have been made using the Star Wars
license, you'd think a game that took three years to develop would
blow us out of our collective seats. Unfortunately, LucasArts' new
Star Wars game, Force Commander ($40 for the PC, www.lucasarts.com)
does that, but in the wrong way: the game makes you want to get out
of your chair and take a walk just to get away from your computer.
Commander, a real-time-strategy game with 3D units and movement, is
nice to look at on first glance, but several problems emerge. The
game interface is clunky and needlessly complex. The background and
character graphics aren't as detailed or breathtaking as they
should be. And the control of the game's point of view is dodgy at
best. All of it combines to make an experience that is more
frustrating than fun. Star Wars fans deserve a great, awe-inspiring
strategy game along the lines of last year's stunning Homeworld,
but unfortunately, this is not the game they're looking for.

 &HT;    Nothing mousy about Boomslang
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Where Microsoft's ``IntelliEye'' reinvented the
mouse by replacing the intrinsic track-ball with an optical laser
sensor, Karna has improved on the original mouse concept by using a
laser to read the track ball. Karna's Razer Boomslang 2000 ($100;
www.razerzone.com) offers a frightfully fast and accurate interface
for any PC video game using the mouse and keyboard, such as first
person shooters. As a USB device, the sexy-looking Boomslang is
able to transmit more input information faster; its controller chip
has a much higher reading resolution at 2000dpi (400dpi is typical
in a typical mouse) and can cover the screen in about one-fifth the
motion. The trackball of the Boomslang is placed near the heel
rather than dead center, proffering finer poise as it practically
hovers under your hand. The Boomslang also offers on-the-fly, ``in
game'' sensitivity adjustment via a button and the scroll-wheel
and, ultimately, gives gamers much more refined and varied control
by greatly reducing the throw of the mouse, allowing greater range
of character movement and aim without the need to reset or
re-center. Watch your frag count soar.

 &HT;    A mystical ride with Mulan
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Though this NewKidCo. product is, indeed, a
PlayStation CD-ROM, Disney's Mulan ($38; www.newkidco.com) is not a
video game per se; it's more of an interactive plaything from the
Disney's Story Studio line that encourages and coaxes kids through
various problem-solving and motor-skills lessons. Terrific and
friendly voice-over work blends story development with pleasant
tutorial as players guide Disney's cross-dressing heroine through a
series of activities, such as bathing and getting dressed, playing
Mahjong and a game of dodge ball as Mulan makes her way down an
avalanche-plagued slope in her back yard. Ultimately, with no way
to lose and with all the problems and conundrums completed, Mulan
is crowned the Imperial Storymaker and can henceforth create her
own stories, play sing-along Karaoke style or paint her own story
boards. Harmless and pleasant interactive fun from the preeminent
early childhood Zen masters at NewKidCo.

 &HT;    Special Newsweek tells how to employ Net as career tool
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More and more people are turning to the Web to find a
job. The Internet is full of sites that offer classified ads, help
with writing a resume and job tips.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a maze navigating all the various sites, and some are
excellent while others are just a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a special edition of Newsweek, called ``How to Use
the Internet to Choose or Change Careers,'' is worth your time.
You'll discover the magazine's views on the hot cities of the new
economy and find job-search tips and ways to make an e-mailed job
query work for you.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails and you find that you need to change careers,
you'll find an article that offers a guide to various graduate
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Are there days when you are stuck in traffic and get the crazy
desire for back roads and deserted highways where you can safely
put the pedal to the metal?
</P>
<P>
   Well, they're harder to come by _ besides, it's dangerous. But
there is a computer game that lets you drive fast, take crazy
chances and still keep your life and your auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The game is called ``Rally Championship,'' and it comes from
Electronic Arts. You can read about it at
www.ea.com/rallychampionship, or just drop by your favorite
software store and pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need a Windows PC with a 266-megahertz or faster
processor and a burning desire for speed.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   There are Web sites that offer jokes, weather forecasts and even
the population of Des Moines, Iowa. Plenty of sites also want to
sell you something.
</P>
<P>
   But humanitarian groups also have a presence on the Web. While
the pages may not be as flashy, there's a lot of socially conscious
information to be had.
</P>
<P>
   One page in particular, the Human Rights Watch World Report 2000
at www.hrw.org/wr2k/, may be of interest if you have a world view.
</P>
<P>
   You can simply click on the country that interests you and find
out about the political climate there and of any abuses. Like most
activist groups, there is a definite point of view here. But it
makes for fascinating reading whether or not you agree.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you're in San Francisco, you may find the world
famous Exploratorium, a really nifty hands-on science museum and
exhibit, worth a visit.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like to take a sneak peek right now, you can check
out the Web site at www.exploratorium.edu.
</P>
<P>
   You'll actually be able to participate in some of the exhibits,
including one called the Fading Eye.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the link for that on the page, along with plenty of
other family-rated activities, including the online store where you
can buy unusual gifts.

 &HT;    Mac's iBook a good step up
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki: I've had a Mac LC and HP printer since 1990,
and I'm awaiting a new iBook and Dell printer (a birthday present
from my parents). I have questions about the transition.
</P>
<P>
   _Jeremiah Gold-Hopton,
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Your folks are happenin'. Graduating from a slow, but
sure, LC to a shiny new iBook is a good leap. Your questions are
relevant to lots of people going from older Macs to sleek iBooks
and iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah: I mainly do word processing. What's the best way to
transfer my data from LC to iBook? Is there a way to connect them,
or do I use floppies? My LC can't get online, so e-mail isn't an
option.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Moving data can be as easy as buying an iBook floppy drive
(about $85). The floppy generation is on its way out, but the drive
still will be useful down the road. If your files are big, or there
are gobs, try File Sharing. It lets you move items by networking
Macs. Because your LC and iBook don't share common network
connectors (the iBook has USB and Ethernet; the LC has serial), you
need a device to make a ``bridge.'' Look for a Localtalk/Ethernet
bridge or adapter to connect the Macs (about $90 to $100, cables
included).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Yeah, the bridge lets them see each other. Hang with me
through these steps. Connect a serial cable from the bridge to the
modem or printer port on the back of the LC. Run the USB or
Ethernet cable from the bridge to the iBook. On the LC, turn on
File Sharing in Control Panel. Then, ``allow guests to connect'' in
the Users and Groups Control Panel. Click on the LC hard drive icon
on your desktop. Pick Sharing from the File menu. Next, via the
Appletalk Control Panel, tell your iBook how it's hooking to the
bridge (USB port or Ethernet). Open the iBook's Chooser. Click
AppleShare. Double-click the LC icon. Log in, and an icon will
appear on the desktop. Whew! You can finally start draggin' and
droppin' files to the iBook.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah: What software do you suggest for my iBook? I do word
processing and use databases and spreadsheets. Price is key. I'm a
grad student on a limited income.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Nowadays, most new computers come with bundled software.
Your swift little iBook has AppleWorks. It's a jack-of-all-trades
app that does all three. It also has nifty paint and graphics
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah: How do I erase my old data, and where can I donate my
LC and printer?
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Don't drag files to the Trash. Someone could ``untrash''
them. Lots of file-trashing apps exist. Surfing turned up
SafeDelete for $10.
(www.macinsearch.com/infomac2/disk/safe-delete-128.html). It'll
work on the LC and iBook. Get free Internet access and download the
application to the iBook. Transfer it to your LC, and start
zapping. To donate equipment, ask schools, churches and charities.

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.)

 &HT;    Purveyors of online news let you personalize the look
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's nothing more annoying than a TV newscast or
nightly newsmagazine that uses enticing teases so you'll stay tuned
for a great story later in the program.
</P>
<P>
   You sit and you wait for the news you want while newscasters
drone on about all kinds of things which, however newsworthy, just
don't interest you.
</P>
<P>
   If you surf the Web for news from the big sites like CNN, MSNBC
or ABCNews.com, things are slightly better. The news story you want
is there _ you just have to point and click a few times to get to
it. Yes, it is a better mousetrap for a quick news hit. The Web
gives you the ability to get the latest headlines without waiting
for the networks or even CNN Headline News to get to it.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any Silicon Valley billionaire will tell you, the key to
a successful Web site is personalization. The more personal the
connection between the user and the Web site, the more likely it is
that users will come back. Order just one book from Amazon.com, and
you will always and forever receive a cheery quasi-personal
greeting. We all know it's just a pile of technology programmed to
remember who we are and what we like, but it does serve a purpose _
to provide users with a personalized experience they won't find on
TV or in most brick-and-mortar department superstores.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get news you can use from the Web is to
personalize your online experience. Give up a little information
about yourself, and you'll get the news or the products you want
without wading through pages of things you don't want or don't care
about.
</P>
<P>
   If you give MSNBC your ZIP code, it will give you your local
weather forecast and a few local news headlines in addition to the
national stories it regularly features. It will also track three
stocks and provide local sports news if you select either option.
No registration is required, and there's no danger in letting MSNBC
know your ZIP code. If you don't play the market or hate sports,
you can tell MSNBC you don't want that information, and zap, it's
gone faster than you can say ``reload.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN will allow you to personalize your start page, too, as do
most of the major search engines. Yahoo, Snap, Lycos and even
Internet service providers such as EarthLink let you personalize a
start page with only the information you want, whether it's news,
sports, music, stocks or even horoscopes and a currency converter.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites will personalize news, weather and sports with just a
ZIP code, but if you want specifics, you have to register.
Registration usually means handing over your name, birthday and
e-mail address to the search engines. They'll also ask you if they
can send you information or give your name to their advertisers so
they can try and sell you things.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do to keep the prying eyes of advertisers and
search engines away is remember to uncheck all the pre-checked
boxes asking for your approval.
</P>
<P>
   After you wade through the registration process, you'll go right
to your personal page, but it's not personal yet. Now is the time
to decide what kind of news you want and from whom. Do you want
just sports scores for teams in your area, or do you want to add
some different ones? Do you want your horoscope daily, or would you
rather see how your stocks are doing?
</P>
<P>
   Among the personal start pages found on search engines, each
offers a variety of news and tools you can add to your page. Snap
is best for online content, with snippets of news from a variety of
publications ranging from Salon to U.S. News and World Report to
Athlete Daily.
</P>
<P>
   At the top corner of nearly every start page, you are offered
options, and every box of information can be edited.
</P>
<P>
   The range of choices can be mind-boggling. If the bright yellow
that Lycos uses as the default color on its personal page is
working your nerves or your eyeballs, you can just point and click
and change it.
</P>
<P>
   Designing your own personal start page is a bit like editing
your own online newspaper. You can decide what color scheme you
want, or how big you want the information boxes to be, or how many
news items you want to see at one time. Do you want to put the list
of local theaters and times ahead of the ski and snow report? Or
maybe you want your search function on top followed by world news
then local news headlines. This kind of thing can keep you busy for
hours. You can tinker with these pages once a year or once a day as
your interests change.
</P>
<P>
   Web skeptics may argue that giving any site, even your own
access provider, any information about yourself or your habits
online isn't a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you do have to tell these sites a bit about yourself before
you can proceed. But in return for letting them know who visits
their site, you get a page tailor-made for you. If you don't want
to wait for traffic on the threes or weather on the eights, it's a
reasonable trade-off.

 &HT;    The mundane isn't so blah, academic journal discovers
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is hard to remember that what we see on television
is not reality, but a small chunk of it.
</P>
<P>
   Stay home sick some day and watch TV. Teenage hookers and their
pimps. Moms who hit on their daughters' boyfriends. A woman who
married a millionaire stranger on prime time television complaining
about losing her privacy.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not convinced by lunch that this is a Jerry Springer
nation, you'll know by Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it helps to stem the flow. Turn off the television.
Put down the tabloid rag. Don't listen to talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   But every so often, you'll have to do more than just ignore the
noise. You'll need to feed the normal stuff.
</P>
<P>
   That's where The Journal of Mundane Behavior comes in.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal Web site (www.mundanebehavior.org/), hosted by the
Sociology Department at California State University, Fullerton, is
``devoted to the study of the `unmarked' _ those aspects of our
everyday lives that typically go unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Issues can be read online or downloaded in Adobe Acrobat reader
format. The Adobe software can be downloaded, for free, from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to the first issue, Managing Editor Scott
Schaffer, a Cal State Fullerton professor, says, ``Most of us don't
live Jerry Springer lives. We get up at some ungodly hour, commute
an insane distance to work, live in a 6-foot by 6-foot cubicle for
eight or more hours, reverse the insane commute and go home to `our
lives.' This amounts to probably 60 percent of our lives, and the
editors here think that this vast amount of energy, effort, and in
some cases, sheer drudgery, deserves some attention. But this is
not the only part of our lives. ... The editors of Journal of
Mundane Behavior believe that the everyday, the earthly, the
worldly, represents a part of what is sacred about our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   With their attention to minute, mundane detail, the submissions
tend to read like failed Nicholson Baker novellas. They are written
by scholars with a similar audience in mind, so they are not for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue contains a piece on Japanese elevator etiquette.
Americans apparently barely acknowledge fellow elevator passengers,
staring straight ahead and waiting for their floor to arrive or
carrying on conversations with a friend in front of strangers. The
Japanese, however, see elevators as recess, according to the piece.
A chance to break from their culture's otherwise strict mold.
Another piece looks closely at the relationship between spatial
organization and social action as it relates to looking for a book
in a library.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting (read: accessible) pieces looks at
what facial hair, and a man's tendency to let it grow, says about
masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   Or, according to the introduction, it is an ``analysis of the
ways in which `masculinity' as a gender construct and a politicized
tool of identity formation are presented through a person's facial
hair.''
</P>
<P>
   If you thought a beard was just a beard, think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many are the men who grow beards to compensate for a receding
hairline, or a balding pate, resexualizing the image they present
to the world, just in case the world thinks they are starting to
flag. ... `I am a man,' says the beard, even before the man himself
has opened his mouth, a gaping hole in a hairy surround, grunting
his joy and his sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beard has never been without political significance. In
simple terms man presents his face to the world and it is known by
the hair that can grow upon it (and similarly women present their
faces to the world and they are known by their hairlessness).
Biology has little to do with the ways in which such attributes are
displayed; in fact it is conformity to a structured image which is
actually put on show.''

 &HT;    Evolution of computing is tough on lovers of DOS
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here of late I've gotten lots of mail from computer
users who are being dragged kicking and screaming, or at least
reluctantly, from good old days of DOS into the bewildering modern
world of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   One fellow, as I mentioned recently, was trying to figure out
how to print a DOS test file with the DOS PRINT command through an
MS-DOS window to his dot-matrix printer. The PRINT command no
longer seems to be available.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help him because I can't remember how to create a DOS
text file _ assuming I ever knew. The logical thing, it seems,
would be to see if the file can't be called up in Word or Wordpad
and printed.
</P>
<P>
   Another gentleman has two computers _ the one he uses, on which
he still runs some version of MS-DOS, and another on which some
version of Windows is installed and which he evidently avoids as
much as possible. Framework, he says, does everything he needs to
do.
</P>
<P>
   He's wondering, however, whether he could install Framework on
the Windows machine and somehow run it there.
</P>
<P>
   Framework? How many of you even remember Framework? It appears
only dimly through the haze of my memory. It was one of those
multifunction DOS-based programs that worked from a central point
and provided word processor, spreadsheet and database. Framework
never really made a big hit. Its publisher, once a major player,
sank below the waves of Windows long ago.
</P>
<P>
   My best advice to him was, if the Framework disks would fit in
his newer computer's drive, to go ahead and try it. Either it will
run or it won't, and I would bet on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   I think I understand his position.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around in DOS wasn't an easy thing to learn. The
programs that ran under its aegis generally were pretty thorny,
too. But once you learned DOS and its commands, you could deal with
problems that arose. You could do some serious trouble-shooting.
You were a pretty good shade-tree mechanic, and if a system gasped
and died you could usually get it back on the road pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Then here comes Windows, which at first was just a poor
imitation of the Macintosh interface. It didn't really start
running very well until version 3. You still had DOS, pretty well
intact, down under the crankshaft, and WINDOWS.INI and SYSTEM.INI
were easy to deal with. The engine compartment was a lot more
complicated and it was stuffed full; a lot harder to work on, but
it could still be done if you wanted to make the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Most people did. Some, however, looked at the new models and
applied a curious kind of logic to the situation. They thought,
``What can this thing do for me that I need done?'' To some, the
answer was ``nothing. There's nothing I want to do that I can't
already do.'' That flies in the face of American consumerism, and
it might be subversive, but so far there's no law against it.
</P>
<P>
   However, it can get sticky after a while. Programs still run,
but the hardware and peripherals they require become more of a
problem. The programs may not wish to share space with modern
versions. The Frameworker may have to either jump into the modern
world of the Registry, which is in no way as easy to deal with as
DOS or earlier Windows versions, or just wipe all that stuff off
his new computer, install MS-DOS V.6, and keep on truckin'.

 &HT;    You needn't upgrade all your computer components at once
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The trouble with loving gadgets is that I have a
difficult time resisting them. So my house is beginning to look
like a second-hand electronics shop, with ham radio gear in the
basement, stereo stuff on the first floor, and the big-screen TV
and its assorted amplifiers and speakers up on top.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that _ with all the money I'm spending _ I'll be
scrounging for partially eaten cabbages in the trash bin behind the
Kroger store. Since some of you might be in the same boat _ after
all, we nerds seem to hang out together _ I thought we'd talk today
about some ways to save some money when it comes to computers.
We'll do it by bucking a trend in computer retailing.
</P>
<P>
   If you walk down the aisles of a computer store, you'll see that
most of the systems are bundled. You end up getting the computer,
monitor, all sorts of accessories, a printer and sometimes a
scanner. The system also is packed with software and sometimes
comes with a free Internet offer.
</P>
<P>
   All that sounds good, but in some ways, it's like going to the
grocery store to buy a roast to cook for Sunday and ending up with
a package deal that includes the plates, glasses, some wine and
even the knives and forks.
</P>
<P>
   The smart way to buy computers _ and this will help you stay up
in a world where today's fastest machine is a techno-dinosaur by
tomorrow _ is to treat a computer system like a stereo outfit.
Today you might buy a really good set of speakers, then replace the
amplifier in a year or so, each time getting really good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   You can do the same thing with computers. By buying just one
component at a time and gradually replacing the weak links in your
system, you can spread out the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a lot more advantages than that to my system.
</P>
<P>
   Since all of us have different ways we use a computer, by
replacing your system a component at a time, you can gradually
create a system that is tailored to your needs.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you a few ``for instances.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's say I'm a computer gamer. I'd want to spend most of my
money on a high-end video card to handle the graphics and maybe a
really terrific monitor, but skimp on things like a printer and a
scanner.
</P>
<P>
   Or if my thing were the Internet, I could buy a low-end
processor and spend money for a fast connection (either DSL or a
cable modem). What I'm saying is that a computer system is just
that _ a system _ and you can assemble the components that suit the
way you use it.
</P>
<P>
   There's still another leg to this strategy: Identify the
components you won't likely have to replace every year or so and
spend money on top-end components that are unlikely to go out of
date.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some of you might want to look into a really cool
flat monitor, or a regular monitor that's 19 to 21 inches. If you
get a good monitor now, it'll probably last you through three or
four computers.
</P>
<P>
   Printers also are a relatively stable component. Inkjet printers
have gotten a lot better over the past three or four years, and the
top-end models today are liable to last for a long time. It's the
same with scanners and digital cameras _ both are much improved,
and one that is good today is likely to remain usable for years.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow my strategy, you'll soon be in the position of
just replacing your computer processor, as needed. If you get a
midrange computer as far as speed, it may well last you for two or
three years if your prime use is e-mail, letters and simple tasks
like figuring your taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Try my system. I have a selfish motive, of course. If I can save
you some money, maybe there won't be as much competition at the
trash bin behind Kroger for those cabbages.

 &HT;    Inventor hopes seat belt indicator will save lives
 &HT;    By Glenn Evans
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILMER, Texas _ Ronald Slaughter has an idea he hopes will be
hitting the road soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've been working on for the last 2 1/2
years,'' the Gilmer resident said before demonstrating the Ace
Safety Device, for which a patent is pending and on which he
anticipates the U.S. Patent Office to bestow full blessing during
2000.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype of Slaughter's invention installed inside his
Cadillac lets him know whether the seat belts inside the car are
being used. Each buckle includes sensors wired to four tiny red
lights mounted on the dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Another four lights, these yellow, are mounted on the rear
windshield. These tell people outside whether the people inside the
car are buckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the number of belts you have, that's the number of
lights you would have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost a brother who was not wearing his seat belt during a
1995 traffic accident, Slaughter's mind naturally steers toward
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The device is named in honor of his brother, Angelo Eugene
Slaughter, whose nickname was Ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the wreck) was the week before the seat belt law was
enforced in Texas,'' Slaughter said, describing the evening his
brother's car pool from Lone Star Steel encountered a semi-trailer
truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one sad story after another. This idea came to me on
Sept. 22, 1997, and I call it a gift from God. I went to my
computer and drew it up, and that's where I got my start.''
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter said every state has a different approach to seat
belts, and auto manufacturers await a national safety belt bill
before they will be willing to seriously discuss the added feature.
Meanwhile, he said Bill Clinton announced the Presidential
Initiative for Seat Belt Use in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are talking about saving lives,'' he said. ``When a
drunk driver gets in a car, the last thing he is thinking about is
fastening a seat belt. ... ``
</P>
<P>
   Slaughter, a native of Gary, Ind., moved to Gilmer 27 years ago
with the bride he met at Wiley College. Mary Jo Slaughter, a
third-grade teacher at Daingerfield Elementary, is from the Buckeye
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call her my co-inventor,'' Slaughter said.

 &HT;    Syphon Filter returns
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that Syphon Filter is back. The
counter-terrorism game (which was meant to be a more action-packed
``Metal Gear Solid'') wowed us with its shooter-type gameplay. It
also had a pretty compelling storyline. 989 Studios's Syphon Filter
2 ($55, Playstation; www.989studios.com) surpasses the old Syphon
Filter in plot, and it offers a slew of new game functions. Your
task is to stop the Syphon Filter virus from being spread to
terrorists. To do this, you need to use brute force and an arsenal
that would make any action hero shout with joy (night vision
rifles, grenade launchers, crossbow, etc.). The game also offers an
addictive, two-player side-by-side mode. In this mode, you can play
the unsinkable Gabriel Logan while your partner in crime plays Lian
Xing. Blast your way to glory and save the world for us all.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   As many video games as have been made using the Star Wars
license, you'd think a game that took three years to develop would
blow us out of our collective seats. Unfortunately, LucasArts' new
Star Wars game, Force Commander ($40 for the PC, www.lucasarts.com)
does that, but in the wrong way: the game makes you want to get out
of your chair and take a walk just to get away from your computer.
Commander, a real-time-strategy game with 3D units and movement, is
nice to look at on first glance, but several problems emerge. The
game interface is clunky and needlessly complex. The background and
character graphics aren't as detailed or breathtaking as they
should be. And the control of the game's point of view is dodgy at
best. All of it combines to make an experience that is more
frustrating than fun. Star Wars fans deserve a great, awe-inspiring
strategy game along the lines of last year's stunning Homeworld,
but unfortunately, this is not the game they're looking for.

 &HT;    A mystical ride with Mulan
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Though this NewKidCo. product is, indeed, a
PlayStation CD-ROM, Disney's Mulan ($38; www.newkidco.com) is not a
video game per se; it's more of an interactive plaything from the
Disney's Story Studio line that encourages and coaxes kids through
various problem-solving and motor-skills lessons. Terrific and
friendly voice-over work blends story development with pleasant
tutorial as players guide Disney's cross-dressing heroine through a
series of activities, such as bathing and getting dressed, playing
Mahjong and a game of dodge ball as Mulan makes her way down an
avalanche-plagued slope in her back yard. Ultimately, with no way
to lose and with all the problems and conundrums completed, Mulan
is crowned the Imperial Storymaker and can henceforth create her
own stories, play sing-along Karaoke style or paint her own story
boards. Harmless and pleasant interactive fun from the preeminent
early childhood Zen masters at NewKidCo.

 &HT;    Web a rich source of sites for sore eyes (runny noses, too)
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is a time of year when even the grass blooms.
There are flowers, sunshine and enough pollen to sneeze at.
</P>
<P>
   The Web itself can't stop your eyes from itching or your nose
from running, but it can lead you to a number of places where
you'll get advice and help that may turn your red eyes back to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   Allernet at www.allernet.com/default.asp is a great place to
start because _ unlike some of the other sites we will visit today
_ it's totally devoted to allergies. If you had just one site to
visit for help, this would be the one.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there is a link to a section that explains just
what allergies are in simple terms. That may not stop you from
sneezing, but a basic knowledge of the condition will help you
treat it intelligently. You'll also find pollen forecasts so you'll
know what types of pollen are active now, as well as a section of
hints on treating allergies. There you'll learn that mold is often
a bigger problem for some people than pollen, and you'll find some
ways to avoid exposure to mold.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop is at the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of
America's Web site at www.aafa.org/. One nice feature of this page
is a list of questions that you can answer _ sort of a mini-self
test _ that will help you determine if your problem is actually
caused by an allergy. Just as is true with computers and computer
viruses, there are times when other problems are actually blamed on
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   For some, a little in-person understanding and support is
needed. You'll find a link on this page that will take you to a
list of support groups that you can find in your area. If you are a
health professional eager to learn more about allergies, you'll
find a link to specialized material that provides more in-depth
information.
</P>
<P>
   When people think of medicine and disease, the Mayo Clinic often
comes to mind. The famous clinic has a Web site with a section that
deals with allergies. If you go to
www.mayohealth.org/mayo/common/htm/allergy.htm, you'll find what
seems to be a complete and well-organized section on allergies.
</P>
<P>
   POLLEN, MOLD AND FOOD
</P>
<P>
   One of the nice features of this site is the diversity of
allergy information. While _ especially this time of the year _
most people are thinking of pollen and mold allergies, that's
surely not the complete picture of what's out there. You'll find
information on this site about other kinds of allergies, including
allergic reactions to food.
</P>
<P>
   But don't worry, you'll also find the expected _ information
about how to keep going when the pollen is flying. If you're a real
allergy maven _ you'll probably qualify if you visit each of the
sites listed today _ you may want to take the interactive allergy
quiz to find out just how much you do know about allergies.
</P>
<P>
   The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology runs a
terrific site at allergy.mcg.edu/. Since the site is run by
physicians, it's not surprising that one of the features here is a
locator service that will let you specify the area of the country
you live in and get a list of board-certified allergy physicians.
</P>
<P>
   One feature you'll find especially useful is the ability to
search the site. That way, if you're curious about a particular
condition or medicine or topic, you'll have a better chance of
either finding it or discovering immediately that it isn't covered
by this site.
</P>
<P>
   The site is fairly complete, however, and a search for the
medicine Claritin, used as a decongestant, produced four hits with
solid information.

 &HT;    Purveyors of online news let you personalize the look
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's nothing more annoying than a TV newscast or
nightly newsmagazine that uses enticing teases so you'll stay tuned
for a great story later in the program.
</P>
<P>
   You sit and you wait for the news you want while newscasters
drone on about all kinds of things which, however newsworthy, just
don't interest you.
</P>
<P>
   If you surf the Web for news from the big sites like CNN, MSNBC
or ABCNews.com, things are slightly better. The news story you want
is there _ you just have to point and click a few times to get to
it. Yes, it is a better mousetrap for a quick news hit. The Web
gives you the ability to get the latest headlines without waiting
for the networks or even CNN Headline News to get to it.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any Silicon Valley billionaire will tell you, the key to
a successful Web site is personalization. The more personal the
connection between the user and the Web site, the more likely it is
that users will come back. Order just one book from Amazon.com, and
you will always and forever receive a cheery quasi-personal
greeting. We all know it's just a pile of technology programmed to
remember who we are and what we like, but it does serve a purpose _
to provide users with a personalized experience they won't find on
TV or in most brick-and-mortar department superstores.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get news you can use from the Web is to
personalize your online experience. Give up a little information
about yourself, and you'll get the news or the products you want
without wading through pages of things you don't want or don't care
about.
</P>
<P>
   If you give MSNBC your ZIP code, it will give you your local
weather forecast and a few local news headlines in addition to the
national stories it regularly features. It will also track three
stocks and provide local sports news if you select either option.
No registration is required, and there's no danger in letting MSNBC
know your ZIP code. If you don't play the market or hate sports,
you can tell MSNBC you don't want that information, and zap, it's
gone faster than you can say ``reload.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN will allow you to personalize your start page, too, as do
most of the major search engines. Yahoo, Snap, Lycos and even
Internet service providers such as EarthLink let you personalize a
start page with only the information you want, whether it's news,
sports, music, stocks or even horoscopes and a currency converter.
</P>
<P>
   Many sites will personalize news, weather and sports with just a
ZIP code, but if you want specifics, you have to register.
Registration usually means handing over your name, birthday and
e-mail address to the search engines. They'll also ask you if they
can send you information or give your name to their advertisers so
they can try and sell you things.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do to keep the prying eyes of advertisers and
search engines away is remember to uncheck all the pre-checked
boxes asking for your approval.
</P>
<P>
   After you wade through the registration process, you'll go right
to your personal page, but it's not personal yet. Now is the time
to decide what kind of news you want and from whom. Do you want
just sports scores for teams in your area, or do you want to add
some different ones? Do you want your horoscope daily, or would you
rather see how your stocks are doing?
</P>
<P>
   Among the personal start pages found on search engines, each
offers a variety of news and tools you can add to your page. Snap
is best for online content, with snippets of news from a variety of
publications ranging from Salon to U.S. News and World Report to
Athlete Daily.
</P>
<P>
   At the top corner of nearly every start page, you are offered
options, and every box of information can be edited.
</P>
<P>
   The range of choices can be mind-boggling. If the bright yellow
that Lycos uses as the default color on its personal page is
working your nerves or your eyeballs, you can just point and click
and change it.
</P>
<P>
   Designing your own personal start page is a bit like editing
your own online newspaper. You can decide what color scheme you
want, or how big you want the information boxes to be, or how many
news items you want to see at one time. Do you want to put the list
of local theaters and times ahead of the ski and snow report? Or
maybe you want your search function on top followed by world news
then local news headlines. This kind of thing can keep you busy for
hours. You can tinker with these pages once a year or once a day as
your interests change.
</P>
<P>
   Web skeptics may argue that giving any site, even your own
access provider, any information about yourself or your habits
online isn't a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you do have to tell these sites a bit about yourself before
you can proceed. But in return for letting them know who visits
their site, you get a page tailor-made for you. If you don't want
to wait for traffic on the threes or weather on the eights, it's a
reasonable trade-off.

 &HT;    Nothing mousy about Boomslang
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Where Microsoft's ``IntelliEye'' reinvented the
mouse by replacing the intrinsic track-ball with an optical laser
sensor, Karna has improved on the original mouse concept by using a
laser to read the track ball. Karna's Razer Boomslang 2000 ($100;
www.razerzone.com) offers a frightfully fast and accurate interface
for any PC video game using the mouse and keyboard, such as first
person shooters. As a USB device, the sexy-looking Boomslang is
able to transmit more input information faster; its controller chip
has a much higher reading resolution at 2000dpi (400dpi is typical
in a typical mouse) and can cover the screen in about one-fifth the
motion. The trackball of the Boomslang is placed near the heel
rather than dead center, proffering finer poise as it practically
hovers under your hand. The Boomslang also offers on-the-fly, ``in
game'' sensitivity adjustment via a button and the scroll-wheel
and, ultimately, gives gamers much more refined and varied control
by greatly reducing the throw of the mouse, allowing greater range
of character movement and aim without the need to reset or
re-center. Watch your frag count soar.

 &HT;    Special Newsweek tells how to employ Net as career tool
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More and more people are turning to the Web to find a
job. The Internet is full of sites that offer classified ads, help
with writing a resume and job tips.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a maze navigating all the various sites, and some are
excellent while others are just a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a special edition of Newsweek, called ``How to Use
the Internet to Choose or Change Careers,'' is worth your time.
You'll discover the magazine's views on the hot cities of the new
economy and find job-search tips and ways to make an e-mailed job
query work for you.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails and you find that you need to change careers,
you'll find an article that offers a guide to various graduate
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Are there days when you are stuck in traffic and get the crazy
desire for back roads and deserted highways where you can safely
put the pedal to the metal?
</P>
<P>
   Well, they're harder to come by _ besides, it's dangerous. But
there is a computer game that lets you drive fast, take crazy
chances and still keep your life and your auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The game is called ``Rally Championship,'' and it comes from
Electronic Arts. You can read about it at
www.ea.com/rallychampionship, or just drop by your favorite
software store and pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need a Windows PC with a 266-megahertz or faster
processor and a burning desire for speed.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   There are Web sites that offer jokes, weather forecasts and even
the population of Des Moines, Iowa. Plenty of sites also want to
sell you something.
</P>
<P>
   But humanitarian groups also have a presence on the Web. While
the pages may not be as flashy, there's a lot of socially conscious
information to be had.
</P>
<P>
   One page in particular, the Human Rights Watch World Report 2000
at www.hrw.org/wr2k/, may be of interest if you have a world view.
</P>
<P>
   You can simply click on the country that interests you and find
out about the political climate there and of any abuses. Like most
activist groups, there is a definite point of view here. But it
makes for fascinating reading whether or not you agree.
</P>
<P>
   The next time you're in San Francisco, you may find the world
famous Exploratorium, a really nifty hands-on science museum and
exhibit, worth a visit.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like to take a sneak peek right now, you can check
out the Web site at www.exploratorium.edu.
</P>
<P>
   You'll actually be able to participate in some of the exhibits,
including one called the Fading Eye.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the link for that on the page, along with plenty of
other family-rated activities, including the online store where you
can buy unusual gifts.

 &HT;    Mac's iBook a good step up
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki: I've had a Mac LC and HP printer since 1990,
and I'm awaiting a new iBook and Dell printer (a birthday present
from my parents). I have questions about the transition.
</P>
<P>
   _Jeremiah Gold-Hopton,
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Your folks are happenin'. Graduating from a slow, but
sure, LC to a shiny new iBook is a good leap. Your questions are
relevant to lots of people going from older Macs to sleek iBooks
and iMacs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah: I mainly do word processing. What's the best way to
transfer my data from LC to iBook? Is there a way to connect them,
or do I use floppies? My LC can't get online, so e-mail isn't an
option.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Moving data can be as easy as buying an iBook floppy drive
(about $85). The floppy generation is on its way out, but the drive
still will be useful down the road. If your files are big, or there
are gobs, try File Sharing. It lets you move items by networking
Macs. Because your LC and iBook don't share common network
connectors (the iBook has USB and Ethernet; the LC has serial), you
need a device to make a ``bridge.'' Look for a Localtalk/Ethernet
bridge or adapter to connect the Macs (about $90 to $100, cables
included).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Yeah, the bridge lets them see each other. Hang with me
through these steps. Connect a serial cable from the bridge to the
modem or printer port on the back of the LC. Run the USB or
Ethernet cable from the bridge to the iBook. On the LC, turn on
File Sharing in Control Panel. Then, ``allow guests to connect'' in
the Users and Groups Control Panel. Click on the LC hard drive icon
on your desktop. Pick Sharing from the File menu. Next, via the
Appletalk Control Panel, tell your iBook how it's hooking to the
bridge (USB port or Ethernet). Open the iBook's Chooser. Click
AppleShare. Double-click the LC icon. Log in, and an icon will
appear on the desktop. Whew! You can finally start draggin' and
droppin' files to the iBook.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah: What software do you suggest for my iBook? I do word
processing and use databases and spreadsheets. Price is key. I'm a
grad student on a limited income.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Nowadays, most new computers come with bundled software.
Your swift little iBook has AppleWorks. It's a jack-of-all-trades
app that does all three. It also has nifty paint and graphics
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah: How do I erase my old data, and where can I donate my
LC and printer?
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Don't drag files to the Trash. Someone could ``untrash''
them. Lots of file-trashing apps exist. Surfing turned up
SafeDelete for $10.
(www.macinsearch.com/infomac2/disk/safe-delete-128.html). It'll
work on the LC and iBook. Get free Internet access and download the
application to the iBook. Transfer it to your LC, and start
zapping. To donate equipment, ask schools, churches and charities.

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.)

 &HT;    Evolution of computing is tough on lovers of DOS
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here of late I've gotten lots of mail from computer
users who are being dragged kicking and screaming, or at least
reluctantly, from good old days of DOS into the bewildering modern
world of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   One fellow, as I mentioned recently, was trying to figure out
how to print a DOS test file with the DOS PRINT command through an
MS-DOS window to his dot-matrix printer. The PRINT command no
longer seems to be available.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help him because I can't remember how to create a DOS
text file _ assuming I ever knew. The logical thing, it seems,
would be to see if the file can't be called up in Word or Wordpad
and printed.
</P>
<P>
   Another gentleman has two computers _ the one he uses, on which
he still runs some version of MS-DOS, and another on which some
version of Windows is installed and which he evidently avoids as
much as possible. Framework, he says, does everything he needs to
do.
</P>
<P>
   He's wondering, however, whether he could install Framework on
the Windows machine and somehow run it there.
</P>
<P>
   Framework? How many of you even remember Framework? It appears
only dimly through the haze of my memory. It was one of those
multifunction DOS-based programs that worked from a central point
and provided word processor, spreadsheet and database. Framework
never really made a big hit. Its publisher, once a major player,
sank below the waves of Windows long ago.
</P>
<P>
   My best advice to him was, if the Framework disks would fit in
his newer computer's drive, to go ahead and try it. Either it will
run or it won't, and I would bet on the latter.
</P>
<P>
   I think I understand his position.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around in DOS wasn't an easy thing to learn. The
programs that ran under its aegis generally were pretty thorny,
too. But once you learned DOS and its commands, you could deal with
problems that arose. You could do some serious trouble-shooting.
You were a pretty good shade-tree mechanic, and if a system gasped
and died you could usually get it back on the road pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Then here comes Windows, which at first was just a poor
imitation of the Macintosh interface. It didn't really start
running very well until version 3. You still had DOS, pretty well
intact, down under the crankshaft, and WINDOWS.INI and SYSTEM.INI
were easy to deal with. The engine compartment was a lot more
complicated and it was stuffed full; a lot harder to work on, but
it could still be done if you wanted to make the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Most people did. Some, however, looked at the new models and
applied a curious kind of logic to the situation. They thought,
``What can this thing do for me that I need done?'' To some, the
answer was ``nothing. There's nothing I want to do that I can't
already do.'' That flies in the face of American consumerism, and
it might be subversive, but so far there's no law against it.
</P>
<P>
   However, it can get sticky after a while. Programs still run,
but the hardware and peripherals they require become more of a
problem. The programs may not wish to share space with modern
versions. The Frameworker may have to either jump into the modern
world of the Registry, which is in no way as easy to deal with as
DOS or earlier Windows versions, or just wipe all that stuff off
his new computer, install MS-DOS V.6, and keep on truckin'.

 &HT;    You needn't upgrade all your computer components at once
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The trouble with loving gadgets is that I have a
difficult time resisting them. So my house is beginning to look
like a second-hand electronics shop, with ham radio gear in the
basement, stereo stuff on the first floor, and the big-screen TV
and its assorted amplifiers and speakers up on top.
</P>
<P>
   Which means that _ with all the money I'm spending _ I'll be
scrounging for partially eaten cabbages in the trash bin behind the
Kroger store. Since some of you might be in the same boat _ after
all, we nerds seem to hang out together _ I thought we'd talk today
about some ways to save some money when it comes to computers.
We'll do it by bucking a trend in computer retailing.
</P>
<P>
   If you walk down the aisles of a computer store, you'll see that
most of the systems are bundled. You end up getting the computer,
monitor, all sorts of accessories, a printer and sometimes a
scanner. The system also is packed with software and sometimes
comes with a free Internet offer.
</P>
<P>
   All that sounds good, but in some ways, it's like going to the
grocery store to buy a roast to cook for Sunday and ending up with
a package deal that includes the plates, glasses, some wine and
even the knives and forks.
</P>
<P>
   The smart way to buy computers _ and this will help you stay up
in a world where today's fastest machine is a techno-dinosaur by
tomorrow _ is to treat a computer system like a stereo outfit.
Today you might buy a really good set of speakers, then replace the
amplifier in a year or so, each time getting really good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   You can do the same thing with computers. By buying just one
component at a time and gradually replacing the weak links in your
system, you can spread out the cost.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a lot more advantages than that to my system.
</P>
<P>
   Since all of us have different ways we use a computer, by
replacing your system a component at a time, you can gradually
create a system that is tailored to your needs.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you a few ``for instances.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's say I'm a computer gamer. I'd want to spend most of my
money on a high-end video card to handle the graphics and maybe a
really terrific monitor, but skimp on things like a printer and a
scanner.
</P>
<P>
   Or if my thing were the Internet, I could buy a low-end
processor and spend money for a fast connection (either DSL or a
cable modem). What I'm saying is that a computer system is just
that _ a system _ and you can assemble the components that suit the
way you use it.
</P>
<P>
   There's still another leg to this strategy: Identify the
components you won't likely have to replace every year or so and
spend money on top-end components that are unlikely to go out of
date.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some of you might want to look into a really cool
flat monitor, or a regular monitor that's 19 to 21 inches. If you
get a good monitor now, it'll probably last you through three or
four computers.
</P>
<P>
   Printers also are a relatively stable component. Inkjet printers
have gotten a lot better over the past three or four years, and the
top-end models today are liable to last for a long time. It's the
same with scanners and digital cameras _ both are much improved,
and one that is good today is likely to remain usable for years.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow my strategy, you'll soon be in the position of
just replacing your computer processor, as needed. If you get a
midrange computer as far as speed, it may well last you for two or
three years if your prime use is e-mail, letters and simple tasks
like figuring your taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Try my system. I have a selfish motive, of course. If I can save
you some money, maybe there won't be as much competition at the
trash bin behind Kroger for those cabbages.

 &HT;    Battle over Elian: What's next?
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The United States government told Elian Gonzalez's
relatives in Miami to speed up their court fight over trying to
gain custody of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   If they refuse, the government could return the 6-year-old to
Cuba immediately.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a branch of the U.S. government ordered Elian
returned to his father in Cuba. The boy's Miami relatives filed a
lawsuit to keep him in America. A Miami court dismissed their
lawsuit last week.
</P>
<P>
   The family has said it will take the case to an appeals court in
Atlanta. That court could review and overrule the other court's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government says it doesn't want to keep the boy away
from his father longer than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found in November clinging to a raft off the coast of
Florida. The boy and his mother were trying to escape Communist
Cuba and made a dangerous voyage across the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   OSCARS FOUND
</P>
<P>
   Willie Fulgear didn't win best actor or best director at the
Academy Awards on Sunday, but he was honored for his honesty last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old salvage man was given $50,000 for recovering the
Oscar statues that were stolen two weeks ago. He found 52 Oscars in
a trash heap. Three are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody says honesty don't pay, send them to me,'' Fulgear
said.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver who worked for the company that delivers the
awards has been charged with stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the front page of the Living section to see who did
win the Academy Awards.

 &HT;    The kid academy gives: Thumbs up to `Toy Story 2'
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Buzz and Woody, take a bow. You and your movie, ``Toy
Story 2,'' were among the big winners in our eighth annual Oscar
Junior poll, in which we asked metro Atlanta kids to name their
favorite flicks and stars of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' took top honors in the ``best movie'' category.
Buzz and Woody were named ``best buddies,'' and Woody snagged the
prize for ``coolest cartoon character.''
</P>
<P>
   Also finishing strong was ``Star Wars: Episode 1 _The Phantom
Menace,'' which won for ``best special effects.'' Natalie Portman,
who played Queen Amidala in the space adventure, won in the
category of ``best acting by a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   And we can't count the mouse out: ``Stuart Little'' did well,
too, finishing second to ``Toy Story 2'' in the best movie category
by a mere 14 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' also was the No. 2 movie for which you'd most
want a sequel. Only six more kids would rather see a follow-up to
``Star Wars: Episode 1'' than ``Stuart Little.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley Joel Osment, who played the kid who sees ghosts in ``The
Sixth Sense,'' scared up the award for ``best acting by a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sandler got goofy in ``Big Daddy'' and won the prize for
``silliest grownup'' by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   The light-saber duel between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn in
``Star Wars: Episode 1'' spooked the most voters and was named
``scariest scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting in our poll were more than 700 Atlanta area readers,
including 130 who filled out our first-ever online ballot.
</P>
<P>
   (We confess that the vote isn't scientific _ some kids didn't
vote in every category, and we have a sneaking suspicion that some
of you onliners voted more than once.)
</P>
<P>
   Here is a list of the Oscar Junior winners:
</P>
<P>
   Best movie: ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Best acting by a girl : Natalie Portman in ``Star Wars: Episode
1 _ The Phantom Menace.'' (Portman barely beat ``Inspector
Gadget's'' Michelle Trachtenberg by only 12 votes.)
</P>
<P>
   Best acting by a guy: Haley Joel Osment in ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Silliest grown-up: Adam Sandler. (Sandler crushed the
competition. He had 494 votes. Matthew Broderick in ``Inspector
Gadget'' got only 85 votes.)
</P>
<P>
   Coolest cartoon character: Woody in ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Best special effects: ``Star Wars: Episode 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Best buddies: Woody and Buzz in ``Toy Story 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Scariest scene: Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn duel with light
sabers in ``Star Wars: Episode 1.''
</P>
<P>
   I would most like to see a sequel of: ``Star Wars: Episode 1.''
(So close! ``Stuart Little'' got 165 votes compared to ``Star Wars:
Episode 1's'' 171 votes.)

 &HT;    The mundane isn't so blah, academic journal discovers
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It is hard to remember that what we see on television
is not reality, but a small chunk of it.
</P>
<P>
   Stay home sick some day and watch TV. Teenage hookers and their
pimps. Moms who hit on their daughters' boyfriends. A woman who
married a millionaire stranger on prime time television complaining
about losing her privacy.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not convinced by lunch that this is a Jerry Springer
nation, you'll know by Oprah.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it helps to stem the flow. Turn off the television.
Put down the tabloid rag. Don't listen to talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   But every so often, you'll have to do more than just ignore the
noise. You'll need to feed the normal stuff.
</P>
<P>
   That's where The Journal of Mundane Behavior comes in.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal Web site (www.mundanebehavior.org/), hosted by the
Sociology Department at California State University, Fullerton, is
``devoted to the study of the `unmarked' _ those aspects of our
everyday lives that typically go unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Issues can be read online or downloaded in Adobe Acrobat reader
format. The Adobe software can be downloaded, for free, from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   In the introduction to the first issue, Managing Editor Scott
Schaffer, a Cal State Fullerton professor, says, ``Most of us don't
live Jerry Springer lives. We get up at some ungodly hour, commute
an insane distance to work, live in a 6-foot by 6-foot cubicle for
eight or more hours, reverse the insane commute and go home to `our
lives.' This amounts to probably 60 percent of our lives, and the
editors here think that this vast amount of energy, effort, and in
some cases, sheer drudgery, deserves some attention. But this is
not the only part of our lives. ... The editors of Journal of
Mundane Behavior believe that the everyday, the earthly, the
worldly, represents a part of what is sacred about our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   With their attention to minute, mundane detail, the submissions
tend to read like failed Nicholson Baker novellas. They are written
by scholars with a similar audience in mind, so they are not for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue contains a piece on Japanese elevator etiquette.
Americans apparently barely acknowledge fellow elevator passengers,
staring straight ahead and waiting for their floor to arrive or
carrying on conversations with a friend in front of strangers. The
Japanese, however, see elevators as recess, according to the piece.
A chance to break from their culture's otherwise strict mold.
Another piece looks closely at the relationship between spatial
organization and social action as it relates to looking for a book
in a library.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting (read: accessible) pieces looks at
what facial hair, and a man's tendency to let it grow, says about
masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   Or, according to the introduction, it is an ``analysis of the
ways in which `masculinity' as a gender construct and a politicized
tool of identity formation are presented through a person's facial
hair.''
</P>
<P>
   If you thought a beard was just a beard, think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many are the men who grow beards to compensate for a receding
hairline, or a balding pate, resexualizing the image they present
to the world, just in case the world thinks they are starting to
flag. ... `I am a man,' says the beard, even before the man himself
has opened his mouth, a gaping hole in a hairy surround, grunting
his joy and his sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beard has never been without political significance. In
simple terms man presents his face to the world and it is known by
the hair that can grow upon it (and similarly women present their
faces to the world and they are known by their hairlessness).
Biology has little to do with the ways in which such attributes are
displayed; in fact it is conformity to a structured image which is
actually put on show.''

 &HT;    Speakers made to blend in
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As the television screens in home theater setups
keep getting larger, the speakers for the audio portion of the
systems seem to be getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using massive speakers that sit on the floor, many
home theater enthusiasts are getting full theater sound from
speakers that can be built into walls or set inconspicuously on a
bookshelf.
</P>
<P>
   Morel Ltd., an Israeli company, won an Innovation Award at this
year's Consumer Electronics Show for a grapefruit-sized home
theater satellite speaker designed to blend with modernistic decor.
</P>
<P>
   The Innovation Award committee said, ``The SoundSpot SA-2 is a
uniquely designed two-way surround speaker that provides audiophile
performance from within a small and elegant enclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   Each SoundSpot SA-2 has a separate driver for its 4-inch
midrange and bass speaker and its tweeter. The midrange speaker is
housed in a steel globe, and the tweeter is housed in a separate
compartment attached to the top of the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The steel globes come in sand-roughened silver, black or white
with color-coordinated fabric speaker grill covers.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers are attached to a base that can be set on a shelf
or attached to a wall or ceiling. The SA-2 is magnetically shielded
so speakers also can be placed directly on top of a television.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker base swivels to point the sound in whatever
direction the user chooses. Also available are stands that allow
the speakers to be placed on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers operate on 15 to 150 watts of power and have a
frequency range of 60 to 22,000 Hz, according to Morel.
</P>
<P>
   A retail outlet in Port Orchard, Wash., is the only store in the
United States that currently carries the SoundSpot SA-2 speakers,
but they can be ordered directly from the company in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman said the speakers were being offered at
$616 a pair at the time this article was prepared, but anyone
wishing to purchase must contact the company by mail or e-mail for
an up-to-date quote.
</P>
<P>
   Morel also manufacture less-expensive home theater satellite
speakers in the SoundSpot line as well as subwoofers and center
channel speakers. The company makes car stereo and other home
theater accessories, too.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on Morel products, visit the company's Web
site at www.morel.co.il. The site includes links to contact the
company by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The company's mailing address is Morel (IL) Ltd., 17 Hamazmera
St., P.O. Box 712, Ness Ziona 70400, Israel.

   THE SOUNDSPOT SA-2 SPEAKERS are fun and functional.

   AUDREY _ Let's face it: Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts are as

snickered when Hewitt wanted to play the glamorous, stick-thin
Audrey Hepburn in a TV movie. After all, Hepburn was flat-chested.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Scientists have recently
discovered a thumb-size primate species that lived in China 42
million years ago. It may help resolve missing links in the
evolutionary pattern as well as cast doubt on our exclusively
African origins. The tiny critter weighed only one-third of an
ounce and ate bugs at night. Interesting stuff, but I can tell you
right now my mother wouldn't like it one little bit. (Schuett, Cox

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA, Fla. _ All mechanical breakdowns are not

attached to machinery. This is the point when mechanical failure no

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; CRIES UNHEARD: Why Children Kill. The Story of Mary Bell &LR;  By
Gitta Sereny. Owl/Holt, $16. Drawing on extensive interviews with
an Englishwoman who murdered two boys in 1968 when she was 11, the
author examines the troubling question of how society should deal
with children who commit violence. ``This is an extraordinarily
important and powerful work,'' Alex Kotlowitz wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1999. ``It will agitate, provoke and poke and
prod your preconceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLIZZARD OF ONE: Poems &LR;  By Mark Strand. Knopf, $15. In this
Pulitzer Prize-winning collection, the eminent poet approaches the
universal through the universal, apprehending a snowflake, for
example, not in its particularity but as linked to a continuum of
snowflakes outside and inside the reader's consciousness. His
magisterial verse evokes a godless world that returns our gaze with
a blank stare, and he offers only small consolations and rare
``spectral glimpses'' of poetic epiphany. ``Strand's willingness to
grapple at this dim frontier has a salutary, lone-wolf quality that
makes him more interesting as his voice mellows and ages,'' Deborah
Garrison wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A PRAYER FOR THE DYING &LR;  By Stewart O'Nan. Picador USA, $13. The
sheriff of a small Wisconsin town is driven to the brink of madness
by a crisis brought on by twin plagues: a diphtheria epidemic and
advancing brush fires that threaten the lives of the quarantined
townspeople. Last year the reviewer Patrick McGrath called this ``a
fine, terse novel about the circumstantial nature of evil and the
terrible fragility of man.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STANDING IN A RIVER WAVING A STICK &LR;  By John Gierach.
Fireside/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13. This literate collection of
fly-fishing essays resembles an angler's book of days. ``It is as
fine a representation of outdoor writing as you're likely to find _
wise, funny and well wrought,'' Jeff MacGregor wrote in The New
York Times Book Review last year. ``Gierach is sly and smart and
writes a clean, purposeful line of prose.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BRIEF INTERVIEWS WITH HIDEOUS MEN &LR;  By David Foster Wallace.
Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.95. Moral fervor bubbles through these
unconventional stories about male selfishness, which are populated
by ``monstrous, parodic versions of Updikean characters,'' Adam
Goodheart said in 1999. ``Even when Wallace's postmodernist
chemistry projects simply fizzle out, there is always at least a
whiff of genius.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FARM SHE WAS &LR;  By Ann Mohin. Bridge Works, $13.95. This
poetic first novel about a tenacious 90-year-old woman struggling
to endure on her family's farm in upstate New York celebrates the
sounds and sensations of the barnyard. ``The particulars of her
seemingly humble life ... make her about as entertaining as any
real person could be,'' Sally Eckhoff wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PLAYING FOR KEEPS: Michael Jordan and the World He Made &LR;  By
David Halberstam. Broadway, $14. In canvassing the dazzling career
of the basketball superstar, Halberstam depicts his subject as not
only a top-flight hoopster but a top-flight pitchman. ``Halberstam
delivers ... insight, balance, analysis'' and hard-dug facts, Ira
Berkow said in 1999. ``He skillfully skirts hagiography.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; MICHAEL JORDAN AND THE NEW GLOBAL CAPITALISM &LR; , by Walter
LaFeber (Norton, $12.95), a historian uses Jordan's popularity and
the worldwide profitability of the sportswear maker Nike to issue a
polemic on the corrosive effects of American capitalism abroad.
Last year the reviewer Jay R. Mandle said LaFeber begins with
``sound premises'' but fails to make a very persuasive case.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OF CABBAGES AND KINGS COUNTY: Agriculture and the Formation of
Modern Brooklyn &LR;  By Marc Linder and Lawrence S. Zacharias.
University of Iowa, $21.95. This timely study of the effects of
unchecked suburban sprawl charts the transformation of
turn-of-the-century Brooklyn from a rural community into a tightly
packed urban center. The result is a ``thoughtful and well-written
history,'' Keith Schneider wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS: An Oral History of Manhattan From the
1890s to World War II &LR; , by Jeff Kisseloff (Johns Hopkins
University, $19.95), is a sweeping collage of voices drawn from 10
city neighborhoods. In 1989 the reviewer Meredith Tax said
``Kisseloff is a sensitive interviewer'' and his book ``has
wonderful passages.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MODEL BEHAVIOR &LR;  By Jay McInerney. Vintage Contemporaries, $11.
A young magazine writer gets dumped by a beautiful model and
searches for meaning amid the decadent glamour of New York. Sound
familiar? In 1998 the reviewer A.O. Scott found this return to the
terrain of ``Bright Lights, Big City'' to be a mixed bag.
``McInerney is a gifted and exasperating writer,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SINKING OF THE ODRADEK STADIUM &LR;  By Harry Mathews. Dalkey
Archive, $11.95. In a series of madcap letters, an American
intellectual in Miami Beach and his Asian wife, who is living in
Italy, chronicle their fitful search for a treasure supposedly lost
off the Florida coast in the 16th century. In 1975 the reviewer
Edmund White called this futuristic novel ``a comic masterpiece.''

IN ELOQUENT STASIS, HAVANA AWAITS A NEW ERA

   In Havana, everything waits. Forty-one years after Fidel Castro
came down from the hills to claim Cuba's then-vibrant capital, the
island has become, says photographer Stephen Crowley, ``a giant
waiting room.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, Cuba has lost its place in the
superpower confrontation and lost its life-sustaining subsidies
from the Soviet Union. Virtually no Latin American governments look
admiringly on Castro or his regime anymore. Instead, 11 million
people live out the tail end of a revolution, on an island cut off
and no longer of vital interest to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   So Cubans have made lives out of waiting. They wait for a house
to move into, for their turn at the bread line, to buy newspapers
that later in the day will be used as toilet paper. They wait for
dollars, for a visa to the United States, for a ride, for a package
with life-saving medicines, for the lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   There is neither joy nor community in their desuetude.
Contemplating the length of another day, people sit on the curb or
listlessly stand next to each other, isolated, wrapped up in their
own worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Under the harsh tropical light, only the architecture seems
alive. The sensuous curves of Art Deco and the concrete and steel
of a later era are unexpectedly fluid. Whole buildings seem to
change by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   But the people of Cuba, together, yet alone, wait as if
suspended in time, in the calm before the storm. &QR;

E-MAIL IS TREACHEROUS. SO WHY DO WE KEEP TRUSTING IT?

<P>
   If Microsoft Corp.'s e-mail storage system had been as flawed as
the one at the White House, the software company might have been
spared many of the more painful moments in its continuing antitrust
battle with the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   But the absence of electronic messages that were supposed to
have been saved on White House computers may not prove any less
embarrassing for the Clinton administration than the vast e-mail
archive behind the government's antitrust case was to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Court filings disclosed last week that the Justice Department
has opened a criminal investigation into whether White House
officials suppressed e-mail messages subpoenaed in investigations
of the administration. Because of a glitch in the White House
electronic mail system, thousands of messages were not saved in a
way in which they could be conveniently searched to comply with
subpoenas dealing with campaign fund raising, Monica Lewinsky and
other matters.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether White House officials who knew of the glitch
understood its implications and tried to cover it up. But whether
or not they did, and whether or not any of the missing mail is
relevant to the subpoenas, the investigation underscores the value
placed on e-mail as a particularly revealing window on the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And as it unravels, the case may once again highlight the
persistent assumption among e-mail users _ despite overwhelming
evidence to the contrary _ that their electronic correspondence is
private. (It may also highlight the misconception that historians
no longer have paper trails to follow.)
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Lt. Col. Oliver North unwittingly proved that
e-mail, so apparently ephemeral, is harder to expunge than paper
documents comfortingly run through a shredder. North thought he had
deleted electronic messages regarding his assistance in providing
arms to Nicaraguan rebels, but it turned out that he had neglected
to eliminate the back-up copies.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, a wave of court cases based on e-mail has mounted.
In the Microsoft trial, the credibility of company's chairman, Bill
Gates, was undermined when he flatly denied in his deposition what
he had previously written in electronic exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Microsoft trial, many companies issued strict
policies governing employees' use of e-mail. Yet people continue to
send such messages that they would never commit to a written
document _ and save them. Henry H. Perritt Jr., dean of the Chicago
Kent College of Law, said, ``What the Microsoft case showed is that
people need to think about e-mail as a form of writing, as opposed
to a telephone call or a face-to-face conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   So why don't they?
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be the seductive quality of computer
communication, which encourages the belief that words are
disappearing into the ether. ``In a public situation, you are
clearly aware of people listening,'' said Sara Kiesler, a professor
of human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. ``But
on a computer you have to monitor yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the apparently intractable human tendency to blab
electronically, several companies are proposing to fight technology
with technology.
</P>
<P>
   Sendmail, whose software handles most of the world's electronic
mail traffic, is working with others on a standard that would
enable senders to control whether their e-mail can be forwarded by
the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, appropriately named Disappearing Inc., is
developing an encryption system that would enable senders to set a
date when their such mail would no longer be readable.
</P>
<P>
   But there is concern that such features could also dampen
enthusiasm for a medium whose speed and simplicity has made it a
hugely popular form of communication. ``A hard problem is how to do
this in a way that doesn't take away from the trillion messages
that are being sent each day,'' said Greg Olson, president of
Sendmail. ``This is a very delicate evolution.''

<P>
   Remember Clairol's catchy slogan from the 1950s, ``Hair color so
natural, only her hairdresser knows for sure''?
</P>
<P>
   In recognition that hair stylists may know more secrets about
their clients than merely cosmetic ones, new programs are being
established by community-based organizations and state agencies to
help hairdressers identify signs of domestic violence. These
programs are trying to take advantage of the bond that often exists
between hairdressers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Each year 3 to 4 million women are beaten in their homes,
according to the Justice Department. In 1998, the latest year for
which data are available, homicide figures gathered by the FBI
showed that 32 percent of the women slain in this country are
killed by their husbands, former husbands, boyfriends or former
boyfriends. If stylists can spot the signs early, they could refer
abused women to social service agencies and support groups.
</P>
<P>
   The New London Rotary Foundation in Connecticut awarded Susan
O'Toole of the Women's Center of Southeastern Connecticut a $1,000
grant last summer to teach hairdressers how to recognize domestic
violence and sexual assault. Participating salons post hot line
numbers, display brochures and make referrals to social service
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Boyd-Frenkel, domestic violence ombudsman for the
attorney general of Nevada, is working with the state board of
cosmetology to develop a training program for cosmetology teachers
and school administrators, who would earn continuing education
credits.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevada's program does not turn stylists into crisis workers.
Instead, according to its training brochure, it teaches them how to
ask the right questions. The brochure warns the hairdresser when
dealing with her client: ``Don't offer advice. Especially, do not
advise her to leave, without knowing how dangerous such a choice
might be for her.'' The brochure also emphasizes the importance of
confidentiality, saying, ``A slip to another client or to another
stylist can result in increased danger to the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Torn-out hair or a bruised eye may signal abuse, but more subtle
warning signs may come out in conversation. One Nevada hairdresser,
Boyd-Frenkel said, told of a client who said: ``My husband doesn't
want me to see my friend anymore. He says she is putting bad ideas
in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotional abuse, intimidation, control, jealousy,
overpossessiveness and constant monitoring,'' she said, can be as
sure signs of domestic violence as physical injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Psychotherapists are not particularly thrilled to cede any
ground to hairdressers. ``Hairdressers are being placed in a role
that they have little training for,'' said John Reid, a clinical
psychologist practicing in San Antonio. ``They may get in over
their heads in terms of the therapeutic relationship and issues
like transference and countertransference. Plus, taking on this
role could get them smack dab into the family dynamics if the
husband finds out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other skeptics note that confidentiality _ a legal duty for
physicians and therapists _ is merely professional etiquette for
hairdressers. They might be too neutral and nonjudgmental in the
interest of maintaining a business relationship.
</P>
<P>
   These misgivings are not confined to therapists. An editorial in
the Las Vegas Review-Journal in February blasted the Nevada
program, invoking the notion of the slippery slope, asking whether
bartenders will be the next group required ``to take government
courses on how to snitch out their customers'' to enforce laws on
domestic violence or child support.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one person's slippery slope is another's vista of
opportunity. The Women's Center of Southeastern Connecticut hopes
to extend its training to bartenders, as well as taxi drivers and
veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, hairdressers have been taught to advise their
clients of the importance of mammography and breast
self-examinations. In Los Angeles, city administrators have held
luncheons with hairdressers to hear what their clients think about
city life. In Nashville, Shears United, a program of a local AIDS
organization, uses beauty parlors to discuss HIV prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Although the phenomenon of the hairdresser, bartender or
personal trainer who acts as a ``paid friend'' may be the result of
today's social isolation and the anomie that arises with far-flung
families, television and the Internet, it is hardly new. A number
of articles on the subject were published in the 1970s. In
``Hairdressers as Caregivers'' (American Journal of Community
Psychology, 1979), the psychologist Emory L. Cowen and his
colleagues wrote that the jobs of ``informal agents'' like
bartenders, barbers, beauticians and cab drivers ``bring them into
contact with interpersonally distressed people.'' Interviews with
90 hairdressers defined the atmosphere of what the authors called
the ``beauty parlor surround'' and revealed that most hairdressers
enjoyed dealing with their clients' personal problems, gratified at
the trust placed in them. One of the survey respondents even
claimed he could infer the emotional state of his client from the
condition of her hair. The psychologists were skeptical,
dismissively so, noting the hairdresser ``offered no dandruff
counts, oil density or sheen measures _ no `objective data'
whatsoever'' to bolster his claim.
</P>
<P>
   But the insight that comes from pounds of journal articles can
be gleaned from a wisp of fiction. Dorothy Allison got it right in
her novel ``The Cavedweller'' (Dutton, 1998), when she described
hairdressers as ``priestesses of appreciation and encouragement.''
It is an apt phrase for the beauticians many Americans bare their
souls to year in, year out.

mainstream only provide evidence of its power and vibrancy.

THE HARD BUSINESS OF SOFT MONEY

   WASHINGTON _ ``They call us the fathers of soft money,'' Bob
Farmer says, and he's not preening. Neither is Bob Mosbacher, the
other hangdog dad.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Farmer, the top money man for Michael Dukakis and the
Democratic Party, and Mosbacher, finance chairman for George Bush
and the Republicans, were the kings of campaign fund-raising. More
than that, they earned a place in political history by starting the
first national programs to raise soft money, the large,
unrestricted gifts to the two parties by wealthy individuals,
corporations and labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them have lived to feel some regret over their fiscal
ingenuity (though not, it must be said, the victories it
contributed to). Today, Farmer says it's high time Washington
passed campaign finance reform legislation. ``Obviously, money in
politics is totally out of control,'' he says. Mosbacher agrees
that ``it's gotten totally out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's about to get worse, predicts Jeffrey Birnbaum, author
of ``The Money Men'' (Crown Books), a forthcoming book about
political fund raising. ``There will be far more soft money than
ever before,'' he says. Experts on campaign finance agree, some
estimating that during the 2000 elections the two parties could
collect as much as $500 million in soft money contributions. That's
up from $262 million four years ago, when there were widespread
fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum says that the Clinton-Gore money team has taken soft
money to a new level. ``At one time in the Democratic Party, it was
time to celebrate if they got a $50,000 check,'' he says. ``Now a
host of wealthy Democrats are expected to fork over $100,000 or
more every year.'' The Republicans, Birnbaum adds, ``are hungry for
victory, having been out of the White House for eight long years.''
More than 50 wealthy Republicans have joined the Regents, which
costs them $250,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from the sidelines, Farmer and Mosbacher sound a little
like those physicists who came to regret having invented nuclear
weapons, which set off the arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1988, Farmer says, he feared that the Republicans, who
held the White House, would raise so much money they would swamp
the Democrats. So he came up with the idea of asking wealthy
supporters to write $100,000 checks to the Democratic Party. They
got a fancy name, the Democratic Trustees, and although the money
they gave went into party coffers, most of it was spent to help the
Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned about the Democrats' program, Mosbacher says, he
worried about being outpaced, so he promptly copied their idea,
calling the Republican version Team 100. Mosbacher says Vice
President George Bush didn't like the idea. ``He moaned and
groaned,'' Mosbacher recalls. ``He foresaw it as something that
would be perceived as someone getting clout for making a big
contribution.'' But he went along with Mosbacher's argument that
the Republicans would be ``left in the lurch'' if they left the
soft money field to Farmer. That year, Farmer recruited 130
Democratic Trustees, while Mosbacher drew 267 members to Team 100.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1988, soft money played an insignificant role, though it
was permitted by a loophole in the post-Watergate federal election
laws passed in 1974, which allowed unrestricted donations to
political parties for party-building activities, like voter
registration drives. Legal challenges to close the loophole have
failed, much to the benefit of presidential candidates, to whom
direct contributions from individuals are limited by law to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The soft money reaped by the two parties in 1988 was a pittance
compared with today, when almost every political leader, from
President Clinton on down, reserves large blocks of time for wooing
big contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' Farmer says. ``They are all spending all
their time on the phone asking for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore has challenged Gov. George W. Bush not to
accept soft money, but even as he issued his proposal, his party's
largest benefactors were invited to a series of lunches. In
Manhattan last Wednesday, for example, Gore raised more than
$700,000 for his party from about 75 donors at two lunches. The
Republican Party will also raise huge amounts of soft money to
support Bush, who has already raised more than $70 million in hard
money for his presidential campaign, an unprecedented sum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, $100,000 donations have become commonplace. And some
of the high rollers from 1988 are rolling higher today. Richard T.
Farmer, an Ohio executive who was one of the original Team 100
members, gave $445,000 to the Republican Party last year. Carl
Lindner, another Ohio executive who was one of Farmer's big
supporters, gave the Democratic Party $270,000 last year, according
to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bob Farmer and Mosbacher, now that they no longer spend
their days raising money, favor campaign finance reform. But they
doubt that Sen. John McCain's bill to ban soft money or the other
proposals now debated in Congress would work. Farmer, who served as
President Clinton's consul general to Bermuda and now runs a
high-tech company in Miami, would like legislation mandating free
or discounted television time for presidential candidates.
Mosbacher, chairman of a Texas energy company, thinks that if
corporate soft money is banned, independent spending by labor
unions must be constrained.
</P>
<P>
   But neither option, Farmer says, will shut the door on soft
money. ``The problem with campaign finance reform,'' he says, ``is
that every time you close one loophole, you open others.''

REMEMBERING JEAN SHEPHERD: PECULIAR RIFFS ON AMERICA

<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's start with a supportable thesis, and duly credit a master:
For pure listening satisfaction it's hard to improve on the
seductive intimacy of radio.
</P>
<P>
   From 1956 to 1977, Jean Shepherd held weeknight seminars on
WOR-AM in New York that were part Kabuki, part commedia dell'arte,
part Uncle Remus. In his flat, nasal Indiana twang, playing all the
parts, and the occasional kazoo, he oozed into the darkened
bedrooms of East Coast America on the battery power of cheap
Japanese transistor radios. The meandering stories he told _ they
always came back to the point,  &UR; always &LR;  _ were usually about him.
But they also seemed to be about us _ about the old man, family car
trips, the Catch-22 Army and a cast of playmates from childhood and
adolescence, through whom all the complexities of life on earth
would be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   What was he? Social commentator? Cult leader? Or just a manic
kid from a blue-collar background discovering his subversive id in
the age of Eisenhower? It was Shepherd, after all, who alerted
America to the scourge of ``creeping meatballism,'' the postwar
rush to a conformist society where happiness meant cars with tail
fins and a refreshing, ice-cold bottle of Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing department at WOR never deciphered his demographic
silhouette. The station fired him in 1977, over frustration with
his format. Shepherd continued to write books (``In God We Trust,
All Others Pay Cash,'' ``Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories
and Other Disasters'') and went on to make films for public
television and delve into other broadcasting venues from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
   His death last October at age 78 proved a catalyst for a
memorial by his admirers, among them the humorist Harry Shearer and
Art Silverman, associate producer of ``All Things Considered'' on
National Public Radio. With others they put together a two-hour
show of reminiscences as well as generous chunks from Shepherd's
programs. The result, ``A Voice in the Night,'' was broadcast last
Christmas Eve on KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in April, the program will be distributed to public
radio stations around the country to schedule as they wish. In New
York, WNYC-AM will broadcast the show May 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an insatiable appetite for one-way conversation,'' said
Silverman, recalling some off-the-air encounters in which he felt
more like audience than companion.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common refrain among those who knew Shepherd, one that
may help explain why he worked alone, with rarely anything more
than a newspaper clipping in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the radio tribute follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ By CHARLES STRUM
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Shepherd essays cannot easily be excerpted;
their point may not become evident until the very last moments of
the show, when his equestrian musical theme, ``The Bahn Frei
Polka'' by Eduard Strauss, kicks in over his peroration. The
following is his prelude to a piece about how he _ a child of
meatloaf and mashed potatoes _ came to taste his first plate of
escargot, and thus his first taste of the wider world: (END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   At a certain age in life, when you're _ oh, I'd say _ roughly
between 15 and 19, possibly, although that, you know, is subject to
change, you really believe you know what it's about. You really,
seriously think you've got life by the you-know-what. And you
really know what it's about. And you can't figure out why all these
other people, usually older people, keep saying that things are not
what they seem to be. What do you mean they're not? They are. You
really believe it.
</P>
<P>
   And then, then, of course, as you get older, you begin to have
faint inklings, faint inklings of what an ignoramus you have been
up to this point in life. And it's just beginning to dawn on you
what an unbelievable ignorant slob you are now.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Another opening gambit: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be _ wouldn't it be fascinating if we had preserved,
actually preserved, really preserved just, just the way he was, you
see, with his armor on and everything, a Roman gladiator? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Well, let me tell you this: that you will be just as great an
attraction 2,000 years from now. If we could preserve you, any one
of you _ even, even the nothingest of us, me, any of us, you know _
we'd be fascinating to a guy 2,000 _ here's a real 20th-century
man, just the way he was, sitting there with that funny look on his
face, kind of sad, obviously suffering from post-Ed Sullivan shock,
just sitting there with a limp old copy of TV Guide in his hand,
one shoelace open.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, you know how, like we really are, you know, with a hole
in the sock. The whole business. Sitting there. You'd be a real
specimen. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And after a thousand years, you'd be great. Really, you'd be _
you'd be famous, you'd be in a museum in a case. And after 2,000
years, you'd be bigger than the Rosetta stone. And you're nothing
now, you know that.

</P>
<P>
   I think Americans are the only people in the world today, I
really do, who really, literally, spend most of their time _
whether it's in politics, whether it's in satire, art, fiction, you
name it _ breast beating, baring its soul and proclaiming to the
heavens how rotten it is. And of course everybody around agrees.
You go to England, you go to France, they all agree loudly, 'cause
it lets them off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   They've been plugging all day long, on the air, that you should
get out and vote. Well . . . this is one guy who says there's a lot
of you who shouldn't. I've heard a lot of you discuss politics and
I'm worried, when I think of you guys voting. I'm really serious.
You know, they seem to think here in America that voting in itself
is a positive virtue. In fact, I heard one spot by some friendly
lady who does a program here on WOR that seemed to say in spite of
the fact you don't know anything about it, and don't let that stop
you, get out and vote, and thereby you will nullify the vote of
somebody who does know something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all right, I'm just merely saying voting itself, friends,
is not a virtue, and if you don't know anything about it, stay
away. You're liable to get us all in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) When seeing is not always believing: (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   One of the secret desires that all kids have is to be invisible
and to, you know, to sneak somehow, nobody would see you, see. And,
well, of course, not only kids want to do that. But this is a kid
thing, and this leads to all kinds of things. For example, there
used to be a thing advertised in the back of Popular Mechanics, and
also Boy's Life, when I was a kid, and it said See-Through X-Ray
Eyes. Ever seen that thing? It said see through bones, and it shows
a hand that says look through and see your very own bones. This
see-through X-ray eye device enables you to see through anything at
will. Send 10 cents to Johnson &AMP; Johnson. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And about three months later this thing came back, this little
round tube, you know. And it's got what looks like frosted glass or
something on the end of it, see. And the instructions came with it,
a little smudgy piece of paper that showed a kid, you know, looking
through this thing, holding his hand up, and you can see the bones.
And it says the see-through X-ray eye device is very simply worked.
It is worked by placing it to your eye, as shown in diagram A, and
then holding your hand up to the light, as shown by diagram B. Then
if the light is properly adjusted, one will see the bones through
the eyepiece marked C in diagram D. End of instructions.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Eventually, he sees the bones of his hands.
But at school, when he tries to look through the dress of a
classmate, Esther Jane Alberry, he sees nothing: (END ITALICS HERE)

<P>
   I've been had. All of my life I'm going to walk around seeing
the bones of my left hand and my right hand, nothing but the bones
in my mitt. It does not look through flowered print dresses.
</P>
<P>
   So kids, don't believe everything you see. Don't believe every
ad you read.

civil rights march in Washington: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   We left 47th Street. I rode on a bus with maybe 200,000 other
people all riding on buses towards Washington, D.C. And one of the
great things that happened was not, oh, not more than 15 or 20
minutes after we got on the road with the bus, other buses started
to pass us in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   We had a very old, terrible bus. And you know, I'll tell you,
have you ever ridden on a bus, a crosstown bus, all the way to
Washington? I'm serious. A lot of people did. The bus that was with
us was a crosstown bus. They just took the crosstown sign out and
everybody sat on those plastic seats and went all the way to
Washington and back. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I had talked with guys who were planning to go and arranging
this thing. I had all kinds of ideas in my mind about the way it
would be, just like all of us have ideas in our head about what
history is. I'm sure you have ideas about how it must have been
like to be in Germany in the '20s. Well, it wasn't. Not the way you
think it was.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you probably thought _ you have ideas of how it must
have been like at the time Washington was crossing the Delaware.
Forget it. It wasn't. It wasn't the way you think it was. I was not
there. Just know one thing: It wasn't the way you think it was.
</P>
<P>
   And I affirm that VERY FEW THINGS ARE THE WAY YOU THINK THEY
ARE. I say that in caps.

   Let's start with a supportable thesis, and duly credit a master:
For pure listening satisfaction it's hard to improve on the
seductive intimacy of radio.
</P>
<P>
   From 1956 to 1977, Jean Shepherd held weeknight seminars on
WOR-AM in New York that were part Kabuki, part commedia dell'arte,
part Uncle Remus. In his flat, nasal Indiana twang, playing all the
parts, and the occasional kazoo, he oozed into the darkened
bedrooms of East Coast America on the battery power of cheap
Japanese transistor radios. The meandering stories he told _ they
always came back to the point,  &UR; always &LR;  _ were usually about him.
But they also seemed to be about us _ about the old man, family car
trips, the Catch-22 Army and a cast of playmates from childhood and
adolescence, through whom all the complexities of life on earth
would be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   What was he? Social commentator? Cult leader? Or just a manic
kid from a blue-collar background discovering his subversive id in
the age of Eisenhower? It was Shepherd, after all, who alerted
America to the scourge of ``creeping meatballism,'' the postwar
rush to a conformist society where happiness meant cars with tail
fins and a refreshing, ice-cold bottle of Pepsi-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing department at WOR never deciphered his demographic
silhouette. The station fired him in 1977, over frustration with
his format. Shepherd continued to write books (``In God We Trust,
All Others Pay Cash,'' ``Wanda Hickey's Night of Golden Memories
and Other Disasters'') and went on to make films for public
television and delve into other broadcasting venues from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
   His death last October at age 78 proved a catalyst for a
memorial by his admirers, among them the humorist Harry Shearer and
Art Silverman, associate producer of ``All Things Considered'' on
National Public Radio. With others they put together a two-hour
show of reminiscences as well as generous chunks from Shepherd's
programs. The result, ``A Voice in the Night,'' was broadcast last
Christmas Eve on KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in April, the program will be distributed to public
radio stations around the country to schedule as they wish. In New
York, WNYC-AM will broadcast the show May 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an insatiable appetite for one-way conversation,'' said
Silverman, recalling some off-the-air encounters in which he felt
more like audience than companion.
</P>
<P>
   It is a common refrain among those who knew Shepherd, one that
may help explain why he worked alone, with rarely anything more
than a newspaper clipping in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from the radio tribute follow.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Shepherd essays cannot easily be excerpted;
their point may not become evident until the very last moments of
the show, when his equestrian musical theme, ``The Bahn Frei
Polka'' by Eduard Strauss, kicks in over his peroration. The
following is his prelude to a piece about how he _ a child of
meatloaf and mashed potatoes _ came to taste his first plate of
escargot, and thus his first taste of the wider world: (END ITALICS

<P>
   At a certain age in life, when you're _ oh, I'd say _ roughly
between 15 and 19, possibly, although that, you know, is subject to
change, you really believe you know what it's about. You really,
seriously think you've got life by the you-know-what. And you
really know what it's about. And you can't figure out why all these
other people, usually older people, keep saying that things are not
what they seem to be. What do you mean they're not? They are. You
really believe it.
</P>
<P>
   And then, then, of course, as you get older, you begin to have
faint inklings, faint inklings of what an ignoramus you have been
up to this point in life. And it's just beginning to dawn on you
what an unbelievable ignorant slob you are now.

   Wouldn't it be _ wouldn't it be fascinating if we had preserved,
actually preserved, really preserved just, just the way he was, you
see, with his armor on and everything, a Roman gladiator? . . .
</P>
<P>
   Well, let me tell you this: that you will be just as great an
attraction 2,000 years from now. If we could preserve you, any one
of you _ even, even the nothingest of us, me, any of us, you know _
we'd be fascinating to a guy 2,000 _ here's a real 20th-century
man, just the way he was, sitting there with that funny look on his
face, kind of sad, obviously suffering from post-Ed Sullivan shock,
just sitting there with a limp old copy of TV Guide in his hand,
one shoelace open.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, you know how, like we really are, you know, with a hole
in the sock. The whole business. Sitting there. You'd be a real
specimen. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And after a thousand years, you'd be great. Really, you'd be _
you'd be famous, you'd be in a museum in a case. And after 2,000
years, you'd be bigger than the Rosetta stone. And you're nothing
now, you know that.

   I think Americans are the only people in the world today, I
really do, who really, literally, spend most of their time _
whether it's in politics, whether it's in satire, art, fiction, you
name it _ breast beating, baring its soul and proclaiming to the
heavens how rotten it is. And of course everybody around agrees.
You go to England, you go to France, they all agree loudly, 'cause
it lets them off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   They've been plugging all day long, on the air, that you should
get out and vote. Well . . . this is one guy who says there's a lot
of you who shouldn't. I've heard a lot of you discuss politics and
I'm worried, when I think of you guys voting. I'm really serious.
You know, they seem to think here in America that voting in itself
is a positive virtue. In fact, I heard one spot by some friendly
lady who does a program here on WOR that seemed to say in spite of
the fact you don't know anything about it, and don't let that stop
you, get out and vote, and thereby you will nullify the vote of
somebody who does know something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all right, I'm just merely saying voting itself, friends,
is not a virtue, and if you don't know anything about it, stay
away. You're liable to get us all in trouble.''

   One of the secret desires that all kids have is to be invisible
and to, you know, to sneak somehow, nobody would see you, see. And,
well, of course, not only kids want to do that. But this is a kid
thing, and this leads to all kinds of things. For example, there
used to be a thing advertised in the back of Popular Mechanics, and
also Boy's Life, when I was a kid, and it said See-Through X-Ray
Eyes. Ever seen that thing? It said see through bones, and it shows
a hand that says look through and see your very own bones. This
see-through X-ray eye device enables you to see through anything at
will. Send 10 cents to Johnson &AMP; Johnson. . . .
</P>
<P>
   And about three months later this thing came back, this little
round tube, you know. And it's got what looks like frosted glass or
something on the end of it, see. And the instructions came with it,
a little smudgy piece of paper that showed a kid, you know, looking
through this thing, holding his hand up, and you can see the bones.
And it says the see-through X-ray eye device is very simply worked.
It is worked by placing it to your eye, as shown in diagram A, and
then holding your hand up to the light, as shown by diagram B. Then
if the light is properly adjusted, one will see the bones through
the eyepiece marked C in diagram D. End of instructions.

the bones of my left hand and my right hand, nothing but the bones

   We left 47th Street. I rode on a bus with maybe 200,000 other
people all riding on buses towards Washington, D.C. And one of the
great things that happened was not, oh, not more than 15 or 20
minutes after we got on the road with the bus, other buses started
to pass us in the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   We had a very old, terrible bus. And you know, I'll tell you,
have you ever ridden on a bus, a crosstown bus, all the way to
Washington? I'm serious. A lot of people did. The bus that was with
us was a crosstown bus. They just took the crosstown sign out and
everybody sat on those plastic seats and went all the way to
Washington and back. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I had talked with guys who were planning to go and arranging
this thing. I had all kinds of ideas in my mind about the way it
would be, just like all of us have ideas in our head about what
history is. I'm sure you have ideas about how it must have been
like to be in Germany in the '20s. Well, it wasn't. Not the way you
think it was.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you probably thought _ you have ideas of how it must
have been like at the time Washington was crossing the Delaware.
Forget it. It wasn't. It wasn't the way you think it was. I was not
there. Just know one thing: It wasn't the way you think it was.
</P>
<P>
   And I affirm that VERY FEW THINGS ARE THE WAY YOU THINK THEY
ARE. I say that in caps.

PINOCHET'S REVENGE: OLIVER NORTH, YOU'D BETTER WATCH OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine that the year is 2005 and that Oliver North, the retired
Marine lieutenant colonel and former National Security Council
staff member in the Reagan White House, is on trial in Lebanon. He
has been arrested while vacationing in Switzerland on an
international murder warrant issued by Lebanon. The charge is that
he helped direct the 1986 bombings of Libya that killed 31 people.
</P>
<P>
   Libya had long sought his arrest, but in the end it was a
Lebanese judge who obtained it, by joining the case and requesting
that the Swiss authorities detain North and then extradite him to
stand trial in Beirut on charges of crimes against humanity and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine further that North is then convicted and the headline in
one American newspaper roars: ``Military Aide to Reagan Convicted
of Murder for Official Act.''
</P>
<P>
   The events have not happened, of course, but international legal
experts say that in the wake of the near-extradition of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet of Chile to Spain, it is no longer so hard to
imagine a situation in which a former high U.S. official could be
arrested while traveling and then tried in any foreign country, for
crimes alleged to have been committed anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the notion, the likelihood that any nation would
be so brazen is another matter. Issuing an indictment as a
propaganda ploy is one thing; indeed, Libya already has one out on
North. But these days, following through on it could subject the
Libyans to far more than a writ of habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   That is because a law of force still operates in the world, and
it is not hard to imagine another set of headlines: ``U.S. Demands
Release of North; Economic Sanctions Threatened; Warships
Maneuver.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is worth considering what might happen to someone like
North when thinking about the recent rulings _ and precedents set _
in the Pinochet case by the British House of Lords. In 1998
Pinochet, in London for medical treatment, was arrested after a
judge in Spain issued an international warrant based on charges
related to his actions while he was the leader of Chile. The Lords
ruled that he was not immune from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   If the British home secretary, Jack Straw, had not freed
Pinochet earlier this year because of his deteriorating health, he
would have had to face trial in Spain on charges of torture and
political killings during his 17-year rule in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Widely praised by human rights organizations, the rulings have
more quietly raised some eyebrows among former U.S. officials who
now wonder whether they too could some day be extradited _ let us
say, if the United States lost its position as the world's sole
superpower _ and tried any time any judge in the world accuses them
of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, North said, ``It limits my travel to certain
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   It has some legal experts asking: Could Henry A. Kissinger be
put on trial overseas as an architect of policy during the Vietnam
War, which included bombings of Cambodian villages and intensive
bombings of Hanoi?
</P>
<P>
   What about President George Bush or his secretary of state,
James A. Baker III? Could they be held responsible for deaths tied
to economic sanctions related to the Persian Gulf war in Iraq? Or
what about President Clinton? After he leaves office, could he face
trial for the bombings of a factory in Sudan that was mistakenly
believed to be a chemical weapons plant?
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional Republicans have argued against the expansion
of international criminal courts, which they say could hamstring
U.S. leaders who fear being prosecuted after they leave office for
official acts they committed. The legal rulings in the Pinochet
case rejected an argument that the general was immune from
prosecution by virtue of his official status, and legal experts say
the case also expands the power to criminally prosecute certain
human rights violations _ that occur anywhere _ to the courts of
every nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have done is restricted the travel opportunities for
people like Henry Kissinger, Wesley Clark and Bill Clinton,'' said
Michael Byers, a professor of international law at Duke University.
``We have reduced their options in traveling to rogue states and
their allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Vieteretti, the managing director of Kroll Associates,
the New York-based international security firm that provides
personal protection, said his company is now much more concerned
``with a country's laws, its alliances and anything our clients may
have done to anger those nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some former U.S. officials said the FBI has warned
them not to travel to some countries, including some in Europe,
where there is a risk of extradition to other nations interested in
prosecuting them.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Byers says that former U.S. officials do not need to
worry ``unless they are foolish enough to travel to some place like
Iraq.'' Experts say that the reason is simple. If, as the saying
goes, to the victor go the spoils, so too with history: the
triumphant get to tell the story of what happened and to name the
heroes, the pardonably mistaken and the villains when the conflict
has ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political reality is that it is very remote,'' said
Jonathan Charney, a law professor at Vanderbilt University and the
editor of the American Journal of International Law. ``Why? Because
we are the superpower. It would be dangerous for another country to
do that economically, politically and otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Kissinger said he believed that the
``very complicated'' issues surrounding the Pinochet rulings needed
further study. But he added that he was not concerned. ``I don't
think the well-known people are as much in danger,'' he said. ``I
certainly don't worry.''
</P>
<P>
   But North said that all it would take would be the slightest
change in the political winds.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was supported by the British when he was their ally in
the war against Argentina over the Falkland Islands. ``Here is this
person who aided and abetted their cause, helped bring about
democracy,'' North said. ``And now because of this political sea
change in Great Britain, now the country is going to turn him over
to a third-party country to have him prosecuted. That's
disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Derian, the first assistant secretary of state for
human rights, said she could foresee the day when U.S. officials
would be prosecuted for acts similar to those that might be
attributed to Baker, North or Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a stretch right now with the current rules of war and
diplomacy, but I think it is going to come,'' said Derian. ``It
would be interesting to see what would happen if Kissinger went to
Cambodia, or they just put out an international warrant for his
arrest.''

A WEAPON FOR CONSUMERS: THE BOYCOTT RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not since the 1970s, when grape workers and the anti-apartheid
movement were holy causes for millions of Americans, have so many
groups embraced the boycott as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In the most prominent boycott in years, the NAACP has called on
tourists and conventions to shun South Carolina to pressure that
state to remove the Confederate flag atop its Capitol. Also facing
an NAACP boycott, the Adam's Mark luxury hotel chain agreed last
week to pay $8 million, seek minority customers and give its
employees diversity training to get the boycott dropped and to
settle race discrimination lawsuits brought by some offended black
guests and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Gay groups have proposed a boycott of Paramount over a planned
television show starring Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who has called
homosexuals ``biological errors'' and ``sexual deviants.'' Groups
seeking to restore democracy to Burma are sponsoring boycotts
against Best Western, Unocal, Suzuki and other companies that do
business there. Among the companies that labor unions are
boycotting is Kaiser Aluminum, which locked out 2,900 unionized
workers 14 months ago. And the Southern Baptist Convention is
pressing a boycott against Walt Disney Co., charging that it is too
sympathetic to gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times may be ripe for more consumer boycotts,'' said Jeff
Faux, executive director of the Economic Policy Institute, a
research group in Washington. ``We have more of a consumer culture,
and people see themselves more as consumers today. While people are
participating less in the political process, as consumers they see
that one way they can exercise power is by where they spend their
money and where they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The boycott takes its name from an economic war waged by Irish
farmers in the 1880s against an English land agent, Charles
Cunningham Boycott, who refused demands to cut rents during a time
of poor crops. Their subsequent refusal to work his land or sell
him goods forced him to return to England.

<P>
   In the late 1880s American farmers were already shunning
railroads charging exorbitant rates. In 1885 alone, American labor
unions carried out 196 official boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   One boycott that made a profound impression on 20th-century
America was the Montgomery bus boycott, which came after Rosa Parks
famously refused to sit in the back of the bus in 1955 because she
was black. Since then, civil rights activists have repeatedly
embraced boycotts. Two months ago, the television networks agreed
to increase minority hiring after the NAACP threatened a boycott,
charging that few shows featured minority actors.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes boycotts, which require organization and consumer
awareness, fail. Most Americans do not realize that the United Farm
Workers' 1984 grape boycott remains in force. Begun when growers
refused to sign new union contracts, it has largely failed because
the union stopped promoting it when it failed to catch on. Union
officials say it remains in effect because lifting the boycott
would give a victory to the grape growers. In sharp contrast, the
original boycott called by Cesar Chavez in 1967 persuaded millions
of Americans to give up grapes and pressured California growers to
recognize unionized workers and raise wages.
</P>
<P>
   Boycotts can hurt the very people they intend to help. When
anti-sweatshop groups threatened a boycott against apparel from
Bangladesh in the mid-1990s because many factories employed child
labor, the factories simply fired the children, pushing some into
begging and prostitution. Anti-sweatshop groups now generally
oppose boycotts.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP's president, Kweisi Mfume, said his group never rushes
into boycotts. ``This is a trigger you don't want to pull until all
else has failed,'' he said. ``In the case of South Carolina, after
38 years of negotiating even the NAACP has a limit to its
patience.'' As a result, the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce
says, more than 100 conventions and other events have been canceled
in the state, which has lost at least $18 million in tourist
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard Hunter Jr., the chamber's president, said, the
boycott might backfire because it has caused some lawmakers to dig
in. ``One group of legislators,'' he said, ``has used the boycott
very effectively for not taking action, saying, `We're being
blackmailed. If we succumb this time, what are they going to ask
for next?''' The business community, Hunter said, has been working
to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for less controversial tools than a boycott to pressure
Paramount to drop its ``Dr. Laura'' plans, gay groups have deluged
the corporation with calls and e-mail. ``Paramount would never host
a talk show where someone said such nasty things about blacks or
Jews,'' said John Aravosis, who has organized the stopdrlaura.com
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Companies react to boycotts with either compliance or defiance.
After several groups boycotted Pepsi over its Burma ties, the
company stopped doing business there. ``When customers and
consumers contact us, we definitely listen,'' said David De Cecco,
a Pepsi spokesman, who added that the company's action was
consistent with American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Unocal has reacted differently to a boycott over its
investment in a natural gas consortium in Burma. ``We sympathize
with the boycott's goals,'' said Michael Thatcher, a Unocal
spokesman. ``We want to see democracy and economic improvement in
Myanmar. We feel that the way we're doing it is much more likely to
bear positive results than their way, which is to pull out and
isolate the country.''
</P>
<P>
   During the South Africa boycott, the apartheid regime made
similar arguments, saying sanctions were hurting the nation's
blacks in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Desmond Tutu rejected those arguments, saying,
``You get all sorts of people saying all sorts of things about
sanctions: That they will hurt the people you are trying to help.
Twiddle! It's baloney of the first order! Because you are speaking
about people already suffering, and you are saying you are trying
to find some way that is a nonviolent strategy for bringing about
the change that everybody says they want.''

A WEAPON FOR CONSUMERS: THE BOYCOTT RETURNS

<P>
   Not since the 1970s, when grape workers and the anti-apartheid
movement were holy causes for millions of Americans, have so many
groups embraced the boycott as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   In the most prominent boycott in years, the NAACP has called on
tourists and conventions to shun South Carolina to pressure that
state to remove the Confederate flag atop its Capitol. Also facing
an NAACP boycott, the Adam's Mark luxury hotel chain agreed last
week to pay $8 million, seek minority customers and give its
employees diversity training to get the boycott dropped and to
settle race discrimination lawsuits brought by some offended black
guests and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Gay groups have proposed a boycott of Paramount over a planned
television show starring Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who has called
homosexuals ``biological errors'' and ``sexual deviants.'' Groups
seeking to restore democracy to Burma are sponsoring boycotts
against Best Western, Unocal, Suzuki and other companies that do
business there. Among the companies that labor unions are
boycotting is Kaiser Aluminum, which locked out 2,900 unionized
workers 14 months ago. And the Southern Baptist Convention is
pressing a boycott against Walt Disney Co., charging that it is too
sympathetic to gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times may be ripe for more consumer boycotts,'' said Jeff
Faux, executive director of the Economic Policy Institute, a
research group in Washington. ``We have more of a consumer culture,
and people see themselves more as consumers today. While people are
participating less in the political process, as consumers they see
that one way they can exercise power is by where they spend their
money and where they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The boycott takes its name from an economic war waged by Irish
farmers in the 1880s against an English land agent, Charles
Cunningham Boycott, who refused demands to cut rents during a time
of poor crops. Their subsequent refusal to work his land or sell
him goods forced him to return to England.

BRINGING LAWSUITS TO DO WHAT CONGRESS WON'T

<P>
   For more than three decades, gun-control advocates have pressed
lawmakers for stiffer measures, but the gun lobby ensured that they
got nowhere in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Then about two years ago, two dozen cities and counties
nationwide began suing gun producers to recover the costs of
treating gun shot victims.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Faced with the lawsuits and the costs of litigating
them, Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest firearms maker, recently
agreed to make changes in the way it makes and markets handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, cigarette makers had long frustrated public health
activists who sought national legislation aimed at restricting how
tobacco is sold, especially to children. Congress proved unwilling
to buck the tremendous lobbying power of the industry, and nothing
happened. But four years after state attorneys general nationwide
and wealthy plaintiffs' lawyers joined forces to sue the tobacco
companies, the companies reversed field and sued for peace.
</P>
<P>
   These two cases are emblematic of a shift taking place in how
Americans attempt to govern their own society. Over the last few
years, the legal system has begun to overtake the legislative
process as the vehicle to resolve contentious debates, particularly
over unpopular products, when Congress is unwilling to act. Both
the tobacco and firearms litigation, for example, were highly
organized assaults on specific industries.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, lawsuits had been brought by individuals against
both industries with little financial success or effect on company
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were always cases out there, and they were going
nowhere,'' said Susan Koniak, a law professor at Boston University.
``But the law is moving the way it is because of the huge
consolidation of cases that are taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of concentrated legal firepower to set social policy has
stirred sharp debate. Some legal experts have decried such lawsuits
as abusive. Others view them as a problematic but necessary
counterbalance to the powerful control that companies and interest
groups can exert over Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schuck, a law professor at Yale University, said that in
assessing whether to go to court or settle, ``a lot of time a
company has to make a judgment regardless of whether it thinks it
is right on the law.'' But in the case of Smith &AMP; Wesson, which
Schuck doubts would have lost a court case, legal right or wrong
was not the relevant calculation. The problem for the company was
simply that it didn't have the money to roll the dice. And that was
a reality its lobbyists were powerless to change.
</P>
<P>
   Some see this as fundamentally unfair. Walter Olson, a senior
fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research group,
described the type of lawsuits brought against cigarette companies
and gun makers as ``end runs'' around the legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not what litigation is supposed to be,'' said Olson.
``It gathers too much power in the legal system to litigate
everything we used to vote over.''
</P>
<P>
   But others disagree, calling the new legal activism an important
counterweight to the power and resources of corporations. ``We have
a political system that is shaped in a significant fashion by
powerful interest groups that spend their resources,'' said Deborah
Hensler, a law professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   She added that private litigation, because of the resources
wielded by wealthy plaintiffs' lawyers, now represents another
arena where political power resides.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the courts have long been used to shape social
policy. In the 1960s and 1970s, so-called impact litigation was
brought by civil rights groups and other activists to bring about
changes in public policies that legislatures were unwilling to
effect, like reforms in prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   And major litigation against products like asbestos, breast
implants and defective birth-control devices like the Dalkon Shield
also traces back decades. In many of those cases, too,
manufacturers withdrew products from the marketplace even though
regulators had not ordered such actions.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest wave of litigation is fundamentally different,
legal experts said. First, its purpose was to change how cigarettes
and guns are sold, and thus consumed, rather than to eliminate
their use. Legal action, initiated largely by private individuals,
was being used as a tool of social engineering. But these suits
also mark a growing alliance between state and city officials on
one hand and private plaintiffs on the other.
</P>
<P>
   That merger confers on the lawyers political credibility and
quasi-public authority, while endowing the states and cities
frustrated by logjams at the federal level with the entrepreneurial
energies of the legal marketplace. The result is a two-track system
where issues stuck in Congress can now jump off that track into the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Hensler, the Stanford University professor, said she believed
that the development was a mixed blessing. While it does provide
for an increased form of legal activism, the private lawyers who
may end up steering such actions are not answerable to the public
they supposedly represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to ask the question, `Are these the right people to be
leading the charge on the private side,''' she said. ``In the end,
I do get to vote on my congressman, but I don't have any direct
power on the deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expect the recent wave of large-scale litigation to end.
Recently, for instance, some of the lawyers involved in state cases
against the tobacco industry filed lawsuits against health
maintenance organizations for failing to disclose that they gave
financial incentives to doctors who restricted medical services.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jack Weinstein of the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn has
overseen much of the recent wave of product litigation, including
major cases involving firearms and tobacco. Known as a judicial
activist, Weinstein said that he believed the courts would always
probably play a pivotal role in resolving social problems. ``We are
going to have government that takes responsibility or have the
private bar back them up where they are not doing a good job,''
Weinstein said.

   A New Culture War on Campus
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times at Eastern Connecticut State University.
One misstep, one infraction, one drunken dorm party, and a student
can find himself on a bus to Hartford for an evening of Aida or
Carmen or who-knows-what kind of caterwauling.
</P>
<P>
   Opera as punishment was the idea of Kirk Peters, the associate
dean of student affairs, who, himself an opera fan, tried to give
away 15 opera tickets last fall. He plastered posters all over the
campus in Willamantic, but got no takers. ``I couldn't get people
to go, and it was a freebie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during a disciplinary session with 10 freshmen men, he
came up with his diabolically brilliant plan. The 10 had hopped a
fence around a football field during a rainstorm and tore up the
field playing baseball. The standard punishment would have been 10
hours of community service, but he offered to cut off five hours if
they would go to the opera with him.
</P>
<P>
   Eight agreed, and off they went, not only to the opera but to
the pre-opera workshop. The reviews, predictably, were mixed. ``Two
of them absolutely loved it,'' Peters said. ``Four thought it was
just OK, and two said they'd rather pick up trash. They fell asleep
and said it was really tough to sit through it.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 60 students have taken the opera option, Peters
said. About 30 have turned it down. Most of the offenders are men
charged with alcohol-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not apologizing at all,'' Peters said. ``I feel a college
has a responsibility for raising standards.''

   Pope Speaks of Holocaust During Visit to Israel
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish to remember,'' Pope John Paul II said at Jerusalem's
Holocaust memorial, ``to ensure that never again will evil
prevail'' as it did for the Nazis' victims.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is on his first visit to Israel, which the Vatican did
not even officially recognize until 1994, and his plea of ``never
again'' _ coming on top of his recent broad apology for past church
sins _ struck a distinct chord.
</P>
<P>
   While some Holocaust survivors faulted the pope for not going
even further in condemning the church's wartime silence, his visit,
one survivor said, ``marks a turning point for Jews and
Christians.''

   Ruling on Cuban Boy
</P>
<P>
   The international custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
seems to be nearing a conclusion. After a federal judge in Miami
concluded that only Attorney General Janet Reno can grant the boy
asylum, Reno said Elian should be reunited with his father in Cuba
in a prompt, orderly fashion. Lawyers for both sides wrangled over
just how, and if, that would be accomplished. The government wants
lawyers for Elian's relatives in Miami to agree to a speedy
timetable for any appeal of the ruling, but the lawyers have
balked.

   '60s Militant Arrested
</P>
<P>
   H. Rap Brown spent the last 25 years effacing his reputation as
one of the most militant black radicals of the 1960s. He changed
his name to Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, became the imam of his mosque
in Atlanta and helped clean up his impoverished neighborhood. But
his peaceful obscurity was shattered when he was accused of the
shooting of two Atlanta sheriff's deputies, one of whom died.

   Decoding the Fruit Fly
</P>
<P>
   At their annual meeting, biologists who study the Drosophila
fruit fly got a gift: a CD-ROM, courtesy of Celera Corp.,
containing the DNA code for the fly's 13,601 genes. The decoding of
the fly's genome validates a bold strategy that Celera is confident
will work on the human genome. The understanding of the fly's
genome will be of major help in interpreting the human genome.
Wings aside, the organisms have a surprising amount of genetic
equipment in common.

   Court Rules on Student Fees
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment protects the right to speak _ and sometimes
the right not to speak. No one can be forced to salute the flag,
for example. Conservative college students have argued that they
should not have to support causes they disagree with through
mandatory student activity fees.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting that argument, the Supreme Court said the overall
quantity of speech at universities mattered more. Unbounded debate
is central to a university's mission, the court said, and mandatory
fees are constitutional as long as the money collected is
distributed without regard to viewpoint.

   Record Sex-Bias Award

   The Voice of America, the government-run radio service that
broadcasts news about the United States abroad, and its parent
agency agreed to pay a record $508 million to 1,100 women to settle
a sex discrimination case. If the settlement is approved by the
judge overseeing the case, each woman will get at least $450,000.
The suit, which was filed 23 years ago, charges that the women were
denied jobs and promotions with the service.

   Grisly Discoveries in Uganda
</P>
<P>
   The corpses of more than 150 people were found by the Ugandan
police buried under a building used by a doomsday cult involved in
a fire on March 17 in which 500 of its members died.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found about 40 miles from the church at Kanungu
where the 500 members of the cult perished when their church was
set ablaze, the police said. The police said the discovery shed new

   A New Culture War on Campus
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times at Eastern Connecticut State University.
One misstep, one infraction, one drunken dorm party, and a student
can find himself on a bus to Hartford for an evening of Aida or
Carmen or who-knows-what kind of caterwauling.
</P>
<P>
   Opera as punishment was the idea of Kirk Peters, the associate
dean of student affairs, who, himself an opera fan, tried to give
away 15 opera tickets last fall. He plastered posters all over the
campus in Willamantic, but got no takers. ``I couldn't get people
to go, and it was a freebie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during a disciplinary session with 10 freshmen men, he
came up with his diabolically brilliant plan. The 10 had hopped a
fence around a football field during a rainstorm and tore up the
field playing baseball. The standard punishment would have been 10
hours of community service, but he offered to cut off five hours if
they would go to the opera with him.
</P>
<P>
   Eight agreed, and off they went, not only to the opera but to
the pre-opera workshop. The reviews, predictably, were mixed. ``Two
of them absolutely loved it,'' Peters said. ``Four thought it was
just OK, and two said they'd rather pick up trash. They fell asleep
and said it was really tough to sit through it.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 60 students have taken the opera option, Peters
said. About 30 have turned it down. Most of the offenders are men
charged with alcohol-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not apologizing at all,'' Peters said. ``I feel a college
has a responsibility for raising standards.''

prevail'' as it did for the Nazis' victims.

   The pope is on his first visit to Israel, which the Vatican did
not even officially recognize until 1994, and his plea of ``never
again'' _ coming on top of his recent broad apology for past church
sins _ struck a distinct chord.
</P>
<P>
   While some Holocaust survivors faulted the pope for not going
even further in condemning the church's wartime silence, his visit,
one survivor said, ``marks a turning point for Jews and
Christians.''

   The international custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
seems to be nearing a conclusion. After a federal judge in Miami
concluded that only Attorney General Janet Reno can grant the boy
asylum, Reno said Elian should be reunited with his father in Cuba
in a prompt, orderly fashion. Lawyers for both sides wrangled over
just how, and if, that would be accomplished. The government wants
lawyers for Elian's relatives in Miami to agree to a speedy

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For seven years now, Bill Clinton has been chanting
the mantra that countries that invest in education and focus on the
Web are far more likely to prosper than those that measure their
power in kilotons and argue over bleak pieces of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   He made the case again last week in India and Pakistan while his
top aides were delivering variations on the theme in Beijing. A
third major flash point, the Middle East, was on his agenda for
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument that seemed so reasonable just a few years ago
_ that plugging into a dynamic world economy will bring prosperity
and tame nasty nationalistic tendencies _ is proving a hard sell as
Clinton races around the globe in the last 10 months of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The world's most economically isolated nations, like Pakistan
and Syria, see no hope of catching up with their more economically
advanced competitors, and those well on the road to global
competitiveness, like India, China and Israel, believe more than
ever that their economic potential must be married with military
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Take India's Parliament, which swooned when Clinton talked
excitedly of the booming software houses of Bangalore and when he
predicted that, as India makes the inevitable choice between ``the
hand loom or the hyperlink,'' its standard of living could sextuple
in the next two decades. Yet as soon as Clinton suggested that
India's economic progress is being undercut by its nuclear testing
and territorial battle over Kashmir, his hosts got their backs up.
</P>
<P>
   Just because our future is etched on a silicon chip, they shot
back, in effect, don't think we're about to give up the Bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, meanwhile, hard-liners were using the election of an
independence-leaning president in Taiwan to bolster their case that
it was time for ``economic integration'' with the world to take a
back seat to the assertion of China's sovereignty over what they
see as a breakaway island. It is still unclear whether the generals
will retake the upper hand from those who argue that the real
business of the Communist Party is business.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Syria's president, Hafez Assad, whose waffling on
a peace accord with Israel prompted Clinton to schedule a
face-to-face meeting Sunday in Switzerland. For years now Clinton
has been sketching out his vision of the Middle East's economic
potential if only it could stop arguing over security and
territory. But now a great deal of that vision hinges on his
ability to persuade a reclusive and ailing Syrian leader
increasingly preoccupied with creating a family dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those disputes, of course, is driven by its own
emotional history of ugly conflict. But they all serve to
illustrate the dangers of too simplistic a faith in the lure of the
market when nationalistic impulses flare up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Americans often see a rigid tradeoff between economic
success in an age of globalization and increasing your old-style
military power,'' said Paul Bracken, a Yale professor whose book
``Fire in the East'' (HarperCollins, 1999) explored the growing
nuclear threats in Asia and the Middle East. ``The rest of the
world doesn't see it that way. And in fact, their growing
nationalism is a counterweight, in their minds, to the other
strains they are feeling as their worlds are changed'' by
borderless competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism isn't the only factor at play. All three flash
points are made more complex and unpredictable by the fact that
nervous authoritarian regimes are facing off against some variety
of democracy _ a mix that can produce political miscalculation when
one side misunderstands how the other makes its decisions. Witness
how China's heavy-handed threats, aimed at intimidating Taiwan's
voters, backfired to the point that the Taiwanese elected the
candidate who until recently had talked of asserting independence.
</P>
<P>
   And in each dispute, Washington's own motives are suspect.
Americans often view themselves as neutral arbiters, only seeking
to spread peace. But from Delhi to Shanghai to the Persian Gulf,
suspicions are greater than ever these days that the sole military
and economic superpower is using its ``neutral'' role to create a
world that plays to Washington's commercial and geopolitical
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Why has a seemingly persuasive argument _ that it's wiser to
invest in education and broadband networks than in nuclear
reprocessors _ run up against such opposition both in unplugged
nations and in the most plugged-in?
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and Syria are good places to start. Both are about as
disconnected from the world economy as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   But, while both countries harbor enormous reservoirs of native
talent, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the leader of Pakistan, and Assad in
Syria understand the nature of the poison pill: if they took
Clinton's advice, the medicine that would be good for the country
would eat away at their own holds on power. Among major
authoritarian regimes at the turn of the century, only China's
Communist leaders have made the bet that they can loosen controls
on the economy, allow in the Internet and still exert iron control
over the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   So Pakistan holds on to nukes for the same reason that NATO did
in Europe: as a guarantee against a much larger force across the
border. Add to that nationalistic pride. But what about India?
Doesn't it see that a nuclear arms race drains resources that could
be better spent conquering new cybermarkets?
</P>

   ``It's exactly the opposite,'' says Jeffrey Garten, dean of the
Yale School of Management, who as a top Commerce Department
official peddled a lot of Clinton's networks-not-nukes message.
``In the first half of the 20th century, countries wanted
well-rounded power. The Cold War, though, created an odd sense that
only a couple of countries would be both economic and military
powerhouses. Now the pendulum is swinging back.''
</P>
<P>
   So India wants both. As does Israel, and both China and Taiwan.
Indeed, countries look at the one nation that was supposed to
exercise ``soft power'' through economic and technological prowess
alone _ Japan _ and they see a pitiful excuse for a superpower.
Once the economic magic went away, so did the global diplomatic
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect between analog and digital nations is worsened
when the former are authoritarians and the latter are some variety
of democracy. This has long been a problem in the Middle East.
Assad's rhetoric regularly frays the fragile coalition keeping
Prime Minister Ehud Barak in power in Israel. Nothing new there.
But Barak has long promised that any peace deal with Syria will be
put up to a national referendum in Israel, and that means final
adoption could be unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   But for real miscalculation, pop back and forth between Beijing
and Taipei. China's leaders have what one senior U.S. official last
week called a ``near-perfect ability to miscalculate'' the effects
of their words on the Taiwanese electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Yu Maochun, a professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who
specializes in cross-straits relations, was sitting in a noisy
Taipei restaurant earlier this month when the television broadcast
a warning to Taiwan from China's premier, Zhu Rongji. The mainland,
he said, was willing to ``spill blood'' to prevent independence.
``People stood up and yelled'' in the restaurant, Yu said, making
vivid the backlash that was felt throughout Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a man as sophisticated about the world as Zhu, China's
leading economic reformer, make such a blunder?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communist Party, when it comes to big problems, is
elitist,'' says Yu. ``It is accustomed to sitting down behind
closed doors with a Nixon or a Kissinger and solving a problem. Now
it is faced with a whole different kind of foreign policy
challenge. And they can't handle the politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Democracies miscalculate, too. It was India that inflamed the
long-running sore with Pakistan two years ago when it uncorked
nuclear tests. Some Indian elites now concede that the nuclear
grandstanding _ a great crowd pleaser at home _ paved the way for
the rise of General Musharraf in Pakistan, who had engineered some
of the horrors in Kashmir, then took command in a coup. Now, U.S.
officials believe, he figures that if the war at the top of the
world gets splashed on enough front pages, India will be forced to
accept what it has long rejected _ outside mediation from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The general may be proved wrong, but maybe not. With not much to
do at home, Clinton is moving from hot spot to hot spot, arguing
that all involve areas in America's strategic interest. The problem
is that Clinton envisions himself as an umpire, while the rest of
the world sees Washington as a player with its own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   There is suspicion in Beijing, for example, that America is
using all its weapons _ from the Seventh Fleet to its influence
over the World Trade Organization _ to contain China's power. The
Indians share a similar suspicion, even as they flocked to shake
Clinton's hand.
</P>
<P>
   And so for all the happy talk, the Indians had no intention of
signing on to Clinton's non-proliferation agenda. After all, they
said, that other great symbol of democracy _ the U.S. Senate _
rejected the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last year, proving
that even the most powerful economy on earth wasn't willing to
forgo its nuclear options.
</P>
<P>
   So why, they asked, should they?

FREE TRADE MEETS THE LURE OF THE GUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For seven years now, Bill Clinton has been chanting
the mantra that countries that invest in education and focus on the
Web are far more likely to prosper than those that measure their
power in kilotons and argue over bleak pieces of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   He made the case again last week in India and Pakistan while his
top aides were delivering variations on the theme in Beijing. A
third major flash point, the Middle East, was on his agenda for
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the argument that seemed so reasonable just a few years ago
_ that plugging into a dynamic world economy will bring prosperity
and tame nasty nationalistic tendencies _ is proving a hard sell as
Clinton races around the globe in the last 10 months of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The world's most economically isolated nations, like Pakistan
and Syria, see no hope of catching up with their more economically
advanced competitors, and those well on the road to global
competitiveness, like India, China and Israel, believe more than
ever that their economic potential must be married with military
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Take India's Parliament, which swooned when Clinton talked
excitedly of the booming software houses of Bangalore and when he
predicted that, as India makes the inevitable choice between ``the
hand loom or the hyperlink,'' its standard of living could sextuple
in the next two decades. Yet as soon as Clinton suggested that
India's economic progress is being undercut by its nuclear testing
and territorial battle over Kashmir, his hosts got their backs up.
</P>
<P>
   Just because our future is etched on a silicon chip, they shot
back, in effect, don't think we're about to give up the Bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, meanwhile, hard-liners were using the election of an
independence-leaning president in Taiwan to bolster their case that
it was time for ``economic integration'' with the world to take a
back seat to the assertion of China's sovereignty over what they
see as a breakaway island. It is still unclear whether the generals
will retake the upper hand from those who argue that the real
business of the Communist Party is business.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Syria's president, Hafez Assad, whose waffling on
a peace accord with Israel prompted Clinton to schedule a
face-to-face meeting Sunday in Switzerland. For years now Clinton
has been sketching out his vision of the Middle East's economic
potential if only it could stop arguing over security and
territory. But now a great deal of that vision hinges on his
ability to persuade a reclusive and ailing Syrian leader
increasingly preoccupied with creating a family dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those disputes, of course, is driven by its own
emotional history of ugly conflict. But they all serve to
illustrate the dangers of too simplistic a faith in the lure of the
market when nationalistic impulses flare up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Americans often see a rigid tradeoff between economic
success in an age of globalization and increasing your old-style
military power,'' said Paul Bracken, a Yale professor whose book
``Fire in the East'' (HarperCollins, 1999) explored the growing
nuclear threats in Asia and the Middle East. ``The rest of the
world doesn't see it that way. And in fact, their growing
nationalism is a counterweight, in their minds, to the other
strains they are feeling as their worlds are changed'' by
borderless competition.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism isn't the only factor at play. All three flash
points are made more complex and unpredictable by the fact that
nervous authoritarian regimes are facing off against some variety
of democracy _ a mix that can produce political miscalculation when
one side misunderstands how the other makes its decisions. Witness
how China's heavy-handed threats, aimed at intimidating Taiwan's
voters, backfired to the point that the Taiwanese elected the
candidate who until recently had talked of asserting independence.
</P>
<P>
   And in each dispute, Washington's own motives are suspect.
Americans often view themselves as neutral arbiters, only seeking
to spread peace. But from Delhi to Shanghai to the Persian Gulf,
suspicions are greater than ever these days that the sole military
and economic superpower is using its ``neutral'' role to create a
world that plays to Washington's commercial and geopolitical
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Why has a seemingly persuasive argument _ that it's wiser to
invest in education and broadband networks than in nuclear
reprocessors _ run up against such opposition both in unplugged
nations and in the most plugged-in?
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and Syria are good places to start. Both are about as
disconnected from the world economy as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   But, while both countries harbor enormous reservoirs of native
talent, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the leader of Pakistan, and Assad in
Syria understand the nature of the poison pill: if they took
Clinton's advice, the medicine that would be good for the country
would eat away at their own holds on power. Among major
authoritarian regimes at the turn of the century, only China's
Communist leaders have made the bet that they can loosen controls
on the economy, allow in the Internet and still exert iron control
over the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   So Pakistan holds on to nukes for the same reason that NATO did
in Europe: as a guarantee against a much larger force across the
border. Add to that nationalistic pride. But what about India?
Doesn't it see that a nuclear arms race drains resources that could
be better spent conquering new cybermarkets?

<P>
   In Savannah, Ga., when people say, ``The Book,'' they're not
talking about the Bible. They're referring to the best-selling
``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' John Berendt's gossipy
expose of the hanky-panky behind Savannah's white-glove facade.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Book was published in 1994, tourist appetite for
all things connected to it shows no sign of abating. Every few
minutes, tour buses or horse-drawn carriages pull up in front of
the places mentioned in ``Midnight'' _ Clary's Cafe, Miss Emma
Kelly's night club and, most riveting to tourists, the Mercer
mansion, where Jim Williams killed his lover, Danny Hanford,
perhaps in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   The closed, louvered shutters of the mansion, where Williams'
sister still lives, express the impatience that many Savannah
residents seem to feel about this intrusion on their privacy. But
there's no denying it's been good for business.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah, with a population of 150,000, now attracts more than 5
million tourists a year. There probably always have been lines in
front of Mrs. Wilkes' Boarding House, where a $10, all-you-can-eat
family-style lunch is served five days a week, but these days, it
can take 30 minutes to an hour to get inside. Other restaurants are
also doing a booming business. The City Market section of town hops
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants such as Garibaldi's, Bistro Savannah and Sapphire
pull in an eclectic crowd of students from the Savannah School of
Art and Design, tourists and locals out for a good time. For a
night cap, they may wander over to nearby Club One where drag
queens sashay across the stage, lipsynching to cranked-up music,
and suburbanites in shorts vie with muscle men in undershirts for
the honor of pushing bills into their cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   Most nights, the cover charge for this entertainment is $5, but
when the Lady Chablis is in town, the entrance fee goes up to $22.
(Tour-bus operators titillate their gray-haired passengers by
telling them that the Lady Chablis' real name is Frank, and by
repeating some of her risque patter.)
</P>
<P>
   Although many people in town are cashing in on Midnight while
the going is good, this is just a blip in Savannah's long and
fascinating history. Georgia, including the city of Savannah, was
founded by James Oglethorpe in 1733 as a haven for debtors.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Catholics and lawyers, everyone was welcome in the
intrepid settlement on the Savannah River where pioneers shared
space with alligators, gnats and fever-breeding mosquitoes.
Savannah now has the gnats and mosquitoes under control, but
alligators still sun themselves on the golf courses just outside of
town.
</P>
<P>
   At first slavery was outlawed in the new colony but by 1753,
slaves accounted for nearly one-third of the population.
</P>
<P>
   If following ``The Book'' trail in Savannah palls, Sunday
services at the First African Baptist Church on Franklin Square,
the oldest black church in North America, can be highly
recommended. The church was founded in 1777, and the present
building was erected in 1859 by enslaved blacks. They worked 12 to
16 hours a day for their masters, but they still found the time and
resources to build a handsome structure and to decorate it with
gilded carvings and stained glass.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since some of the slaves were the master craftsmen and
builders who erected Savannah's finest houses, the church is simple
but just as resplendent. A small museum in the basement of the
church includes silver baskets donated to the sanctuary in 1814 by
the sisterhood, who somehow managed to collect money for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday services are a fervent affair. Men dazzle in their white
suits, women, in lacy white dresses topped with magnificent hats. A
gospel choir sings hymns, beating out the rhythms on tambourines.
The preacher elicits an ecstatic response from the congregation as
he leaves the pulpit and walks in the aisles. Sometimes there will
be a baptism in a pool behind the pulpit in which the person to be
baptized and the preacher descend into the water.
</P>
<P>
   This church played an important role in the history of Savannah.
On the lower level is a wooden floor with holes in it. Beneath the
floor is a 4-foot-high crawl space, part of the Underground
Railroad that enabled slaves to escape to freedom in the North.
More recently, beginning on March 16, 1960, high school and college
students prayed in the church before fanning out through downtown
Savannah to sit in at lunch counters in their attempts to bring
about integration.
</P>
<P>
   A diorama at the Ralph Mark Gilbert Civil Rights Museum on
Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard re-creates this period of black
history in Savannah and recounts other aspects of the black
experience in this city. The museum is open from Monday through
Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., with a small admission fee.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks are not the only minority group to have played a special
role in the history of Savannah. In 1733, the first Jewish
congregation in the South was established in this city. A memorial
stone at the corner of Bull and Oglethorpe streets, the center of
old Savannah, marks the Jewish graveyard. And Temple Mickve Israel
which dates from 1776-1778, displays letters from Washington,
Jefferson and Madison as well as the congregation's original Torah
scroll, which the settlers brought with them when they fled the
Portuguese Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The Wesley brothers (Charles and John) also found a temporary
haven in Savannah. John is known as the central founder of
Methodism and Charles as the author of hymns including ``Hark the
Herald Angels Sing.'' Their sojourn in Savannah was short and
unhappy, but the city still remembers them.
</P>
<P>
   John left town in a hurry after it was reported that both he and
his brother were ``dangerous snares to many young women.'' A statue
of John adorns Reynolds Square, and Trinity Methodist Church,
housed in a handsome 150-year-old Greek revival building on Telfair
Square, bills itself as ``John Wesley's American Parish.''
</P>
<P>
   Savannah's squares are the city's single most distinguished
physical feature and make this town a wonderful place in which to
walk. Oglethorpe himself came up with a plan for these symmetrical
parks, each with public buildings on one side and houses on the
others.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the buildings have pillared entrances, fanlights over
the doors and wrought-iron trim. Some are fitted out with 18th- and
19th-century furnishings and are open as museums.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 21 squares with statues, fountains, trees
festooned with Spanish moss and glorious arrays of flowers in
spring. People stroll through the squares, lounge and read under
the shady trees, hold parties, and get married with passers-by
looking on.
</P>
<P>
   On the riverfront to the north of the old part of town, cotton
warehouses rise from the river's edge to the bluff above. Now they
house shops, bars and restaurants, and draw a convivial crowd,
especially on evenings and weekends. This area, known as Factors
Walk, is the site of an arts and crafts festival that takes place
on the first Saturday of each month.
</P>
<P>
   There are many charming inns and guesthouses in Savannah, among
them, the Ballastone, an 18-room bed and breakfast which is
centrally located on Oglethorpe Street next to the Juliette Gordon
Low house, where the founder of the Girl Scouts was raised. At one
time, the Ballastone (built by a merchant in 1838), was used by the
Girl Scouts for administrative offices but before that it was a
brothel, a boarding house and an apartment house for immigrant
workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the checkered story of this now lavishly and lovingly
decorated inn encapsulates the history of Savannah. It's had its
ups and downs, but plumped by tourist dollars generated by ``The
Book,'' Savannah now shines.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   The Ballastone Inn is owned by Miss Jean Hagens, a fifth cousin
of Jefferson Davis, who has schooled her staff in southern
hospitality. Nothing is too much trouble. Room rates start at $275
in spring, with breakfast and afternoon tea included. For more
information, call (800) 822-4553 or fax (912) 236-4626.
</P>
<P>
   At Mrs. Wilkes Boarding House, you can dine family-style on such
Southern staples as Brunswick stew, creamed corn, collard greens,
fried chicken, black-eyed peas and buttermilk biscuits. For a
different kind of dining experience, try the charming Gryphon Tea
Room, owned by the Savannah College of Art and Design and housed in
what was once a turn-of-the-century drug store. The menu includes
soups, sandwiches, salads, dessert and afternoon tea. The Olde Pink
House, so-called because of its startling exterior paint job, is a
Savannah landmark. It was built around 1771 and serves an elegant
dinner in its candlelit dining rooms. A ghost is said to be in
residence.

   ``We know of one collector who travels to Belgium, France and
Holland several times a year just to search for unique chocolate
molds,'' says Bob Wade, who with his wife, Barbara, owns Once Upon
a Time Antiques in Cold Spring, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon after the reunification of Germany,' he says, ``this
gentleman discovered a bakery that was selling its entire inventory
of prewar chocolate molds _ dozens of wonderful examples. That's
any collector's dream come true!''
</P>
<P>
   What today has become something of a collecting craze began
during the golden age of the corner candy shop _ 1880 to 1940 _
when the production of decorative chocolate molds was in full
swing. After the Second World War, however, the candy maker's craft
succumbed to the relative ease and lower expense of mass
production.
</P>
<P>
   These whimsical artifacts of yesterday's kitchen are collector's
delight. ``There's just such a wide variety out there,'' Wade says.
``People can collect for years and still find a design they haven't
seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers in Europe and the United States produced detailed
molds made of tin, pewter and copper. The stamped-metal molds of
bunnies, sheep, turkeys, dogs, cats, hearts, eggs, Santas and other
motifs were intended both for commercial bakeries and individual
homes.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1908 book, ``Household Discoveries,'' author Sidney Morse
devoted an entire chapter to making sweets: ``Candy making should
be taught and acquired as one of the most useful of womanly
accomplishments,'' he wrote, adding, ``each household should have
on hand a small stock of fancy molds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has been collecting chocolate molds for about 30
years,'' says antiques dealer Jean Van Kuren, of Ruth's Antiques in
Clarence Center, N.Y., ``and we must have a few hundred examples
throughout the house. What I love most about them is that they are
so very detailed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Van Kuren, who also sells molds at antiques shows
around the country, detailing is one of the major factors affecting
the value of a piece.
</P>
<P>
   Small molds with limited detail, for example, can still be found
between $10 and $25, while more desirable pieces featuring
extremely fine blades of grass, strands of hair, creases in
clothing or other decorative elements sell for up to $100 or more.
Pieces made by the German firm Anton Reiche, of Dresden, are
particularly intricate, Van Kuren says.
</P>
<P>
   Size is another important factor that can affect the value of a
chocolate mold. ``Value typically increases as molds get larger,''
says Wade. ``A manufacturer may have produced a good number of
6-inch molds but probably only turned out a handful of molds that
were 3 feet tall.''
</P>
<P>
   The smallest molds that collectors will encounter stand 3 to 5
inches tall, and the most common examples range from 6 to 12 inches
in height. Larger molds range from 15 to 20 inches in height while
the rarest, tallest examples top off at 2 to 3 feet. Molds of this
size, Wade reports, have sold for as much as $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest in these pieces has really increased in recent
years,'' Barbara Wade points out. ``Only 20 years ago, you could
pick them up for a song, but that's no longer the case. Today these
pieces are in high demand and the prices reflect that trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The best places to search for vintage chocolate molds include
antiques shops (especially those specializing in kitchenware),
holiday collectibles fairs and flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   When inspecting a stamped-tin mold, look closely to see if it
has all its companion parts _ including clamps, straps and clips.
Reproductions do exist, says Wade, but they generally stand out
when compared to authentic pieces: Vintage examples tend to be made
of heavy-gauge tin, display greater attention to detail and have
small nicks and dents consistent with repeated use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beginning collectors should get a feel for the quality of the
workmanship that went into making the original pieces,'' Wade
advises.
</P>
<P>
   In the home, period chocolate molds make an eye-catching display
on shelves, sideboards and mantels, but beauty and whimsy alone
have yet to surpass function. As it turns out, many candy-mold
collectors are cooking and kitchenware enthusiasts to begin with,
and they use their vintage molds to create old-fashioned
confections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family uses them to make chocolate figures to give as
gifts and display in our home for festive occasions,'' says Jean
Van Kuren. ``It's become a special tradition for us because it also
gives us a connection with the past.''

 c.2000 Esquire
<TEXT>
 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &QL;
<P>
   EDITORS: On Sept. 9, 1999, Jim Boyer was beginning a descent
from the summit of a rock face in the Catalina Mountains, outside
Tucson. A piece of equipment he was anchored to gave way. He fell
more than 100 feet to a ledge below and was killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the dozen or so years that I have been climbing, my mother
has had approximately two things to say about the subject: ``Don't
do it!'' and ``Oh no, you're not!'' The former might apply to a
1,000-foot cliff, the latter to a 20,000-foot peak.
</P>
<P>
   Being a good, dependable son, I never listened. Being a good
mother, she wasn't surprised. I kept climbing, and after a while
she seemed to get used to the idea that I was happiest while
hanging off the side of a big chunk of rock.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I never expected to get the kind of messages from her I
began receiving via e-mail last spring: ``To: Jboy From: Momboyer
Subject: Mom Boyer's Hardbody Training Camp jogged two miles again
last night. Even got your little brother to go with me. I've also
been doing my pull-ups and finger exercises. Just wait until you
feel my forearms. No wimps around here!''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of this was that my 66-year-old mother was going
climbing with me. Our goal was Finger Rock, a slender digit of
granite that thrusts emphatically skyward from the ridgeline of the
Catalina Mountains, just north of Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The Finger is sheer-sided, 80 feet tall, and rises from a much
larger cliff at the top of a very steep canyon, 4,000 feet above
the city. The view is vertiginous. If you were to take one step
southward from the top, which is the size of a patio table, you
would drop several hundred feet before the first bounce and still
have a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small notch in the summit that you can stand in while
bracing your shins against the rock, as if you were standing in an
open washing machine. With a climbing rope and a cool head, this
perch is quite safe _ but you must resist the spin cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Finger Rock is clearly visible from Tucson, and my mother had
looked up at it hundreds of times over the years, ever since she
was a child. The idea to climb it, however, was mine, and came
about in a way that neither of us expected.
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.
The initial prognosis was not good _ she might die within the year.
It was summer, and I flew home from Colorado (where I'd been
climbing) the day after my father called with the news. It was a
difficult visit. My mother was reticent and I didn't know what to
say.
</P>
<P>
   Had my father been ill, he and I probably would have talked for
hours. That was the nature of our relationship. But my mother and I
rarely talked like that. We did things.
</P>
<P>
   We both spent summers in Alaska (she as a physician and I as a
commercial fisherman), and usually we'd meet up for a week to
backpack or otherwise see some new country. We'd drink beer in
Anchorage biker bars or go up to Fairbanks for the Eskimo Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little you can do for someone whose departure is
suddenly imminent, and that summer I hoped that she already knew
everything I couldn't quite say.
</P>
<P>
   Then things got better. She went through surgery and radiation
therapy, and six months later her biopsies were still clean. Her
odds improved. She began taking tamoxifen, which despite several
nasty side effects (hot flashes and increased appetite among them)
improved those odds further. A year passed, and then another, with
no sign of a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   During this time my mother began making a list of things she
wanted to do before she died. Some of these things were fairly
typical _ to travel to China and Africa _ others less so.
</P>
<P>
   One day she said to me, ``You know what I've always wanted to
do? Walk from one end of the state to the other. People used to
walk such vast distances, and we've all forgotten that. We're too
hung up on the cars.''
</P>
<P>
   She liked the sense of history that came from walking old Indian
trails and watching the subtle changes in terrain. Walking made the
world big again. But so did climbing, and I wasn't about to take a
400-mile stroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's climb Finger Rock,'' I said. ``Heavens, no!'' she said.
I figured that meant maybe. A year later the answer was yes. We
would attempt Finger Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only go around once,'' she said, ``and maybe not all that
long. '' She wanted three months to train. By this time she'd
gained eleven pounds, largely because of the tamoxifen, and she
was, by her own reckoning, in lousy shape. So she quit the drugs,
went on a diet and began running laps around the homestead.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later I began getting the e-mail updates. Perhaps the
biggest challenge had less to do with Finger Rock than it did with
my mother's own fingers. As a result of her treatment, the digits
of her left hand often seized up involuntarily. When this happened
she had to pry them open with her other hand.
</P>
<P>
   For rehab purposes, I bolted a Simulator board to a crossbeam in
my parents' carport. A few days later my father came home from work
to find my mother hanging from plastic climbing holds, her feet
partially supported by bungee-cord stirrups.
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head. ``You're really going to do this, aren't
you?'' he said. He'd always hoped she'd take up tennis. My little
brother, who still lived at home, had it worse. My mother figured
that as long as she was getting in shape, he should, too.
</P>
<P>
   One evening I stopped by just as they were returning from a run.
My brother was dripping with sarcasm as well as sweat: ``Great
idea, this climbing thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trail up to Finger Rock is five miles long, rocky and very
steep, so we went for hikes as well. The first couple weren't
encouraging. Despite her jogging schedule, she was painfully slow
on hills.
</P>
<P>
   If I hadn't inherited her impatience along with her
adventurousness I probably would have been more sympathetic.
Instead I began feeling a coach's frustration that we might not be
ready on game day. Even hinting at that possibility would have
started an ugly fight between us, however, so I kept my mouth shut
and crossed my fingers.
</P>
<P>
   We still had several weeks. In the meantime, she needed to learn
to climb. We started out at Rocks and Ropes, the local climbing
gym, which has indoor climbing walls 35 feet tall. After strapping
her into a harness, we went over knots and belay techniques, then
fit her with some rental climbing shoes. To my considerable relief,
she showed no signs of acrophobia, and moved up the wall with
surprising grace for a beginner. I was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at my friend Jason, the gym owner, who'd come out from
his office to watch. He made a face that said, Not bad. ``Hey, that
was kind of fun,'' she said once back on the ground. Still, the
Finger made her nervous. ``What if I just can't do it?'' she would
ask. ``What if I freeze up?''
</P>
<P>
   I explained (again) that I would be above her and could easily
support her weight with the rope. This seemed to reassure her. ``I
really don't want to be dragged up ignominiously like a sack of
potatoes,'' she said, ``but I'd like to have that option.'' Fair
enough.
</P>
<P>
   We went to the gym a second time and then practiced rappelling
off my upstairs porch, since rappelling is the only way to get off
the Finger.
</P>
<P>
   Rappelling is the most counterintuitive aspect of climbing.
Basically, it involves walking backward off a cliff while trusting
your life to your equipment.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't seem to mind this, though, and by early April we were
more or less ready.
</P>
<P>
   On a Wednesday morning we headed out with packs full of camping
and climbing gear. My longtime climbing partner, photographer Peter
Noebels, came along, as did our friend Jim Malusa.
</P>
<P>
   We had given my mother the lightest load in hopes that she could
keep up, but by midday I was tempted to sneak some of my own weight
into her pack. When we stopped to rest, she was always the first
one up, saying, ``Well, I think I'll plod on ahead since I'm the
slowest.'' Twenty minutes later the rest of us would come around a
bend in the trail and find her facing our way, trying not to look
impatient.
</P>
<P>
   It took six hours to make it up to the Finger's base. The trail
winds and twists and doubles back, disappears into thickets of
manzanita and shindaggers, climbs and drops and then rises again.
But once you get to the Finger there's only one way to go: straight
up.
</P>
<P>
   We dumped our packs in a tiny clearing on the ridge between the
Finger and Prominent Point and sat staring up at our route. My
mother looked almost disappointed. She said, ``That's it?''
</P>
<P>
   From a distance the Finger looks tall and impossibly steep, but
from this vantage it was far less imposing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you it was easy,'' I said. ``But don't worry, it'll be
interesting enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan had been to hike up, spend the night, and then climb in
the morning when we were fresh, but after resting for an hour or
so, my mother got fidgety. She left the shade of the oak we'd been
sitting under and looked up at the rock again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess we might as well get this over with,'' she said.
We roped up at the base of the climb and then I led up the first
section. I pointed out the best holds as I went, but I couldn't
guess how hard it would be for her. We had only practiced inside,
where holds are purposefully bolted within reach; out here you had
to take what the rock offered, and the climbing was far more
subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty feet up I secured a belay and took up the slack in the
rope. ``Climb away,'' I said. She moved gingerly up the rock,
feeling around for good edges to hold, then walking her feet up.
</P>
<P>
   Things went smoothly enough until she was about 10 feet below
me, when the only handhold was a sloping mantel of smooth granite
at chin level. It was too low to pull on, too high to step on.
There was another good hold above the mantel, but it was still out
of reach. In the meantime, her arms had begun to quiver from the
strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Point your elbow up and push down with your palm, '' I said.
Didn't work. ``I think I'm going to fall,'' she said shakily. ``No,
you're not.'' I could have pulled her up, but I knew she'd be
happier if she did it herself. Then she slapped her forearm onto
the mantel, grunted upward, and grabbed the next hold. A minute
later she was sitting beside me, looking distracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halfway there,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did something to my arm,'' she said. She held up her
forearm, which had a purple lump on it the size of an egg. I said,
``Yikes.'' At first she thought she had torn a tendon, but all her
fingers worked. ``It's probably a hematoma,'' she said. ``I think
it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to keep climbing. The second pitch was easier, except
for one tricky section where the holds again disappeared. This time
she made it through without any damage, and soon joined me just
below the top.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Finger Rock's summit especially rewarding is that you
climb up the back side, with the rock between you and the valley,
so you get the view all at once. I showed her where to wedge her
legs, and she stood up, craning her neck in one direction and then
the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, wow,'' she said, grinning. ``Wow, wow, wow. You never get
a perspective like this from the ground _ never. This is really
something.''
</P>
<P>
   I climbed up next to her and sat down. We stayed there for quite
a while, enjoying our unlikely perch and the afternoon breeze. I
was still a little nervous about the rappel down, but she slid down
the rope without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   After sunset, the city lights glowed far beneath us, framed by
the steep walls of the canyon. We ate dinner and drank a
celebratory toast of tequila and fruit juice, then lay talking
under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   My mother seemed more at ease than she had in a long time. We
talked about family matters, about her cancer, about other
adventures we might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, your father thinks I'm crazy for doing this with
you,'' she said. ``He really does. He thinks all this stuff you do
is crazy. He doesn't get it. He doesn't understand why anyone would
take so many risks. But I do.''

DELIA EPHRON DISCUSSES LIFE, DIVORCE AND HER LATEST NOVEL

 (tlk) 
 &HT;    Joan Smith is a senior editor of ``Redbook.''
 &HT;    
 By JOAN SMITH 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc. 
<TEXT>
 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;
<P>
   Delia Ephron was in East Hampton, N.Y., reading the police log
in the local paper. There was a geranium thief on the loose, but
the best item was about a woman complaining that someone had pulled
in and out of her driveway three times in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so divine,'' says Ephron, who like everyone in New York
City is both dazzled and bemused by the relative simplicity of life
outside the five boroughs. ``I knew this was the beginning of a
book for me _ about a woman living in a small town where there is
no real crime and then a real crime happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But if she was going to write a murder mystery _ and because
she's Delia Ephron, it would be a funny murder mystery. She wanted
``something really meaty, that affects all women, at its heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ephron, who helped write some of sister Nora Ephron's films
(their most recent collaboration was ``Hanging Up,'' starring Meg
Ryan and based on Delia's first novel), loves children and has
written seven books for and about them. So she decided that the
heart of her new novel, ``Big City Eyes,'' would be a maternal
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Lily Davis leaves Manhattan and moves to a small town on Long
Island because she is worried about her 15-year-old son, Sam: He
seems withdrawn and friendless, she thinks he's sneaking out to
Manhattan nightclubs, and she's found a steak knife in his
underwear drawer.
</P>
<P>
   But the knife, she understands, is a defensive weapon, much like
the missiles he drew in a picture of himself when he was 6. Sam,
she concludes, still feels unsafe, nine years after his parents'
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Big City Eyes'' is also a romance with a twist. Lily has
to decide whether she has a right to be with the man of her dreams
(who wants to leave his wife to be with her) if it means that, like
Sam, her lover's children will have to live with the pain of their
family's dissolution.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why did you decide to write about the impact of divorce on
children?
</P>
<P>
   A. I really identify with children and their vulnerability. I
helped raise two stepchildren and experienced their grief, and I
interviewed a lot of single mothers and children for my book
``Funny Sauce.'' When parents get divorced, children get their
hearts broken.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does this mean parents should stay together for the sake of
their children?
</P>
<P>
   A. The weird thing is that divorce, like skirts and dresses,
goes in and out of fashion. When I divorced my first husband, the
women's movement was in full flower and everyone was doing it.
Which made it a lot easier, because divorce is the hardest thing
you can do. It's like burning the ground beneath your feet.
</P>
<P>
   But if you need to get divorced, you need to get divorced. And
when you need something that badly, you tend to delude yourself
into believing that there's not going to be a cost. But the cost is
what happens to your kids.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the mother in ``Hanging Up,'' who abandons her
kids completely?
</P>
<P>
   A. To me that's unforgivable. Lily leaves her husband, but she
is a very conscientious mother. But another thing that interests me
is how motherhood seems to conflict with sexual passion. Raising
children is not the most romantic situation, and everyone knows how
hard it is to switch gears and get romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And isn't it the first time since adolescence that you find
yourself hiding your sexuality from people you love?
</P>
<P>
   A. Exactly. You simply don't want to walk around your house
feeling and acting sexual. I remember my mother going to a
department store and getting one of those free makeovers. She came
home looking rather glamorous and asked, ``How do I look?'' And I
said, ``You look awful.'' She looked great actually, but I was a
teen-ager and she didn't look like my mom.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Was it hard being a stepmother?
</P>
<P>
   A. Very. The children were 4 and 6, and I wanted to be their
mother, which was not appropriate. I couldn't have children of my
own, which made it more painful, and I moved too fast for them. But
I was completely devoted and now we all love each other and it
works great.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, being a stepmom really prepares you for being a
screenwriter, because if you want the child to change in any way
you can never just make them do it. You have to lobby the real
parents. And when you're a screenwriter and you want something for
the movie, you have to lobby the director. So it was the best
training I ever had.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Reform'' is a positive _ and therefore
subjective _ word that is overused. It implies an improvement in
something, but what is viewed as ``reform'' by one person may be
considered a pox on society by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   This distinction particularly holds true when people discuss
``reform'' of the political system. Ask a trial lawyer, for
example, if the ``tort reform'' movement is misnamed.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of this problem by an e-mail message commenting
on a recent column, which discussed George W. Bush's and Al Gore's
conversions _ maybe _ to the cause of campaign finance ``reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The reader doubted that limiting campaign contributions would
improve the system because, he reasoned, the less money candidates
have to spend, the less voters would learn about them.
</P>
<P>
   And, he suggested, people with ``great power and influence''
would adjust their tactics and ``try to maintain influence under
any system that can be devised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you refer me to anything that will go beyond chanting
`reform, reform' and help me understand where that reform might
take us?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure where any ``reform'' will eventually lead because
the reader is correct. People wanting a political edge will seek a
new way to circumvent restrictions. But tight, new campaign finance
rules with stiff sanctions against violators are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   I have mixed feelings about one alternative _ public financing
of political races. Although it is an option for presidential
candidates, I suspect that most people strongly oppose using tax
dollars to finance state and local campaigns in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign contributions must be completely and timely reported,
and limits should be set on both direct contributions to candidates
and on indirect donations through political parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature, with Bush's support, took an important step
last year with a new law requiring most state candidates to file
finance reports electronically.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers, in the interest of protecting privacy on the
Internet, excluded addresses of donors from the electronic
postings. That is a mistake that the Legislature should correct,
because addresses are essential information. People who value their
privacy that much shouldn't give to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law sets no limits on contributions in state races, except
for judicial offices. Federal law limits contributions in federal
races to $1,000 per election for individuals and $5,000 per
election for political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   In a congressional race, there can be as many as three elections
per cycle _ a party primary, a runoff and the general election.
That means a person can give a candidate as much as $3,000 _ $1,000
for each election _ and a PAC can give as much as $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be unreasonable to raise the federal limit on
individual donations to $5,000 per election. Perhaps the PAC limit
also could be raised, but not by much. Limits of some kind,
meanwhile, also should be set on contributions to candidates for
all state and local offices.
</P>
<P>
   Strict limits or outright bans also should be imposed on ``soft
money'' contributions to political parties, which bypass the
existing federal donation limits and are used to buy ads benefiting
candidates. Bush has proposed banning soft money from labor unions
and businesses, but his plan has a big loophole _ he would allow
soft money contributions from wealthy individuals. They also should
be banned or limited.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of change argue that restrictions on
contributions to political candidates and parties are an
unconstitutional infringement on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court refuted that argument
two months ago when it once again upheld state limits on campaign
contributions as a means of fighting real or perceived political
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave the perception of impropriety unanswered, and the
cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize
the willingness of voters to take part in democratic governance,''
the court majority wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It also noted, ``There is little reason to doubt that sometimes
large contributions will work actual corruption of our political
system.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, big money in politics often talks, and that's
why it must be restricted.

   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Slide in a buck and punch 24-12 on the
Hyperbeam Laserdisc juke box in the bar at the Best Western motel.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Springsteen pops on, singing the sad truth:
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreman says these jobs are going, boys, and they ain't
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``To your home town.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Willie Martin's home town. He was born and reared in
this blue-collar community of textile mills and furniture factories
in the shadow of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Played defensive end on
the high school football team. Hired on at the plant that made Sara
Lee brand clothing. Never wanted to live anywhere other than this
hilly settlement of 16,000 people in modest brick houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is home,'' he proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is 36 now. When he was growing up, Martinsville boasted
of being the ``Sweatshirt Capital of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the Sara Lee plant closed about seven years ago, he soon
got a job at Tultex Corp. making sweatshirts and sweat pants and
T-shirts and shorts for Sears, Nike, Reebok and other brands as
well as for Tultex's own Discus Athletic and Track Gear lines. He
worked the night shift, 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., four nights one week,
three nights the next. He liked the hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a morning person,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   Tultex paid about as well as any other employer in the region _
$11 to $12 an hour for the average worker.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three weeks before Christmas, Tultex declared bankruptcy.
Willie Martin was among 1,100 workers terminated without warning.
No severance check. No holiday bonus. No more company insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just dumped us out like we were nothing,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, there were no jobs awaiting laid-off workers. The
Sara Lee closing had been a harbinger. DuPont moved out of
Martinsville in 1998. Pluma closed its clothing plants here last
fall. Ashmore Industries shut down shortly thereafter. Then Hampton
Industries closed its sewing plant for sleepwear.
</P>
<P>
   In two years, the area lost about 3,400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Now nearly one out of every five adults in Martinsville is
looking for work. The 18.4 percent unemployment rate could even go
higher when the last Tultex workers, now cleaning out the plants
and shipping out the final products, are let go.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell folks hereabouts about America's boom times. They
smile bitterly when asked about the Federal Reserve Board raising
interest rates to slow a surging economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan Greenspan ought to come down and visit us for a while,''
said Mary Minter, a 54-year-old grandmother who is looking for a
new job after being laid off at Tultex.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   In the new Southern economy that stretches from America Online
Inc.'s headquarters in Northern Virginia to Dell Computer Corp.'s
headquarters outside Austin, it's easy to overlook the old Southern
economy in places like Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, the textile industry, located largely in Dixie, has
lost more than 100,000 jobs, leaving it with about 550,000. In the
apparel industry, the situation is worse, with nearly 300,000 jobs
lost in the same seven-year period, leaving fewer than 700,000 at
work making clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In Martinsville, folks blame the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They believe that their jobs went to Mexico, where manufacturers
pay less for labor. Now President Clinton has asked Congress to
give China the same permanent trade benefits granted most other
nations. If that happens, workers here warn, the remaining textile
and apparel jobs are headed to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is more complicated than that, explained Gary
Shoesmith, an economist at Wake Forest University in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Automation has replaced about as many textile workers as foreign
trade has, he said. U.S. textile shipments have actually increased
slightly since NAFTA opened the continent's borders. Wages have
increased for the Southern textile workers in new high-tech mills.
</P>
<P>
   In the less automated apparel industry, dependent on people who
cut and sew, more jobs are headed to countries where labor costs
are lower, he predicted. But he says it would have happened with or
without NAFTA or permanent trade privileges for China.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, the textile and apparel industries will be wide open
worldwide, said Shoesmith. Free trade will benefit the overall
Southern economy, he said. Already, yarn spun in automated Carolina
mills is being used to make clothing in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While Dixie's textile and apparel industries have historically
paid relatively low wages, Shoesmith said, workers of the future
will be paid according to what they know and what they're willing
to do. They'll have to retrain several times over a lifetime of
work and be more mobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the 50-year-old man who walks out of the textile mill for
the last time, where does he go?'' asked Shoesmith. ``If he is
resistant to retraining, he may end up on the graveyard shift at
the 7-Eleven. Those are the sad stories.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Mary Minter lives one of those sad stories.
</P>
<P>
   In 14 years at Tultex, she was late only twice. Both times, she
was delayed when deer smashed into her pickup truck while she was
driving to work. Two of her four sons, as well as a brother, also
lost their jobs when Tultex abruptly shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine had worked there for 40 years. She had gone
to Tultex straight out of high school and had a year and a half
till she could retire. They told her that she had 20 minutes to
gather up her things and get out of the building,'' Minter
recalled. ``It was like a slap in the face to people who had worked
so hard for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's squeezing a living from an unemployment check of
about $200 a week, the grandchildren ``want to know why Nanny can't
buy'' any more Matchbox cars or Pokemon cards.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, John, is disabled. He had a heart attack one
Christmas Eve in the parking lot of K-Mart and has since had
open-heart surgery and several operations on his back. They're
worried about how to pay for the pills that regulate John's
heartbeat. Their health insurance had been provided by Tultex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting more desperate as the weeks go by,'' said Mary.
She has put in applications at businesses all over the area, but so
have hundreds of other job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   She's looking forward to the NASCAR season opening at the
Martinsville Race Track, where she can earn some money working in
the concession stand on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   The signs marking Martinsville's city limits now feature a
checkered flag motif rather than sweatshirt production. The city
council has offered to give away land to companies that will invest
in the community and create new jobs. So far, there are few takers.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Bassinger is worried.
</P>
<P>
   She worked in the cutting room at Tultex for nearly 13 years
until, at the age of 36, she lost her job ``with no warning or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bassinger tells it, for decades the town was run by a few
families who owned and operated textile mills or furniture
factories. They resisted other industries coming in because they
wanted to keep wages low. Eventually, the local textile owners sold
out to national corporations. Beset by foreign competition, the
corporations pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   But Bassinger doesn't want to pull out. She grew up in
Martinsville. Her parents still live here. Her three teenage
children are immersed in their high school. Her husband has a job
at a tire dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have roots,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's putting in job applications at furniture factories in
North Carolina. Sitting in the sunny back yard of her small brick
house, Bassinger said she's willing to drive an hour each way if
she can find a job. She doesn't want to move away from
Martinsville.
</P>
<P>
   This is her home town.

 A Diluted Absinthe, Once Touted By Van Gogh, Is Back  
 (Lead)  
 By CARL T. HALL  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;  &QL;  &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Absinthe, the emerald-green liqueur that was popular in
fin-de-siecle Paris and is now enjoying a watered-down comeback,
contains a neurotoxin that may account for some of the addled
behavior of Vincent Van Gogh, scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Using lab mice to solve a century-old riddle, researchers
reported that a substance called alpha-thujone -- the active
ingredient in what some cognescenti call ``La Fee Verte,'' or ``the
green fairy'' -- can lead to the out-of-control firing of brain
cells.
</P>
<P>
   A similar misfiring is found in some forms of epilepsy. Other
symptoms long linked to absinthe consumption include addiction,
hallucinations and delirium.
</P>
<P>
   Many late 19th century and early 20th century creative geniuses
had a strong taste for absinthe, and became well-practiced in its
elaborate mystique and rituals -- typically involving perforated
spoons, water and sugar in a sidewalk-cafe setting.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Van Gogh, other famous imbibers included Baudelaire,
Rimbaud, Verlaine, Toulouse-Lautrec and Picasso. Many immortalized
the beverage in paintings, notably Toulouse-Lautrec, who favored
diluting his in cognac rather than water, forming a deathly
concoction he called an ``earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears some of their more curious, if not
self-destructive, psychiatric symptoms may be explained by
absinthe's activity on a special type of receptor responsible for
controlling the excitation of brain signals.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the GABA receptor, it is a key component in the brain's
delicate system of self-control.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy consumption of the high-potency liqueurs common in Van
Gogh's day ``would have greatly disrupted the nervous system,''
said John Casida, a professor of toxicology and environmental
chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Casida and colleagues at UC Berkeley and the Northwestern
University Medical School summarized their findings in the latest
issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   A separate report on the same material was scheduled for Monday
during the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the latest findings explain Van Gogh's psychiatric
symptoms and more extreme behavior -- which ultimately led to his
infamous ear-slicing and suicide -- is a matter of conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gogh experts said Friday the new biochemical evidence
certainly sheds some important light on one of history's most
intensely creative periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old absinthe was bad stuff,'' said Dr. Wilf Arnold at the
University of Kansas Medical Center, author of the book ``Vincent
Van Gogh: Chemicals, Crises and Creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is finally a good scientific reason to explain the
toxicity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Van Gogh appears to have suffered a congenital
condition called acute intermittent porphyria, whose psychiatric
conditions can be drug induced.
</P>
<P>
   Others who lacked such predispositions, including Van Gogh's
onetime roommate Paul Gauguin, may have been able to drink more
absinthe than Van Gogh with much less severe results, Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Absinthe's active ingredient, which comes from an extract of the
wormwood plant, has been linked to psychiatric illness, convulsions
and even death since the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could determine just how the drug affected the brain. As
a result of health concerns, the drink was banned shortly after the
turn of the century in France and many other countries, including
the United States, where it is still outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   But today, green-colored absinthe beverages, some containing 55
percent alcohol, are sold legally in parts of Europe and Canada.
Their potency, however, is much reduced: less than 10 parts per
million of the active ingredient versus 260 parts per million in
``old absinthe,'' according to some recent studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite trendy in the U.K. at the moment,'' said Sue Hill,
office manager at a British absinthe dealer called Sebor Absinthe,
which advertises on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the company's Web site gets a steady stream of
orders, perhaps 20 or so daily, from would-be absinthe drinkers in
the United States -- part of an apparent worldwide surge in
retro-European-style tippling.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, herbal concoctions containing the same active
ingredient, including extracts of wormwood oil and cedarleaf oil,
are sold to control various digestive and liver symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Dosages are supposed to be too low for any brain effects, but at
least one accidental poisoning has been reported recently in a
31-year-old man who eventually recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Casida noted that many of the herbal medicines have not been
rigorously tested. The National Institutes of Health plans further
studies of products with alpha-thujone next year.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates argue against outright prohibition, maintaining that
people who want the stuff will find it anyway, or can make their
own homemade versions with unpredictable results.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News

   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ And so Pope John Paul II flew away
and took his positive karma with him. This is how the morning after
looked in Israel: diminished prospects for peace with Syria, the
opening of a criminal investigation into a leading rabbi, and five
separate Parliament votes of no confidence in the government. By
Deborah Sontag.

a Jewish massacre of Arabs. By Joel Greenberg.

human rights abuses, including torture, are widespread in Saudi
Arabia's criminal justice system and that the U.S. turns a blind

   BAHAI-RADIO (Hemingway, S.C.) _ Williamsburg County, a rural
slice of the Bible Belt an hour's drive from the Atlantic coast, is
just the place one expects to find religious radio. Roadside signs
testify that Jesus saves, and the steeples of Baptist and
Pentecostal churches can seem as ubiquitous as the tall pines and
Spanish moss. Yet it is this setting that makes WLGI, a 50,000-watt
FM station outside this small town, such a surprise. To listeners,
WLGI is known as ``Radio Baha'i,'' a 15-year-old project of one of
the world's newer religions, a monotheistic faith that emerged in
19th century Persia (now Iran). By Gustav Niebuhr.

   BIOTECH-PATENT (Boston) A battle with huge ramifications for the
biotechnology industry gets under way with hearings in a federal
court in Boston Monday and Tuesday. Amgen, the industry leader, is
suing Transkaryotic Therapies, or TKT, contending that TKT's
company's production of Epogen, a genetically engineered form of
protein used by kidney dialysis patients, violates Amgen's patents.
The stakes are huge: Epogen is Amgen's top-selling drug, generating
$4 billion in annual sales. More important, the case will touch on

how far patents can extend to cover a substance found in nature. By

closed up 1.62 percent; the Hang Seng index ended up 2.86 percent.

   LATINBANK-SUMMERS (New Orleans) _ Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers is scheduled to speak at the annual meeting of the
Inter-American Development Bank, where finance ministers, central
bankers and other officials from Latin America and the Caribbean
meet. The bank on Monday forecast a 4 percent growth for the region
this year. By Joseph Kahn.

   LEESON-AD-COLUMN (London) _ Nicholas Leeson is an unlikely
candidate to promote an online brokerage firm. He is, after all,

IN CABINET RESHUFFLE, PRIME MINISTER BRINGS IN RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ After weeks of sinking ratings in the polls, Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin announced a shake-up in his Cabinet Monday,
including the appointment of one of his main rivals, former Prime
Minister Laurent Fabius, as finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin has faced a torrent of criticism for lackluster
performance on several fronts, including the failure of his
administration's school and tax reforms. Cartoonists have depicted
him as a man who has run out of steam halfway through his five-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to counter that image, Jospin added two of France's
most dynamic left-wing politicians, Fabius and Jack Lang, a former
culture minister, to his administration. Lang will take over the
troubled education ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as Jospin's administration is preparing for the
local elections next year and the presidential elections of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius' appointment was generally praised by economists, who do
not expect him to make any drastic changes to the overall direction
of the finance ministry. Under Jospin, the ministry has endorsed
market-friendly policies and overseen the privatization of many
state assets.
</P>
<P>
   But political analysts had mixed assessments. Some regarded the
appointment of Fabius, 53, as a move that could lead to an internal
power struggle, while others saw it as an effort to pull the party
together.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius, a protege of the late President Francois Mitterrand and
his prime minister from 1984-86, has had a long, bitter rivalry
with Jospin. In recent years his own political career stalled when
he was accused of a role in allowing unscreened blood to be given
to hemophiliacs at the national transfusion center in the
mid-1980s, causing some of them to contract AIDS. He was acquitted
of criminal negligence and manslaughter charges last year.
</P>
<P>
   He has recently criticized the Jospin administration for not
cutting taxes more sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin said that the changes, the first big Cabinet reshuffle
since he formed a coalition joining his Socialists with Communists
and Greens in 1997, would reinforce his government's ``capacity to
act.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, he said, ``will continue its reform policies
inspired by left-wing values in the service of the country and with
the same main goal _ _ growth and jobs for more justice.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During most of Jospin's two and a half years in office he has
enjoyed almost unprecedented popularity for a prime minister, at
times surpassing the ratings of the Gaullist President Jacque
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since Jospin was hit in the back of the head by a stone
thrown by Palestinian protesters last month, he has been in
trouble. First, polls indicated that the French people disapproved
of his trip to the Middle East and believed that he should not have
meddled in foreign policy, which is usually Chirac's domain.
</P>
<P>
   Then his domestic problems began to grow. He so mishandled a
$7.5 billion surplus that it began to hang around his neck like a
dead albatross. Weeks went by as the French waited for him to
explain how the money would be used.
</P>
<P>
   And then two of his administration's major efforts, school and
tax reforms, foundered as teachers and tax inspectors took to the
streets in protest, eventually forcing the plans to be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jospin tried to get his political house back in
order. Fabius will replace Christian Sautter, who was appointed
when the far more dynamic Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned over
corruption allegations. Lang is to replace Claude Allegre, a
long-time friend of Jospin's whose efforts to streamline the school
system ran into opposition from both teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin also announced changes in two other major posts.
Catherine Tasca replaced Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann, who
had been expected to leave after bungling a plan to reform
advertising on public television.
</P>
<P>
   A former finance minister, Michel Sapin, replaced Emile
Zuccarelli, the civil service minister, who had failed to persuade
the vast bureaucracy to accept Jospin's flagship policy of cutting
the work week to 35 hours from 39 hours in an effort to create more
jobs and cut unemployment.

&HT;     CENSUS RAISES PRIVACY COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SHERRY SYLVESTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ An unsuccessful candidate for Congress has filed a
lawsuit saying some of the questions on the 2000 Census are an
invasion of privacy. And the radio airwaves have been buzzing with
complaints that the government is prying into their lives by asking
too many questions.
</P>
<P>
   The head count, held every 10 years, often raises questions of
privacy. But this year, with the federal government and local
jurisdictions across the country urging people to fill out the
forms, the count is stirring questions and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Messer, the fiery talk show host at radio station KTSA in
San Antonio, said callers have been burning up the phone lines to
his station complaining that the census is invading their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People find the questions invasive and insulting,'' Messer
said. ``Bathrooms? Income? Isn't the census supposed to count
heads?''
</P>
<P>
   Messer said the complaints particularly focus on the long form,
which includes 53 questions.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Ashwood, operations manager and director of talk
programming at radio station WOAI in San Antonio, said national
talk shows, including Rush Limbaugh and Lionel, have received high
numbers of calls on the census forms.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brewer, a failed Republican congressional candidate, filed
a lawsuit in federal court Thursday in Houston against the U.S.
Census Bureau, charging the U.S. Commerce Department and the Census
Bureau with invasion of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   At his weekly briefing last Tuesday, Census Bureau Director
Kenneth Prewitt called the reaction against the long census form
part of the country's ``civic disengagement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we live in a time when there is a growing
mistrust of government,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt insists the public should be angry with its
congressional representatives, not the Census Bureau, because all
the long form questions were required by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles A. Gonzalez, D-Texas, said the information from the
census is crucial to lawmakers. ``Government is only going to be as
responsive as it is knowledgeable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hofeller, redistricting director for the Republican National
Committee, said both Democrats and Republicans are pushing for an
accurate count, since census figures are used in congressional
redistricting and in apportioning federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Hofeller said Republicans are not behind the Brewer lawsuit,
which he predicted would go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Ellis Smith, editor of the Privacy Journal and a
longtime privacy advocate, said the public is right to object to
many of the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long form is actually a marketing survey for American
businesses,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that while Congress asks for some questions to be
included on the census forms, businesses have a greater influence.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll released March 13 found that half of those
surveyed did not believe the Census Bureau would prohibit other
government agencies from using census information and 60 percent
said they believe the Census Bureau could not protect the data even
if it tried.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, said the Census Bureau has an impressive record
in guarding its data on individuals. Even recent charges that
Census Bureau data may have been used to identify Japanese-American
neighborhoods in World War II do not suggest individual household
records were handed over to the military.

&HT;     PLAY THE JOB GAME WELL AND WIN THE CAREER TOURNAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you have not gotten excited about anything at
work in the past month, there is something seriously wrong with
your office. Where is your spirit? Where is your sense of
accomplishment? Where is your NCAA basketball pool?
</P>
<P>
   The 63 games that make up the men's college basketball
championship tournament are perfect for a little wagering (which
is, of course, totally illegal and completely appalling, especially
if you picked Stanford to win the championship). Research and
street smarts are the keys to winning, but never underestimate the
importance of freak accidents and blind luck.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds a lot like your career, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Here are some lessons from March Madness that you can apply to
career insanity:
</P>
<P>
   _ There are many definitions of success.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges like Jackson State and Winthrop and Iona know they
can't really compete for the championship, but they are still proud
to be a part of the tournament. Even though there is only one
official winner, just participating is a victory for them.
</P>
<P>
   One pitfall for workers is the feeling that they have to be the
champion or else they are failing. Not everyone wants to be the
chief executive, certainly, but often there is this internal
pressure to be the top producer or get the stock options or join a
Big Six company.
</P>
<P>
   Those are admirable goals, as long as they are yours. The
problem is that people don't stop often enough to consider whether
the ambitions they had 10 years ago are still appropriate today.
When you are young, landing a job with a prestigious company sounds
like the most impressive career path, but you are usually too naive
to appreciate the sacrifices involved to make it to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   For every star at a prestigious company, there are dozens of
benchwarmers, people whose talent gets lost in the shuffle. It's
easy to become a faceless cog when there are dozens of people who
do your job just as well as you do.
</P>
<P>
   It also is easy for your priorities to change, without you even
realizing what is going on. You start a family or develop
wanderlust or gradually stop pushing yourself as hard as you used
to.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have the desire, you have to take a hard look at
whether you are talented enough to be on top. You can work hard to
build your skills, but an awful lot of people just don't have the
inherent talent necessary to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Players from Jackson State and Winthrop and Iona probably didn't
leave the tournament disappointed; they landed a spot with the big
organization, but realized they would never make it beyond the rank
and file. They met their goals.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, players from Indiana probably were
disappointed. Their school has a rich history, even though things
have been relatively shaky for several years. They have upper
management ambitions and rank-and-filer talent. That is a mixture
for frustration.
</P>
<P>
   And many people's definition of success doesn't involve the big
organization at all. An obvious example from college basketball is
that women's teams don't compete with the men. They put their
talents to better use by creating a tournament of their own, which
is smaller, but still successful.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate mentality doesn't suit a lot of workers from
either sex, but there are all sorts of jobs in small businesses, or
you can create a corporation of your own. If you are still in a
large corporation and it hasn't dawned on you that you are not a
good fit, though, you will be as frustrated as a women's team in
the men's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reputation can help you get in.
</P>
<P>
   A mediocre team from a well-respected conference like the Big
Ten will make it into the tournament a lot more often than a
mediocre team from a weak conference.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderfully talented people can make it to the top no matter
where they went to school, or whether they went to school at all.
But don't underestimate the importance of snob appeal. For young
people in particular, a degree from a prestigious university or an
internship with a top-ranked company can open a lot of doors.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't go to a big-name university, consider whether it
is worth your time to try for a fellowship or master's degree from
a more prestigious place. A lot of universities are offering
programs on line, so you might not have to leave work or choose a
nearby institution.
</P>
<P>
   The snob appeal degree goes along with the most basic rule of
career success: If you can make yourself stand out from the masses
in a favorable way, do it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to make the matchups work in your favor.
</P>
<P>
   Some basketball teams do best when the game is played at
breakneck speed, but others like to slow it down. Some play a zone
defense, others man-to-man. There is no ``right'' strategy; it
depends on the talent you have.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are great at everything, but you should be talented
at certain aspects of your job. Focus on getting the most out of
those skills. Could you help the company more if you restructured
your job? Is there another place that would be a better fit for
you? Being a great man-to-man defender doesn't do you a lot of good
if your team plays a zone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes life is brutally unfair.
</P>
<P>
   The best team doesn't always win. A few good teams don't get
invited to the tournament, and some great teams can't be at their
best because a key player is injured.
</P>
<P>
   Your career won't always be fair, either. You will have a boss
who doesn't appreciate you or an inept colleague who gets promoted
ahead of you or a company that crumbles around you.
</P>
<P>
   But referees also will make mistakes in your favor, and good
colleagues will support you more than you probably deserve. The
breaks have a way of evening out, as long as you play the game
well.

 &HT;    VICTORIOUS PUTIN REMAINS VAGUE ON PLANS TO RESTORE RUSSIAN
ECONOMY, SOCIETY
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ An energetic-looking President-elect Vladimir Putin
arrived at work Monday to meet with government leaders, but instead
of triumphant speeches about his election victory, Putin shed no
light about which way he'll lead the economy and society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of expectations is very high. People are tired and
struggling and they're hoping for things to get better, but
miracles don't happen,'' he said. ``A lot of things that will lead
to many controversies need to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of the vote counted, Russian election officials
named Putin, 47, the winner of only the second democratic
presidential election in Russia's history with 53 percent.
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov finished in second place
with a stronger-than-expected 29 percent, and liberal Gregory
Yavlinsky was third with 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Putin's victory has been expected since former
President Boris Yeltsin's abrupt resignation on Dec. 31, the novice
politician appeared unprepared with the first tough tasks of
office, namely nominating a new prime minister and Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's chief of staff, Dmitry Kozak, said Putin would wait to
publish his economic plan and list of ministerial candidates until
after his inauguration, which the Central Election Commission
tentatively scheduled for May 5. Putin cannot officially call
himself president until that time.
</P>
<P>
   Putin gave no hints Monday as to who he favors to head his new
government, saying only that cooperation is needed from all
political parties and that the results of the elections will have
to figure into his decision making.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said this signalled Putin's willingness to make room
for political opposition in the new government, especially the
Communists, with whom Putin's parliamentary bloc already has a
strategic alliance in the Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as Putin extended an olive branch to his rivals,
Zyuganov spent the day vilifying the elections as a sham, full of
gross violations. ``They have set up a zone of blanket fraud to
cheat citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's election commission as well as the head of the team of
international observers led by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, denied the allegations, saying if
minor irregularities occurred they would not change the overall
results.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE's special representative in charge of the observer
mission, Helle Degn, characterized the elections as fair ``to a
certain degree,'' calling into question biased media coverage of
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, 47, a virtual unknown in the Russian political world
until becoming prime minister in August, received flattering and
blanket coverage by the country's most influential broadcasters _
state-run television stations ORT and RTR _ throughout the
three-month campaign, which began after former President Boris
Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned on Dec. 31. Putin's opponents,
meanwhile, found themselves the target of negative attacks on TV,
or simply not shown at
</P>
<P>
   all.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's successful manipulation of the media, to forward the
government's war in the rebellious republic of Chechnya and to
publicize his preferred campaign image of a tough-talking,
effective leader, is one of the many reasons detractors fear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's full of words _ promises to end corruption, promises to
build our society again _ but we don't know who he really is or who
stands behind him,'' said Alexei Slavin, a Russian voter who chose
``None of the Above'' on the ballot sheet as a protest against
Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The former KGB officer's victory came as a relief to many
Russians after Yeltsin's poor health and the legacy of corruption
allegations within his family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people from Yeltsin's Kremlin administration widely
considered to have tight relations with the country's so-called
``oligarchs'' still held their jobs Monday morning. This fact
causes concern among anti-Putin observers that the country was in
for not a new era, like Putin promised voters, but four more years
of the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see him get rid of the rot (the oligarchs and their
Kremlin connections). Then maybe I'll change my mind'' about him,
said political analyst Lilia Schvetsova from the Moscow Carnegie
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has expressed uncertainty
over how vigorously Putin will pursue democratic change, U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that his words have the
right tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russians evidently want to live in a more orderly society. The
United States will watch closely to see how former intelligence
officer Vladimir Putin will try to instill this order as
president,'' she said in an interview with CNN. ``I think we're
going to have to see'' how strong Putin's commitment to democracy
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, born Oct. 7, 1952, is a fluent German speaker. He is
married and has two children.

DAIMLERCHRYSLER INVESTS IN MITSUBISHI MOTORS CORP.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ DaimlerChrysler AG signed an agreement Monday to invest
in Mitsubishi Motors Corp., finally securing the toehold in Asia
that it has long wanted.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler will pay $2.1 billion to buy newly issued shares
that will give it a 33.4 percent stake in Mitsubishi, enough to
guarantee it board representation and limited veto power. On a
fully diluted basis, DaimlerChrysler will be paying a 7.4 percent
premium on the price at which Mitsubishi shares closed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The German car company said that the alliance gave it entree to
Asian markets as well as access to small car technology that it
would use to expand its Smart car brand. DaimlerChrysler said
Monday that Mitsubishi will supply transmissions and direct
injection gasoline engines for Smart cars, thus sharply curtailing
development costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have closed the circle,'' Juergen Schrempp, chairman of
DaimlerChrysler, told reporters at the company's headquarters in
Stuttgart Monday. ``We have covered all the markets of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mitsubishi, the agreement means survival. With debts that
outweigh equity by a factor of five and a history of poor
profitability, the company needed a partner.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of two years, 7 of Japan's 11 automakers have taken
foreign partners _ a stunning trend considering how closed this
market has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of Japanese automakers, this was the last one
available,'' said Christopher Richter, an analyst at HSBC
Securities in Tokyo. ``Toyota is too big, Honda has no apparent
interest in an alliance and competition for the Korean automakers
is intense.''
</P>
<P>
   That begs the question of whether DaimlerChrysler is paying a
price for walking away from a deal with Nissan Motor Co. nearly a
year ago. Since then, DaimlerChrysler has talked with PSA Peugeot
Citroen, Fiat and others but failed to clinch a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding its truck business, which is not part of the
agreement, Mitsubishi has a much smaller product line than Nissan,
and debt accounts for a bigger portion of its balance sheet than
did Nissan's debts.
</P>
<P>
   And it is an integral part of a tightly knit business cluster,
the Mitsubishi Group, which has resisted political and financial
pressure to dismantle itself, unlike other Japanese conglomerates.
Mitsubishi Group companies own, and will continue to own, a larger
portion of Mitsubishi Motors than members of the Fuyo Group held in
Nissan, according to Richter.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kentaro Aikawa, the former chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, Mitsubishi's biggest shareholder, is infamous for
saying that shareholders do not matter. ``The notion that accrued
profits belong to shareholders is an American one,'' Aikawa said in
1997. ``In Japan, these profits go to paying employee salaries,
even when the work dries up.''
</P>
<P>
   While Aikawa has since taken an advisory role at the company,
his sentiments have continued to color perceptions here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the biggest challenges here will be providing
DaimlerChrysler with the management access and participation it
wants while keeping the existing management team in place to keep
the Mitsubishi group happy,'' said Steven Usher, an analyst at
Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. ``I think that will be very
touchy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nissan announced a year ago that it had sold a
similar-sized stake to Renault S.A. of France, it was clear that
the company had resigned itself to the management of its partner.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ghosn, a senior executive of Renault, had been identified
at the news conference announcing the deal as Nissan's new chief
operating officer, and he began his job almost immediately. He was
quickly followed by 40 other Renault executives, who made no secret
of the fact that they were, in effect, in charge.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler had no version of Ghosn on hand Monday. Instead,
Katsuhiko Kawasoe, who has tenaciously guarded Mitsubishi's
independence for the last two years, remains as president, or
``shatcho,'' a title that confers a great deal more authority and
weight here than it does in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler has demonstrated its ability to wield management control
over Chrysler, which has seen a veritable flood of executives
depart in the wake of the merger more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was the early departure of Robert Eaton, Chrysler's former
chief executive, that opened the door to negotiations with
Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether Mitsubishi Motors will give DaimlerChrysler as big a
market in Asia as DaimlerChrysler believes is another question.
Mitsubishi Motors has an impressive distribution network in the
region, and its market shares there are higher than Nissan's if its
truck operations are taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitsubishi Motors signed a deal with Volvo last year that
gives the Swedish company a 19 percent stake in Mitsubishi's truck
business, and Volvo has said it is not interested in selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have been a lot more attractive for DaimlerChrysler
if trucks were part of it,'' Richter said.

&HT;     THE CONVICTS AMONG US 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's not just seeing new people and new lands
that is the reward of overseas travel, but also what you sometimes
discover about your own country.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with five weeks touring New Zealand and Australia
recently. Sights of nature compelling in their unique attraction,
people viewed in their own national setting and exposure to the
cultures specific to these countries were ample reward for the time
and money spent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the good travel engenders, there is hubris that
might go with it: the presumption of observations based on slight
experience.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealanders and Australians, though different from each other
in ways immediately apparent, are similarly friendly to visitors,
as they are with their countrymen. They have a good humor and
openness with each other that long ago disappeared from every day
life in America.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the niceness, they are helpful in everyday discourse,
displaying courtesies long neglected in American life. Ask an
employee of the Sydney monorail how to cope with the ticketing and
for help to get where you want to go, and you get a full-blown and
kindly explanation that solves your problem and leaves you feeling
good.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly striking is the cleanliness of the big cities, with
populations in the millions, which manage nevertheless to be tidy.
A civic morale is in play in both countries that we Americans
should envy. More than that, we should work to emulate it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a secret to Americans that they are much liked in both
New Zealand and Australia, in part because the United States in
World War II shielded them from Japanese invasion while their
fighting forces were engaged in other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Australians (as do New Zealanders) take their wars seriously.
Each city, each town, each village has a memorial to the war dead,
put in place for the bitter sacrifices of their young men in World
War I at Gallipoli and augmented to note their participation in
subsequent wars.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as binding as America's wartime help was America's
history. Each place we visited in Australia, we were made aware by
our lecturers and guides of the country's short history.
</P>
<P>
   Their beginning as a European settlement came in 1788, with
arrival of the First Fleet, which plays the role in Australian
history and national mythology that the Mayflower does in ours. To
have an ancestor on the ships that arrived then is to possess a
superior pedigree. There is special poignancy in the fact that
unlike those who sailed on the Mayflower, those in the First Fleet
were convicts expelled by Britain to exile on the other side of the
world and their keepers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, those ancestors deemed criminals in their own time are
proudly remembered by their progeny as the people who pioneered
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Australians connect to Americans because they believe, as a
national credo, that if it hadn't been for that dust-up in 1776,
many of them would be living in the United States. Time and again
we visitors were reminded that it was only because the American
Revolution stopped Britain from exporting convicts to its American
Colonies that the First Fleet sailed 12 years later for that land
so far away.
</P>
<P>
   We Americans listened to this version politely and with some
amusement for hardly anyone of the 30-odd on the tour recollected
the role that British convicts were supposed to have played in our
country's early settlement.
</P>
<P>
   It was pointed out to our lecturers and instructors that if the
export of convicts to America had occurred, it escaped Thomas
Jefferson as a problem about which to complain in our proudest
national document. In the Declaration of Independence, which is a
catalog of grievances against the depredations of the British king,
not a word about convicts appears.
</P>
<P>
   However, historical documents show that the Australians knew
what they were talking about. Although none in our group recalled
the mention of this salient fact in our early schooling,
one-quarter of the early British emigrants in America were
convicts.
</P>
<P>
   Americans resemble their Australian cousins in that they
thoroughly absorbed these convicts into the national culture,
although they formed a lesser part of the whole than they did in
Australia. Unlike the Australians, we appear to fail to recollect
what brought them here in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Australians recollect their forebears fondly, reciting the
crimes for which they were transported. Americans are taught that
settlers came for religious and political freedom or the chance to
make a living. The convicts among our early settlers are widely
ignored, as if it were something to be embarrassed about.

 &HT;    GARBAGE IN AMERICA: MORE RECYCLING AND MORE WASTING
 &HT;    With GARBAGE-DATA.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans are recycling trash and garbage like
never before _ but the tonnage of discarded waste has also started
to grow after several years of decline.
</P>
<P>
   Increased economic activity, which enabled Americans to buy and
use more products and materials, appears to have been largely
responsible for the generation of 217 million tons of municipal
solid waste in 1997, the most recent year for which statistics are
available.
</P>
<P>
   That's the largest amount since the data have been collected,
according to the most recent update of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's continuing report, ``Characterization of
Municipal Solid Waste in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   From this record garbage pile, roughly 61 million tons of trash
found its way to recycling centers in 1997, also the largest
quantity in history.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to statistics posted on the Internet by
EPA, is that 156.3 million tons of municipal solid waste went to
the country's landfills and incinerators in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While significantly lower than the 172 million tons discarded in
1990, the 1997 total represented an increase of 4.4 million tons
from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by state and federal mandates, recycling and composting
of municipal solid waste have increased dramatically over the past
decade. There were more than 9,000 curbside recycling programs in
America in 1997, and 12,000 drop-off centers for recyclables.
</P>
<P>
   Waste News, a solid waste industry publication, reported
recently that in little over a decade, California cities and towns
have recycled enough waste to fill a line of garbage trucks that
would encircle the Earth four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA has established a target recycling goal of 35 percent by
the year 2005, while maintaining the per capita generation of solid
waste at 4.3 pounds per person per day,'' said consultants who
prepared the waste report. ``The nation appears to be on track to
meet that goal, but it will take continued commitment from
business, industry, government and the public to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   But citing the 1997 upturn in the national tonnage of discarded
waste, two recycling advocacy groups said Monday the federal
government should invest more in recycling and stop ``subsidizing''
the use of virgin materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our present pattern of using resources is not sustainable,''
said the Athens, Ga., GrassRoots(cq) Recycling Network and the
Institute for Local Self-Reliance in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a period of increasing recycling rates and decreasing
wasting rates in the early 1990s, wasting is now increasing and
recycling gains have slowed,'' the groups said.
</P>
<P>
   In a jointly issued report titled ``Wasting and Recycling in the
United States, 2000,'' the two organizations said local governments
and taxpayers spend $43.5 billion a year ``collecting and disposing
of municipal discards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence, disposing of municipal discards is an unfunded
mandate,'' the report declared.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA report projects that between 156 million and 163 million
tons of solid waste will have to be incinerated or sent to
landfills in 2005, depending on recycling trends.

&HT;     COUPLES TIE THE KNOT WITH EXTRAVAGANT TWISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VICKI HADDOCK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Why simply tie the knot when you can do it with
a twist?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question prompting a growing number of couples to
transform their weddings around tradition-defying themes. The trend
is flourishing in Northern California, where experts now say at
least one in every 20 weddings is a themed concoction _ be it a
Roman toga feast, a cowboy barbecue hoedown or a you-name-it.
</P>
<P>
   Among recent examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ When two diving enthusiasts took the plunge off the Monterey
Coast, guests who wanted to witness the underwater vows had to
likewise submerge themselves. The bride was radiant in an ivory wet
suit, now routinely offered as a wedding accessory by two
manufacturers of scuba gear.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Berkeley couple staged a masquerade Halloween wedding,
hosting guests who came disguised as gypsies, Civil War soldiers,
sultans and a ``friendly'' ax murderer. The bride and groom
contemplated but ultimately nixed the notions of trick-or-treat
stations and a bubbling caldron of witches' brew. Instead,
invitations evoked a classic All Hallow's Eve and noted ``elegant
please  &Cx1f; _ no gorilla costumes.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A Mill Valley pair decided to let the good times roll with a
jazzy Mardi Gras wedding, where guests were showered with Carnival
beads and served hurricane cocktails with corn bread, Chilean sea
bass and collard greens.
</P>
<P>
   _ Renaissance romance was the theme for the nuptials of a Sonoma
bride whose green and gold period wedding gown was created by the
costumers at the American Conservatory Theater. Nearly all the 180
wedding guests likewise donned Renaissance garb to watch as the
groom serenaded them with his lute rendition of ``A Lover and His
Lass.'' The minister, dressed as the ``King of the Realm,''
officiated by touching the bowed couple with his outstretched
sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our friends said it'll be hard for them to plan their
weddings after ours, that we set the standard too high,'' said
Aaron Leventhal, who married Laura Ackerman in the Halloween
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think theme weddings can be a very good thing and a lot
more interesting because they're a little unpredictable,'' he
added. ``Ours allowed all of our creative friends to express
themselves and really be a part of the whole process of our
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledges, not everybody is sold on the idea of
nuptials as a participatory sport. Some relatives thought the theme
idea was nuts. And Miss Manners, he grants, ``would definitely not
approve of the ax murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved my wedding. It was like a fairy tale come true,'' said
Marcia Gerbode of her Elizabethan spectacular in St. Helena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both drawn to the Renaissance because people were so
zestful and lusty then _ they really knew how to live,`` sais Frank
Gerbode, the groom. ``That was exactly the theme we wanted for our
life together.''
</P>
<P>
   Some wedding planners sniff at the mention of elaborate theme
weddings, saying they trivialize the dignity of the marriage
ceremony. One San Francisco bridal consultant who requested
anonymity said they tend to be ``totally kitschy. If you want
Disneyland, go to Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   But professionals who disdain theme weddings increasingly do so
at their peril, said Gerard J. Monaghan, president of the
2,200-member Association of Bridal Consultants, based in New
Milford, Conn. He estimates that theme weddings have doubled in
popularity in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they turn up their nose, they're missing a lot of
business,'' he said. ``Couples today want to personalize things.
They don't want their mother's wedding. They don't want to have to
mold their special day to somebody else's ideal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tired of going to weddings where the only difference
is the color of the bridesmaid's dresses. Why not have a part
that's unique to them?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Monaghan has his limits.
</P>
<P>
   Example: the wedding where the bride wore a black gown and
exchanged vows in a cemetery at midnight. ``Without wanting to
characterize people,'' he said, ``that's strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's strong economy is contributing to the unusual weddings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what influences the trend toward theme weddings is,
frankly, money,'' said Kristen McCormick of An Entertaining Company
in Santa Rosa. McCormick coordinated the Renaissance wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Extravagance certainly was a prerequisite for the couple who
tented the tennis courts of a Stanford University estate, rolled
out Persian carpets and welcomed sari-costumed guests for an
India-themed wedding. Not to mention the Roman wedding couple who
arrived via a horse-pulled chariot.
</P>
<P>
   But for daring couples on a small budget, there is always the
Internet. Various sites now offer do-it-yourself kits for couples
desiring an intergalactic, Egyptian, gangster or rock 'n' roll
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal and Ackerman pulled off their Halloween masquerade
wedding without the use of consultants _ relying on friends who
joined brainstorming sessions and even helped make masks for
favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may get to return the favor soon,'' Leventhal said. ``Two
of our friends are thinking of doing a Roaring '20s or Gay '90s
theme for their wedding. They are now inspired.''

RELATIVES OF CUBAN BOY SEEK TO SPEED UP APPEALS PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family members of Elian Gonzalez filed an emergency motion
Monday to try and speed up an appeals process that could ultimately
block the U.S. government from sending the 6-year-old boy back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The motion, filed by lawyers Monday morning with the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, is a request to schedule
briefings and oral arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, Elian's great-uncle, and other relatives are
appealing to overturn a decision last week by a federal district
court in Miami that said that only the U.S. attorney general can
grant the boy political asylum. In that March 22 ruling, Judge K.
Michael Moore dismissed a lawsuit filed by Lazaro Gonzalez to try
and compel immigration officials to grant Elian an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez filed an appeal with the Atlanta
court immediately after Moore's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said last week that the government
will work quickly to reunite the boy with his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, who lives in Cuba. But many Cuban-Americans who oppose
Fidel Castro's communist regime are pushing for the U.S. government
to keep the boy in this country, pointing to the fact that Elian's
mother took her son with her on a desperate flight from her
homeland. The mother and 10 other Cubans died in November when
their boat capsized, but fishermen found Elian floating off the
Florida coast in an inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's motion does not prevent the government from deporting
Elian but simply asks for the court to speed up the appeals
process. Reno has said that she can return Elian to his father
before the appellate arguments begin, but she has not given a
timetable.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The judge who will consider the motion has not been assigned,
said Thomas Kahn, the court clerk. He also said there was no way to
tell exactly how long it will take for the judge to act on the
motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``To what extent the court will act on it, I don't know,'' Kahn
said in a telephone interview. ``It will happen fairly
expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent attempt to drum up more support for blocking
Elian's return, the boy's Miami relatives allowed ABC's Diane
Sawyer to interview the boy in his private school last week. The
interview was broadcast Monday on ``Good Morning America.'' Elian
said through interpreters that he remembered water rushing into the
boat and then falling asleep after his mother placed him in an
inner tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is not in heaven, not lost,'' he said through his
cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez. ``She must have been picked up here in
Miami somewhere. She must have lost her memory, and just doesn't
know I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Elian used crayons to draw the waves that
lapped water into the boat. He sketched himself as a stick figure
in an inner tube, with a dolphin leaping above nearby waves.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech given in Havana on Sunday, Fidel Castro said
subjecting the boy to the interview was ``monstrous and
sickening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely think that this boy is at risk in the hands of
desperate people and the government of the United States should not
be running this risk,'' Castro said, according to The Associated
Press.
</P>

   Since November, Cuban-Americans who fled from Castro's
government have lobbied politicians, paid for expensive media
advertisements and staged protests across the country.
Demonstrations have intensified since Moore's ruling last week, and
about 100 protesters gathered outside Elian's Miami home Monday.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moore's ruling came as a major blow to the boy's relatives in
Miami. Their lawyers had argued before the judge that Elian had
been denied the due process granted to other people who come to the
United States seeking asylum. But in his 50-page ruling, Moore said
that ``the determination to grant asylum is a matter within the
discretion of the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said that he supports the January decision
reached by immigration officials to return Elian to Cuba. Those
officials argued that the boy was too young to apply for asylum and
that only a parent or guardian could file for him. They said the
wishes of the boy's father should be respected over those of his
grand-uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., asked the Immigration and
Naturalization Service to put off returning the boy until Congress
could consider a bill that would grant U.S. citizenship to Elian.
Mack sponsored the bill in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But in his ruling, Moore emphasized the need to return Elian to
Cuba as soon as possible. He said that ``even this well-intended
litigation has the capacity to bring about unintended harm'' and
that ``each passing day is a day lost between Juan Gonzalez and his
son.''

   Attention health-conscious shoppers: The salad dressing in aisle
one is now spiked with a drug that lowers your cholesterol. In the
produce section, you'll find carrots bred to reduce the risk of
cancer. And on the way out, why not grab a snack bar that helps
stave off heart disease?
</P>
<P>
   Functional foods _ those that confer benefits beyond basic
nutrition _ are changing the rules about how to eat healthy.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, your staid supermarket will sell an array
of ordinary edibles with extraordinary claims. The first of these
products _ just hitting the market _ contains novel
health-enhancing additives or benefit from breeding intended to
boost the innate medicinal properties of fruits and vegetables.
Farther ahead, some researchers plan to redesign nature's bounty
from the genes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing the marriage of the food and pharmaceutical
industries,'' says food scientist Manfred Kroger of Pennsylvania
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly six in 10 shoppers already choose groceries with the
idea of managing or lowering their risk of illness. Rudimentary
functional foods _ such as orange juice enriched with vitamins C
and E _ are a $15 billion market in this country, says Tom Aarts,
publisher of the Nutrition Business Journal in San Diego. Those
numbers are expected to soar over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, the giant Swiss-based pharmaceutical corporation, is
throwing its full weight behind the functional-food movement. For
years the company has touted Ovaltine, its chocolate-milk mix, as a
vitamin and mineral supplement. Last year in Europe, Novartis
introduced a broad line of cereals, snack bars and other foods
spiked with ingredients that diminish the likelihood of heart
disease and osteoporosis. The products still rely on relatively
traditional health aids like calcium and dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis is readying foods with a new functional additive:
Phytrol, a wood-pulp extract that lowers levels of ``bad'' LDL
cholesterol in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that
soy protein lowers heart-disease risk, guaranteeing that a slew of
soy-enriched foods will show up in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The produce section of the grocery is also getting a functional
makeover. Leonard Pike of Texas A&AMP;M University has created
BetaSweet, a maroon carrot packed with beta-carotene and
anthocyanin, antioxidants that may reduce the risk of cancer and
fight aging. Adventurous shoppers are crunching the BetaSweet right
now in its Houston test market.
</P>
<P>
   Pike is also breeding carrots rich in lycopene _ a chemical that
gives tomatoes their red color and may also reduce the risk of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are delving into DNA in their quest for better
ways to eat. At Monsanto, researchers are reconfiguring the genes
of potato plants to create a starchier tuber that absorbs less oil
during frying.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Arntzen, president of the Boyce Thompson Institute for
Plant Research at Cornell University, is working on perhaps the
most ambitious genetically engineered food of all: an edible
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Arntzen and his colleagues genetically modified potatoes so they
incorporate a protein from the hepatitis B virus. The protein is
harmless, but it trains the immune system to recognize the virus
and mount a preemptive defense.
</P>
<P>
   Arntzen is also working on engineered bananas and tomatoes and
targeting other diseases, such as cholera. Preliminary human trials
last year showed the concept works with raw potatoes. Follow-up
studies with processed potatoes and tomatoes are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Like iron-rich rice, disease-preventing foods are intended
primarily for poor countries where hundreds of millions of children
today do not have access to vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can make a tomato sauce whether they're in Colombia or
Cambodia,'' Arntzen says.
</P>
<P>
   But custom-designed functional foods are still a long way from
the dinner table. Some scientists and activists suspect tinkering
with DNA will cause long-term health and environmental problems.
Opposition to genetically modified food, which has sparked mass
demonstrations in Europe, is growing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean DellaPenna, a plant biologist at the University of
Nevada at Reno, is more concerned that the genetic-engineering
debate will slow efforts to improve nutrition worldwide. Many
people get enough to eat, he notes, but still suffer from
malnutrition because they do not have access to a well-rounded
diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bellies are full, so we can afford to argue, but some 3
billion people in the world don't have that luxury. Once we can
show the direct benefit of genetic modification, I hope consumers
will realize the possibilities of the technology,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   DellaPenna hopes to make his case by showing how to reconfigure
staple crops to increase their vitamin E content tenfold. Plenty of
other functional foods don't require cracking the genome. Additives
like Phytrol and soy protein are derived from perfectly ordinary
trees and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Pike used only conventional breeding for his BetaSweet carrot,
crossing seeds from Brazil to obtain a root with stellar taste and
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be as fast or exciting as genetic modification, but
we can do it without upsetting people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Breeding alone could still fill stores with racks of
heart-friendly soybeans, cancer-fighting tomatoes and anticlotting
onions.
</P>
<P>
   Clare Hasler, director of the Functional Foods for Health
Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, predicts
tomorrow's grocery store will house a miniclinic that administers a
quick blood test and a genome printout, including a person's top
disease risks and a recommended shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, that will lead people to diet patterns that defray
_ or even eliminate _ many of the chronic diseases we face,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   If privacy is an issue, people might run their genome tests at
home and then shop for appropriately tailored foods on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the focus on individualized nutrition will begin
before birth, Kroger says. Hospitals already test babies for the
enzyme phenylalanine hydrolase. Children who lack it must avoid any
food containing the amino acid phenylalanine _ including meat and
even mother's milk _ or risk mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already modifying diet based on a gene,'' Kroger says.
``Soon, we'll be able to go a step further _ to take an amniotic
fluid sample from an unborn baby and determine its genome.''
</P>
<P>
   Careful parents could then pick out optimal functional baby
foods. If the food companies have their way, that's one early trend
that will stick around for a lifetime.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   About a millennium ago, legends tell us, a Viking named Leif
Eriksson sailed to the shores of North America, arriving hundreds
of years ahead of Christopher Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though archaeologists have yet to uncover any physical
evidence of Eriksson's visit, the presumption that a Viking band
traveled that far has gained credibility in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations in Greenland indicate that Vikings flourished there
for hundreds of years, trading with the European continent and
probably Native-American tribes, before inexplicably disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   A central figure in this historical drama was Eriksson's father,
Erik the Red, who grew up in Iceland after his father, Thorvald
Asvaldsson, was exiled from Norway around 965 for ``some
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   When Erik was a child, Iceland already boasted a
well-established colony of Vikings who had fled a land squeeze in
Norway and the iron rule of King Harald Fairhair.
</P>
<P>
   In 980, Erik the Red headed even farther west when he was
banished from Iceland _ for murder. He set sail for land that was
visible west of Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he returned to Iceland and convinced hundreds
of others to join him in settling this new country. Some 25 boats
set out for what Erik the Red had dubbed Greenland. Only 14 ships
survived the seas, but about 450 new colonists set foot ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The land was bare, uninhabited and inhospitable, but Erik the
Red's advertisements were not entirely false. A thin green carpet
of arctic heath promised support for grazing farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Farms sprang up quickly and, later, churches. One colony, simply
called the Eastern Settlement, sat in the toe of Greenland; the
Western Settlement lay close to what is now Nuuk, Greenland's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what would have been at best harsh living conditions,
the Greenland Vikings' outposts began to thrive. Archaeologists
estimate that at one point perhaps 3,000 Vikings lived on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Then all of them vanished. The mystery of their fate was
rekindled in 1721 when a Danish-Norwegian missionary who set out to
convert Eskimos decided to look for traces of the old Viking
settlers. His findings began an inquiry that has intensified over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant progress unearthing ancient settlements,
archaeologists still haven't found an answer. Was it plague, cold,
hunger, conflict with Eskimos or sheer hardship that finished off
these stalwart pioneers?
 &UR; LIFE IN GREENLAND &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Settling Greenland posed a formidable challenge. There are no
trees large enough to produce timber for shelter or fuel. The only
wood is small brush and driftwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings settled on fjords resembling those of their
homeland. There they built homes of driftwood, stone and sod. For
adequate insulation, the walls of some buildings were made six to
10 feet thick.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the most well-excavated Western Settlement sites,
called the ``farm beneath the sand,'' archaeologists have turned up
detailed evidence of the Viking way of life in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Caribou hunters who noticed timbers poking out of sandy soil
discovered the site in 1990. They contacted the Greenland National
Museum and Archives, and archaeologists set to work meticulously
removing 1,000 tons of sand by hand to get a close look at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   One structure is the remains of a great hall once lined with
benches. Archaeologists estimate that to create a structure of that
size with walls of sod required stripping more than 1,000 square
meters of turf.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter, food and clothing were, of course, essential to
survival. The summer was too short to farm grain crops, so settlers
probably went without beer or bread. Although they farmed
domesticated animals imported from Europe _ goats, sheep, cattle _
the settlers ate them sparingly, relying instead on milk and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, the Greenlanders' lives differed little from
those of their compatriots in Scandinavia. They netted fish and
hunted seal and caribou. They wove clothing from wool and linen.
</P>
<P>
   For about two centuries, Greenland's Vikings had the country to
themselves. Yet they relied on a fragile trade with Scandinavia to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for iron, timber and grain from Europe, they traded
pelts of bear and arctic fox as well as narwhale tusks and rope
made of walrus hide. Whalebone, too, was traded to Europeans for
use in stiffening clothes.
</P>
<P>
   According to one account, the Greenlanders even traded live
polar bears. They may also have ventured to North America for
timber.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Viking structures at L'Anse aux Meadows in
Newfoundland testify to a short-lived presence there. Unlike
southern Greenland in the 10th century, North America was already
populated, and newcomers may not have been welcome.
 &UR; THE SETTLEMENTS GO EXTINCT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At some point during the 14th century, Greenland's climate grew
colder. With the climate change, glaciers began creeping over the
land, bringing with them a runoff of sand, silt and gravel. That
runoff slowly robbed the settlers of valuable pastureland.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, says Danish archaeologist Jette Arneborg,
the Black Death had decimated Norway, wiping out nearly two-thirds
of the population. The plague hit Iceland, too, killing some 30
percent. Although there is still no evidence the sickness reached
Greenland, archaeologists believe it left its mark by curtailing
the flourishing trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenlanders adapted. Recent evidence shows that their diet
shifted from land-based foods to marine products. Researchers
measured this shift by examining the ratio of two forms of carbon _
a common form with 12 neutrons and a rare form with 13 _ in the
bones of 27 settlers from different time periods. The count reveals
variations in the way forms of carbon are deposited and metabolized
in food chains in the ocean and on land.
</P>
<P>
   Like their kin in Norway, the Vikings in Greenland had always
exploited marine life but, by the close of the 14th century, the
proportion of their food taken from the sea had risen to 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1100 and 1200 A.D., as the colder weather arrived, so
did the Thules. These Native-Americans, migrants from the area
surrounding the Bering Strait, began trickling eastward from
Ellesmere Island, just northwest of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have speculated that Greenland Vikings may have
met and intermingled with them, but researchers examining skulls
found at Viking sites have found no traces of Native-American
morphology. Others theorize that the Vikings clashed with the
Thules, as recounted in Native-American legends. It's more likely
that an uneasy trade between the two groups sprang up and, as
living conditions grew harsher for the Vikings, the better-adapted
Thules thrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Settlement was abandoned by 1350 and the Eastern
Settlement by 1500. Among the last written records of the Vikings
in Greenland is a record of a Christian wedding ceremony at Hvalsey
Church in the Eastern Settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating youth, optimism and prosperity, it is wistful proof
of the dreams Vikings had in settling this barren and young new
world.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what became of them, Arneborg says she thinks they
struggled mightily to adapt to the increasingly difficult
conditions. But as the weather worsened and life became even
harsher, some may have returned to Iceland. And it's easy to
imagine that, as trade dwindled, the settlements may have become so
depopulated the colonists simply were unable to replace themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The southern part of Greenland can be terrible,'' Arneborg
says. ``Storms show up in a minute. I would never be able to do
it.'' &QL;

<P>
   About a millennium ago, legends tell us, a Viking named Leif
Eriksson sailed to the shores of North America, arriving hundreds
of years ahead of Christopher Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though archaeologists have yet to uncover any physical
evidence of Eriksson's visit, the presumption that a Viking band
traveled that far has gained credibility in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations in Greenland indicate that Vikings flourished there
for hundreds of years, trading with the European continent and
probably Native-American tribes, before inexplicably disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   A central figure in this historical drama was Eriksson's father,
Erik the Red, who grew up in Iceland after his father, Thorvald
Asvaldsson, was exiled from Norway around 965 for ``some
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   When Erik was a child, Iceland already boasted a
well-established colony of Vikings who had fled a land squeeze in
Norway and the iron rule of King Harald Fairhair.
</P>
<P>
   In 980, Erik the Red headed even farther west when he was
banished from Iceland _ for murder. He set sail for land that was
visible west of Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he returned to Iceland and convinced hundreds
of others to join him in settling this new country. Some 25 boats
set out for what Erik the Red had dubbed Greenland. Only 14 ships
survived the seas, but about 450 new colonists set foot ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The land was bare, uninhabited and inhospitable, but Erik the
Red's advertisements were not entirely false. A thin green carpet
of arctic heath promised support for grazing farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Farms sprang up quickly and, later, churches. One colony, simply
called the Eastern Settlement, sat in the toe of Greenland; the
Western Settlement lay close to what is now Nuuk, Greenland's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what would have been at best harsh living conditions,
the Greenland Vikings' outposts began to thrive. Archaeologists
estimate that at one point perhaps 3,000 Vikings lived on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Then all of them vanished. The mystery of their fate was
rekindled in 1721 when a Danish-Norwegian missionary who set out to
convert Eskimos decided to look for traces of the old Viking
settlers. His findings began an inquiry that has intensified over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant progress unearthing ancient settlements,
archaeologists still haven't found an answer. Was it plague, cold,
hunger, conflict with Eskimos or sheer hardship that finished off
these stalwart pioneers?
 &UR; LIFE IN GREENLAND &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Settling Greenland posed a formidable challenge. There are no
trees large enough to produce timber for shelter or fuel. The only
wood is small brush and driftwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings settled on fjords resembling those of their
homeland. There they built homes of driftwood, stone and sod. For
adequate insulation, the walls of some buildings were made six to
10 feet thick.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the most well-excavated Western Settlement sites,
called the ``farm beneath the sand,'' archaeologists have turned up
detailed evidence of the Viking way of life in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Caribou hunters who noticed timbers poking out of sandy soil
discovered the site in 1990. They contacted the Greenland National
Museum and Archives, and archaeologists set to work meticulously
removing 1,000 tons of sand by hand to get a close look at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   One structure is the remains of a great hall once lined with
benches. Archaeologists estimate that to create a structure of that
size with walls of sod required stripping more than 1,000 square
meters of turf.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter, food and clothing were, of course, essential to
survival. The summer was too short to farm grain crops, so settlers
probably went without beer or bread. Although they farmed
domesticated animals imported from Europe _ goats, sheep, cattle _
the settlers ate them sparingly, relying instead on milk and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, the Greenlanders' lives differed little from
those of their compatriots in Scandinavia. They netted fish and
hunted seal and caribou. They wove clothing from wool and linen.
</P>
<P>
   For about two centuries, Greenland's Vikings had the country to
themselves. Yet they relied on a fragile trade with Scandinavia to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for iron, timber and grain from Europe, they traded
pelts of bear and arctic fox as well as narwhale tusks and rope
made of walrus hide. Whalebone, too, was traded to Europeans for
use in stiffening clothes.
</P>
<P>
   According to one account, the Greenlanders even traded live
polar bears. They may also have ventured to North America for
timber.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Viking structures at L'Anse aux Meadows in
Newfoundland testify to a short-lived presence there. Unlike
southern Greenland in the 10th century, North America was already
populated, and newcomers may not have been welcome.
 &UR; THE SETTLEMENTS GO EXTINCT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At some point during the 14th century, Greenland's climate grew
colder. With the climate change, glaciers began creeping over the
land, bringing with them a runoff of sand, silt and gravel. That
runoff slowly robbed the settlers of valuable pastureland.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, says Danish archaeologist Jette Arneborg,
the Black Death had decimated Norway, wiping out nearly two-thirds
of the population. The plague hit Iceland, too, killing some 30
percent. Although there is still no evidence the sickness reached
Greenland, archaeologists believe it left its mark by curtailing
the flourishing trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenlanders adapted. Recent evidence shows that their diet
shifted from land-based foods to marine products. Researchers
measured this shift by examining the ratio of two forms of carbon _
a common form with 12 neutrons and a rare form with 13 _ in the
bones of 27 settlers from different time periods. The count reveals
variations in the way forms of carbon are deposited and metabolized
in food chains in the ocean and on land.
</P>
<P>
   Like their kin in Norway, the Vikings in Greenland had always
exploited marine life but, by the close of the 14th century, the
proportion of their food taken from the sea had risen to 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1100 and 1200 A.D., as the colder weather arrived, so
did the Thules. These Native-Americans, migrants from the area
surrounding the Bering Strait, began trickling eastward from
Ellesmere Island, just northwest of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have speculated that Greenland Vikings may have
met and intermingled with them, but researchers examining skulls
found at Viking sites have found no traces of Native-American
morphology. Others theorize that the Vikings clashed with the
Thules, as recounted in Native-American legends. It's more likely
that an uneasy trade between the two groups sprang up and, as
living conditions grew harsher for the Vikings, the better-adapted
Thules thrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Settlement was abandoned by 1350 and the Eastern
Settlement by 1500. Among the last written records of the Vikings
in Greenland is a record of a Christian wedding ceremony at Hvalsey
Church in the Eastern Settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating youth, optimism and prosperity, it is wistful proof
of the dreams Vikings had in settling this barren and young new
world.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what became of them, Arneborg says she thinks they
struggled mightily to adapt to the increasingly difficult
conditions. But as the weather worsened and life became even
harsher, some may have returned to Iceland. And it's easy to
imagine that, as trade dwindled, the settlements may have become so
depopulated the colonists simply were unable to replace themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The southern part of Greenland can be terrible,'' Arneborg
says. ``Storms show up in a minute. I would never be able to do
it.'' &QL;

   Attention health-conscious shoppers: The salad dressing in aisle
one is now spiked with a drug that lowers your cholesterol. In the
produce section, you'll find carrots bred to reduce the risk of
cancer. And on the way out, why not grab a snack bar that helps
stave off heart disease?
</P>
<P>
   Functional foods _ those that confer benefits beyond basic
nutrition _ are changing the rules about how to eat healthy.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, your staid supermarket will sell an array
of ordinary edibles with extraordinary claims. The first of these
products _ just hitting the market _ contains novel
health-enhancing additives or benefit from breeding intended to
boost the innate medicinal properties of fruits and vegetables.
Farther ahead, some researchers plan to redesign nature's bounty
from the genes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing the marriage of the food and pharmaceutical
industries,'' says food scientist Manfred Kroger of Pennsylvania
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly six in 10 shoppers already choose groceries with the
idea of managing or lowering their risk of illness. Rudimentary
functional foods _ such as orange juice enriched with vitamins C
and E _ are a $15 billion market in this country, says Tom Aarts,
publisher of the Nutrition Business Journal in San Diego. Those
numbers are expected to soar over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, the giant Swiss-based pharmaceutical corporation, is
throwing its full weight behind the functional-food movement. For
years the company has touted Ovaltine, its chocolate-milk mix, as a
vitamin and mineral supplement. Last year in Europe, Novartis
introduced a broad line of cereals, snack bars and other foods
spiked with ingredients that diminish the likelihood of heart
disease and osteoporosis. The products still rely on relatively
traditional health aids like calcium and dietary fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis is readying foods with a new functional additive:
Phytrol, a wood-pulp extract that lowers levels of ``bad'' LDL
cholesterol in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that
soy protein lowers heart-disease risk, guaranteeing that a slew of
soy-enriched foods will show up in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The produce section of the grocery is also getting a functional
makeover. Leonard Pike of Texas A&AMP;M University has created
BetaSweet, a maroon carrot packed with beta-carotene and
anthocyanin, antioxidants that may reduce the risk of cancer and
fight aging. Adventurous shoppers are crunching the BetaSweet right
now in its Houston test market.
</P>
<P>
   Pike is also breeding carrots rich in lycopene _ a chemical that
gives tomatoes their red color and may also reduce the risk of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are delving into DNA in their quest for better
ways to eat. At Monsanto, researchers are reconfiguring the genes
of potato plants to create a starchier tuber that absorbs less oil
during frying.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Arntzen, president of the Boyce Thompson Institute for
Plant Research at Cornell University, is working on perhaps the
most ambitious genetically engineered food of all: an edible
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Arntzen and his colleagues genetically modified potatoes so they
incorporate a protein from the hepatitis B virus. The protein is
harmless, but it trains the immune system to recognize the virus
and mount a preemptive defense.
</P>
<P>
   Arntzen is also working on engineered bananas and tomatoes and
targeting other diseases, such as cholera. Preliminary human trials
last year showed the concept works with raw potatoes. Follow-up
studies with processed potatoes and tomatoes are under way.
</P>
<P>
   Like iron-rich rice, disease-preventing foods are intended
primarily for poor countries where hundreds of millions of children
today do not have access to vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can make a tomato sauce whether they're in Colombia or
Cambodia,'' Arntzen says.
</P>
<P>
   But custom-designed functional foods are still a long way from
the dinner table. Some scientists and activists suspect tinkering
with DNA will cause long-term health and environmental problems.
Opposition to genetically modified food, which has sparked mass
demonstrations in Europe, is growing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean DellaPenna, a plant biologist at the University of
Nevada at Reno, is more concerned that the genetic-engineering
debate will slow efforts to improve nutrition worldwide. Many
people get enough to eat, he notes, but still suffer from
malnutrition because they do not have access to a well-rounded
diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bellies are full, so we can afford to argue, but some 3
billion people in the world don't have that luxury. Once we can
show the direct benefit of genetic modification, I hope consumers
will realize the possibilities of the technology,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   DellaPenna hopes to make his case by showing how to reconfigure
staple crops to increase their vitamin E content tenfold. Plenty of
other functional foods don't require cracking the genome. Additives
like Phytrol and soy protein are derived from perfectly ordinary
trees and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Pike used only conventional breeding for his BetaSweet carrot,
crossing seeds from Brazil to obtain a root with stellar taste and
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be as fast or exciting as genetic modification, but
we can do it without upsetting people,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Breeding alone could still fill stores with racks of
heart-friendly soybeans, cancer-fighting tomatoes and anticlotting
onions.
</P>
<P>
   Clare Hasler, director of the Functional Foods for Health
Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, predicts
tomorrow's grocery store will house a miniclinic that administers a
quick blood test and a genome printout, including a person's top
disease risks and a recommended shopping list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, that will lead people to diet patterns that defray
_ or even eliminate _ many of the chronic diseases we face,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   If privacy is an issue, people might run their genome tests at
home and then shop for appropriately tailored foods on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the focus on individualized nutrition will begin
before birth, Kroger says. Hospitals already test babies for the
enzyme phenylalanine hydrolase. Children who lack it must avoid any
food containing the amino acid phenylalanine _ including meat and
even mother's milk _ or risk mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already modifying diet based on a gene,'' Kroger says.
``Soon, we'll be able to go a step further _ to take an amniotic
fluid sample from an unborn baby and determine its genome.''
</P>
<P>
   Careful parents could then pick out optimal functional baby
foods. If the food companies have their way, that's one early trend
that will stick around for a lifetime.

   About a millennium ago, legends tell us, a Viking named Leif
Eriksson sailed to the shores of North America, arriving hundreds
of years ahead of Christopher Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though archaeologists have yet to uncover any physical
evidence of Eriksson's visit, the presumption that a Viking band
traveled that far has gained credibility in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations in Greenland indicate that Vikings flourished there
for hundreds of years, trading with the European continent and
probably Native-American tribes, before inexplicably disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   A central figure in this historical drama was Eriksson's father,
Erik the Red, who grew up in Iceland after his father, Thorvald
Asvaldsson, was exiled from Norway around 965 for ``some
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   When Erik was a child, Iceland already boasted a
well-established colony of Vikings who had fled a land squeeze in
Norway and the iron rule of King Harald Fairhair.
</P>
<P>
   In 980, Erik the Red headed even farther west when he was
banished from Iceland _ for murder. He set sail for land that was
visible west of Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he returned to Iceland and convinced hundreds
of others to join him in settling this new country. Some 25 boats
set out for what Erik the Red had dubbed Greenland. Only 14 ships
survived the seas, but about 450 new colonists set foot ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The land was bare, uninhabited and inhospitable, but Erik the
Red's advertisements were not entirely false. A thin green carpet
of arctic heath promised support for grazing farm animals.
</P>
<P>
   Farms sprang up quickly and, later, churches. One colony, simply
called the Eastern Settlement, sat in the toe of Greenland; the
Western Settlement lay close to what is now Nuuk, Greenland's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what would have been at best harsh living conditions,
the Greenland Vikings' outposts began to thrive. Archaeologists
estimate that at one point perhaps 3,000 Vikings lived on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Then all of them vanished. The mystery of their fate was
rekindled in 1721 when a Danish-Norwegian missionary who set out to
convert Eskimos decided to look for traces of the old Viking
settlers. His findings began an inquiry that has intensified over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite significant progress unearthing ancient settlements,
archaeologists still haven't found an answer. Was it plague, cold,
hunger, conflict with Eskimos or sheer hardship that finished off
these stalwart pioneers?
 &UR; LIFE IN GREENLAND &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Settling Greenland posed a formidable challenge. There are no
trees large enough to produce timber for shelter or fuel. The only
wood is small brush and driftwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings settled on fjords resembling those of their
homeland. There they built homes of driftwood, stone and sod. For
adequate insulation, the walls of some buildings were made six to
10 feet thick.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the most well-excavated Western Settlement sites,
called the ``farm beneath the sand,'' archaeologists have turned up
detailed evidence of the Viking way of life in Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Caribou hunters who noticed timbers poking out of sandy soil
discovered the site in 1990. They contacted the Greenland National
Museum and Archives, and archaeologists set to work meticulously
removing 1,000 tons of sand by hand to get a close look at the
site.
</P>
<P>
   One structure is the remains of a great hall once lined with
benches. Archaeologists estimate that to create a structure of that
size with walls of sod required stripping more than 1,000 square
meters of turf.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter, food and clothing were, of course, essential to
survival. The summer was too short to farm grain crops, so settlers
probably went without beer or bread. Although they farmed
domesticated animals imported from Europe _ goats, sheep, cattle _
the settlers ate them sparingly, relying instead on milk and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, the Greenlanders' lives differed little from
those of their compatriots in Scandinavia. They netted fish and
hunted seal and caribou. They wove clothing from wool and linen.
</P>
<P>
   For about two centuries, Greenland's Vikings had the country to
themselves. Yet they relied on a fragile trade with Scandinavia to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for iron, timber and grain from Europe, they traded
pelts of bear and arctic fox as well as narwhale tusks and rope
made of walrus hide. Whalebone, too, was traded to Europeans for
use in stiffening clothes.
</P>
<P>
   According to one account, the Greenlanders even traded live
polar bears. They may also have ventured to North America for
timber.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Viking structures at L'Anse aux Meadows in
Newfoundland testify to a short-lived presence there. Unlike
southern Greenland in the 10th century, North America was already
populated, and newcomers may not have been welcome.
 &UR; THE SETTLEMENTS GO EXTINCT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At some point during the 14th century, Greenland's climate grew
colder. With the climate change, glaciers began creeping over the
land, bringing with them a runoff of sand, silt and gravel. That
runoff slowly robbed the settlers of valuable pastureland.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, says Danish archaeologist Jette Arneborg,
the Black Death had decimated Norway, wiping out nearly two-thirds
of the population. The plague hit Iceland, too, killing some 30
percent. Although there is still no evidence the sickness reached
Greenland, archaeologists believe it left its mark by curtailing
the flourishing trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenlanders adapted. Recent evidence shows that their diet
shifted from land-based foods to marine products. Researchers
measured this shift by examining the ratio of two forms of carbon _
a common form with 12 neutrons and a rare form with 13 _ in the
bones of 27 settlers from different time periods. The count reveals
variations in the way forms of carbon are deposited and metabolized
in food chains in the ocean and on land.
</P>
<P>
   Like their kin in Norway, the Vikings in Greenland had always
exploited marine life but, by the close of the 14th century, the
proportion of their food taken from the sea had risen to 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1100 and 1200 A.D., as the colder weather arrived, so
did the Thules. These Native-Americans, migrants from the area
surrounding the Bering Strait, began trickling eastward from
Ellesmere Island, just northwest of Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have speculated that Greenland Vikings may have
met and intermingled with them, but researchers examining skulls
found at Viking sites have found no traces of Native-American
morphology. Others theorize that the Vikings clashed with the
Thules, as recounted in Native-American legends. It's more likely
that an uneasy trade between the two groups sprang up and, as
living conditions grew harsher for the Vikings, the better-adapted
Thules thrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Settlement was abandoned by 1350 and the Eastern
Settlement by 1500. Among the last written records of the Vikings
in Greenland is a record of a Christian wedding ceremony at Hvalsey
Church in the Eastern Settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating youth, optimism and prosperity, it is wistful proof
of the dreams Vikings had in settling this barren and young new
world.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what became of them, Arneborg says she thinks they
struggled mightily to adapt to the increasingly difficult
conditions. But as the weather worsened and life became even
harsher, some may have returned to Iceland. And it's easy to
imagine that, as trade dwindled, the settlements may have become so
depopulated the colonists simply were unable to replace themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The southern part of Greenland can be terrible,'' Arneborg
says. ``Storms show up in a minute. I would never be able to do
it.'' &QL;

<P>
   About a millennium ago, legends tell us, a Viking named Leif
Eriksson sailed to the shores of North America, arriving hundreds
of years ahead of Christopher Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Even though archaeologists have yet to uncover any physical
evidence of Eriksson's visit, the presumption that a Viking band
traveled that far has gained credibility in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations in Greenland indicate that Vikings flourished there
for hundreds of years, trading with the European continent and
probably Native-American tribes, before inexplicably disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   A central figure in this historical drama was Eriksson's father,
Erik the Red, who grew up in Iceland after his father, Thorvald
Asvaldsson, was exiled from Norway around 965 for ``some
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   When Erik was a child, Iceland already boasted a
well-established colony of Vikings who had fled a land squeeze in
Norway and the iron rule of King Harald Fairhair.
</P>
<P>
   In 980, Erik the Red headed even farther west when he was
banished from Iceland _ for murder. He set sail for land that was
visible west of Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he returned to Iceland and convinced hundreds
of others to join him in settling this new country. Some 25 boats
set out for what Erik the Red had dubbed Greenland. Only 14 ships
survived the seas, but about 450 new colonists set foot ashore.

   On a recent morning, Jennifer Connelly stood before the mirror
in the bathroom of her West Village apartment and found her first
gray hair. This may come as a shock to anyone who remembers
Connelly's stint as an '80s teen queen _ or, further back, as the
12-year-old who melted boys' hearts from behind a chink in the wall
in Sergio Leone's 1984 epic, ``Once Upon a Time in America.''
</P>
<P>
   If you did grow up in the '80s, then chances are you saw
Connelly play the pubescent baby sitter in Jim Henson's
``Labyrinth'' and then the rebellious rich girl _ with blown-out
hair, Brooke Shields eyebrows and a ``Dynasty''-sized coat over
leggings _ in John Hughes' ``Career Opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a cameo in a Duran Duran video and the release of
a pop song _ in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly laughs looking back on the fleeting moment when she was
a male teen-ager's ultimate fantasy object _ the face that launched
a thousand dirt bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking about the old stuff is like having a conversation
with someone you were once in a relationship with,'' she says later
that day, sitting down to a pot of tea at a neighborhood
restaurant. ``You remember how there was once this incredible
intimacy between you, but now you feel like strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   With three high-profile films scheduled for release this year,
Connelly is about to show that she's come a long way since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   First up is Keith Gordon's ``Waking the Dead,'' in which she
stars as a bright-eyed '70s activist whose mysterious death starts
to haunt her lover (Billy Crudup) 10 years later _ so much so that
he begins to suspect she may still be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Next come Darren Aronofsky's ``Requiem for a Dream,''
co-starring Jared Leto, and Ed Harris' ``Pollock,'' about the life
of the Abstract Expressionist.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has said, with just a touch of Hollywood overstatement,
that casting Connelly's part in ``Waking the Dead'' was akin to the
search for a Scarlett O'Hara for ``Gone with the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Jennifer just had this tremendous intelligence,'' he
explains.
</P>
<P>
   And while most of the actresses who read for the part struck
Gordon as clueless, Connelly engaged him on subjects ranging from
Isabel Allende and magical realism to quantum physics and
Schrodinger's cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't hurt that I knew Billy thought highly of her,'' he
adds. ``I had called him and he said, `I don't think people even
realize how good she is yet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the obvious chemistry between Connelly and Crudup,
already recorded in 1996's ``Inventing the Abbotts.'' Shooting the
love scenes in ``Waking the Dead,'' Connelly had to take frequent
timeouts to unpeel Crudup's hippie-style muttonchops every time
they ended up stuck to her forehead. But there's nothing goofy
about the final cut, which is fraught with a kind of ominous
passion.
</P>
<P>
   As for Connelly's offscreen romantic life, she spent five years
with Bill Campbell, her co-star in 1991's ``The Rocketeer,'' and
recently ended a relationship with Dave Dougan, a photographer and
the father of her 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something so new I'm not sure I should even talk about
it,'' she says. ``But it's hot. My God, I have such a one-track
mind these days! I run around making lists of all the things I need
to do in our next sexual encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   All this bedroom talk comes as a surprise, since Connelly
insists that it's the nerd, not the nymph, with whom she
identifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so strange to start working as a child,'' says the
actress, who began modeling at 10 and had appeared in nine films by
the time she was 20. ``I was being so much watched from the outside
that I became very careful _ which is sort of crippling. In certain
ways you grow up fast, but I think in other ways you arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   After the string of teen flicks, Connelly decided to take a
break and enrolled at Yale. But when her ``lack of socialization
skills'' got the best of her, Connelly left _ first for Stanford,
then to work on another string of films she'd rather not think
about (``Far Harbor,'' ``Mulholland Falls,'' etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Now 29, Connelly picks her roles carefully, but she's just as
happy thinking about the outer-space mural she's planning for her
son Kai's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 20 years on the outer rim of the limelight,
Connelly is far too familiar with the fallibility of the acting
life to submit to the fantasies Hollywood spins for its leading
ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just avoid the word `celebrity,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her insistence that acting is a job like any other,
you can sense her enchantment when she talks about how her dream
role relates to her dream man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about the guy I'm looking for these days, it's
somebody who's completely uninhibited, who defies all
conventions,'' she says. ``The guy who's just so real, so amazingly
clear. You know that guy? I want to play that girl.'' &QL;

timeouts to unpeel Crudup's hippie-style muttonchops every time
they ended up stuck to her forehead. But there's nothing goofy
about the final cut, which is fraught with a kind of ominous
passion.
</P>
<P>
   As for Connelly's offscreen romantic life, she spent five years
with Bill Campbell, her co-star in 1991's ``The Rocketeer,'' and
recently ended a relationship with Dave Dougan, a photographer and
the father of her 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have something so new I'm not sure I should even talk about
it,'' she says. ``But it's hot. My God, I have such a one-track
mind these days! I run around making lists of all the things I need
to do in our next sexual encounter.''
</P>
<P>
   All this bedroom talk comes as a surprise, since Connelly
insists that it's the nerd, not the nymph, with whom she
identifies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so strange to start working as a child,'' says the
actress, who began modeling at 10 and had appeared in nine films by
the time she was 20. ``I was being so much watched from the outside
that I became very careful _ which is sort of crippling. In certain
ways you grow up fast, but I think in other ways you arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   After the string of teen flicks, Connelly decided to take a
break and enrolled at Yale. But when her ``lack of socialization
skills'' got the best of her, Connelly left _ first for Stanford,
then to work on another string of films she'd rather not think
about (``Far Harbor,'' ``Mulholland Falls,'' etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Now 29, Connelly picks her roles carefully, but she's just as
happy thinking about the outer-space mural she's planning for her
son Kai's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 20 years on the outer rim of the limelight,
Connelly is far too familiar with the fallibility of the acting
life to submit to the fantasies Hollywood spins for its leading
ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just avoid the word `celebrity,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite her insistence that acting is a job like any other,
you can sense her enchantment when she talks about how her dream
role relates to her dream man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think about the guy I'm looking for these days, it's
somebody who's completely uninhibited, who defies all
conventions,'' she says. ``The guy who's just so real, so amazingly
clear. You know that guy? I want to play that girl.'' &QL;

BOOM ECONOMY MAKES HOUSING FOR AMERICA'S WORKING POOR HARDER TO
FIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the United States is enjoying continuing
prosperity, many of the working poor have become worse off because
affordable housing is harder for them to find, a federal report
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of
housing and urban development, said that 5.4 million low-income
families pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in
dilapidated units, an increase of 12 percent since the economic
expansion began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the highest need for affordable housing since we have
been taking numbers,'' Cuomo said at a news conference at his
department's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that low-income housing was becoming less available
because ``it is getting old, it is coming out of service, it is
being knocked down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor
were caused by several factors, including the rising economy
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, building owners accepted low-income tenants whose
rent was paid from their own earnings and from a government voucher
program known as Section 8. But because of the nation's rising
prosperity, Cuomo said, many property owners have found that
higher-income tenants have bid up the prices of the apartments
beyond the poorer tenants' abilities to pay, even with the
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, Cuomo said, was that Congress refused to approve
additional Section 8 housing from 1995 through 1998, ``when we went
out of the housing business.'' He blamed the Republicans in
Congress for the lack of new Section 8 units, saying, ``We had
proposals in the tens of thousands for every year, and Congress
said zero.''
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton asked for an additional 120,000 housing
vouchers in his State of the Union message in January, Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., acknowledged that no new vouchers had been approved
by Congress in a four-year period, but he said that there were good
reasons for that .
</P>
<P>
   A cause of Republican objections, he said, was a ``take one,
take all'' provision that required landlords who accepted any
families with housing vouchers to accept all families with them.

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, March 28:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HEISENBERG-BOMB (New York) _ Physicists and historians
gathered in Manhattan today to discuss the issues raised by Michael
Frayn's play, Copenhagen, which deals with the relationship between
quantum theorists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg and the German
atomic bomb project. By James Glanz. (800 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AURORA (Undated) _ Shimmering waves of color and brilliance
may soon be visible around the globe as the Sun approaches the peak
of its 11-year cycle of storms, sunspots and flares. The resulting
heavy rain of particles, interacting with Earth's magnetic field,
will light up the skies with heavenly fire known in the Northern
Hemisphere as the aurora borealis. The solar disturbances produce
auroras in places where most people never expect to see them. By
William J. Broad. (1650 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphics.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HOPKINS-GENES (Undated) _ Dr. Nancy Hopkins, the MIT
professor who convinced her bosses that sex discrimination was
rampant on campus, now is making her mark in genetics. In her lab
she has developed a technique that uses retroviruses to induce
mutations of single genes in zebra fish. The technique allows for
quick isolation and cloning of the mutated genes and could
ultimately help define a kind of ``construction kit'' of the genes
necessary to make, say, a heart, or a brain, or a whole baby fish.
By Carey Goldberg. (1995 words)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CORAL-REEFS (Undated) _ The federal government has issued a
long-term plan to save coral reefs along the coast of the United
States and its territories, setting aside many sites as ecological
preserves over the next 10 years. The plan calls for 20 percent of
all coral reefs in American-controlled waters to be designated
ecological preserves by 2010, protecting them from pollution,
fishing and other activity that could harm the reefs. By John
Files. (750 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GAMMA-RAYS (Undated) _ Even as NASA bureaucrats were
ordering up its demise, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory
discovered a new class of mysterious sources of celestial gamma
rays scattered along the Milky Way. Bu John Noble Wilford. (960
words).
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BLACK-HOLES (Undated) _ Astronomers at Ohio State University
have photographed feeding frenzies at the hearts of a score of
galaxies, images of gas and dust draining into what may be black
holes like water spiraling down a bathtub drain.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NANOTUBES (Undated) _ A research team at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute has created tiny ``trees'' using flashes of
extreme heat to deposit carbon atoms in piles on a graphite
surface. The structures average about one one-hundredth of an inch
in height and can be as narrow as five- millionths of an inch in
diameter. By Henry Fountain. (415 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT6.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MOAS-EXTINCTION (Undated) _ An entire class of large
flightless birds called moas, 11 species and an estimated 160,000
individuals in all, lived in New Zealand until the 13th or 14th
century when Polynesians colonized the island and began what
biologists call a blitzkrieg. New evidence now suggests that it may
have been the most rapid extinction ever brought about by primitive
people. The bird probably was so naive that that is just allowed
hunters to walk up and kill it. By William K. Stevens. (1325 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT2,3.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on the
vibrations of earth, toxins in puffer fish and Lake Vostok's water
movements. By Henry Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CHILDREN-GRIEVE (Undated) _ A new book based on findings of
a large-scale study by researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center of families coping with the illness and death of a
parent, offers new understanding of children's ability to come to
terms with loss. In ``Healing Children's Grief: Surviving a
Parent's Death From Cancer'' (Oxford; 2000), Dr. Grace Hyslop
Christ makes it clear that children, even very young children, do
grieve, though their grieving differs at different ages, and often
bears little resemblance to the mourning reactions of adults. By
Erica Goode. (1850 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT4.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DIABETES-DRUG (Undated) _ Patients react to FDA's pulling of
rezulin off market. For some, the drug has helped tremendously, and
the news took them by surprise. But others died from it, their
families said. By Holcomb B. Noble. (1250 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Personal Health: An important
documentary ``Cancer: Evolution to Revolution'' to be shown
Thursday offers extraordinary segments of people living and dying
with the disease, and they share hopes, goals and expectations. By
Jane E. Brody. (1275 words)

Captain: The new Wuksachi Lodge complex in Sequoia National Park is
constructed of cedar and blends well with its surroundings.
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK _ When the rustic cabins at Sequoia's
Giant Forest Village were removed over the last few years, the park
service heard a few scattered expressions of nostalgic regret. But
the overriding purpose of the project _ protecting the groves of
ancient sequoias _ was widely embraced, according to national park
spokeswoman Kris Fister.
</P>
<P>
   And when longtime visitors find their way to the new Wuksachi
Lodge, located a respectful distance from the sequoia zone, they
probably won't be surprised to learn that the accommodations
benefit from the sins of the fathers. Constructed by the park
concessionaire, Delaware North Parks Services, the lodge design
reflects obvious respect for its setting.
</P>
<P>
   The Wuksachi is set well back from the Generals Highway as the
road winds west toward Cedar Grove and adjoining Kings Canyon
National Park. If you don't want to see the buildings, you don't
have to.
</P>
<P>
   The lodging units are divided among three structures that are a
good distance from the main building. The complex is connected by
forest pathways that are unobtrusively lighted. (Important tip:
Pack a flashlight. On a January visit, I didn't, and regretted it
on a cloudy night while walking to dinner through a light dusting
of snow.)
</P>
<P>
   Even the parking lots are segregated from the rooms, hidden down
the slope of a slight hill. It means lugging bags over considerable
distances, but it was done so that guests could look out a window
and see trees, not a Wagoneer with an aluminum row boat tied to the
top.
</P>
<P>
   The buildings are constructed of cedar, with river-stone skirts,
and thus blend in well with their surroundings. The rooms are spare
and dimly lit rather than luxurious, but somehow that feels
appropriate here. Be prepared to make special requests, though: My
room had a writing table, but it lacked a lamp ... and a chair.
(Rooms are priced at $75-$105 in winter, Sequoia's slack season.
Once June arrives, that range climbs to $110-$155.)
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are not equipped with TVs. The proprietors want people
to be able to open their windows in summer without being assaulted
by the disembodied voice of Regis Philbin. Unfortunately, on my
visit, the people in the next room had obviously gotten advance
word of this unthinkable deprivation. They packed a TV and VCR to
administer a nightly fix, the sound of which was thoughtfully
shared with me through the thin walls.
</P>
<P>
   More gentle forms of diversion can be found in the main lodge.
Board games and books are stocked just inside the front door, and
on chilly nights, a wood-burning stove throws off comforting
warmth. Unfortunately, there is adequate reading light at only a
few of the lounging chairs. One evening, a 50ish couple had jumped
two of them. He read a paperback, she worked at a laptop computer,
they took turns rocking their sleeping baby in the stroller at
their feet _ the 21st-century family.
</P>
<P>
   The Wuksachi dining room, meanwhile, will be embraced warmly by
everyone who choked down the slop that used to be served at the
Giant Forest Village cafeteria _ the only dining option in the area
in winter.
</P>
<P>
   The offerings here, reasonably priced from $10 to $20 (including
soup or salad), are hearty _ appropriate after a day of tramping
through the mountains _ while still reflecting some imagination:
chicken Pompeii ($14.50), prepared with provolone, mozzarella and
gorgonzola cheeses and a heavy marinara sauce; medallions of pork
tenderloin marsala ($15).
</P>
<P>
   In winter, you're forced to set your body clock on mountain time
_ they stop serving dinner at 8:30 p.m.! And in the morning,
patience will serve you well; service at breakfast was numbingly
slow during my visit.
</P>
<P>
   But the setting mitigates any annoyances. The vaulted ceiling
rises to perhaps 25 feet, held up by massive, rough-hewn timbers.
Picture windows overlook a forested slope in the foreground, the
snow-tipped peaks of the Great Western Divide in the distance. At
night, a continuous blaze is maintained in the tall, stone
fireplace. This is the poor man's Ahwahnee _ but with a much better
view.
</P>
<P>
   Winter came late to Sequoia this year, and came with a
vengeance. Snow is 70 inches deep in some tourist areas. This does
not mean guests have to stay huddled inside, though. The park
service conducts snowshoe tours of an area of the Giant Forest on
weekends. Snowshoes are provided to those who don't own them for a
nominal charge of $1.
</P>
<P>
   The walk is less than a mile, on relatively flat ground, and
takes about two hours, said Fister. ``It's more stopping and
talking than walking,'' she added. It's not recommended for kids
under age 10, and reservations are recommended: (559) 565-3782.
</P>
<P>
   Given the heavy snow layer, the snowshoe treks will probably be
offered through April, but with the thaw they'll be replaced by
ranger-led walks.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Polish conductor serves his passengers coffee a half-hour
before the night train from Berlin pulls into Krakow's main
station.
</P>
<P>
   After expertly stirring in her nondairy creamer, the Krakow-born
economics professor who occupies the lower berth considers the
question: What are her townsfolk like? With a resounding zip of her
knee-high boots, she announces, with a hint of swagger, that they
are proud.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder. The people of Krakow are citizens of one of nine
cities chosen as European cultural capitals for the year 2000, with
a recorded history dating back to 965; a city selected by Unesco in
1978 as one of the most remarkable architectural complexes in the
world; home to one of Europe's largest medieval marketplaces;
central Europe's second oldest university (after Prague); royal
seat for six centuries of Polish kings with the kinds of names that
make learning history fun: Boleslaus the Bold, Boleslaus the
Chaste, Boleslaus the Squintmouth, Ladislaus the Elbow-High.
</P>
<P>
   During the golden renaissance of Polish culture in the 16th
century, Krakow was the capital of Europe's most populous kingdom,
stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea, harboring a medley of
cultures including Poles, Germans, Lithuanians, Jews, Italians and
Hungarians _ a veritable Euro-boomtown.
</P>
<P>
   There remains, of course, the unhappy flip side of Krakow's
history: the city's gradual decline after the transfer of the royal
seat of power to Warsaw in the early 17th century, the subsequent
partitioning of Poland and accompanying loss of independence, the
years of Nazi occupation, wrenching postwar relocation, Soviet
control, martial law.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s Krakow's dark side became physically manifest in
historic monuments blackened by tons of ash that fell on the city
weekly, courtesy of an indifferent industrial machine.
</P>
<P>
   But to stand in the middle of the restored Rynek Glowny, the
city's marketplace, is to sense the unique quality of Krakow's
pride; a pride both because and in spite of the city's perceptible
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of two medieval trade routes, from Prague to
the Crimea, and the Amber Road from the Baltic to southern Europe,
the 13th-century square marks the open center of a geometric
checkerboard of streets that describes the old city. (These streets
are, for the most part, wonderfully off limits to motorized
traffic.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vastness of the space, humanity clearly dominates
the scene: South American street musicians gather before the
Sukiennice (Cloth Halls) that cut the square in half. The
part-Renaissance, part-Gothic arcades now house cafes, rows of
wooden stands selling souvenirs and crafts, and upstairs, the
National Museum's picture gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Beside an outdoor display of watercolor cityscapes, older men in
peaked caps stop to chat, while mothers chase after toddlers who
chase after pigeons. Tourist-bearing horse-drawn buggies clip-clop
the perimeter, circling couples buying flowers from kerchiefed
saleswomen who purposefully ignore the white-faced mime perched on
a nearby soapbox.
</P>
<P>
   Other couples rest on benches watching other couples stroll, as
clusters of laughing students, laden with shopping bags, cram
themselves into phone booths. The young women wear short skirts and
dark nylons and high black boots, their wide faces turned up.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is appealingly slack. The feel, surrounded by
pastel-colored Renaissance and Baroque town houses, amid ambling,
stylish locals speaking their blurry, shushing tongue, is decidedly
Southern European. Except for one thing: It is freezing. It is
February. And this is Middle Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A penetrating icy rain slices down, blowing into the young
women's upturned faces as a piercing wind rips across the open
square, causing the old men to reach for their caps. All those
short skirts! Such cold knees. And those frozen fingers,
nonchalantly holding cigarettes (no gloves) while friends pause to
exchange intimacies, exposed to the elements. It is an entirely
imaginary spring that is in the air. The real thing must be
breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   As the full hour approaches, some heads lift to the taller
octagonal spire of the Church of the Virgin Mary, a red brick
Gothic affair that historically served the city's German patrician
class and now dominates the eastern corner of the square.
</P>
<P>
   On the hour (give or take a few minutes) one of the church's
remote arched windows opens and a faint flash of brass indicates a
lone trumpeter. The melody he plays is ancient and stirring, the
Hejnal, a medieval reveille that unexpectedly ends mid-bar.
</P>
<P>
   The practice memorializes a brave sentry who in the 13th century
raised the alarm from the same tower to warn his townspeople of
imminent Tartar invasion. Pierced in the throat by an enemy arrow,
the guard was unable to finish his song.
</P>
<P>
   Every hour, every day and night these interrupted tones are
repeated four times for the four points of the compass; the tribute
dates back 700 years. Thus punctuating the day, the ghostly melody
evokes a continuing memory of proud sacrifice, when spirited by the
wind to the farthest reaches of the old city.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Church of the Virgin Mary, shortly before noon every
day, the doors open to one of the largest Gothic altars in Europe.
This most famous work of the Nuremberg artist Wit Stwosz (Veit
Stoss in German), what he called his ``Bible made of linden,'' was
completed over a 12-year period, from 1477 to 1489.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 other churches and houses of prayer adorn the streets,
covering every architectural period in the art history books and
often combining several styles under one roof. There is the Church
of St. Andrew, one of the few buildings in Krakow to survive the
Tartar invasion of 1241, that conceals within its austere white
limestone facade a later, richly ornate Baroque interior.
</P>
<P>
   The Gothic Church of St. Francis sports vibrantly colorful,
sinuously formed Art Nouveau stained-glass windows by Stanislaw
Wyspianski, as well as his decorative frescoes on the walls of the
transept and presbytery; surprisingly temporal roses and lilies,
seashells and peacock feathers.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that is over 90 percent Catholic, all these
churches are very much in use. On a given Sunday you can even find
small crowds outside the houses of worship listening to Mass on a
loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the spirit of Krakow would appear to be dominated by its
most populous secular group of citizens _ the students. For this,
if there ever was one, is a university town. There are no less than
100,000 students attending 15 institutions of higher learning.
That's one-eighth of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
   Step into the courtyards of the 16th- and 17th-century houses
along Florianska Street or Grodzka Street, the main pedestrian
arteries pumping a steady current of life into the market square,
and you will find happily ensconced behind Baroque porticos,
beneath vaulted passageways, up exterior courtyard staircases, all
the commercial byproducts of a vibrant student body: music shops,
clothing boutiques, art galleries, bookstores and enough cafes and
restaurants to rival the city's roster of churches _ with equally
packed houses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Krakow's restaurants differ from their Middle European
neighbors. While Berliners and Viennese enjoy their kaffee and
kuchen behind large windows, to maximize their climate's limited
light, Krakow stashes its eateries in the cellars below the old
city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, it would seem, the southern European illusion is in
effect: As if in need of escape from an invisibly glaring sun,
throngs of Krakow's young people retreat into windowless,
candlelighted caverns for cappuccino and cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly one-quarter of Krakow's students attend the Jagiellonen
University, founded in 1364 by Casimir the Great. The 1492
Collegium Maius on Jagiellonska Street, with four red-brick Gothic
wings enclosing an arcaded courtyard, is the university's oldest
building. It houses a museum that includes displays of the medieval
ceremonial garb still used today during graduation ceremonies, as
well as precious works of art and instruments of science.
</P>
<P>
   The library, communal dining hall, treasury and auditorium tell
the tale of the university's rich history. Copernicus studied here
from 1491 to 1495 and his astronomical instruments are displayed in
a room bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval astrolabes, torquetum and globe of the skies
appear, to the uninitiated, as gleaming brass disks and spheres,
dangling from chains, mounted on clawed feet, meticulously
inscribed with a secret systematic beauty. A mappamundi from 1510
is the first globe to indicate the then-newly discovered American
continent: America terra noviter reperta.
</P>
<P>
   The relics are not all ancient. Neil Armstrong left an
autographed picture of the Moon with special thanks to Copernicus.
A pen on display was used by the university's most prominent recent
alumnus, the theologian Karol Wojtylas, later Archbishop of Krakow,
now Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to the hustle of the market, a distinct and
directed undercurrent can be detected in the general comings and
goings. This popular stream follows the historic royal processional
route south on Grodzka Street, ending at the foot of the Wawel
Hill, or ``Polish Acropolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian traffic jams the 82-foot climb to the renaissance
Wawel Castle where Polish kings reigned for over 500 years, and its
adjoining Gothic Cathedral, the site of coronations and royal
funerals until 1734.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the hilltop, an imposing and messy complex of towers,
cupolas, bastions and battlements commands a magnificent view of
the Vistula River and the surrounding city.
</P>
<P>
   Within the medieval fortifications _ near the tapestried royal
chambers and carved marble tombs of Poland's royalty _ school
classes, families, the Polish equivalent of Boy Scouts in uniform,
elderly couples puffing from the exertion, babies in carriages, all
bask in the warmth of grandeur on a bitter cold day. The crowd
contains almost no foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Here, one senses, Poland was never partitioned, reduced or
dominated. Here Poland is big. As big as the view. And Krakow
remains its capital.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, ironically, the view from Wawel Hill features the
single portion of Krakow and Krakow's history that could throw the
proud citizenry off stride.
</P>
<P>
   A mile southeast of the castle, Kazimierz became the home to
Krakow's Jewish population after pogroms drove them out of the Old
City at the end of the 15th century. During the golden Polish
renaissance, Kazimierz represented the undisputed capital of the
Diaspora, a lively cultural and intellectual center that attracted
the largest Jewish community in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of World War II, one quarter of Krakow's residents
were Jews. The Jewish quarter itself boasted eight synagogues and
numerous other places for religious studies and prayer. Then the
Nazis established the Krakow ghetto in Podgorze on the other side
of the Vistula.
</P>
<P>
   By 1943 Kazimierz was completely emptied of its inhabitants.
Many of the Jews of Krakow were transferred to the Warsaw ghetto.
Others perished in the Nazi death camps _ Plaszow. Belzec.
Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the 69,000 Jews living in Krakow in 1939,
roughly 150 returned after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual revival of so-called ``Post-Jewish'' Kazimierz
coincided with Polish political unrest in the mid-1980s. Some
people in Krakow sensed that resurrecting the city's Jewish history
was one of the keys to saving their own.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, today's non-Jewish Krakowers dedicated to the
ethnic revitalization of Kazimierz are walking a fine moral line,
and they well know it.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, ever since Steven Spielberg shot ``Schindler's
List'' on Szeroka Street in 1993, there has developed an
undiscriminating and in some ways unhealthy interest in all things
Jewish. Some fear the neighborhood would turn into an Old World
Disneyland, featuring kosher vodka, klezmer music and gefilte fish.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, since ``Schindler's List,'' there has
developed a very real and sincere dedication to restoring the
quarter's Jewish heritage, featuring historical exhibits in the
former synagogues, a modern Jewish Cultural Center committed to
international discourse, a charming hotel and cafe in the former
mikvah, or ritual bath, and, well, kosher food and klezmer music.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is not entirely abstract, for of course there is
gefilte fish, and there is gefilte fish. Such subtle variances in
flavor are also a Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact remains that early on a Saturday morning, before
the 16th-century Remu'h Synagogue, the ancient melodies of the
Shabbat service still drift from the intimate sanctuary where
Krakow's Jews come to pray.
</P>
<P>
   A peek inside the entrance reveals a bare wooden table set for
kiddush: 12 plates of checkerboard poundcake and 12 cups for the
fruit of the vine. Two more than needed for a minyan. In light of
the history that these streets have witnessed, this humble scene
would appear to be a final heartbreaking wonder in this wondrous
city.

<P>
   The owners of the newly opened Hotel Klezmer-Hois, Szeroka
Street 6, telephone and fax (48-12) 411 1245, were among the
pioneers in revitalizing the Jewish quarter. The antique-furnished
hotel, in a former mikvah directly across the square from the
Remu'h Synagogue, has 11 rooms, a restaurant featuring Middle
European Jewish cuisine and nightly klezmer concerts. Doubles: $58
to $67, with breakfast, at 4.17 zlotys to $1.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-room Pod Roza, Florianska Street 14, (48-12) 422 9399,
fax (48-12) 421 7513, is one of the oldest hotels near the market
square. The renaissance portal has welcomed such guests as Franz
Liszt and Czar Alexander I. Doubles with breakfast: $100; after
April 1, $118.

   By the 1980s Krakow's dark side became physically manifest in
historic monuments blackened by tons of ash that fell on the city
weekly, courtesy of an indifferent industrial machine.
</P>
<P>
   But to stand in the middle of the restored Rynek Glowny, the
city's marketplace, is to sense the unique quality of Krakow's
pride; a pride both because and in spite of the city's perceptible
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of two medieval trade routes, from Prague to
the Crimea, and the Amber Road from the Baltic to southern Europe,
the 13th-century square marks the open center of a geometric
checkerboard of streets that describes the old city. (These streets
are, for the most part, wonderfully off limits to motorized
traffic.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vastness of the space, humanity clearly dominates
the scene: South American street musicians gather before the
Sukiennice (Cloth Halls) that cut the square in half. The
part-Renaissance, part-Gothic arcades now house cafes, rows of
wooden stands selling souvenirs and crafts, and upstairs, the
National Museum's picture gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Beside an outdoor display of watercolor cityscapes, older men in
peaked caps stop to chat, while mothers chase after toddlers who
chase after pigeons. Tourist-bearing horse-drawn buggies clip-clop
the perimeter, circling couples buying flowers from kerchiefed
saleswomen who purposefully ignore the white-faced mime perched on
a nearby soapbox.
</P>
<P>
   Other couples rest on benches watching other couples stroll, as
clusters of laughing students, laden with shopping bags, cram
themselves into phone booths. The young women wear short skirts and
dark nylons and high black boots, their wide faces turned up.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is appealingly slack. The feel, surrounded by
pastel-colored Renaissance and Baroque town houses, amid ambling,
stylish locals speaking their blurry, shushing tongue, is decidedly
Southern European. Except for one thing: It is freezing. It is
February. And this is Middle Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A penetrating icy rain slices down, blowing into the young
women's upturned faces as a piercing wind rips across the open
square, causing the old men to reach for their caps. All those
short skirts! Such cold knees. And those frozen fingers,
nonchalantly holding cigarettes (no gloves) while friends pause to
exchange intimacies, exposed to the elements. It is an entirely
imaginary spring that is in the air. The real thing must be
breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   As the full hour approaches, some heads lift to the taller
octagonal spire of the Church of the Virgin Mary, a red brick
Gothic affair that historically served the city's German patrician
class and now dominates the eastern corner of the square.
</P>
<P>
   On the hour (give or take a few minutes) one of the church's
remote arched windows opens and a faint flash of brass indicates a
lone trumpeter. The melody he plays is ancient and stirring, the
Hejnal, a medieval reveille that unexpectedly ends mid-bar.
</P>
<P>
   The practice memorializes a brave sentry who in the 13th century
raised the alarm from the same tower to warn his townspeople of
imminent Tartar invasion. Pierced in the throat by an enemy arrow,
the guard was unable to finish his song.
</P>
<P>
   Every hour, every day and night these interrupted tones are
repeated four times for the four points of the compass; the tribute
dates back 700 years. Thus punctuating the day, the ghostly melody
evokes a continuing memory of proud sacrifice, when spirited by the
wind to the farthest reaches of the old city.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Church of the Virgin Mary, shortly before noon every
day, the doors open to one of the largest Gothic altars in Europe.
This most famous work of the Nuremberg artist Wit Stwosz (Veit
Stoss in German), what he called his ``Bible made of linden,'' was
completed over a 12-year period, from 1477 to 1489.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 other churches and houses of prayer adorn the streets,
covering every architectural period in the art history books and
often combining several styles under one roof. There is the Church
of St. Andrew, one of the few buildings in Krakow to survive the
Tartar invasion of 1241, that conceals within its austere white
limestone facade a later, richly ornate Baroque interior.
</P>
<P>
   The Gothic Church of St. Francis sports vibrantly colorful,
sinuously formed Art Nouveau stained-glass windows by Stanislaw
Wyspianski, as well as his decorative frescoes on the walls of the
transept and presbytery; surprisingly temporal roses and lilies,
seashells and peacock feathers.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that is over 90 percent Catholic, all these
churches are very much in use. On a given Sunday you can even find
small crowds outside the houses of worship listening to Mass on a
loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the spirit of Krakow would appear to be dominated by its
most populous secular group of citizens _ the students. For this,
if there ever was one, is a university town. There are no less than
100,000 students attending 15 institutions of higher learning.
That's one-eighth of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
   Step into the courtyards of the 16th- and 17th-century houses
along Florianska Street or Grodzka Street, the main pedestrian
arteries pumping a steady current of life into the market square,
and you will find happily ensconced behind Baroque porticos,
beneath vaulted passageways, up exterior courtyard staircases, all
the commercial byproducts of a vibrant student body: music shops,
clothing boutiques, art galleries, bookstores and enough cafes and
restaurants to rival the city's roster of churches _ with equally
packed houses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Krakow's restaurants differ from their Middle European
neighbors. While Berliners and Viennese enjoy their kaffee and
kuchen behind large windows, to maximize their climate's limited
light, Krakow stashes its eateries in the cellars below the old
city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, it would seem, the southern European illusion is in
effect: As if in need of escape from an invisibly glaring sun,
throngs of Krakow's young people retreat into windowless,
candlelighted caverns for cappuccino and cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly one-quarter of Krakow's students attend the Jagiellonen
University, founded in 1364 by Casimir the Great. The 1492
Collegium Maius on Jagiellonska Street, with four red-brick Gothic
wings enclosing an arcaded courtyard, is the university's oldest
building. It houses a museum that includes displays of the medieval
ceremonial garb still used today during graduation ceremonies, as
well as precious works of art and instruments of science.
</P>
<P>
   The library, communal dining hall, treasury and auditorium tell
the tale of the university's rich history. Copernicus studied here
from 1491 to 1495 and his astronomical instruments are displayed in
a room bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval astrolabes, torquetum and globe of the skies
appear, to the uninitiated, as gleaming brass disks and spheres,
dangling from chains, mounted on clawed feet, meticulously
inscribed with a secret systematic beauty. A mappamundi from 1510
is the first globe to indicate the then-newly discovered American
continent: America terra noviter reperta.
</P>
<P>
   The relics are not all ancient. Neil Armstrong left an
autographed picture of the Moon with special thanks to Copernicus.
A pen on display was used by the university's most prominent recent
alumnus, the theologian Karol Wojtylas, later Archbishop of Krakow,
now Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to the hustle of the market, a distinct and
directed undercurrent can be detected in the general comings and
goings. This popular stream follows the historic royal processional
route south on Grodzka Street, ending at the foot of the Wawel
Hill, or ``Polish Acropolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian traffic jams the 82-foot climb to the renaissance
Wawel Castle where Polish kings reigned for over 500 years, and its
adjoining Gothic Cathedral, the site of coronations and royal
funerals until 1734.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the hilltop, an imposing and messy complex of towers,
cupolas, bastions and battlements commands a magnificent view of
the Vistula River and the surrounding city.
</P>
<P>
   Within the medieval fortifications _ near the tapestried royal
chambers and carved marble tombs of Poland's royalty _ school
classes, families, the Polish equivalent of Boy Scouts in uniform,
elderly couples puffing from the exertion, babies in carriages, all
bask in the warmth of grandeur on a bitter cold day. The crowd
contains almost no foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Here, one senses, Poland was never partitioned, reduced or
dominated. Here Poland is big. As big as the view. And Krakow
remains its capital.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, ironically, the view from Wawel Hill features the
single portion of Krakow and Krakow's history that could throw the
proud citizenry off stride.
</P>
<P>
   A mile southeast of the castle, Kazimierz became the home to
Krakow's Jewish population after pogroms drove them out of the Old
City at the end of the 15th century. During the golden Polish
renaissance, Kazimierz represented the undisputed capital of the
Diaspora, a lively cultural and intellectual center that attracted
the largest Jewish community in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of World War II, one quarter of Krakow's residents
were Jews. The Jewish quarter itself boasted eight synagogues and
numerous other places for religious studies and prayer. Then the
Nazis established the Krakow ghetto in Podgorze on the other side
of the Vistula.
</P>
<P>
   By 1943 Kazimierz was completely emptied of its inhabitants.
Many of the Jews of Krakow were transferred to the Warsaw ghetto.
Others perished in the Nazi death camps _ Plaszow. Belzec.
Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the 69,000 Jews living in Krakow in 1939,
roughly 150 returned after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual revival of so-called ``Post-Jewish'' Kazimierz
coincided with Polish political unrest in the mid-1980s. Some
people in Krakow sensed that resurrecting the city's Jewish history
was one of the keys to saving their own.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, today's non-Jewish Krakowers dedicated to the
ethnic revitalization of Kazimierz are walking a fine moral line,
and they well know it.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, ever since Steven Spielberg shot ``Schindler's
List'' on Szeroka Street in 1993, there has developed an
undiscriminating and in some ways unhealthy interest in all things
Jewish. Some fear the neighborhood would turn into an Old World
Disneyland, featuring kosher vodka, klezmer music and gefilte fish.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, since ``Schindler's List,'' there has
developed a very real and sincere dedication to restoring the
quarter's Jewish heritage, featuring historical exhibits in the
former synagogues, a modern Jewish Cultural Center committed to
international discourse, a charming hotel and cafe in the former
mikvah, or ritual bath, and, well, kosher food and klezmer music.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is not entirely abstract, for of course there is
gefilte fish, and there is gefilte fish. Such subtle variances in
flavor are also a Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact remains that early on a Saturday morning, before
the 16th-century Remu'h Synagogue, the ancient melodies of the
Shabbat service still drift from the intimate sanctuary where
Krakow's Jews come to pray.
</P>
<P>
   A peek inside the entrance reveals a bare wooden table set for
kiddush: 12 plates of checkerboard poundcake and 12 cups for the
fruit of the vine. Two more than needed for a minyan. In light of
the history that these streets have witnessed, this humble scene
would appear to be a final heartbreaking wonder in this wondrous
city.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; SIDEBAR: WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the newly opened Hotel Klezmer-Hois, Szeroka
Street 6, telephone and fax (48-12) 411 1245, were among the
pioneers in revitalizing the Jewish quarter. The antique-furnished
hotel, in a former mikvah directly across the square from the
Remu'h Synagogue, has 11 rooms, a restaurant featuring Middle
European Jewish cuisine and nightly klezmer concerts. Doubles: $58
to $67, with breakfast, at 4.17 zlotys to $1.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-room Pod Roza, Florianska Street 14, (48-12) 422 9399,
fax (48-12) 421 7513, is one of the oldest hotels near the market
square. The renaissance portal has welcomed such guests as Franz
Liszt and Czar Alexander I. Doubles with breakfast: $100; after
April 1, $118.

Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use
this article only by special arrangement. For purchase information,

 By EVERETT POTTER  
 &HT;    Spring on the slopes means balmy weather and bargains. That is
especially true this spring, when many ski areas are trying to make
up for a rocky start that left them high and dry. Now they have the
snow, but they also have too many empty hotel rooms and condos.
 &HT;    Smart skiers and snowboarders should be on the lookout for even
deeper discounts than normal. Prices will dip around the end of
March and then fall off in April, with reductions that range from
20 percent to 70 percent off high-season prices.
 &HT;    To find the cheapest airline seats, plan to fly to hub cities
like Denver and Salt Lake City, which are served by many carriers.
 &HT;    Spring skiing is also perfect for last-minute skiers _ those who
commit only when the snow seems right. Here's a look at some
packages for Spring 2000. Prices are per person, based on double
occupancy.
 &HT;    From March 26 to April 14, Ascutney Mountain Resort (Rt. 44,

 &UR; From The New York Times &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Polish conductor serves his passengers coffee a half-hour
before the night train from Berlin pulls into Krakow's main
station.
</P>
<P>
   After expertly stirring in her nondairy creamer, the Krakow-born
economics professor who occupies the lower berth considers the
question: What are her townsfolk like? With a resounding zip of her
knee-high boots, she announces, with a hint of swagger, that they
are proud.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder. The people of Krakow are citizens of one of nine
cities chosen as European cultural capitals for the year 2000, with
a recorded history dating back to 965; a city selected by Unesco in
1978 as one of the most remarkable architectural complexes in the
world; home to one of Europe's largest medieval marketplaces;
central Europe's second oldest university (after Prague); royal
seat for six centuries of Polish kings with the kinds of names that
make learning history fun: Boleslaus the Bold, Boleslaus the
Chaste, Boleslaus the Squintmouth, Ladislaus the Elbow-High.
</P>
<P>
   During the golden renaissance of Polish culture in the 16th
century, Krakow was the capital of Europe's most populous kingdom,
stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea, harboring a medley of
cultures including Poles, Germans, Lithuanians, Jews, Italians and
Hungarians _ a veritable Euro-boomtown.
</P>
<P>
   There remains, of course, the unhappy flip side of Krakow's
history: the city's gradual decline after the transfer of the royal
seat of power to Warsaw in the early 17th century, the subsequent
partitioning of Poland and accompanying loss of independence, the
years of Nazi occupation, wrenching postwar relocation, Soviet
control, martial law.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s Krakow's dark side became physically manifest in
historic monuments blackened by tons of ash that fell on the city
weekly, courtesy of an indifferent industrial machine.
</P>
<P>
   But to stand in the middle of the restored Rynek Glowny, the
city's marketplace, is to sense the unique quality of Krakow's
pride; a pride both because and in spite of the city's perceptible
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The intersection of two medieval trade routes, from Prague to
the Crimea, and the Amber Road from the Baltic to southern Europe,
the 13th-century square marks the open center of a geometric
checkerboard of streets that describes the old city. (These streets
are, for the most part, wonderfully off limits to motorized
traffic.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vastness of the space, humanity clearly dominates
the scene: South American street musicians gather before the
Sukiennice (Cloth Halls) that cut the square in half. The
part-Renaissance, part-Gothic arcades now house cafes, rows of
wooden stands selling souvenirs and crafts, and upstairs, the
National Museum's picture gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Beside an outdoor display of watercolor cityscapes, older men in
peaked caps stop to chat, while mothers chase after toddlers who
chase after pigeons. Tourist-bearing horse-drawn buggies clip-clop
the perimeter, circling couples buying flowers from kerchiefed
saleswomen who purposefully ignore the white-faced mime perched on
a nearby soapbox.
</P>
<P>
   Other couples rest on benches watching other couples stroll, as
clusters of laughing students, laden with shopping bags, cram
themselves into phone booths. The young women wear short skirts and
dark nylons and high black boots, their wide faces turned up.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is appealingly slack. The feel, surrounded by
pastel-colored Renaissance and Baroque town houses, amid ambling,
stylish locals speaking their blurry, shushing tongue, is decidedly
Southern European. Except for one thing: It is freezing. It is
February. And this is Middle Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A penetrating icy rain slices down, blowing into the young
women's upturned faces as a piercing wind rips across the open
square, causing the old men to reach for their caps. All those
short skirts! Such cold knees. And those frozen fingers,
nonchalantly holding cigarettes (no gloves) while friends pause to
exchange intimacies, exposed to the elements. It is an entirely
imaginary spring that is in the air. The real thing must be
breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   As the full hour approaches, some heads lift to the taller
octagonal spire of the Church of the Virgin Mary, a red brick
Gothic affair that historically served the city's German patrician
class and now dominates the eastern corner of the square.
</P>
<P>
   On the hour (give or take a few minutes) one of the church's
remote arched windows opens and a faint flash of brass indicates a
lone trumpeter. The melody he plays is ancient and stirring, the
Hejnal, a medieval reveille that unexpectedly ends mid-bar.
</P>
<P>
   The practice memorializes a brave sentry who in the 13th century
raised the alarm from the same tower to warn his townspeople of
imminent Tartar invasion. Pierced in the throat by an enemy arrow,
the guard was unable to finish his song.
</P>
<P>
   Every hour, every day and night these interrupted tones are
repeated four times for the four points of the compass; the tribute
dates back 700 years. Thus punctuating the day, the ghostly melody
evokes a continuing memory of proud sacrifice, when spirited by the
wind to the farthest reaches of the old city.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Church of the Virgin Mary, shortly before noon every
day, the doors open to one of the largest Gothic altars in Europe.
This most famous work of the Nuremberg artist Wit Stwosz (Veit
Stoss in German), what he called his ``Bible made of linden,'' was
completed over a 12-year period, from 1477 to 1489.
</P>
<P>
   Some 100 other churches and houses of prayer adorn the streets,
covering every architectural period in the art history books and
often combining several styles under one roof. There is the Church
of St. Andrew, one of the few buildings in Krakow to survive the
Tartar invasion of 1241, that conceals within its austere white
limestone facade a later, richly ornate Baroque interior.
</P>
<P>
   The Gothic Church of St. Francis sports vibrantly colorful,
sinuously formed Art Nouveau stained-glass windows by Stanislaw
Wyspianski, as well as his decorative frescoes on the walls of the
transept and presbytery; surprisingly temporal roses and lilies,
seashells and peacock feathers.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that is over 90 percent Catholic, all these
churches are very much in use. On a given Sunday you can even find
small crowds outside the houses of worship listening to Mass on a
loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the spirit of Krakow would appear to be dominated by its
most populous secular group of citizens _ the students. For this,
if there ever was one, is a university town. There are no less than
100,000 students attending 15 institutions of higher learning.
That's one-eighth of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
   Step into the courtyards of the 16th- and 17th-century houses
along Florianska Street or Grodzka Street, the main pedestrian
arteries pumping a steady current of life into the market square,
and you will find happily ensconced behind Baroque porticos,
beneath vaulted passageways, up exterior courtyard staircases, all
the commercial byproducts of a vibrant student body: music shops,
clothing boutiques, art galleries, bookstores and enough cafes and
restaurants to rival the city's roster of churches _ with equally
packed houses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Krakow's restaurants differ from their Middle European
neighbors. While Berliners and Viennese enjoy their kaffee and
kuchen behind large windows, to maximize their climate's limited
light, Krakow stashes its eateries in the cellars below the old
city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, it would seem, the southern European illusion is in
effect: As if in need of escape from an invisibly glaring sun,
throngs of Krakow's young people retreat into windowless,
candlelighted caverns for cappuccino and cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly one-quarter of Krakow's students attend the Jagiellonen
University, founded in 1364 by Casimir the Great. The 1492
Collegium Maius on Jagiellonska Street, with four red-brick Gothic
wings enclosing an arcaded courtyard, is the university's oldest
building. It houses a museum that includes displays of the medieval
ceremonial garb still used today during graduation ceremonies, as
well as precious works of art and instruments of science.
</P>
<P>
   The library, communal dining hall, treasury and auditorium tell
the tale of the university's rich history. Copernicus studied here
from 1491 to 1495 and his astronomical instruments are displayed in
a room bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval astrolabes, torquetum and globe of the skies
appear, to the uninitiated, as gleaming brass disks and spheres,
dangling from chains, mounted on clawed feet, meticulously
inscribed with a secret systematic beauty. A mappamundi from 1510
is the first globe to indicate the then-newly discovered American
continent: America terra noviter reperta.
</P>
<P>
   The relics are not all ancient. Neil Armstrong left an
autographed picture of the Moon with special thanks to Copernicus.
A pen on display was used by the university's most prominent recent
alumnus, the theologian Karol Wojtylas, later Archbishop of Krakow,
now Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to the hustle of the market, a distinct and
directed undercurrent can be detected in the general comings and
goings. This popular stream follows the historic royal processional
route south on Grodzka Street, ending at the foot of the Wawel
Hill, or ``Polish Acropolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian traffic jams the 82-foot climb to the renaissance
Wawel Castle where Polish kings reigned for over 500 years, and its
adjoining Gothic Cathedral, the site of coronations and royal
funerals until 1734.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the hilltop, an imposing and messy complex of towers,
cupolas, bastions and battlements commands a magnificent view of
the Vistula River and the surrounding city.
</P>
<P>
   Within the medieval fortifications _ near the tapestried royal
chambers and carved marble tombs of Poland's royalty _ school
classes, families, the Polish equivalent of Boy Scouts in uniform,
elderly couples puffing from the exertion, babies in carriages, all
bask in the warmth of grandeur on a bitter cold day. The crowd
contains almost no foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Here, one senses, Poland was never partitioned, reduced or
dominated. Here Poland is big. As big as the view. And Krakow
remains its capital.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, ironically, the view from Wawel Hill features the
single portion of Krakow and Krakow's history that could throw the
proud citizenry off stride.
</P>
<P>
   A mile southeast of the castle, Kazimierz became the home to
Krakow's Jewish population after pogroms drove them out of the Old
City at the end of the 15th century. During the golden Polish
renaissance, Kazimierz represented the undisputed capital of the
Diaspora, a lively cultural and intellectual center that attracted
the largest Jewish community in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of World War II, one quarter of Krakow's residents
were Jews. The Jewish quarter itself boasted eight synagogues and
numerous other places for religious studies and prayer. Then the
Nazis established the Krakow ghetto in Podgorze on the other side
of the Vistula.
</P>
<P>
   By 1943 Kazimierz was completely emptied of its inhabitants.
Many of the Jews of Krakow were transferred to the Warsaw ghetto.
Others perished in the Nazi death camps _ Plaszow. Belzec.
Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the 69,000 Jews living in Krakow in 1939,
roughly 150 returned after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual revival of so-called ``Post-Jewish'' Kazimierz
coincided with Polish political unrest in the mid-1980s. Some
people in Krakow sensed that resurrecting the city's Jewish history
was one of the keys to saving their own.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, today's non-Jewish Krakowers dedicated to the
ethnic revitalization of Kazimierz are walking a fine moral line,
and they well know it.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, ever since Steven Spielberg shot ``Schindler's
List'' on Szeroka Street in 1993, there has developed an
undiscriminating and in some ways unhealthy interest in all things
Jewish. Some fear the neighborhood would turn into an Old World
Disneyland, featuring kosher vodka, klezmer music and gefilte fish.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, since ``Schindler's List,'' there has
developed a very real and sincere dedication to restoring the
quarter's Jewish heritage, featuring historical exhibits in the
former synagogues, a modern Jewish Cultural Center committed to
international discourse, a charming hotel and cafe in the former
mikvah, or ritual bath, and, well, kosher food and klezmer music.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is not entirely abstract, for of course there is
gefilte fish, and there is gefilte fish. Such subtle variances in
flavor are also a Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact remains that early on a Saturday morning, before
the 16th-century Remu'h Synagogue, the ancient melodies of the
Shabbat service still drift from the intimate sanctuary where
Krakow's Jews come to pray.
</P>
<P>
   A peek inside the entrance reveals a bare wooden table set for
kiddush: 12 plates of checkerboard poundcake and 12 cups for the
fruit of the vine. Two more than needed for a minyan. In light of
the history that these streets have witnessed, this humble scene
would appear to be a final heartbreaking wonder in this wondrous
city.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; SIDEBAR: WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the newly opened Hotel Klezmer-Hois, Szeroka
Street 6, telephone and fax (48-12) 411 1245, were among the
pioneers in revitalizing the Jewish quarter. The antique-furnished
hotel, in a former mikvah directly across the square from the
Remu'h Synagogue, has 11 rooms, a restaurant featuring Middle
European Jewish cuisine and nightly klezmer concerts. Doubles: $58
to $67, with breakfast, at 4.17 zlotys to $1.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-room Pod Roza, Florianska Street 14, (48-12) 422 9399,
fax (48-12) 421 7513, is one of the oldest hotels near the market
square. The renaissance portal has welcomed such guests as Franz
Liszt and Czar Alexander I. Doubles with breakfast: $100; after
April 1, $118.

transept and presbytery; surprisingly temporal roses and lilies,
seashells and peacock feathers.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that is over 90 percent Catholic, all these
churches are very much in use. On a given Sunday you can even find
small crowds outside the houses of worship listening to Mass on a
loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the spirit of Krakow would appear to be dominated by its
most populous secular group of citizens _ the students. For this,
if there ever was one, is a university town. There are no less than
100,000 students attending 15 institutions of higher learning.
That's one-eighth of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
   Step into the courtyards of the 16th- and 17th-century houses
along Florianska Street or Grodzka Street, the main pedestrian
arteries pumping a steady current of life into the market square,
and you will find happily ensconced behind Baroque porticos,
beneath vaulted passageways, up exterior courtyard staircases, all
the commercial byproducts of a vibrant student body: music shops,
clothing boutiques, art galleries, bookstores and enough cafes and
restaurants to rival the city's roster of churches _ with equally
packed houses.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Krakow's restaurants differ from their Middle European
neighbors. While Berliners and Viennese enjoy their kaffee and
kuchen behind large windows, to maximize their climate's limited
light, Krakow stashes its eateries in the cellars below the old
city streets.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, it would seem, the southern European illusion is in
effect: As if in need of escape from an invisibly glaring sun,
throngs of Krakow's young people retreat into windowless,
candlelighted caverns for cappuccino and cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly one-quarter of Krakow's students attend the Jagiellonen
University, founded in 1364 by Casimir the Great. The 1492
Collegium Maius on Jagiellonska Street, with four red-brick Gothic
wings enclosing an arcaded courtyard, is the university's oldest
building. It houses a museum that includes displays of the medieval
ceremonial garb still used today during graduation ceremonies, as
well as precious works of art and instruments of science.
</P>
<P>
   The library, communal dining hall, treasury and auditorium tell
the tale of the university's rich history. Copernicus studied here
from 1491 to 1495 and his astronomical instruments are displayed in
a room bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval astrolabes, torquetum and globe of the skies
appear, to the uninitiated, as gleaming brass disks and spheres,
dangling from chains, mounted on clawed feet, meticulously
inscribed with a secret systematic beauty. A mappamundi from 1510
is the first globe to indicate the then-newly discovered American
continent: America terra noviter reperta.
</P>
<P>
   The relics are not all ancient. Neil Armstrong left an
autographed picture of the Moon with special thanks to Copernicus.
A pen on display was used by the university's most prominent recent
alumnus, the theologian Karol Wojtylas, later Archbishop of Krakow,
now Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to the hustle of the market, a distinct and
directed undercurrent can be detected in the general comings and
goings. This popular stream follows the historic royal processional
route south on Grodzka Street, ending at the foot of the Wawel
Hill, or ``Polish Acropolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian traffic jams the 82-foot climb to the renaissance
Wawel Castle where Polish kings reigned for over 500 years, and its
adjoining Gothic Cathedral, the site of coronations and royal
funerals until 1734.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the hilltop, an imposing and messy complex of towers,
cupolas, bastions and battlements commands a magnificent view of
the Vistula River and the surrounding city.
</P>
<P>
   Within the medieval fortifications _ near the tapestried royal
chambers and carved marble tombs of Poland's royalty _ school
classes, families, the Polish equivalent of Boy Scouts in uniform,
elderly couples puffing from the exertion, babies in carriages, all
bask in the warmth of grandeur on a bitter cold day. The crowd
contains almost no foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Here, one senses, Poland was never partitioned, reduced or
dominated. Here Poland is big. As big as the view. And Krakow
remains its capital.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, ironically, the view from Wawel Hill features the
single portion of Krakow and Krakow's history that could throw the
proud citizenry off stride.
</P>
<P>
   A mile southeast of the castle, Kazimierz became the home to
Krakow's Jewish population after pogroms drove them out of the Old
City at the end of the 15th century. During the golden Polish
renaissance, Kazimierz represented the undisputed capital of the
Diaspora, a lively cultural and intellectual center that attracted
the largest Jewish community in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of World War II, one quarter of Krakow's residents
were Jews. The Jewish quarter itself boasted eight synagogues and
numerous other places for religious studies and prayer. Then the
Nazis established the Krakow ghetto in Podgorze on the other side
of the Vistula.
</P>
<P>
   By 1943 Kazimierz was completely emptied of its inhabitants.
Many of the Jews of Krakow were transferred to the Warsaw ghetto.
Others perished in the Nazi death camps _ Plaszow. Belzec.
Auschwitz-Birkenau. Of the 69,000 Jews living in Krakow in 1939,
roughly 150 returned after the war.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual revival of so-called ``Post-Jewish'' Kazimierz
coincided with Polish political unrest in the mid-1980s. Some
people in Krakow sensed that resurrecting the city's Jewish history
was one of the keys to saving their own.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, today's non-Jewish Krakowers dedicated to the
ethnic revitalization of Kazimierz are walking a fine moral line,
and they well know it.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, ever since Steven Spielberg shot ``Schindler's
List'' on Szeroka Street in 1993, there has developed an
undiscriminating and in some ways unhealthy interest in all things
Jewish. Some fear the neighborhood would turn into an Old World
Disneyland, featuring kosher vodka, klezmer music and gefilte fish.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, since ``Schindler's List,'' there has
developed a very real and sincere dedication to restoring the
quarter's Jewish heritage, featuring historical exhibits in the
former synagogues, a modern Jewish Cultural Center committed to
international discourse, a charming hotel and cafe in the former
mikvah, or ritual bath, and, well, kosher food and klezmer music.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is not entirely abstract, for of course there is
gefilte fish, and there is gefilte fish. Such subtle variances in
flavor are also a Jewish tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fact remains that early on a Saturday morning, before
the 16th-century Remu'h Synagogue, the ancient melodies of the
Shabbat service still drift from the intimate sanctuary where
Krakow's Jews come to pray.
</P>
<P>
   A peek inside the entrance reveals a bare wooden table set for
kiddush: 12 plates of checkerboard poundcake and 12 cups for the
fruit of the vine. Two more than needed for a minyan. In light of
the history that these streets have witnessed, this humble scene
would appear to be a final heartbreaking wonder in this wondrous
city.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The owners of the newly opened Hotel Klezmer-Hois, Szeroka
Street 6, telephone and fax (48-12) 411 1245, were among the
pioneers in revitalizing the Jewish quarter. The antique-furnished
hotel, in a former mikvah directly across the square from the
Remu'h Synagogue, has 11 rooms, a restaurant featuring Middle
European Jewish cuisine and nightly klezmer concerts. Doubles: $58
to $67, with breakfast, at 4.17 zlotys to $1.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-room Pod Roza, Florianska Street 14, (48-12) 422 9399,
fax (48-12) 421 7513, is one of the oldest hotels near the market
square. The renaissance portal has welcomed such guests as Franz
Liszt and Czar Alexander I. Doubles with breakfast: $100; after
April 1, $118.

 By EVERETT POTTER  
 &HT;    Spring on the slopes means balmy weather and bargains. That is
especially true this spring, when many ski areas are trying to make
up for a rocky start that left them high and dry. Now they have the
snow, but they also have too many empty hotel rooms and condos.
 &HT;    Smart skiers and snowboarders should be on the lookout for even
deeper discounts than normal. Prices will dip around the end of
March and then fall off in April, with reductions that range from
20 percent to 70 percent off high-season prices.
 &HT;    To find the cheapest airline seats, plan to fly to hub cities
like Denver and Salt Lake City, which are served by many carriers.
 &HT;    Spring skiing is also perfect for last-minute skiers _ those who
commit only when the snow seems right. Here's a look at some
packages for Spring 2000. Prices are per person, based on double
occupancy.
 &HT;    From March 26 to April 14, Ascutney Mountain Resort (Rt. 44,

BLAIR IS PRESSED TO TAKE PATERNITY LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It's not as if Prime Minister Tony Blair doesn't have
enough on his mind, what with the peace process in Northern Ireland
stalled and his handpicked candidate in the upcoming London mayor's
race trailing badly in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But it all pales in comparison to the pressure Blair is feeling
at home as his wife, Cherie, pregnant with their fourth child,
approaches her May due date.
</P>
<P>
   Under government policy, Blair is, like any new dad, entitled to
take paternity leave, as much as 13 weeks off without pay. His wife
wants him to take at least some of it, and many in his Labor Party
say it is incumbent on the incumbent of 10 Downing St. to show that
what's good for the people is good for the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking leave would be an excellent signal to other men and
other employers that no job is so important that you can't afford
time off to spend with a newborn child,'' said Mary-Ann Stephenson,
director of the Fawcett Society, a group that lobbies for gender
equality in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair is, like his hard-charging lawyer wife, something of a
workaholic and doesn't exactly relish the idea of relinquishing the
reins of power that he worked his whole life to grasp, no matter
how many brownie points he can score with the public, especially
women voters.
</P>
<P>
   The British public isn't of one mind on the matter, anyway. For
someone who gets accused of making policy with one eye on the polls
and one finger testing the prevailing winds of public opinion,
Blair is in a pickle.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Conservatives and their cheerleaders in the
right-wing, anti-Blair press, led by the Daily Telegraph and Daily
Mail, are poised to pounce if Blair gives the slightest indication
he wants to become the New Age Dad of British politics.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Blair is keeping his options open. He acknowledges that
his wife wants him to take some time off, but as he put it, ``I
have got to make sure that the country is properly run, too. I have
got a country to run, and I think people would expect me to be
doing my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a European Summit in Lisbon to the ITN television
network, Blair said, ``I'm going to have to sit down and discuss it
with the family first. That's the right place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics are gleefully suggesting part of the dilemma facing
Blair is that he and his spin doctors are terrified at the prospect
of leaving the day-to-day running of the country for any extended
period to John Prescott, the deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   While a competent administrator, Prescott has a habit of, as the
British say, making a bottle of things.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott is in charge of transportation, and a central plank of
the Labor Party is to encourage drivers to leave their cars at home
and use public transportation. Imagine the guffaws then when, after
announcing that policy at Parliament two years ago, Prescott left
Westminster in a chauffeur-driven Jaguar. He added to his legend
last year when he and his wife were chauffeured all of 300 yards
from their hotel to the hall where the Labor Party was holding its
annual conference.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said his hesitation has nothing to do with his confidence
in Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lack of confidence in anyone. I just haven't made
up my mind,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Blair told the BBC he needs more time to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I want to take some time with the baby when he or
she comes, but I honestly don't know what to do. I will have to
find a third way through,'' said Blair, lightheartedly referring to
his vaunted ``Third Way'' philosophy of merging social spending and
pro-business policy, which left-wing diehards abhor and
right-wingers complain he stole from them.
</P>
<P>
   While in Lisbon, Blair may feel the urge to give a dope slap to
his Finnish counterpart, Paavo Lipponen, who hasn't made things any
easier for Blair. Having just returned from his second paternity
leave, Lipponen has become the poster boy for Europeans who want
men to put family first.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blair spoke approvingly of Lipponen recently, saying, ``I,
for one, am promoting the widespread adoption of his fine
example.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the resolute Mrs. Blair, who uses her maiden
name, Cherie Booth, in her work as a lawyer, say her praise of the
Finnish prime minister means this is a done deal and that her
husband will have to take at least part of his allotted 13 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Female parliamentarians in the Labor Party, who once called
themselves ``Blair's Babes,'' say the imminent arrival of the new
Blair babe, who will be the first child born to a sitting prime
minister in some 150 years, will help them in their campaign to get
Blair to push for paid paternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders are appalled at that prospect, and Blair's
political enemies will make considerable hay if he betrays even the
slightest sympathy for it.
</P>
<P>
   As he ponders the next two months, Tony Blair may be forgiven
for asking why someone once dubbed all this ``the blessed event.''

&HT;     SUTURE COMPANY FACES NEW LAWSUITS OVER ALLEGED CONTAMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (ATTN: Calif., N.J., Okla., Texas)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LANCE WILLIAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The families of three people who died of
infections after routine operations have filed wrongful death
lawsuits against Ethicon Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of
surgical sutures.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuits, the families claimed their loved ones died
because surgeons unknowingly used sutures that allegedly were
contaminated with infectious bacteria during a processing accident
at an Ethicon factory in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints regarding the deaths of William Carpenter,
retired school counselor from San Francisco; Virginia McMillan, a
homemaker from San Jose; and Tom Schroeder, a cattle rancher from
Freedom, Okla., were contained in lawsuits filed last month in San
Francisco and Alameda County courts.
</P>
<P>
   The three new lawsuits were filed on behalf of 52 surgical
patients who said they had suffered grievous injuries because their
doctors unknowingly used contaminated sutures in operations.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, more than 100 patients in California
and 15 other states have sued Ethicon in connection with infections
that they blame on breakdowns in a new sterilizing system at an
Ethicon plant in San Angelo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Four fatalities have been blamed on the sutures in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicon, a division of the Johnson &AMP; Johnson Co. that is based
in Somerville, N.J., has denied that its products made anyone ill.
Company spokeswoman Susan Odenthal said she was not aware of the
new lawsuits and had no comment on them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims who have sued said they were alerted to the
contamination incident _ and, thus, to the alleged cause of their
maladies _ by stories on the sterilizing system breakdown that
appeared in the San Francisco Examiner last year.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1994, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prodded
Ethicon into issuing a voluntary recall for 3.6 million of the
company's trademark Vicryl dissolving sutures.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of the sutures were not recovered,
according to the FDA. Meanwhile, surgical patients around the
country began blaming Ethicon sutures for fierce post-surgical
infections, many caused by staphylococcus and a rare bacteria
related to tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Congress and in response to lawsuits, Ethicon has
acknowledged problems with the sterilizer unit, but contended that
all the sutures it sold were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Since the incident, the company has made confidential
settlements with 22 victims who blamed the sutures for their
infections, according to public records.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaints, the three patients who died all had
operations involving the dissolving Vicryl sutures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carpenter, 72, died of a staph infection after surgery, in
October 1995, for replacement of a heart valve.
</P>
<P>
   _ Schroeder, 75, had heart surgery at an Oklahoma City hospital
in 1994. Four days after the operation, the former rodeo cowboy's
chest burst open from a serious staph infection, medical records
show. He lived four more years, but was an invalid frequently
subject to infections that required urgent care, said his daughter,
Carlene Culver of Ashland, Kan. He died in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ McMillan, 48, had a heart valve replacement in June 1994. She
also suffered a serious infection and ultimately died, according to
the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuits, the plaintiffs accuse the Ethicon Inc. of
seeking to conceal the risks posed by the sutures.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While earlier lawsuits have focused solely on alleged
contamination of Ethicon's dissolving Vicryl sutures, the products
that were the subject of the September 1994 recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But a another lawsuit filed in Alameda County contended that
Ethicon also shipped contaminated sutures made of silk and a
synthetic, Prolene.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1994, the company voluntarily recalled 2,600
packages of Prolene and silk sutures, according to the lawsuit
filed by Sacramento lawyer Wendy York on behalf of eight California
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that those sutures, like the Vicryl ones
subject to the later recall, had been contaminated during
processing and caused the patients to suffer serious postoperative
infections.
</P>
<P>
   York said the foil packages containing the silk and Prolene
sutures had been improperly sealed, leading to fears that the
products were contaminated.

JAPANESE TOWN USES ITS OWN SOCIAL CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHARON MOSHAVI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KURIYAMA, Japan _ Like many Japanese, the residents of this
town, population 15,500, worry that the things that have long made
this orderly, polite society function are crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning in the newspapers, they see the face of the new
Japan: rising crime, corrupt police, increasing child abuse,
violent schools, and youth who are just plain rude.
</P>
<P>
   But the people of Kuriyama think they may have found a simple,
though radical, solution to the ills of modern Japan: printing
their own money.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of reinforcing community values, Kuriyama has embarked
on an experimental barter system where its residents ``sell'' their
services _ ironing, for example, or snow shoveling, or dog-walking,
or just talking to a lonely person. In return, they get a currency
called kurin, which they can then use to ``buy'' a service someone
else is offering.
</P>
<P>
   They aim to create a town in which people know and more
importantly, in which they take care of one another, says Masahiro
Hanada, 43, the official heading the program. ``With this project,
I wish to make Kuriyama a little like it was when I was young,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The program began in February on a two-month trial basis.
Municipal officials put an ad in the newspaper, hoping to draw 50
or 100 people. They wound up with more than 250 participants.
</P>
<P>
   Mieko Kadoya, 81, is one of them. Her husband has died, and none
of her three children live in town, so she gets lonely. She gave
kurin to Saburo Okada, 39, to come to talk to her. Okada in turn,
used his kurin to learn a software program from Naomi Mizuguchi,
24.
</P>
<P>
   Mizuguchi used the kurin she got to learn to make traditional
Japanese pickles from Setsuko Hanada, 66, who speeds up the
process, which usually takes days, by using a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Like many older Japanese, Hanada the young have lost their
respect for the elderly, and hopes the kurin can bring the
generations together. ``We older people have knowledge to offer,
and the younger people have energy,'' said Hanada, who has used her
kurin to pay someone to shovel her walk.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a way to help out Japan's aging population was the main
engine driving Kuriyama's decision to try the barter experiment.
The town is the face of what Japan will be in a few years: one in
four people are over 65, a proportion the entire country is
expected to reach by 2025. That'll put a strain on Japan's pension
and health care systems, and deprive it of a work force large
enough to keep the economy growing.
</P>
<P>
   Towns in other countries, including the United States, have
embarked on variations of a barter system, but most, like the Hours
system developed in Ithaca, N.Y., are more designed to defend local
retailers against national chain stores.
</P>
<P>
   No other project has been designed to deal with an aging
population, an issue many developed countries are facing as birth
rates decline. Kuriyama hopes it can serve as a model not just for
other Japanese towns, but for other countries as well.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the experiment is an admission of just how much
community and family ties _ things on which Japan has long prided
itself _ are breaking down. Many young Japanese seek an
increasingly individualistic lifestyle, which means fewer of them
live with parents or grandparents. Japan's growing numbers of
elderly are increasingly left to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Town leaders say that so far the trial is a success in providing
basic services to the elderly and in creating a sense of community.
They plan to widen it to 1,000 participants in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the scheme's effectiveness is limited to small,
select towns and could never be replicated in any grand scale.
Hidehiko Sekizawa of Tokyo's Hakuhodo Institute of Life and Living,
says it is a well-meaning project designed to ``transform
capitalism into a gentler system.''
</P>
<P>
   Toshiharu Kato, who developed the barter project in his spare
time, acknowledges that his scheme is a rather warm and fuzzy
utopian idea. ``You can describe me as a dreamer, but it's
important to dream, to realize the ideal type of community,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's perhaps fitting that the very local Kuriyama barter program
was dreamed up by Kato, a government bureaucrat in Tokyo. Localism
is a radical idea in Japan, where everything from street signs to
building designs is centrally planned.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say a barter system could be particularly useful
in Japan, where money is considered almost dirty; for instance,
even in the simplest purchase, money almost never is directly
handed to anyone, but rather placed in a small tray. So it would be
unseemly to pay someone to teach a recipe or read aloud, things a
family member might do.
</P>
<P>
   Before they turned to the barter scheme, Kuriyamans attempted
another way to reinvigorate the town: it tried to attract more
children. Officials offered a better health care package for
youngsters, and built a baseball field and soccer stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Result: The town exhausted its funds paying for all this, and
the effort was a total failure. In fact, one of the town's five
elementary schools was forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   Kuriyama's population continues on a slow decline as young
people move away in search of more excitement and better jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same problem all over Japan. Young people go and
leave their families. It's not the way it should be,'' said Seiichi
Hasegawa, an administrator at the Red Cross Hospital who has spent
his life in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa has gotten his daughter involved in the barter project
_ she buys groceries for an elderly lady _ in hopes of instilling
in her a sense of community and family responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   He would like her to stay in Kuriyama, to raise her family here
and see him through his old age. The problem, he said, is ``I can't
force her. That is her freedom.''

   &UR;  &LR;  KISANGANI, Democratic Republic of Congo _ A block down from
the Assemblies of God clothing store, a policeman in Cub Scout
yellow and blue directs traffic from a wooden scaffold set in the
middle of a four-way intersection.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only way to keep all the bicyclists from colliding.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the coming weeks or months, the United Nations will
arrive. Kisangani is one of four towns in Congo where the
international community will send observers and peacekeepers to
monitor compliance with a cease-fire negotiated, signed, and
repeatedly violated by the belligerents of this country's 20-month
war. The UN will bring cargo planes, helicopters, and a convoy of
white vehicles. Foreign development and relief organizations will
probably follow, each with their own fleet of all-terrain vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic will thicken, and Kisangani and its people will become a
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment, the streets are largely empty of cars, most
of them having been stolen and driven off during successive wars,
and clogged with ``tolekas,'' the local name for bicycle taxis.
Translated, it means ``we go.'' The bicycles are all the same,
standard black one-speeds with rod-lever brakes, but individualized
with patterns of colored tape and rear-wheel mudguards bearing
catchy phrases that usually evoke God or Jesus. They cost little to
ride _ a few bills of late-Zairian issue or new Congolese francs
with too many zeroes to carry much value.
</P>
<P>
   While tolekas set the pace on Kisangani's wide and once-splendid
lanes, pirogues, or dugout canoes, ferry life on the near-mythical
Congo River.
</P>
<P>
   Originally named Stanleyville, after the indefatigable but
brutal explorer Henry Morton Stanley, Kisangani was the last great
river outpost establishing Belgian King Leopold II's reign over the
Congo basin. The town lies in the middle of this vast country,
surrounded by dense rainforest.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the roads connecting Kisangani to other cities are
impassable, either damaged by war or overgrown with neglect. In
fact, the town has never been easy to reach, but it has always been
a draw. Two airports make it a strategic port in war, and Kisangani
has been sacked in successive conflicts against former Zairian
president Mobutu Sese Seko and the current Congolese leader,
Laurent Kabila. Pope John Paul II spent four days here during his
first tour of Africa in 1980. Diamond traders flock to dig in the
sandbars hidden in the dense surrounding forest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of two foreign armies and three rebel
factions, all flexing self-declared authority, the town hums with
its own brand of insouciance.
</P>
<P>
   The central market, once called 24 November after Mobutu's rise
to power but renamed 13 March for the day Kabila swept through,
bustles in a town square ringed by bullet-pocked buildings. Entire
streets are lined with the kitschy facades of prospecting diamond
dealerships _ named Willy's, Jihad, or Christ is Rich.
</P>
<P>
   Some mornings Kisangani awakens to the bells and baritone choir
of the Cathedral of our Lady St. Rosaira on the Congo's banks. Dusk
sets off a chorus of frogs, so numerous it is almost impossible to
walk without stepping on them, on the far and less developed side
of the river.
</P>
<P>
   It is sad that Congo, chronicled a century ago by Joseph Conrad,
still bears the insulting label from the title of his most famous
work, ``Heart of Darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese are a kind and patient people, with a curious
penchant for purple lounge suits. Like any place, Kisangani has its
swindlers and cheats, but also its heroes and saints. The most
respected man in town is a meek English professor from the local,
impoverished university.
</P>
<P>
   Well-thumbed Bibles aren't hard to find. Nor is the yearning for
peace. Zuzi Batetianto runs a stall at the 13 March market, selling
_ with a straight face _ pink and purple trousers in just about any
size and cut. He has heard the UN is coming, and he's willing to
hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe now Congo will get out of its present difficulties,'' he
said. ``We have had enough.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Isatu Olivia and Nanah Kylie, two girls from
war-torn Sierra Leone, came into the life of Dr. Sondra S. Crosby
last year, the nine-year veteran at Boston Medical Center suddenly
found herself on the other side of the waiting-room door.
</P>
<P>
   In a whirlwind of events that eventually reshaped her life,
Crosby sought compassion from her profession, but found little.
During one week alone, when Isatu's and Nanah's pediatrician was
out of town, the girls' HIV tests were botched, frazzled clerks
were uncaring, and the future seemed as uncertain as the girls'
ages, which no one could pinpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated and with no one to talk to, Crosby sat at her
computer at midnight one night and poured out her frustrations.
Then, without a second thought, she clicked a button and sent her
words to the Journal of the American Medical Association, which
published her essay earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``A Mother's Prayer,'' Crosby's piece is part mea culpa,
part raw assessment of her experiences, and part plea to do
something about a medical industry directed more by profits than
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the constraints of 15-minute visits and productivity
quotas, I can't remember the last time I asked a patient `How are
you, really?' and meant it,'' she lamented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to get beyond the next mammogram, Pap smear,
cholesterol or viral load results,'' she continued. ``I have never
even thought to consider patients' experiences in the waiting room,
or what happens to them when I go on vacation. How do they get
through the impossibly complicated medical maze?''
</P>
<P>
   Since it was published, Crosby said the most common reaction has
been a quiet pat on the back and a knowing glance. The biggest
surprise was that there was no surprise: Most doctors privately
agreed with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the core of medicine is empathy with patients,'' said
Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, who practices internal medicine at
Cambridge Hospital. ``And the more the patient becomes referred to
as an industrial commodity, the harder it is to maintain that core
of empathy and compassion, and that's part of what she's talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby's essay may have provoked mild talk around hospital
cafeterias, but its message was felt most deeply by its 40-year-old
author, who has quietly vowed to come to terms with the realities
of working in an increasingly MBA-driven profession, while reaching
out to others as best she can, one patient at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know what it feels like to be in so much pain and not
know where to go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sondra Crosby first heard of Isatu and Nanah in a letter from a
Maine adoption agency seeking families for children whose lives had
been torn apart by strife.
</P>
<P>
   The news came just months after she and her husband, Alan, had
begun building a family when they adopted a 1-year-old girl,
Madison, from China.
</P>
<P>
   A cherub-cheeked toddler with a passion for Barney the purple
dinosaur, Madison was an easy child to adopt. Her medical history
was known, her status constantly monitored since birth. But
yearning for more children, Sondra and Alan received pictures of
two wiry girls with cropped hair and faint smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Isatu and Nanah could hardly have been more in need of
parenting: with distended bellies from malnutrition and faces that
hid a host of fears, the girls' adoption from Sierra Leone would be
both a challenge and a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   But then things grew worse.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the girls' pictures were sent abroad, their orphanage
was attacked by rebels on Jan. 12 last year. The building was
burned to the ground, forcing all 17 children and their leaders
into the thick African bush. After months of near constant
communication, there was suddenly nothing but silence as two months
slowly passed.
</P>
<P>
   On March 16 last year, the silence broke. Reports from Africa
and Maine said the small band of teachers and orphans had made it
to Guinea after trudging for two months and 90 miles in the bush.
</P>
<P>
   It was good news, but it was then that Crosby's fears began to
build. She wrote that she knew nothing of the girls' medical or
family history. She did not know what they had seen, what horrors
they had experienced. Isatu would later talk of smelling burning
flesh and of being forced to beat a young boy, while Nanah suffered
from poor teeth and mysterious rectal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Crosby said she was falsely confident. ``After
all,'' she wrote in her essay, ``I am a physician and I work in the
inner city. I treat patients with parasitic diseases, hepatitis,
HIV, and post-traumatic stress, as well as those who have
experienced domestic and street violence.

   ``But what I failed to understand,'' she continued, ``was simply
how to be a mother, and how to share and experience my girls' pain
in a very personal way.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the new family finally arrived home in Canton, Crosby
turned to the medical profession for answers and, where there were
none, for some help making sense of her new daughters' conditions.
Tests for human immunodeficiency virus, malaria, hepatitis, sickle
cell anemia, syphilis, and lead poisoning were administered.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, the process turned chaotic: During one blood
test, one of the girls soiled her clothing. During another visit, a
clerk rudely asked Crosby where the girls' mother was. She had
problems contacting doctors and getting answers to basic questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never before felt so helpless or out of control,''
Crosby wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One day last year, Crosby said, her frustrations gave way to a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of her fears over Isatu and Nanah, when it all
seemed to be spiraling out of control, a woman called out to Crosby
from across the crowded lobby at BMC.
</P>
<P>
   Desperately sobbing and noticeably drunk, the woman was a former
patient, a recovering alcoholic and diabetic. She told Crosby she
was scheduled that day to testify against a man accused of shooting
her son. Terrified over retribution for her testimony, she had
slipped off the wagon and did not know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   With that cry for help, time stopped for Crosby. Of all the
people to turn to, of all the places to go, this woman had come
seeking her. And within this woman's pain, Crosby said, she saw her
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was me,'' she said. ``I suddenly knew where that woman
was coming from. Looking at her, I knew what it feels like to be in
so much pain and not know where to go. I tried to understand this
before, but I didn't really understand it the way I do now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crosby flung herself into her work at BMC, where she spends long
hours while carrying a ceramic coffee mug adorned with a picture of
her new family. The mug is usually filled with cold coffee. On the
back of the mug is a crayoned picture of a smiling face and
widespread arms with the caption: ``We love our Mommy this much.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby's clientele is a rare mix of the city's displaced and
downtrodden. Most of her patients have no regular medical care, no
phones, and often no homes. She has been treating such patients
since she was in her residency.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as part of her vow to pay more attention to her patients,
Crosby gives her beeper number out liberally, a cure for impersonal
phone systems. And while the visits are still quick and the pace of
her day nonstop, she said she is making an effort to stop, to
listen to what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am suddenly finding out things about their lives I never
knew, but should have known,'' Crosby wrote. Her daughters, she
said, ``have thankfully influenced what had become a businesslike
approach to my own medical practice: I am reminded why I went into
medicine in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hospital's urgent care clinic, where Crosby spends some
of her week, the door opens and closes on a host of maladies and
stories.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, with only one other doctor helping out,
the clinic had taken in 43 patients by 3 p.m. The two doctors see
as many as 85 to 100 patients between 8 a.m. and 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m., Crosby and Dr. Stelios Maheras had had no break since
8 a.m. No lunch. And the waiting room seemed perpetually filled.
There was a man newly arrived from Cameroon with malaria and a
homeless patient with a bruised hand whom Crosby has sporadically
cared for since her residency.
</P>
<P>
   At her primary practice the next day, Crosby saw an HIV-positive
man from South Boston whom she met in the urgent care clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I started to be treated for HIV, I've had four
doctors,'' said the man. ``The first doctor, I had absolutely no
use for. The second doctor was great but he was transferred
somewhere else. And he referred me to another doctor who seemed
more concerned about his image as a doctor than about treating
patients. And Dr. Crosby, she's an extremely caring doctor, a
caring person, period.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, on a beautiful morning hinting at spring, three
girls in matching dresses walked into the Norfolk County Courthouse
before an attorney handed them each a helium-filled balloon adorned
with a ballerina bear.
</P>
<P>
   When their turn came, the girls, their father, mother, and
grandparents were escorted into a quiet courtroom that was all
their own. The girls drew pictures of houses on the blackboard
before the judge came out, introduced himself, and escorted the
three beaming girls behind the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Holding Madison on his hip, shuffling documents in his free
hand, and directing Isatu and Nanah to bang his gavel at the
appropriate time, the judge solemnly bequeathed each girl a new
name, all of which now end in Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   There were no plans for celebration. Sondra said she hoped she
and Alan would sip champagne when the house grew quiet that night,
and a large family meal was planned for this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But on this warm day _ a bright end to all the pain and
introspection that began less than a year ago _ Alan and the girls
headed home while Sondra strapped two beepers around her neck,
located her missing stethoscope, and once again headed back to
work.

BATTLE BREWING OVER RIGHTS TO INTERNET CONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Over the past 200 years, a rough balance has evolved in
this country between the rights of the owners of intellectual
property and those of the public who want access to their work. But
a sizable body of legal experts now believes that technology being
developed to protect intellectual property on the Internet _
``code'' in Web vernacular _ may shatter this equilibrium and
marginalize much of traditional copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, a trifecta of code, aggressive licensing
contracts, and recent federal legislation has buttressed owners'
rights at the expense of public access. Leading this wave have been
record companies and movie studios incensed over the piracy
flourishing on the Net that costs them millions of dollars each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the tension between open content advocates who
consider the Net nirvana and owners who find it a free fire zone on
their creative work has elevated the arcane world of copyright law
to marquee status.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the movement in this field has been toward content and
then encryption at the expense of Fair Use,'' says Terry Fisher, an
intellectual property specialist at Harvard Law School. Fair Use is
the doctrine that provides exceptions to exclusivity of copyright
protection for criticism, commentary, news, teaching, scholarship,
and research.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is at risk,'' adds Jessica Litman, an intellectual
property law specialist at Wayne State University in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the nonprofit Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF), which is dedicated to open Net access,
has emerged as one of the field commanders waging rhetorical
warfare against corporate intellectual property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was previously considered a common human resource,
distributed among the minds and libraries of the world,'' he
writes, ``is now being fenced and deeded. It is as though a new
class of enterprise had arisen, which claimed to own air and
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Horsefeathers, counter record and movie executives. ``If you
can't protect what you own, you don't own anything,'' says Jack
Valenti, the longtime president of the Motion Picture Association
of America (MPAA), which represents the major studios. ``Society
doesn't say you can copy anything you want. Fair Use is still very
much alive. We have no problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a culture clash between those who believe content on
the Net should be free and the content community who says, no, what
we do has value,'' adds Cary Sherman, general counsel of the
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which represents
more than 500 companies in the music business.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Era of Promiscuous Publication, a phrase that
captures the unsettling ability of the Net to transmit anything
instantly and indiscriminately. ``Today,'' Sherman told Congress in
1997, ``one individual, in less time than it takes me to read this
testimony, can send a full-length album to more than 50 million
Internet users.''
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree on one thing: Nothing is safe on the Net today.
``If you handed me a 100-page book, I could give you a digital copy
in about two hours,'' says Michael Segroves, an executive at
peanutpress.com, the Maynard-based e-book publisher that
participated in the online distribution this month of Stephen
King's latest work. ``What then has that done to the intellectual
property?''
</P>
<P>
   To staunch the flow of illicit traffic, the RIAA has filed a
spate of well-publicized lawsuits recently against Web sites such
as MP3.com and Napster alleging massive copyright infringement.
While Sherman said he admires the genius of MP3 software, which
compresses a CD to allow fast and easy storage on a hard drive, he
remains livid at both sites for finessing the permission from
artists and record companies required under copyright law to use
their music.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com makes copyrighted music available to users, providing
they can demonstrate possession of the CDs they want to hear. Thus
far, it has amassed upward of 80,000 from which to choose. Napster
allows users to link their own music archives to those of others.
While Napster doesn't offer any music of its own, it facilitates
access to a huge trove from other participants. Napster, which
Sherman calls ``a giant piracy machine,'' is an example of a
network externality. In plain English, this is something that
becomes more valuable the larger it grows.
</P>
<P>
   When MP3 software surfaced in the late '90s, the recording
industry reacted ``like a parent to a freshly mohawked teenager,''
according to a precis drafted at Harvard Law School's Berkman
Center on the Internet and Society and the EFF. It was just a
phase, record executives concluded. Wrong. Last year, according to
the document, ``MP3'' replaced ``sex'' as the Internet's most
searched term. And Napster use has so overloaded college systems
that it has been banned from many campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are huge. According to a recent report by Jupiter
Communications, the Net music business alone will swell to $1.6
billion by 2002. Many legal experts expect the recording industry
to prevail in its suits. But a larger question looms: Can
intellectual property on the Net ever really be controlled?

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The families of three people who died of
infections after routine operations have filed wrongful death
lawsuits against Ethicon Inc., the world's largest manufacturer of
surgical sutures.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuits, the families claimed their loved ones died
because surgeons unknowingly used sutures that allegedly were
contaminated with infectious bacteria during a processing accident
at an Ethicon factory in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints regarding the deaths of William Carpenter,
retired school counselor from San Francisco; Virginia McMillan, a
homemaker from San Jose; and Tom Schroeder, a cattle rancher from
Freedom, Okla., were contained in lawsuits filed last month in San
Francisco and Alameda County courts.
</P>
<P>
   The three new lawsuits were filed on behalf of 52 surgical
patients who said they had suffered grievous injuries because their
doctors unknowingly used contaminated sutures in operations.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, more than 100 patients in California
and 15 other states have sued Ethicon in connection with infections
that they blame on breakdowns in a new sterilizing system at an
Ethicon plant in San Angelo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Four fatalities have been blamed on the sutures in lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicon, a division of the Johnson &AMP; Johnson Co. that is based
in Somerville, N.J., has denied that its products made anyone ill.
Company spokeswoman Susan Odenthal said she was not aware of the
new lawsuits and had no comment on them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victims who have sued said they were alerted to the
contamination incident _ and, thus, to the alleged cause of their
maladies _ by stories on the sterilizing system breakdown that
appeared in the San Francisco Examiner last year.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1994, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prodded
Ethicon into issuing a voluntary recall for 3.6 million of the
company's trademark Vicryl dissolving sutures.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of the sutures were not recovered,
according to the FDA. Meanwhile, surgical patients around the
country began blaming Ethicon sutures for fierce post-surgical
infections, many caused by staphylococcus and a rare bacteria
related to tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Congress and in response to lawsuits, Ethicon has
acknowledged problems with the sterilizer unit, but contended that
all the sutures it sold were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Since the incident, the company has made confidential
settlements with 22 victims who blamed the sutures for their
infections, according to public records.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaints, the three patients who died all had
operations involving the dissolving Vicryl sutures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carpenter, 72, died of a staph infection after surgery, in
October 1995, for replacement of a heart valve.
</P>
<P>
   _ Schroeder, 75, had heart surgery at an Oklahoma City hospital
in 1994. Four days after the operation, the former rodeo cowboy's
chest burst open from a serious staph infection, medical records
show. He lived four more years, but was an invalid frequently
subject to infections that required urgent care, said his daughter,
Carlene Culver of Ashland, Kan. He died in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ McMillan, 48, had a heart valve replacement in June 1994. She
also suffered a serious infection and ultimately died, according to
the lawsuit.

   In the lawsuits, the plaintiffs accuse the Ethicon Inc. of
seeking to conceal the risks posed by the sutures.

<P>
   Earlier lawsuits have focused solely on alleged contamination of
Ethicon's dissolving Vicryl sutures, the products that were the
subject of the September 1994 recalls.
</P>
<P>
   But another lawsuit filed in Alameda County contended that
Ethicon also shipped contaminated sutures made of silk and a
synthetic, Prolene.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1994, the company voluntarily recalled 2,600
packages of Prolene and silk sutures, according to the lawsuit
filed by Sacramento lawyer Wendy York on behalf of eight California
patients.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that those sutures, like the Vicryl ones
subject to the later recall, had been contaminated during
processing and caused the patients to suffer serious postoperative
infections.
</P>
<P>
   York said the foil packages containing the silk and Prolene
sutures had been improperly sealed, leading to fears that the
products were contaminated.

US TROOPS IN KOSOVO NAVIGATE CALDRON OF HATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia _ When Velko Gjorevic's medication ran out,
he picked up a pitchfork and started chasing his family around
their farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, the guy's so old he couldn't catch any of them,'' US
Army Staff Sergeant Lee Sodic said as the 70-year-old Gjorevic sat
quietly in the back of a Humvee, heading back home after two nights
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hunter, Gjorevic was the potentially hunted, and so, at
US taxpayer expense, he was driven home by a heavily armed escort
of six US soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do this a lot,'' said Sodic, a 28-year-old from Boise,
Idaho. ``Six months ago, a Serb was released from jail and the
Albanians followed him home and jumped him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 10-year Army veteran and experienced peacekeeper, having
served in Somalia and Bosnia, Sodic has no illusions about his job
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop these people from killing each other,'' he
said, pausing briefly to spit chewing tobacco juice into an empty
plastic water bottle. ``And these people would like nothing better
than to kill each other. They hate each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Sodic turned to face a reporter in the back seat of his Humvee,
to make sure his point hit home. ``I mean, really hate each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 100,000 Serbs left in Kosovo, about half of them
live in the southeast sector controlled by 6,000 US troops. Keeping
the majority of ethnic Albanians from killing their Serb neighbors
in retaliation for the Serbian government's ethnic cleansing which
led to NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia is the biggest job facing US
troops.
</P>
<P>
   But few Serbs seem to appreciate the protection. As a US patrol
trundled through a Serb enclave outside Gnjilane, children flashed
three-finger Serbian salutes, while sullen men and dour women
stared contemptuously at their supposed protectors. Sometimes they
throw rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also have to deal with a small but persistent
group of ethnic Albanians who want to continue the war that
supposedly ended last June.
</P>
<P>
   In the Presevo valley, along the border with Serbia, former
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army have restyled themselves as
the Presevo, Medveda, and Bujenovac Liberation Army, referring to
the areas where about 70,000 ethnic Albanians live under Serbian
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that part of Serbia as ``eastern Kosovo,'' the rebels
have ambushed Serbian police, who have killed civilians in
retaliation. US Army officials say the Albanians are trying to
provoke an overreaction by Serb forces, such as the atrocities
against civilians that triggered the war last year, or to draw
American fire on the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   US Army Lieutenant Cliff Keller met with the rebels and told
them to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they're on their own, that we're not getting
involved in that, and if they think they can draw us in they're
wrong,'' said Keller, a Tennessean.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the political representatives of the fledgling
rebel group vowed to seek a political solution, but US troops say
they will continue to be vigilant.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, American soldiers have staged high-profile searches of
border area homes, taking weapons from ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   First Lieutenant Scott Olson said the Americans mean business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to tolerate the Albanians killing Serbs,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there is only so much American soldiers can do. About 20
Serbs have been murdered in Gnjilane since US troops arrived here
last June, and there are about a half-dozen attacks on them every
week.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Dr. Josef Vasic, a moderate and one of only two Serb
physicians left in Gnjilane, was gunned down in the city center at
9:30 a.m. &UR;  &LR; as US soldiers stood nearby. His killer escaped in the
crush of people, none of whom would help the peacekeepers identify
the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   As US Army Specialist Jason Nelson, a baby-faced 22-year-old
from El Paso, guided their Humvee down the narrow, dusty roads on
the outskirts of Gnjilane, Sergeant Sodic said many former Kosovo
Liberation Army members are trying to reinvent themselves, either
as die-hard patriots or get-rich-quick gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many organizations, I can't keep 'em straight,''
Sodic said. ``But if they've got weapons, we take 'em. The Serbs
think they're being picked on, the Albanians say we're not doing
enough. Our job is to be impartial and control both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Most ethnic Albanians are not actively seeking revenge or trying
to stir up trouble along the border with Serbia. They waved
cheerfully as the American ``presence patrol'' passed. Children, in
particular, flock to the American GIs. But having seen how friendly
locals in Somalia quickly turned on US soldiers, Sodic is wary,
taking the adulation with a huge pinch of salt.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, people like having us here,'' he said.
``But eventually, like Somalia, people will probably begin to see
us as part of the problem. When you hold people back from carrying
out the revenge that they think is their God-given right, you get
caught in the crossfire. We expect things to get worse as it gets
warmer. During the winter, most people are just trying to survive.
They're not thinking about killing someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials worry about the crossfire scenario, which is
why US troops were pulled out of the divided northern city of
Mitrovica after Serbs attacked them as they searched houses for
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Of two dozen US soldiers interviewed here, all of them said they
believed the peacekeeping mission here will go on indefinitely
because the hatred they see is so intense, and because they have
little faith in the United Nations to establish a modern,
multiethnic democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no opinion on the UN,'' Sodic said diplomatically,
before adding, almost under his breath. ``I saw them in Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two US bases in Kosovo. Camp Bondsteel, the bigger of
the two, has about 4,000 soldiers, while Camp Monteith here has
2,000. US jets purposely avoided bombing the Yugoslav Army base
here that has been transformed into Camp Monteith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before the war started, we knew we were coming here,''
Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of hammering, as permanent buildings go up, suggests
that the US Army plans to be here a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson parked outside the police station so Sodic could go in
and get a local farmer who found a minefield on his land. The plan
was to have the farmer point out the area so they could mark it off
with warning tape and bring in a contractor who clears minefields.
As Nelson waited, a little boy rode up on a rusty bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason, Jason!'' 10-year-old Doni Becini called out to Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up, Doni?'' Nelson said, climbing out of the Humvee,
tousling the boy's brown hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you, my friend,'' Doni sang in broken English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big news, big news,'' Nelson told him. ``I'm going home in 20
days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You go where, Jason?'' the boy asked, sounding confused.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson knelt down on one knee so he could look his young friend
in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home,'' the soldier said gently, ``I'm going back to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was crestfallen, his knuckles white as he gripped the
handlebars tightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, why Jason? Why you go home?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My job here's finished, Doni,'' the American GI said, putting
his hand on the boy's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, Jason, no,'' the little boy said, shaking his head,
sounding almost hopeful. ``Your job here is never finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Doni Becini may be more prescient than anyone dares to believe.

BATTLE BREWING OVER RIGHTS TO INTERNET CONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Over the past 200 years, a rough balance has evolved in
this country between the rights of the owners of intellectual
property and those of the public who want access to their work. But
a sizable body of legal experts now believes that technology being
developed to protect intellectual property on the Internet _
``code'' in Web vernacular _ may shatter this equilibrium and
marginalize much of traditional copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, a trifecta of code, aggressive licensing
contracts, and recent federal legislation has buttressed owners'
rights at the expense of public access. Leading this wave have been
record companies and movie studios incensed over the piracy
flourishing on the Net that costs them millions of dollars each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the tension between open content advocates who
consider the Net nirvana and owners who find it a free fire zone on
their creative work has elevated the arcane world of copyright law
to marquee status.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the movement in this field has been toward content and
then encryption at the expense of Fair Use,'' says Terry Fisher, an
intellectual property specialist at Harvard Law School. Fair Use is
the doctrine that provides exceptions to exclusivity of copyright
protection for criticism, commentary, news, teaching, scholarship,
and research.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is at risk,'' adds Jessica Litman, an intellectual
property law specialist at Wayne State University in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the nonprofit Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF), which is dedicated to open Net access,
has emerged as one of the field commanders waging rhetorical
warfare against corporate intellectual property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was previously considered a common human resource,
distributed among the minds and libraries of the world,'' he
writes, ``is now being fenced and deeded. It is as though a new
class of enterprise had arisen, which claimed to own air and
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Horsefeathers, counter record and movie executives. ``If you
can't protect what you own, you don't own anything,'' says Jack
Valenti, the longtime president of the Motion Picture Association
of America (MPAA), which represents the major studios. ``Society
doesn't say you can copy anything you want. Fair Use is still very
much alive. We have no problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a culture clash between those who believe content on
the Net should be free and the content community who says, no, what
we do has value,'' adds Cary Sherman, general counsel of the
Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which represents
more than 500 companies in the music business.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Era of Promiscuous Publication, a phrase that
captures the unsettling ability of the Net to transmit anything
instantly and indiscriminately. ``Today,'' Sherman told Congress in
1997, ``one individual, in less time than it takes me to read this
testimony, can send a full-length album to more than 50 million
Internet users.''
</P>
<P>
   All sides agree on one thing: Nothing is safe on the Net today.
``If you handed me a 100-page book, I could give you a digital copy
in about two hours,'' says Michael Segroves, an executive at
peanutpress.com, the Maynard-based e-book publisher that
participated in the online distribution this month of Stephen
King's latest work. ``What then has that done to the intellectual
property?''
</P>
<P>
   To staunch the flow of illicit traffic, the RIAA has filed a
spate of well-publicized lawsuits recently against Web sites such
as MP3.com and Napster alleging massive copyright infringement.
While Sherman said he admires the genius of MP3 software, which
compresses a CD to allow fast and easy storage on a hard drive, he
remains livid at both sites for finessing the permission from
artists and record companies required under copyright law to use
their music.
</P>
<P>
   MP3.com makes copyrighted music available to users, providing
they can demonstrate possession of the CDs they want to hear. Thus
far, it has amassed upward of 80,000 from which to choose. Napster
allows users to link their own music archives to those of others.
While Napster doesn't offer any music of its own, it facilitates
access to a huge trove from other participants. Napster, which
Sherman calls ``a giant piracy machine,'' is an example of a
network externality. In plain English, this is something that
becomes more valuable the larger it grows.
</P>
<P>
   When MP3 software surfaced in the late '90s, the recording
industry reacted ``like a parent to a freshly mohawked teenager,''
according to a precis drafted at Harvard Law School's Berkman
Center on the Internet and Society and the EFF. It was just a
phase, record executives concluded. Wrong. Last year, according to
the document, ``MP3'' replaced ``sex'' as the Internet's most
searched term. And Napster use has so overloaded college systems
that it has been banned from many campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are huge. According to a recent report by Jupiter
Communications, the Net music business alone will swell to $1.6
billion by 2002. Many legal experts expect the recording industry
to prevail in its suits. But a larger question looms: Can
intellectual property on the Net ever really be controlled?

FACTORING GORE CAMPAIGN INTO CHINA TRADE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For President Clinton, it's deja vu all over again. Only this
time, the stakes are higher.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Clinton lobbied Congress, successfully, to pass the
North American Free Trade Agreement, to the dismay of many of his
fellow Democrats and one of their key allies, organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor-friendly Democrats agonized over the divide between
Clinton and organized labor on the issue, but finally supported the
NAFTA bill. The treaty was approved over the protests of labor and
Democrats who believed it would result in jobs moving from the
American work force to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate is ongoing as to what damage, if any, NAFTA did
to American jobs, Clinton is now campaigning heavily for passage of
a bill that would give China permanent normal trade relations,
formerly called most-favored-nation status.
</P>
<P>
   A key portion of that NTR bill, which has human rights and labor
activists up in arms, would scrap Congress's annual review of
China's trade and human rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and key members of Congress support an end to this
annual review even though the US State Department reported in 1999
that China's ``poor human rights record deteriorated markedly
throughout the year, as the government intensified efforts to
suppress dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   While polls suggest that a majority of Republicans oppose
granting China permanent trade status, the Senate, which took up
the bill last week, is expected to approve it.The House, however,
is bitterly divided over the legislation. Clinton and other backers
of the bill hope that passage in the Senate will help persuade
House members to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet opponents of the bill appear to have legitimate arguments
against granting China permanent trade status while removing the
annual review of the country's human rights and trade, both of
which have been called ``abysmal'' by organized labor and rights
activists.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Amnesty International reported that China executed
1,769 people in 1998, more than the rest of the world combined.
Among those put to death were people convicted of tax fraud,
smuggling, and credit card theft. Then there is China's record of
tortures.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty's report said that 126 people were killed by police in
China during interrogations in 1995, and 115 in 1994. And, as
reported in The Washington Post, Amnesty ``catalogued a series of
violent crimes committed by police against suspects. Suspects have
been tortured to death with electric cattle prods, placed on
burning stoves, drowned in buckets, hanged and have died from a
heart attack after being beaten by police.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also reports of China making products in forced labor
camps, with workers earning 13 to 35 cents an hour, and having
these products sold in US stores.
</P>
<P>
   As for trade agreements with China, the United States Trade
Representative and the US State Department reported that over the
past 10 years, China has violated every trade agreement, four since
1992, it has signed with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With all these human rights and trade violations, rights
activists raise a legitimate issue as to why Clinton, members of
Congress, and others who are strong advocates of human rights
support giving China permanent trade status while ending the annual
congressional review.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other supporters of the bill argue that granting
China permanent trade status would eliminate barriers to US
products, expand US exports, and create good jobs in the United
States. Not supporting this bill would hurt US businesses, they
say. And, they further argue, the best way to improve human rights
in China is to give China this permanent trade status and bring it
into the World Trade Organization where the country would be forced
to play by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, China has a strong record of not playing by the rules
when it comes to human rights and trade, and there is strong
evidence that it is not likely to change suddenly if it is given
permanent trade status and brought into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International and other human rights groups, as well as
the AFL-CIO and other labor groups, are right to point to China's
human-rights and trade violations as sufficient reason not to give
permanent trade status without China improving its very poor record
on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and organized labor also know how important it is
to elect the expected Democratic presidential nominee, Vice
President Al Gore, in November. Both Gore and the expected GOP
nominee, George W. Bush, support permanent trade status for China
and elimination of the annual congressional review.
</P>
<P>
   If opponents defeat the bill this year, it would be a serious
blow to Clinton and his legacy in the last year of his
administration. And Gore's support of the bill could impact
negatively on his campaign, particularly among Democrats and labor
groups who are on the opposite side of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, Democrats and organized labor know that if
many of them stay home in protest of Gore's stance, they are only
giving Bush a better chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   And they know if Bush wins, the Democrats and labor will be in a
lot more trouble with him as president than they would be with
China's lousy record on human rights and free trade agreements.

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... really be controlled?  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the feverish efforts by the RIAA and MPAA, the answer
may be no. If so, the anxiety flourishing in academic circles is
unwarranted, at least for now. The recording industry association
has sent out hundreds of cease-and-desist letters to rogue Web
sites alleging copyright violations. The sites disappear into the
ether like moonshiners in the hills of Appalachia, who simply move
their stills to another site when authorities approach.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he believes efforts to control intellectual property
on the Net by tightening existing law are doomed. ``Those will all
fail because it is ineffectual to halt the ingenuity of hackers or
the pace of technological innovation,'' he says. ``Ultimately,
copyright owners and their representatives are going to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The second way to attempt control of intellectual property on
the Net _ an intermediate step in Fisher's view _ is through
contracts a user must agree to when signing up for a particular
program. These may be ``click-on agreements'' on the Net or
``shrink-wrapped'' ones in which a user agrees to terms
accompanying software to be installed in a computer. But their
legal standing is murky.
</P>
<P>
   A third way, the use of code, offers the best chance for
intellectual property owners to control their work on the Net.
Essentially, code provides techniques to limit or channel the uses
of information through encryption technology. Big content owners
like Disney and Sony can use it without public debate or
legislative fights. Eventually, walls of seamless protective code
may rise from the Net landscape like the towers of a Tuscan hill
town _ a specter that terrifies Barlow and others.
</P>
<P>
   This would be a change from traditional copyright enforcement,
where owners such as record companies have always tolerated a
degree of ``leakage.'' Before the advent of the Net, attempts to
make and distribute bootleg cassettes of music, for example, were
of no consequence because the quality of such reproduction was poor
and the process cumbersome. The lost revenue simply wasn't worth
pursuing. No more.
</P>
<P>
   Code also brings to mind the axiom of Jonathan Zittrain,
executive director of the Berkman Center: Technology always has two
phases _ It's Too Early To Tell and It's Too Late To Do Anything
About It. The only way to avoid the second is to focus on the
first.
</P>
<P>
   If code is indeed where the action is, then who writes it and
toward what end loom as the key questions. Consider the Secure
Digital Music Intiative (SDMI), a worldwide consortium of about 200
organizations associated with the music industry struggling to
develop a global encryption standard available to music content
providers. SDMI is far from reaching its goal, but its very
existence provides a glimpse into the thinking of the recording
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want the amount of freedom to reproduce speech to be
defined solely by the owner, who normally looks only at the
market?'' asks Zittrain about SDMI. ``There is not one user sitting
at that table. I don't want to rely on business models to give me
rights from copyright law. I don't know why I should have to go
down quietly on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness too the hoopla around the recent online release of
Stephen King's latest piece of fiction. Through code, the 66-page
novella entitled ``Riding the Bullet'' was made available only on
computer and hand-held instruments like the Palm Pilot. Most
salient, it cannot be copied. This limitation is at odds with the
First Sale Doctrine, a rule embedded in copyright law that allows
people to lend or resell a hard copy after they have purchased it.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the tight access is obvious to owners. ``If I put
intellectual property in a browser, it is almost impossible to
protect the security of that text,'' says Segroves. Adds
peanutpress.com cofounder, Mark Reichelt: ``The publishers want to
be damned sure that what happened to the music industry won't
happen to them.''
</P>
<P>
   So is the King experience going to be the future of digital
publishing? ``Absolutely,'' says Segroves. It is but one example of
the new reality that Zittrain calls ``privication'' _ where code
enables the distribution of information to a large audience while
not releasing it into general circulation.
</P>
<P>
   While some panic, others counsel caution. Pamela Samuelson, an
intellectual property specialist at the University of California at
Berkeley's law school, Boalt Hall, may have it right when she says
that despite ominous signs, ``We're in a transitional period where
Fair Use still has a future.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston University Law School professor Maureen O'Rourke agrees.
``The question is, does the law need to intervene at this point or
wait for the market to evolve?'' she asks rhetorically. ``It is
premature to do anything to stop the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But few outside the recording and movie industries, including
O'Rourke, are happy with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of
1998, a leviathan federal law that made it a felony for someone
merely to attempt circumvention of protective code. Mark Lemley,
Samuelson's colleague at Boalt Hall, calls this ``unilateral
technology disarmament'' in which one side uses code to build a
wall, but the other side cannot use technology to crack it.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 act has already triggered an important legal fight. In
January, Norwegian authorities detained a 16-year-old youth who
hacked his way through the DVD encryption code and then posted his
program, called DeCSS, on the Net. The seven major studios that
comprise the MPAA then filed federal suits in New York and
Connecticut under the DMCA, alleging copyright infringement against
individuals who exploited the DeCSS technology.
</P>
<P>
   The movie industry moved fast to avoid the mayhem that hit the
RIAA ranks. ``We watched the savaging of the music industry. They
were first in the line of fire,'' says MPAA spokesman Richard
Taylor. ``There were lessons to be learned.''
</P>
<P>
   But new problems may arise from the DMCA. Jane Ginsburg, an
intellectual property specialist at Columbia Law School, worries
about the inability of code to identify motives behind the copying
of a film in the wake of the DMCA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same device that could stop me from copying a whole movie
could also stop me from copying a small amount of the movie to show
to my class,'' says Ginsburg. ``In that case, the copy would be
locked up and I couldn't circumvent the lock because of the DMCA.
Here is where the existence of an alternative copy is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other sources, says Valenti, such as
Blockbuster Video and cable television. But will Blockbuster even
sell ancient technology like VHS cassettes a decade from now?
``These alternatives are only available at the pleasure of the
publisher,'' said Zittrain.
</P>
<P>
   Big content owners claim they are simply protecting what they
own. But they are short on credibility. These are the folks, after
all, who brought us the Sonny Bono Copyright Act of 1995 that
extended copyright protection to an astonishing 95 years.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that law, the operating system code of an
antediluvian laptop Radio Shack TRS-80, already ensconced in the
Smithsonian Institution as a museum piece, won't be in the public
domain until 2075. Go figure.

 BOSTON: ... Kennedy recalls.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Ohio State Murders'' is a semiautobiographical tale based
on that experience. The lead character reenacts her student years,
a time when she was so tense, she injured the flesh on her head.
Her dreams are left to decompose at the bottom of a lonely ravine.
</P>
<P>
   While many details are factual, Kennedy says the story itself is
fiction. ``When I went to Ohio State, I met my husband-to-be and
clung to him for dear life,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her character, the playwright got married in the
mid-1950s and moved to New York, where her husband, Joseph, was a
graduate student at Columbia University. (They've since divorced,
but remain friends.) Still a daydreamer and a hopeless romantic,
she longed to mingle with the movie stars and the serious writers
of the day and yearned to see her name appear in the gossip columns
of the local tabloids. ``Oh, I was very romantic about
everything,'' she recalls. ``I was this young housewife with a
baby, and I wore these little cotton dresses and had this vague
idea in my mind that I wanted to be a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   The writing life
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She didn't find herself as a writer until she accompanied her
husband to Africa in the early 1960s. All the hallucinogenic images
that had been swirling around in her mind jelled during that trip,
and she fired off ``Funnyhouse.'' The playwright Edward Albee
produced it off-Broadway in 1964. In the play, a college student is
haunted by images of Jesus, Queen Victoria, and the slain African
leader Patrice Lumumba.
</P>
<P>
   Her plays often unfold on that sort of surreal landscape, where
racial hatred can turn an innocent daydream into a vicious
nightmare. Racism is the underlying force of ``Sleep Deprivation
Chamber,'' a play she co-wrote with her son, Adam, that won an Obie
Award in 1996. The play is based on a real incident when Adam, now
38, was beaten by a police officer who followed him home to his
father's house in a tony Virginia suburb. ``It happened in my
husband's front yard,'' Kennedy says. ``I think of all those years
he worked to buy this white house with yellow shutters and a forest
behind it. It was his dream house, but somehow I realized we were
living in a kind of dream world. It was a shock for this to happen
to my son, a real shock.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't like to talk about the incident in too much detail:
Her emotional response is recorded in the play, which depicts a
mother's worst nightmare. After all, the teacher preparing to meet
her students still astonishes herself when that other woman _ the
one who writes the plays _ dredges up such blood-curdling images.
``I still get very upset,'' she says gently before heading to
class.
</P>
<P>
   She decides to allow the visitor to observe the seminar. In
class, one student reads a synopsis of her play, painting harrowing
images of a Christlike figure in a train station, a suicide, a dead
baby, a troubled woman with a troubled past. The student is a timid
type, and Kennedy urges her to be protective of her apocalyptic
vision. ``You have to be careful about listening to other people
because you don't want to get too logical,'' she tells the student.
``You have to be careful with this material because it's very
fragile.'' In those few moments, Adrienne Kennedy the teacher could
be addressing Adrienne Kennedy the playwright. In those brief
moments, she becomes the benevolent teacher she never had at Ohio
State.

UNSPARING LOOK AT A MOGUL'S LIFE

THE OPERATOR 
David Geffen Builds, Buys and Sells the New Hollywood. 
By Tom King. Random House. Illustrated. 670 pp. $25.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1941, Budd Schulberg came out with his novel ``What Makes
Sammy Run?'' The story of Sammy Glick, an amoral movie producer who
clawed his way to the top on the back of a talented writer, caused
a sensation. Glick lied, cheated, and stole his way to Hollywood
fame and fortune in Schulberg's cautionary tale. For the better
part of 50 years, readers, particularly those in the movie
business, were appalled by Glick's tactics. But for the past decade
and more, it's been an introductory textbook on how to succeed in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Operator,'' Wall Street Journal reporter Tom King's
well-researched, compellingly documented biography of media
billionaire David Geffen, reads like a factual version of
``Sammy.'' Except that Geffen's rise makes Glick seem like a
candidate for sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   On a superficial level, Geffen's life story seems to have
blossomed full blown from one of those old MGM Mickey Rooney-Judy
Garland movies. Here's the bright and cheery Hollywood version: At
13, after growing up on the edge of poverty, the son of Abraham and
Batya Geffen reads ``Hollywood Rajah,'' the story of Louis B.
Mayer's rise from poverty to head MGM itself, and sees that as a
plan for his own life. After a mediocre high school career and
after flunking out of both the University of Texas at Austin and
Brooklyn College, Geffen takes a job in the mailroom at William
Morris, and starts working his way up.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, a lack of academic success might be a serious
roadblock, but not for the eager, ambitious Geffen. When it seemed
that lacking a degree might hurt his chances for advancement,
King's book says, Geffen forged a letter from UCLA saying he
graduated. In one of a series of spectacular ironies, he eventually
used his friendship with Linda Rondstadt who used her friendship
with then-California Governor Jerry Brown to obtain a seat on the
California board of regents. And that was just the beginning of his
rise.
</P>
<P>
   At 25, Geffen made his first million as a record executive. His
list of friends and clients eventually read like Liz Smith's
Rolodex: The Doors, Elton John, Cher, the Eagles, Joni Mitchell,
Bob Dylan, Donna Summer, Jackson Browne, Crosby, Stills, Nash and
Young. In 1980, he produced John Lennon and Yoko Ono's ``Double
Fantasy'' album. In 1982, he established the Geffen Film Co., which
produced movies such as Tom Cruise's ``Risky Business'' and Albert
Brooks's ``Lost in America.'' Geffen coproduced Broadway shows,
including ``Cats'' and ``Dreamgirls.'' By 1990, Geffen Records was
making $46 million in profits a year, and its namesake hardly had
enough wall space to hang his 50 gold and 31 platinum albums.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? Buy a new home. In 1990, Geffen purchased the
Beverly Hills mansion of Jack Warner, another legendary studio
mogul, for $47.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Grover, in a 1992 Business Week profile, characterized
Geffen this way, ``. . .the reason David Geffen emerged (in 1991)
as the richest man in Hollywood is his uncanny ability to discover
raw talent, feed it through his Rolodex, and parlay it into rivers
of money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the relentless nature of that course also left a residue of
isolation in its wake. King, in one of the book's most stunning
scenes, writes how during the trial of O.J. Simpson, Geffen and
onetime super-agent Sue Mengers sat in his Malibu beach house
watching the proceedings on television, by themselves. The moment,
like a riff on Gloria Swanson and William Holden in ``Sunset
Boulevard'' (1950), strongly suggests the sort of eventually lonely
``friendship'' that money sometimes buys.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, this biography began with Geffen's full
cooperation. The mogul, responsible for making so many astute
decisions and parlaying them into vast wealth, opened his door, and
all of his associates' as well, to King.
</P>
<P>
   So, if he's so smart and rich, how did he ever let a journalist
as savvy and incorruptible as Tom King get this close to him?
Perhaps the answer comes through a mixture of self-deception and
the fact that the press has always tread softly around Geffen. But
not King.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have suggested that King received major access
over three years in part because he and his subject are gay and
because Geffen thought the Wall Street Journal connection had a
certain cachet, worthy of someone of his stature. But there may be
more to Geffen's reasoning. Geffen had spent so much of his life
re-creating the story of his life _ and getting away with it _ that
maybe he just saw King as a more formidable challenge than pulling
the wool over the eyes of the entertainment press. Well, if that's
the case, he woefully underestimated the writer.
</P>
<P>
   King has been criticized in some quarters for merely providing
the facts of Geffen's life without drawing definitive psychological
conclusions. But because King's reportorial skills keep his
analytical bent in check, that becomes one of the book's primary
virtues. He trusts the readers to draw their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The pivotal moment, for me, occurred when Geffen was 18, and he
and his brother, Mitchell, were riding in a limousine on the way to
the cemetery to bury their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Mitch, nobody knows we're not rich,'' said David.
``We could be rich riding in this limousine.'' Now, he assuredly
is.
</P>
<P>
   But the book leaves readers with one really obvious question _
just what has a billion dollars purchased for Mr. Geffen?

ONE RULE FOR REPUBLICANS; ANOTHER FOR KENNEDYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1995, Oregon Senator Bob Packwood's long career of making
unwanted sexual advances caught up with him, and, under pressure,
he resigned. His friend Alan Simpson, then a senator from Wyoming,
was among those who counseled Packwood to step down. Nevertheless,
Simpson was incensed by a glaring double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked around that room,'' he said, ``and saw people who had
done things much worse.'' In a column soon after, I quoted Simpson
and asked: Now, which senior senator from Massachusetts do you
suppose he was referring to?
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, that senior senator _ Edward Kennedy _ is up
for reelection. Preparing to challenge him, the papers reported on
March 16, was a young Republican businessman, Jack E. Robinson III.
Though a novice, Robinson was not, it seemed, without political
assets. For one thing, he was reportedly able to finance much of
his own campaign. And as the son of a longtime former president of
the Boston chapter of the NAACP, he could expect a warmer reception
among minority voters than Republicans usually enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Then the dimes started dropping. In the mid-1980s, it turned
out, he had once been stopped for driving under the influence. A
former girlfriend took out a restraining order against him,
claiming he had forced sex on her one night. Another woman alleged
that during a date four years ago, he aggressively tried to kiss
her. Robinson himself identified some other episodes: The speeding
ticket he forgot to pay; the ``dangerous weapon'' _ a star-shaped
Kung Fu gizmo _ found in his pocket in 1985; the four attempts it
took him to pass the bar exam; the court finding that an
unpublished book he wrote violated the copyright of another author.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week, bad press had pounded Robinson's fledgling
campaign into rubble. He was mocked as ``Jack the Tongue.''
Columnists were pitiless. Governor Paul Cellucci, citing ``the
sheer volume of the allegations,'' said the state GOP would have
nothing to do with him.
</P>
<P>
   To crown it all, Robinson's car was hit by an out-of-control
driver. He was spared from a head-on crash, but not from another
snide headline: ``Candidate Robinson steers into more trouble.''
The article's lead sentence was a taste of what he can expect every
day from now until he drops out of the race: ``Jack E. Robinson
III, the US Senate candidate accused of sexual misconduct,
plagiarism, and carrying a dangerous weapon, found himself in a new
controversy Wednesday: defending his behavior following a car
accident.'' (The ``behavior'' was not pulling over immediately.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, the case against Robinson is not exactly airtight. That
restraining order was vacated within a month. The woman he
supposedly forced kisses on is lobbing her accusation anonymously.
The drunk-driving arrest came to naught, since he passed a
Breathalyzer test.
</P>
<P>
   Details, details. No one cares. Robinson's real offense is not
sexual misconduct or speeding. It's that he is a Republican named
Robinson instead of a Democrat named Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual misconduct? Robinson has far to go before he can rival
the senior senator in that department.
</P>
<P>
   ``A former midlevel Kennedy staffer, bitterly disillusioned'' _
this is from Michael Kelly's long report in 1990 on Ted Kennedy's
loutish ways _ ``recalls with disgust one (now ex-) high-ranking
aide as `a pimp . . . whose real position was to procure women for
Kennedy.' The fellow did have a legitimate job, she says, but also
openly bragged of his prowess at getting attractive and beddable
dates for his boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Mishaps while driving? In the most infamous car accident in US
political history, Ted Kennedy left his passenger to die while he
went back to a party and never called the police. In a later car
wreck, Joseph Kennedy II _ a Bay State congressman from 1987 to
1999 _ left his passenger crippled for life.
</P>
<P>
   Abuse of women? Ted Kennedy's behavior smacks of ``misogyny,''
journalist Suzannah Lessard wrote in a famous article in 1979. ``It
suggests an old-fashioned, male chauvinist, exploitative view of
women as primarily objects of pleasure.'' Sheila Rauch Kennedy
wrote in 1997 that her ex-husband _ Joe Kennedy, the congressman _
``was powerful and popular'' while ``I was, as he so often reminded
me, a nobody.'' During her marriage, she said, she ``rarely stood
up to Joe'' and for good reason: ``I had simply become afraid of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The point isn't that Kennedys have skeletons in their closet
too, or that Robinson deserves a free pass. It is that there is a
clanging double standard. Democrats named Kennedy can be guilty of
shocking transgressions and Massachusetts voters will keep electing
them to term after term in the US Congress. A Kennedy's past is
never deemed a bar to holding public office. Indeed, it is
considered infra dig even to suggest such a thing. The media
themselves generally discuss the Kennedys' old scandals only when a
family member is caught committing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   But when it transpires that Republicans named Robinson _ or
anything else _ have a past, they are savaged in the press, their
reputations are pummeled, and they are laughed off the stage. Their
imperfections, we are given to understand, are massive failings,
rendering them unfit for political office.
</P>
<P>
   Jack E. Robinson is only the latest victim of this hypocrisy. He
won't be the last.

OK, REGIS, HERE ARE SOME REAL QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Jeopardy'' host Alex Trebek complains that the questions on
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' are too easy. Sour grapes, some
might say, since Trebek's comments came on the heels of Regis
Philbin signing a contract in the $20 million range to host
``Millionaire.'' Still, Trebek isn't the first critic to point out
that the questions are a tad on the simple side.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what's needed aren't tougher questions but a different
sort of question altogether. For example:
</P>
<P>
   How can I get my 15-year-old son out of bed in the morning?
</P>
<P>
   Or if that sort of question is too challenging, maybe they could
try questions that might compel contestants and viewers alike to
reflect, however briefly and superficially, on the meaning of
modern life. For example:
</P>
<P>
   How does Jerry Lewis fit into the generally accepted belief that
the universe is a better place with human life than without it?
</P>
<P>
   In a utopian world, would there be any need for Dr. Laura
Schlessinger?
</P>
<P>
   Does the question ``Got milk?'' presuppose an answer?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this sort of question doesn't lend itself to multiple
choice answers. Maybe the producers would agree to give every
contestant the $1 million just for showing up and grappling with
questions like these:
</P>
<P>
   If we can have knowledge of only what is true, how can we decide
which candidate to vote for in the presidential election?
</P>
<P>
   Does the phenomenal popularity of the World Wrestling Federation
tend to support Spengler's theory about the decline of Western
civilization?
</P>
<P>
   If, as Plato maintained, the unexamined life is not worth
living, what keeps Kathie Lee Gifford going?
</P>
<P>
   Is the phrase ``Viva Las Vegas!'' a legitimate example of the
timeless present?
</P>
<P>
   If not to decide is to decide, has John McCain given George Bush
his answer?
</P>
<P>
   If, as Hegel contended, only mind is real, to what extent were
Rick Rockwell, Darva Conger, and everybody else associated with
``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' wasting their time, and
ours?
</P>
<P>
   Is CNN news a legitimate example of Nietzsche's doctrine of the
eternal recurrence of the same events?
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to reconcile the concept of a supreme being with
the continuing success of David Geffen?
</P>
<P>
   If we accept the definition of a miracle as an event that
violates the ordinary course of nature, what _ if anything _ should
we conclude about the Miracle Bra?
</P>
<P>
   How many angels can dance on a PIN?
</P>
<P>
   Does Dick Vitale's commentary on ESPN reflect Wittgenstein's
view that the primary function of language is not to describe?
</P>
<P>
   Does the success of the Internet mean that entropy doesn't apply
when it comes to information systems?
</P>
<P>
   Is Sports Illustrated's prediction that the Red Sox will win the
World Series an example of ambiguous optimism? Is it an appropriate
probability statement? Or is it just nuts?
</P>
<P>
   If the concept of immortality presupposes physical death, how do
we account for the existence of show-biz immortals, so called, who
are still living?
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you accept the concept of collective guilt, are we all
responsible for the success of Andre Rieu and his magic violin?
</P>
<P>
   In an ideal society, would everyone have an equal chance to be a
contestant on ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''?

REVISITING JFK'S '52 RACE

   WASHINGTON _ If history is any guide, there will be a
coordinator for Senator Edward M. Kennedy's reelection campaign _
opponent or no opponent, joke or no joke _ operating in every city
and town in Massachusetts this year, and in every ward and precinct
in the population centers as well.
</P>
<P>
   New Englandfrom Washington
</P>
<P>
   This small chunk of what is a large army will be Democratic to
its shoes, but nonetheless distinct, a bit apart from the state's
official Democratic Party, and above all Kennedy in its fixation.
When people say ``the Kennedys,'' they're not talking merely about
a family; they're talking about an institution.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way for 50 years. You could maybe start with
John F. Kennedy's first run for Congress in 1946 and see many of
the roots, but all the elements came together for the first time
when he caught Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. napping six years later and
took his Senate seat away, setting him on the course that ended in
the White House eight years after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It quickly developed into an entire political party,'' Tip
O'Neill noted in his autobiography, ``with its own people, its own
approach, and its own strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later the cement that was poured into that foundation is
composed of his younger brother's 37-year record of accomplishment
for the working familes who then and now are the core of this
political dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's observation is quoted approvingly in a doctoral
dissertation at Boston College's history department on that pivotal
1952 race by Thomas J. Whalen that Northeastern's press will bring
out in book form this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Whalen, who teaches at Boston University, has mined a topic
often glossed over in JFK biographies. It's a far better tale than
that. It has intrigue, sharp elbows, and bare knuckles, family and
class struggle, and national meaning for the stage it set.
Kennedy's victory margin, 70,737 out of more than 2.3 million votes
cast, was small enough that every maneuver made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   From the Kennedy side, Whalen makes clear that this was in part
a grudge match. Lodge's grandfather, the legendary isolationist and
vehement conservative who virtually raised him, had beaten JFK's
grandfather, John ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald, in 1916 to win the
state's first popular election of a US senator. Lodge himself would
reappear as Richard Nixon's running mate in 1960. And Edward
Kennedy beat Lodge's son, George, in the '62 Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a complicated story of two men who transcended
dominating ancestors _ by 1952 Lodge, as his own man, had become an
important moderate Republican internationalist; Kennedy, 15 years
younger, was in the process of becoming his own man, though
Whalen's meticulous research shows Joseph P. Kennedy as a central
but not predominant character in the drama.
</P>
<P>
   As narrative, his dissertation is riveting. Lodge was not merely
the most important influence on Dwight D. Eisenhower's decision to
run for president that year; he ran his campaign through the GOP
convention, neglecting his own. Worse, his maneuvers in the defeat
of Mr. Conservative, Senator Robert Taft, earned him the enmity of
``Tafties'' in Massachusetts, most significantly Taft's state
chairman, Basil Brewer, whose right-wing New Bedford Standard Times
endorsed Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   And JFK was uniquely poised to capitalize on this party split as
the much more conservative candidate on foreign policy. People
forget that in those days, Kennedy's anticommunism often veered
into virulence, encompassing both ``who Lost China'' baloney and
domestic witch hunts. Joe McCarthy was both a family friend and a
personal pal from World War II days, and Whalen's tale of his
dissing of Lodge in the campaign's final days and the endorsement
of Kennedy by the red-baiting Boston Post is delicious.
</P>
<P>
   But the '52 election is also crucial as a harbinger of many
things to come. Without benefit of modern crutches like exit polls,
Whalen's analysis of selected precinct voting patterns shows a
victory based on blue-collar voters (we call them working families
today), Catholics, and a swollen turnout in key areas that was
almost certainly largely female. And his research shows how
Kennedy's masterful mix of money, organization, and media molded
this coaliton.
</P>
<P>
   It was personal and political then. It is so much more than that
now because of Edward Kennedy's record. But what hasn't changed is
the attention to political detail that enlivens this account of
1952.
</P>
<P>
   The real story in Massachusetts right now should not be the
tabloid-style humiliation of a would-be candidate. It should be the
state Republican Party's abdication of its public responsibility.
One reason Senator Kennedy has no viable opponent is that he never
forgets his.

<P>
   SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK _ At the new Wuksachi Lodge in Sequoia
National Park, a musty book is tucked in among the reading
selections in the lobby: Hammonds' Illustrated Nature Guide. It
doesn't appear to get much attention from guests, probably because
of its age _ it was published in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Look up the tree species for which this park is famed and you'll
read this entry: ``For how many centuries or millennia our present
sequoias will go on living nobody knows; their chances seem
excellent as they are almost indestructible.''
</P>
<P>
   Irony fairly spills off the page.
</P>
<P>
   Indestructible? Exactly five years before this book was
released, park rangers determined that a sequoia in nearby Giant
Forest Village, leaning ominously, was in danger of flattening some
cabins if it were to topple over. So they lifted the cabins with
jacks, rolled them out of the way, and felled the tree. Cut it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Then they counted rings in the trunk. The tree was more than
2,200 years old. It first poked through the ground and shed its
seed coat in 261 B.C., about the time Roman legions were tangling
with Carthage in the first of the three Punic Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bill Tweed, Sequoia's chief naturalist, can only shake
his head. ``There was a symbol there,'' he said. ``We were cutting
down sequoia trees to make it safe for visitors to come to see
sequoia trees. In the long run, that just didn't add up right.''
</P>
<P>
   The stewardship of the park now conforms to a much different
philosophy, and visitors will notice it the instant they wheel in
among these towering trees _the largest living things on Earth _ in
California's western Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, nearly all the development has been
removed from the Giant Forest Village. Cabins, parking areas, side
roads. Tourist lodging and services were relocated to an area a bit
farther along the road, just past the Lodgepole region, in an area
of pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Wuksachi Lodge, which opened there last spring, accommodates
visitors with 102 rooms, a main lodge building, a restaurant and
bar, a small gift shop. Its most impressive feature: It is safely
removed from any of the sequoia groves that dot these western
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   These are truly magnificent trees. They're not as tall as
redwoods or as old as bristlecone pines, but no organism on the
planet can match its volume. The General Sherman tree here, which
is 275 feet tall and 103 feet around, is estimated to contain
52,500 cubic feet of wood, enough to build 40 houses.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive immune systems enable these trees to grow so tall,
gain such bulk and last so long. Their bark is virtually devoid of
pitch, which creates the equivalent of an asbestos suit, impervious
to fire. Their bark and heart wood is also laced with a bitter
tannin, such that insects attempting to bore in become afflicted
with acute indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these giants have feet of clay _ quite literally. The
sequoia spreads its roots outward in shallow soil, and it has no
tap root. Thus, if its root system is damaged or if its surrounding
soil is eroded, it simply topples over.
</P>
<P>
   The tree can usually hold its own under natural circumstances.
But it faces the fight of its life when trenches for water pipes
are dug nearby, when road beds alter normal drainage, when
pollutants work their way into the surface water. This was the
sequoias' plight after a village was built in their midst in the
early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it was removed over the last three years. A couple of
structures deemed historic remain, notably the market that served
Giant Forest. They're to be converted to a museum and a learning
center, due to open next spring.
</P>
<P>
   In one year's time, the forest has already made a remarkable
recovery. Most of the development in the area had been small cabins
dotted among the trees, not sprawling lodge complexes that would
have required extensive bulldozing. Once the cabins were plucked
out, the ground was smoothed over, covered with mulch, planted with
seedlings and interlaced with irrigation tubing. It regained the
look of natural forest floor rather quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to know if irreversible damage was done by man's
100-year handprint (a tent camp went up in 1899, the last cabins
were removed in 1999). ``Did we do damage that will take a while to
show?'' said Tweed. ``Quite likely, yes. But you have to change
your thinking from human time to sequoia time.''
</P>
<P>
   A given tree might topple prematurely, but that could happen in
100 years, 500 years, he said _ only a fraction of a life that can
span 30 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Tweed does not impose a harsh judgment on his
forebears in the park. ``It's not that people were in any way evil
or shortsighted,'' he said. ``Sometimes it just takes time to see
the impact of what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the development was in the `20s and `30s. We've later
seen that it was located in sensitive areas. When most of the
national parks were in development _ Yosemite, the Old Faithful
area of Yellowstone _ visitation was a fraction of what it is
today. No one knew how mobile the society would become.''
</P>
<P>
   If you visit today, and you venture out on your own in the
sequoia zone, you'll be a member of a distinct minority. Most
tourists, it seems, are content to observe the trees from behind
their windshields on a drive along the Generals Highway, making
only an obligatory stop at the General Sherman tree.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman tree, the largest living thing on Earth, is only
steps from the main road, and has its own parking lot. Visitors who
stop here quickly learn that they can't backpedal far enough to
capture its 275-foot height in their camera viewfinders.
</P>
<P>
   From the edge of the parking area, you can embark on the
Congress Trail, a relatively easy, 2.1-mile loop that is kind of a
sequoia civics lesson _ trees or clusters of trees are named for
such institutions as the presidency, the Senate and the House, and
the individuals honored include William McKinley and Robert E. Lee.
(The Sherman tree honors the Union general who put the torch to the
South because James Wolverton, the cattleman who named it in 1879,
had served under William Tecumseh Sherman in the Civil War.)
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing route that branches off the Congress Trail is
the Trail of the Sequoias. It is a 5.1-mile loop that wends its way
around, under and even through fallen giants, skirts three meadows
and takes in Tharps Log, a cabin built into a hollow fallen sequoia
by an eccentric cattle rancher in the 1800s. (In this literal log
cabin, there are a table, benches, stone fireplace _ and enough
head room for an NBA forward.)
</P>
<P>
   This trail is impeccably maintained and very well marked. You'd
have to work pretty hard to get lost while navigating it. It was
also utterly deserted on a Saturday afternoon in January, just
before the season's snows arrived. Visitors don't seem inclined to
stray far from their cars or the paved roads.
</P>
<P>
   At least the makeover of Sequoia National Park has forced them
to get out of the Giant Forest before they lie down to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   A cross section of the tree sacrificed to tourist comfort in
1950, by the way, is on display today. It is turned on its edge
near the General Sherman tree. Black marks in the rings signify
fires it survived during its lifetime, and a sign chronicles them _
one roughly coinciding with William the Conqueror's arrival in
England, another with Columbus' landfall in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beginning to lean,'' said Tweed. ``The primary cause of
death for sequoia trees is that they eventually fall over. They're
resistant to fire and disease, but they develop balance problems.
Maybe the next year, maybe the next 100 years or 200 years, it was
going to fall over.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the distant future, naturalists will examine the
trunk of a stately giant sequoia that toppled over from natural
causes. Imagine them assessing the rings in the trunk and drawing
these conclusions: Survived fires of 699 and 980, made it through
drought of 1258, recovered from sewer-line trench of 1961 ...
flourished for another three centuries. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Sequoia National Park, which lies south of
Yosemite and due east of Fresno in the western Sierra Nevada, is a
233-mile drive from Los Angeles. After proceeding north via I-5 and
Highways 99 and 65 to Lindsay, the route jogs and twists a bit
before picking up Highway 198 into the mountains and the park;
simply follow the signs for ``Sequoia'' or ``National Park.'' It's
a good idea to allow between four and five hours for this drive,
particularly if there is snow on the sharply curving roadway above
Three Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: Admission to the national park is $10 per vehicle, good
for seven days. It is $5 per person for cyclists and visitors on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: The new Wuksachi Lodge has three room categories,
graduated according to view and space. Rates are $75, $90 and $105
until June 1, at which time they'll rise to $110, $125 and $155 for
the summer peak. Rooms are simply furnished but comfortable, and do
not have TVs. Reservations: (888) 252-5757. Front desk: (559)
565-4070. Web: www.VisitSequoia.com.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The Wuksachi serves breakfast, lunch and dinner in a
vaulted-ceiling dining room with impressive views through picture
windows. The fare is both tasty and reasonably priced _ dinner
items in the $10 to $20 range. Nearby, the Lodgepole market, closed
for renovations through most of the winter, is scheduled to reopen
Saturday. Never leave picnic items locked in your car unattended _
the bear-proof car door or window has yet to be invented.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Lodgepole Visitors Center, which lies between
the Giant Forest and the Wuksachi Lodge, can be reached at (559)
565-3782. The National Park Service maintains an office in Three
Rivers. Phone: (559) 565-3341. Web: www.nps.gov/seki.

ADRIENNE KENNEDY IS FRAGILE AND FEROCIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Adrienne Kennedy has a problem. A visitor wants to sit
in on her playwriting seminar at Harvard, and she really wants to
accommodate. But she frets: What about the students? ``That's a lot
of pressure on them,'' she says, hands fingering an invisible
string of worry beads. ``They're so very. . . .'' She pauses,
sighs. ``They're so very fragile, you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Fragile, in fact, would be a good way to describe the
68-year-old playwright, who at 5-foot-1 weighs in at barely 100
pounds. There's something delicate about her, a sort of dreaminess
that gives her an almost ethereal quality. She tends to get a
faraway look when recalling youthful fantasies about breaking bread
with the Bronte sisters or hanging out with Hemingway at some Paris
bar. Her laugh is gentle, almost girlish.
</P>
<P>
   Her plays, however, are another thing entirely. In a body of
work written over the last four decades, Kennedy has created a
surreal world in which romantic innocents are threatened by the
persistent presence of racism. Rage lurks beneath the surface. Time
is all topsy-turvy. History is fluid. Violence is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   How can the same woman who fusses about her students create such
harrowing dramas? ``It does seem like two different people,''
Kennedy confesses. ``There's the person getting ready to walk out
now and teach, and there's the person who writes the plays. I don't
know that person, although I've come to trust her. I'm a mystery to
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She explores that mystery in ``The Ohio State Murders,'' a
one-act play that opens a two-week run Friday at the Hasty Pudding
Theatre in Cambridge. Produced by the American Repertory Theatre,
it stars Denise Nicholas. In the piece, a writer named Suzanne
Alexander returns to her alma mater to deliver a lecture and, in
the process, unearths the devastating secrets of her own past. ``I
was asked to talk about the violent imagery in my work,'' the
character begins. ``Bloodied heads, severed limbs, dead father,
dead Nazis, dying Jesus.'' By the end of the play, the source of
that imagery is all too clear.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Kennedy to define the source of the violence in her own
work and she hesitates _ at first. After all, she doesn't know the
mysterious woman who writes the mysterious plays. She does allow
that she's always been filled with anxiety and dread. She also
recalls her own shattering experience as an undergraduate at Ohio
State in the early 1950s, when, as one of only a handful of black
students in a gigantic dorm, she was treated like a dust mote
intruding on an all-white decor.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, she remembers the stories she heard on her
mother's lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just a little girl, but I was totally my mother's
confidante,'' she recalls. ``We would sit and talk, very often in
the early evening in the winter, and I know for a fact that my
plays have the same tone as her stories.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of stories? ``Oh, she'd say, `When I was a little
girl, my stepfather was killed crossing a railroad track. He was
electrocuted.' Or she might say, `When I was growing up in
Montezuma (Georgia), black people were not allowed to walk on the
white side of town. One day, I made a mistake, and I walked beyond
the post office, and this white man came out and said, `You little
yellow bastard, what are you doing here?' Stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright quietly repeats more of her mother's sagas, never
raising her voice or altering her calm tone while recalling tales
about ``Whites Only'' signs and segregated drinking fountains and
cemeteries where blacks weren't allowed to have tombstones on their
graves. ``My mother was quite violent in her language, so I grew up
feeling that blacks were hated people. I still feel that way. Very
much so,'' she says gently.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy pauses, then smiles. ``My mother totally had my
attention on those wintry evenings,'' she says. ``To get someone's
attention that way is part of my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Delicate pieces
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Kennedy's plays have captured more attention in
the halls of academe than on the stages of the American theater.
Her work is regularly taught on college campuses, and the
playwright is a frequent guest lecturer at such universities as
Yale and Harvard, where she taught this winter. She has a devoted
academic following, but her experimental plays are rarely produced.
Her first play, ``Funnyhouse of a Negro,'' won an Obie Award in
1964, but she went decades without a New York production until the
Signature Theatre Company devoted an entire season to her work in
1995. Two of her early plays were staged by David Wheeler's Theatre
Company of Boston in the 1960s, but she hasn't been produced
locally since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her plays are very delicate and sensitive pieces of writing,''
says ART artistic director Robert Brustein. ``They're not
blockbusters or powerhouses, so she is not produced that often.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy tries to be philosophical about her career. ``Sometimes
I would become very, very sad _ I think I was the saddest in the
'70s,'' she says. ``But over a period of time, it's become clear
that my plays tend to be taught in colleges and are the subjects of
dissertations and papers at conferences. I've come to be happy and
grateful for that because I could be just totally forgotten.'' A
pause. ``That doesn't mean that when I read that David Mamet is
opening again on Broadway that I don't feel sort of . . . well,
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, the plays reflect the personality of the
playwright. ``She is the work,'' says Marcus Stern, who is
directing the ART production. ``She is both incredibly delicate and
very beautiful with the appropriate amount of rage about racist
atrocities. She is like the quiet watcher who absorbs so much, and
we're not even aware of how much she sees and understands until she
produces it in her plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the playwright has always been demure, even as she was
digesting her mother's stories. Apart from those haunting tales,
Kennedy looks back wistfully to a charmed childhood in Cleveland.
Named after the movie star Adrienne Ames, she and the other
children in her mixed-race neighborhood fell in love with
Hollywood, restaging favorite films in their backyards. Her parents
were college-educated professionals _ her father a social worker,
her mother a teacher _ who were active in civil-rights work; at
home, Kennedy was instilled with a grounding in black culture and
history, and at school, she devoured the classics of European
culture, particularly the romantic poets. ``I was a very quiet
person, and I became very caught up in this idea of being a writer.
I read `Jane Eyre' and I wanted to be Charlotte Bronte. But I never
would have told that to anyone. I was expected to be a second- or
third-grade teacher and that was going to be my life. I kept those
secrets buried inside me, and I guess that heightened it.''
</P>
<P>
   In her autobiography, ``People Who Led to My Plays,'' Kennedy
pays tribute to a broad range of influences, from Langston Hughes
and Lena Horne to Clark Cable and Gene Kelly. But along with the
usual adolescent crushes on movie stars and the occasional poet,
she also harbored a fascination with the dark side of life from an
early age. She admired Abraham Lincoln, but noted that he had ``a
mad wife.'' She cherished a great aunt even though she was
``touched in the head.'' She worshiped glamorous movie stars but
was also perversely fascinated by the Wolf Man, an ordinary fellow
by day who turns into a monster at night. Her daydreams, it seems,
were tempered by dread.
</P>
<P>
   That anxiety heightened at Ohio State, where she was one of only
300 blacks on a campus with about 27,000 students. Accustomed to
the hodgepodge of her Cleveland neighborhood, where her best
friends were a mix of blacks, Jews, and Eastern European
immigrants, she was suddenly an outcast, an Other. Blacks weren't
allowed to join clubs or major in literature. Her dorm mates
sneered or pretended she didn't exist. ``There's violence in that
kind of behavior,'' Kennedy recalls.

BALANCING ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BLUE ANGEL 
By Francine Prose. HarperCollins. 314 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like its step-sibling, the newsroom novel, the academic satire
has always seemed to promise more than it delivers. It's a
wonderfully self-contained genre _ all those ideas and parodies of
ideas, bordered by the hedges of pastoral restraint _and yet the
same qualities, used to ill effect, can make it somewhat beholden
to form. The Brits have set high the bar, what with Kingsley Amis's
seminal ``Lucky Jim'' and David Lodge's hilarious ``Small World.''
But it's taken the American extremities of the past few decades _
protests and deconstructionists and teddy-bear campus love-ins _ to
take the groves of academe to new vistas of poetic possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Francine Prose, no wimp when it comes either to irony or
to scrutiny, and a writer who's presided over her share of college
classrooms. With her formidable analytic mind and her penchant for
bumbling anti-heroes, she knows how to be wicked and literary at
once. Certainly that's a trait her own Ted Swenson would
appreciate, were he given the occasion to encounter it. But he's
trapped running a Beginning Fiction seminar somewhere in the
perilous wilds of upstate Vermont, where the only thing more
troubling than the oppressive ennui of Euston College seems to be
his students' proclivity _ ah, creativity! _ for workshop stories
about bestiality.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get this way overnight, of course, neither
Swenson's own desperate cynicism nor his wannabe novelists'
rhetorical artifice. The critically acclaimed author of a couple of
novels _ his first, ``Blue Angel,'' was inspired by the 1930 German
film classic _ Swenson has been trying for years (he's 47) to live
up to his own promise. But the Muse governing his current
Stendhalian manuscript (tentatively titled ``The Black and the
Black'') is as hauntingly reticent as Euston's rumored ghosts,
lurking in the periphery of one's consciousness but never showing
up at the door. His students, on the other hand, have only age on
their side; they're young and earnest and achingly untalented,
convinced that solipsism and moral superiority are easy
replacements for literary depth. This is the life to which Swenson
has become accustomed, until he stumbles onto the idiosyncratic
literary gifts of a disingenuous, overly pierced woman-child named
Angela Argo _ who, like Marlene Dietrich's Lola Lola, eventually
turns her beleaguered don into a drooling buffoon.
</P>
<P>
   So: Angela's Ashes, in other words, since we know from the first
that this ``Blue Angel,'' like its namesake, is headed for
incendiary ruin. But Prose is too savvy to head straight for
parallelisms. She has instead given us a satire that's also a map
of the entire academic campus _ a place where the metaphors and
endowments are rich, but the more essential resources of integrity
and character are paltry indeed. There are no heroes in ``Blue
Angel,'' save Swenson's wife, Sherrie, who, despite her husband's
shenanigans, is more wiseacre-weary than martyred. Nor are we long
on morally defensible positions: The Cotton Mather-type judges who
condemn Swenson for his idiocies are hardly the peers you'd want to
stand before, from Euston's hypocritical dean to the gender
theorist of what used to be known as the English Lit department.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Prose has given us one hero: literature. It's there in
the shadows of Stendhal and Flaubert and Tolstoi, hovering in the
wings but doing what the Euston ghosts could never do _ affording
someone a reason to go on living, teaching, writing. It's what
drives Swenson, what made him first notice odd little punked-out
Angela when she approached him bearing a battered copy of ``Jane
Eyre.'' ``What I like,'' Angela tells her prof, ``is how pissed off
Jane Eyre is. She's in a rage for the whole novel, and the payoff
is she gets to marry this blind guy who's toasted his wife in the
attic.'' Take that, Mr. Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Angel'' is a wicked novel, but it is also, to its credit,
quite sad; buried amid the jokes and send-ups of a terminally
righteous academic milieu is the more poignant tale of a man whose
foibles have eclipsed his dreams. Abandoned by his own college-age
daughter, scarcely idealized by his beloved wife of two decades,
Swenson sees his own future every day before him: ``Age and death _
the unfairness of it, the daily humiliation of watching your power
vanish just when you figure out how to use it.'' And if that's a
prototypically existential definition of a midlife crisis, there
are far less deadly tonics for it than pursuing a student for whom
you feel equal parts lust and envy. But Swenson's literary fate is
to hurl himself, unshaven and unrepentant, upon that old
metaphorical funeral pyre. What else can a creative writing
professor do? This is a guy who, faced with ignominy and his own
mug in the mirror, reflects upon the tragic falls of Anna K. and
Emma B.
</P>
<P>
   The sweetest prism within ``Blue Angel'' is its multi-layered
comprehension of the truths and falsehoods of fiction; no one who
has given two thoughts to that subject _ as teacher, writer, or
patron _ will fail to relish the parallel between creativity
(writing a novel) and psychosis (imaginary friends, all day long!).
Prose is equally adept at creating the Academic Dinner Party from
Hell, or at least purgatory, where your best bet is to wait it out
_ accompanied by the other regulars trapped at the table,
``simultaneously rescued and menaced by dessert.'' Lacking the
hubris of either Swenson or Angela, Prose has not set out to give
us Stendhal or Flaubert; she has instead managed to be funny,
piercing, and dry as Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Let loose in fiction, intellect has a way of bullying
creativity, and at times in ``Blue Angel'' I felt the heft of
Prose's analytical mind taking over a scene where it ought to have
stayed quiet: where character or psychic dimension, say, would have
been far more revealing than mere humor or allusion. And
occasionally, as Swenson dug himself ever deeper, I found myself
troubled by what the professor himself would call the plausibility
factor: Would a half-decent guy (not to mention tenured professor)
really risk everything, especially for a frail, tattoos 'n' chains
girl whom nobody much likes? Then I remembered the day Monica
Lewinsky's name hit the presses, when my first thought had been
that Bill Clinton couldn't possibly be that stupid.

BUT WHAT IF THE WRITING IS A CRIME, TOO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should we expect a mystery or detective novel to be well
written? If we do, on the whole we will be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   What do we mean when we say a book is well-written anyway? It's
clear? Compelling? Evocative? Showing a sensitivity to words, a
sensitivity that includes an awareness of place, time, class,
ethnicity, nationality, gender, whatever?
</P>
<P>
   Too much of this sensitivity can destroy the narrative drive
that attracts many readers to the genre; too little makes a reader
with any awareness annoyed; being tone deaf kills credibility. Was
Agatha Christie a ``good'' writer, or simply an effective writer
who never lost sight of her main goals: to entertain, to mislead,
to be lean and brief, to sell really, really well?
</P>
<P>
   I was brooding on these questions as I looked over the books
chosen for review in this month's column. Two of them are
well-written by my lights, though they are very different; two are
adequately written to serve their purposes; one is badly written,
and yet I read, and for the most part, liked it. How important to
me, then, is it that a book read well?
</P>
<P>
   Fairly important. Robert Barnard is an old hand at the mystery,
and ``A Murder in Mayfair'' (Scribner, $23) is his 32d mystery. It
is written in his usual clear, calm manner, deceptively simple,
attractively spare, moving in a direct line that still admits
frequent surprises, what Americans often mean when they say a book
is ``very English.'' Barnard once taught English and has written a
biographical study of Christie, and while he does not try to
mislead a reader as she did, he does seek to deceive, very
successfully. Several of his books have been about a person's
discovery that they are not who they believe themselves to be.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Colin Pinnock has become a junior minister in a new
British government, pretty clearly Labour, and among the
congratulatory messages he receives is one that simply asks, ``Who
Do You Think You Are?'' At first he thinks someone is warning him
not to be arrogant, but he soon suspects otherwise, and with
precision and a very dry wit, Barnard takes us on a journey of
discovery with Pinnock that is intriguing and quite satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   A journey of discovery, self- and otherwise, is also at the
heart of ``Lost Girls,'' by Andrew Pyper (Delacorte, $23.95).
Beautifully written, claustrophobic despite being set in a rainy
northern Ontario town that flows outward into a land of deep lakes
and few people, this is a first novel that has done very well in
the author's native Canada. It deserves to be widely read in the
States as well.
</P>
<P>
   A young attorney, Bartholomew Christian Crane, is assigned to
defend a teacher accused on purely circumstantial evidence of
having killed two girls who were the members of the teacher's
``literary society.'' Crane is a habitual user of cocaine, and the
reader cannot be certain whether some of the bizarre occurrences
are real or in his mind. The brooding atmosphere is
well-maintained, and the book is a good bit better than its
dust-cover tag line, ``a novel of psychological terror,'' suggests.
It is frequently quite funny, and there are rewarding character
insights along the way to a resolution that falls just short of
being truly surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midnight at the Camposanto,'' by Mari Ulmer (Poisoned Pen
Press, $23.95), also is a first novel, and while it shows the hands
of a beginner in its rather wooden construction, it also has
frequent attractive set pieces and draws on the ethnic communities
of Taos, N.M., with skill and compassion. It begins with the
killing of a ``penitente,'' relates this to skullduggery at Los
Alamos and, after a rather didactic start, relaxes into a
convincing and intelligent story about interesting people.
</P>
<P>
   Don Flynn writes a punchy prose meant to imitate deadline
journalism, quite successfully in his ``Fitz'' Fitzgerald mystery,
``A Brand X Murder'' (St. Martin's Minotaur, $23.95). Fitzgerald
works for the New York ``Daily Press.'' A good friend, Bobo Watson,
piano player, is murdered. Fitz is assigned a nothing story by his
city editor and feels he must investigate the murder instead, and
though he makes a remarkable number of mistakes, he finally solves
the mystery. The writing is of the old ``Black Mask'' style in
which body blows go ``Thunk!'' in conscious homage to a time now
gone. I'm not sure whether the style is a sendup or not, but I
enjoyed it.
</P>
<P>
   I am even less certain about Christopher Reich's stylistic
intentions in ``The Runner'' (Delacorte, $26.95), in which a
sedentary interrogator for the International Military Tribunal,
charged with investigating and trying war crimes at the end of
World War II, searches for Erich Seyss, an elite member of Hitler's
SS, a former Olympic sprinter, who escapes from an American
prisoner-of-war camp in order to carry out a mysterious but clearly
peace-destroying final mission. Real people play important roles
here, including General George Patton and OSS Director ``Wild
Bill'' Donovan.
</P>
<P>
   The language often seems ill-considered, Seyss escapes far too
many times, one is inclined to conclude that the interrogator,
Judge Devlin, is only barely competent, yet one keeps reading. I
guess that's what this game is all about.

   !! ``Cotton Mary'' Madhur Jaffrey is haunting as a woman of
Anglo-Indian parentage pathetically seeking to identify with Brits
who have no sympathy for her at the end of colonialism. But Ismail

her to make the film seem anything more than overextended domestic
drama. (R) &QL;

out of control, he joins a men's therapy group and falls for Sandra
Bullock, an offbeat nurse who helps temper his fears. (R) (Loren

appealing performers woefully undersupplied. Leelee Sobieski is a
romantic local girl, Chris Klein is a rich twit who destroys her
family's diner and is sentenced to stick around and rebuild it,
Josh Hartnett is the local boy she drops. Dated moves and a cop-out
ending put this one out of the running. (PG-13) &QL;

around him, but it's his acrobatics in the fight scenes that make
the rest of the film worth sitting through. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Such a Long Journey'' The first film made in India by an
Icelandic director (Sturla Gunnarsson) has a satisfying weight and
amplitude. It's built around Roshan Seth's performance as a
refined, humane Bombay family man trying to get by, despite some
treacherous problems of loyalty and politics on the eve of India's
1971 war with Pakistan. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !! ``Waking the Dead'' This worthy attempt to fuse the politics
of the '70s and '80s with a ghostly love story can't successfully
pull its parts together into a satisfying whole. It settles for
being a mood piece, with Jennifer Connelly's half-saintly,
half-smug crusader tantalizing Billy Crudup's idealistic young
lawyer turned pol, trying not to fall victim to his own pragmatism.
(R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
! ``Whatever It Takes'' The producers of this would-be teen comedy,
in the apparent belief that it doesn't take much to succeed in this
business, settle for formulaic who'll-take-whom-to-the-prom stuff.
With its girl's-locker-room scene and brain-dead mayhem, it's
novocaine for the eyes. (PG-13)

WHEN INTERNET GAMBLING BECOMES A PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Internet making gambling in everything from Las
Vegas-style games to the stock market more accessible, agencies
combating problem gambling are going online to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5.5 percent of the US adult population will
experience compulsive or problem gambling at some point in their
lives, according to officials from various gaming councils. And
average gambling debts can reach into the tens of thousands of
dollars, they say.
</P>
<P>
   That makes problem gambling one of the most extreme examples of
personal finance out of control. Overall, Americans spend an
estimated $600 billion a year gambling.
</P>
<P>
   With up to 700 Internet gambling sites, the situation can only
get worse for those at risk, say worried officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can now gamble from your home or office any time of day or
night,'' said Dana Forman, associate program director for the
Massachusetts Council on Compulsive Gambling. ``It's going to be so
easy to destroy yourself. It's like an alcoholic living in a
barroom.''
</P>
<P>
   And with technology allowing instantaneous stock market trades,
officials also worry about gambling in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day trading on the Internet is exactly like, or much akin to,
gambling,'' said Forman. ``The idea that someone can make sudden
riches in minutes _ it's the same kind of idea that a problem
gambler might have.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter the increasing availability of opportunities to
gamble, whether online or offline, groups combating problem
gambling have set up Internet sites to help problem and compulsive
gamblers and their families. (Problem gamblers are defined as
experiencing one or two negative consequences as a result of
gambling, while compulsive gamblers experience several, often
severe, consequences.)
</P>
<P>
   Some sites feature self-scoring tests to diagnose gambling
problems, whether those experienced by teenagers betting on sports
games, adults wagering on Las Vegas-style games, or Internet users
day trading in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites provide referrals to treatment centers, support
groups, and certified gambling counselors, and access to other
resources. And one site geared to problem gamblers trying to resist
temptation allows visitors to print out a form that will have their
credit or debit cards automatically rejected by casino cash
machines.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one resource you probably won't see listed on sites
providing help to problem gamblers: low-cost credit counseling
services that consolidate debt and negotiate better payment terms.
That's because one of the Gamblers Anonymous principles of recovery
for compulsive or problem gamblers is to refuse any form of debt
renegotiation or forgiveness, said Marvin Steinberg, executive
director of the Connecticut Council on Gambling Problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gamblers Anonymous feels that can function as a bailout for
the gambler,'' said Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Forman agreed: ``You cannot cure a gambling problem by curing
the debt. You must work on the gambling first.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some relevant Web sites:
</P>
<P>
   --www.masscompulsivegambling
</P>
<P>
   .org: This site by the state-funded Massachusetts Council on
Compulsive Gambling lists outpatient treatment programs at which

for a March 30-31 and April 6-7 course on ``Understanding,
Assessing, and Treating Compulsive Gambling'' or an April 14
session on adolescent and college-age gambling called ``March
Madness: April Sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   --www.800gambler.org: Run by the Council on Compulsive Gambling
of New Jersey, this site allows you to sign up for a monthly e-mail
update, participate in online polls on compulsive gambling or
online trading, and read newsletters about senior citizens and
gambling. The organization's 1999 statistics from its 24-hour help
line are scheduled to be posted by April 1. 1998 statistics showed
help-line callers had average gambling debts of $38,030, when their
average annual income was only $36,134.

USE CAUTION ON RISKIER FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. I am debating what to do with this fund, since it has not
done well lately. I was considering rolling the 401(k) into an IRA
in Janus Enterprise and Janus Global Life Science and Janus Global
Technology, and possibly into a couple of the PBHG funds.
</P>
<P>
   R.H., San Diego, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. So Vanguard's Index 500 hasn't done much for you lately?
After five consecutive years of annual returns in excess of 20
percent, ranging as high as 37.4 percent in 1995, you've decided
the champ has fallen. As this is written, the fund has a 1.93
percent year-to-date total return, although it was indeed in the
red in the early months of the year. Including this year's stumble,
the five-year record shows 26.92 percent average annual growth.
</P>
<P>
   As the hillbilly comic Jerry Clower used to say, I think you're
fixing to mess up.
</P>
<P>
   Very simply, you need to view that five-year performance as
extraordinary and recognize that the future will bring considerably
lower _ but nonetheless solid _ returns. Certainly, if you had gone
back through those past five years and sought out the hottest
sectors of the market, investing in them would have produced better
results. But if you had guessed or calculated wrong as to when a
particular sector would shine, you probably would have done worse
than the broad market average that the Index 500 fund tracks so
well. This year and last, the hot sector has been technology, and
not surprisingly many of the funds you have identified tend to
focus in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Although these funds' recent results have been spectacular, led
by the 211.6 percent 1999 returns of Janus Global Technology, you
have to remember that along with such returns comes a lot of risk.
The portfolio price-to-earnings ratios of the Janus funds you
mention go as high as 58.1 (for Janus Global Technology), compared
to 37.3 for the Index 500 fund. Needless to say, in sour markets
the portfolio, which is backed by a good stream of cash earnings,
is likely to hold up better than a portfolio of stocks that have
been valued based on unproved prospects of strong future earnings,
rather than an established record.
</P>
<P>
   Let's put it another way. The funds you are looking at can add a
lot of spark to a portfolio, but they are simply too risky for most
people to bet the farm on. That's why most investors who use such
funds limit them to small percentages of their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you leave the lion's share of the 401(k) money in the
solid, boring, old Vanguard Index 500, putting no more than a total
of 25 percent in these spirited but risky funds. I'd put 12.5
percent each into Janus Global Life Sciences and Janus Global
Technology, thereby at least dividing your bets between two market
sectors, health care and technology.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've been less than satisfied with my 401(k) plan and have
decided to move 95 percent of my contributions to the large-cap
index fund and 5 percent to the international fund. Should I change
the allocation of my 401(k) funds based on my other investments?
</P>
<P>
   A.B., Boston &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, right off the bat, I would reverse your savings
pattern. Currently you are putting taxable money into the riskier
sector-dominated funds that you were formerly using in your 401(k)
account, and you are now are putting your tax-deferred money into
broad-based funds. As a general rule, index and broad-based funds
will be more tax-efficient than funds that focus on a particular
market sector. If you are going to invest in the more narrowly
defined funds that you now have in your taxable accounts, it stands
to reason that you consider that these sector plays will deliver
above-average long-term results but will be balanced by the steady
performance of the stock index fund.
</P>
<P>
   So why not reverse the procedure, putting the entire $1,250 a
month that is now going into the taxable accounts into a Standard
and Poor's Index 500 fund, such as Fidelity Market Index or
Vanguard Index 500? The taxable distributions of sector-oriented
funds tend to be substantial and unpredictable, whereas those of
index funds more moderate and slightly more predictable. Moreover,
if you hold these sector plays within the 401(k), you will be in a
position to sell the holdings with no immediate-term tax effect
when the sector appears to you to have had its run.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, I would suggest that you diversify your portfolio a
bit more by resuming small contributions to the Davis New York
Venture fund within the 401(k). This would give you some exposure
to the value end of the market. I'd also keep my eye on Davis
Financial fund, but would withhold contributions at this time. The
price-to-earnings ratio of 19.2 for this funds portfolio is
attractive, but its 4.5 price-to-book ratio still gives me pause.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect of all of these moves would be that you would put
your entire $1,250 monthly contribution to taxable accounts into a
stock index fund, move all contributions to the funds you now have
in taxable accounts to the 401(k) account, dollar for dollar,
maintain your $75 monthly contribution to the international stock
fund in the 410(k), and contribute $100 and $75 a month,
respectively, to the stock index and New York Venture accounts in
the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all I'm suggesting is moving 5 percent of the
contributions from the stock index fund to Davis New York Value,
but changing the tax status of your investments should pay big
dividends over the years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be 70 on Oct. 15 and will take my IRA withdrawal this
year, so as to avoid two withdrawals in 2001. It is the math I am
concerned with. I am a widow, so I have my three children as my
beneficiaries, who will be 46, 49, and 51 when I turn 70. Does the
IRA figure these ages into the formula, or do they just use me? I
don't really need the money that will be represented by the IRA
withdrawals. Maybe I should give each child $10,000 per year. What
do you think?
</P>
<P>
   M.W., Madison, Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With multiple IRA beneficiaries, the rules require that you
focus on the oldest for the purpose of determining the joint and
several life expectancy. Moreover, if the eldest beneficiary is
more than 10 years younger than you are, you must for the purposes
of calculating the mandatory distribution treat that person as
being only 10 years younger.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if you take your first distribution this year, you would
look at the ages 70 and 60 and determine that the balance of your
IRA accounts would be divided by 26.2 to determine the required
distribution. Each subsequent year, the level of the divisor falls,
and accordingly the amount of your required withdrawal will rise.
</P>
<P>
   However, the requirement for mandatory withdrawals involves the
year in which you reach age 70 1/2 rather than 70. You need take no
distribution at all this year. You will reach 70 1/2 on April 15,
2001, and you are not required to receive the first distribution
until April 1 of the year following attainment of that age.
</P>
<P>
   You could delay the first distribution for another 11 1/2
months. But then you would (as you correctly note) end up taking
two withdrawals in tax year 2002: one for the year 2001 in which
you turned 70 1/2 and another for tax year 2002. It would probably
be best to take a distribution in 2001, with a single distribution
in each subsequent year.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether you would be better off giving each
child $10,000 a year _ which would trigger no gift tax consequences
_ involves a lot of variables that go beyond taxes. They include
but are not limited to the question of whether you feel they would
be better off with a series of gifts over many years or access to a
larger pool later on, when they are closer to their own
retirements.
</P>
<P>
   If each of your children inherits a third of your IRA, they must
continue taking distributions at least as rapidly as you were
taking them.
</P>
<P>
   Note: I have answered your question directly, but there are also
other ways to determine IRA distributions and/or establish bequests
to your children, and it may pay for you to go to discuss them with
a tax professional.

E-CULTURE FORGETS TO PLAY NICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I pick up my phone, and some 30-year-old starts yelling at
me,'' sputters the executive, whose indignation brings him out of
his chair. ``I find it incomprehensible that people can operate
this way. They're screaming monsters. Brats!''
</P>
<P>
   The executive is in his late forties and running a hot
e-business where he cultivates a collegiality not always shared by
clients and associates outside the company. He's a savvy pro with
the energy of a 30-year-old himself who walks the walk, dresses in
Friday casual all week, and would never be confused with the old
economy. Yet, he's offended by the brashness resounding through the
technological land and the sense that rudeness is OK, even
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet shouldn't be any different from any other
business,'' he says. ``We're not curing cancer here.''
</P>
<P>
   He works on the front lines of the culture clash, where his
complaint resonates as deeply as it offends. To e-culture boosters,
and there are many, such gripes are an exaggeration, or sour
grapes, or a misreading of the speed and intensity required by
anyone _ young, old, or in-between _ who wishes to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a race,'' says Steve Schwartz, cofounder of
Schwartz Communications, which does public relations for many of
the entrepreneurs driving the economic boom. ``They've got a radar
lock on their goals. I find that exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they don't always return phone calls the way their
predecessors did 10 or 15 years ago. ``No return means `I'm not
interested, but I don't have the time to call you to tell you I'm
not interested,' '' Schwartz explains. ``That's becoming
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to Judy Bowman, head of Protocol Consultants International
in South Hamilton, Mass., purveyor of civility to the corporate
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for not returning a call,'' she says.
``With voice mail, you can always call back and leave a message
when you know someone is at lunch, and at least get credit for
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   But even expedient politeness takes time. And when a business
can mature in weeks, and when fortunes can be made or lost in
minutes, niceties are no longer a priority in many quarters. The
business world speaks in the shorthand of the zone known as
``Internet time,'' where too much is happening too fast and often
all at once: e-mail, faxes, IPOs, mergers, acquisitions, growth,
relationships that once took years to build, and decisions that
once required at least a night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   While entrepreneurs have always been hard-driving, today's crop
is pressing even harder because of this pace and the competition,
also proliferating at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ready, fire _ aim!'' says David Blohm, describing
decision-making in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Blohm is president and CEO of SmarterKids.com, an online
educational store with headquarters in Needham, Mass.. Blohm, who
founded another company in the mid-1980s, says the atmosphere today
is ``significantly more stressful.'' He doesn't see this as
rudeness, but simply the way business is done.
</P>
<P>
   But is there a cost _ if not for Blohm, who's a success, then
for the up-and-comer straining to reach the top?
</P>
<P>
   ``People are out of control,'' says an entrepreneur who founded
his first businesses 20 years ago and now runs an online financial
services company. ``There used to be a line between aggressive and
obnoxious. I think that line has been moved. There is so much money
being put down now and the stakes are so much higher that this is
driving people to do things in business they might not do in their
personal lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He finds that business relationships are short-term. ``Somebody
will be red-hot to work with you, and when the project is over,
that's it. You never hear from them again.''
</P>
<P>
   A business school administrator who mentors entrepreneurs says
they have little time for friendships:
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who sleep in the office. What you hear about
is the 50 percent who make it. But there's the 50 percent who don't
make it. Everybody's going to the Indy 500, but nobody's looking at
those crashes on the side of the road.''
</P>
<P>
   He feels that ``some people are trading off their souls.'' He
asks the question that might well become a bumper sticker for this
economic age: Is the money worth it?

CHANGES NEEDED TO BETTER COMBAT POVERTY IN LATIN AMERICA, U.S.
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Monday
that he favors sweeping changes in the way international aid
organizations combat poverty in Latin America amid signs that
robust economic growth there has left more people behind than many
economists expected.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, in a speech to Latin American finance ministers and
development experts at the annual meeting of the Inter-American
Development Bank, said the United States wants the bank to do a
``full review'' of its lending programs, raise the interest rates
it charges its wealthiest borrowers and adopt more effective ways
of raising education levels and fighting poverty. The
Washington-based bank, which is funded by the major industrial
nations, makes about $7 billion in development loans to Latin
America each year. Along with lending by the World Bank, it is the
main vehicle for the United States and other wealthy nations to
help alleviate poverty in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and other major Latin American
countries are performing better economically than most economists
anticipated a year ago, poverty and inequality have stayed
stubbornly high, and by some measures may even be increasing, bank
officials and development experts here said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the persistent income gap threatens the consensus that
has brought Latin American economies closer together in the past
decade, especially at a time when globalization is under attack by
labor unions and some private interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America's economic success in recent years has not been
associated with a reduction in inequality,'' Summers said in an
interview. ``The pressing economic problem for Latin America is to
create an environment in which all have a chance to benefit from
growth.''

MOYERS PUTS HUMAN FACE TO DEPRESSING ECONOMIC REALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Moyers has done it again. Over the years, he has earned a
reputation and a growing fandom among televiewers for revealing the
real-life human dramas behind America's most impersonal statistics.
He does this, moreover, in good taste _ without pandering or
preaching.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Moyers fan, or if you just like an honest,
undoctored, unslanted picture of American life as it's really being
lived, here's a special treat.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, PBS will present what may be Moyers' very best work
to date. ``Surviving the Good Times'' is an absorbing 90-minute
chronicle of current American life, 10 years in the making. Look
for this piece and tune it in. I predict you'll be rewarded. This
isn't escape stuff, but you'll find it far more gripping than
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   It's the true story of two fairly typical American working
families, in the 1990s, told in their own words and filmed exactly
as it was happening.
</P>
<P>
   You watch the children grow and the young parents become
middle-aged. You experience the gamut of their human emotions _
their elation when the eldest goes on to college, the near-panic as
a bank threatens foreclosure on the family home, the strains on the
marital bonds caused by a husband's declining self-esteem when his
wife has to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   This is real. It could follow no script. The stories of these
two middle-income families, the Neumanns and the Stanleys, unfold
with the honest vicissitudes of real life. They begin in the summer
of 1991 in Milwaukee when two old-line manufacturing companies
dismiss much of their workforce, one to move its workshops to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Tony and Terry Neumann are white; Claude and Jackie Stanley
African-American. Both have children. Set adrift by the layoffs,
each works hard to recover lost ground. After 10 years of
intermittent unemployment, extra schooling, second jobs and family
forays into entrepreneurship, both are struggling to regain the
economic status they enjoyed when the decade began.
</P>
<P>
   To reveal more of what happens would spoil the suspense. But be
prepared for poignant, funny and triumphant moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surviving the Good Times'' will make you think. Here, in
graphic human detail, is the overlooked story. The grim reality
behind the giddy statistics of soaring stock market values, overall
economic growth, low unemployment and stable prices includes the
declining lot of many hardworking households as familiar industrial
jobs with secure salaries and benefits continue to disappear.
Average wage earning families have a difficult struggle keeping
their heads above water.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Wilde once wrote that a mark of the truly educated person
is to be deeply moved by statistics. But most people comprehend a
statistic better if it wears a human face. Moyers' latest
production provides the faces.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Bill Moyers makes no political argument
about what should be done. I'll offer none here. Solutions can come
only when we understand the dimension of the very real problem
faced today by America's working men and women. Here, from studies
by the Economic Policy Institute and other think tanks probing the
financial health of America's labor force, are a few hard facts:
</P>
<P>
   _ During the '90s, while the real income of the upper
one-twentieth of America's families grew by 15 percent, real hourly
wages, measured against inflation, fell by four percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Among workforce members without a college education, average
real wages plunged from $11.21 an hour in 1973 to $8.22 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even people with four years of college enjoy slightly less
buying power in hourly compensation ($18.38) than they had in 1973
($18.60). Only those with master's degrees and above are averaging
more than their counterparts one generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ To compensate for lost buying power, middle-income families
work 256 more hours yearly than in 1979. The average working wife
today spends 15 hours a week more on the job than she did in 1979.
One of the things we see in this film is the added strain and
stress this puts on the raising of a family.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty-nine million Americans (one in five) live in households
that regularly have trouble meeting at least one important family
need, such as food, electricity or medicine.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is more job anxiety in the workplace today. In 1992,
even with the recession, only about 17 percent said they were
afraid of losing their jobs. By 1997, that figure had risen to 46
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forty-five million Americans today have no health insurance
and approximately 30 million more are inadequately covered. The
percentage of those without is rising steadily as more and more
corporations downsize their workforces and outsource their work to
satellite companies to avoid the costs of providing coverage to
their employees.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is imposing more stress on American families.
Outsourcing, downsizing, and moving to other countries for cheap
labor tell America's working people, ``You're on your own!'' What
has happened to the old basic American idea that we're all in this
together?
</P>
<P>
   Every business entity in this country has three types of
stakeholders. Two of them are not stockholders. They are the
company's workforce, and its customers. Without them, no business
could exist. Ultimately, business itself must rise or fall upon the
buying power that permits people who work for a living to purchase
the goods and services that America's businesses turn out. Moyers
doesn't bore us with these statistical arguments. He lets the human
story tell itself.

NRA'S OFFICIAL LINE DISTORTS FOUNDING FATHERS INTENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Warren Burger blasted the National Rifle Association on
nationwide television for perpetrating a ``fraud'' on the American
people by spreading disinformation about the Second Amendment to
the U.S. Constitution, a lot of eyes were opened.
</P>
<P>
   But that 1991 shot heard round the nation didn't shut the mouths
of the gun lobbyists. They continued to bombard the people with
their fallacious flak about the Second Amendment's guaranteeing
every individual American the right to possess and transport guns.
And the beat goes on today.
</P>
<P>
   Say it isn't so and true believers come out of walls, all
singing the same songs, all chanting the same verses of the NRA's
official line, all mouthing, mailing or e-mailing the same
distortions of the reasoning of Messrs. John Jay, Alexander
Hamilton and James Madison.
</P>
<P>
   In urging those who challenge their gun-rant to read or re-read
the ``Federalist Papers,'' Charlton Heston's fellow travelers
really do serious injury to their cause. A few years ago that might
have given some gun control advocates pause because it would have
meant a trip to the library and a lot of leafing through thick
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   But in this day of PC proliferation, one can pull up the
thoughts of the founders who published their views on various
aspects of the Constitution _ that they were putting the finishing
touches on _ under the pseudonym ``Publius'' with just a few rodent
clicks.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't require the intellectual firepower or erudition of a
Harvard constitutional scholar to discern what those Publius guys
were trying to do. They were attempting to convince the
Anti-Federalists, who were fearful of a standing federal army, that
they could still have their state militias.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with a mind that has not been supersaturated with NRA
rhetoric and has no vested interest in perpetuating the fraudulent
view that the Second Amendment speaks to personal gun ownership can
readily discern that.
</P>
<P>
   But don't take the word of a lowly journalist about that. Rewind
to that evening in 1991 when on the ``McNeil-Lehrer Report'' the
former Chief Justice of the United States took aim at the NRA's
Second Amendment disinformation campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative, gun-owning, Richard Nixon appointee, who is
now deceased, described the Second Amendment as ``the subject of
one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word `fraud,' on
the American people by a special interest group that I have ever
seen in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   As though to make it clear what he meant by fraud, Burger added
that the NRA ``has misled the American people and they, I regret to
say, they have had far too much influence on the Congress of the
United States than as a citizen I would like to see _ and I am a
gun man.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were strong words coming from a jurist who was the soul of
restraint. But those words were in keeping with thoughts he had
expressed in writing previously, most notably in a Parade magazine
article in January 1990. In layman's terms, Burger presented the
historical context in which the Second Amendment evolved, stressing
that it sprang from the fear of some of the founding fathers that
the creation of a standing national army would lead to dismantling
the state militias.
</P>
<P>
   The militias of the 18th century, contrary to what some gun
enthusiasts say today, did not consist of ``the whole people.''
They were groups of volunteers who met certain requirements and
trained on a more or less regular basis under officers designated
by the various states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real purpose of the Second Amendment,'' wrote Burger,
``was to insure that the `state armies' _ `the militia' _ would be
maintained for the defense of the state... The very language of the
Second Amendment refutes any argument that it was intended to
guarantee every citizen an unfettered right to any kind of weapon
he or she desires.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that Americans do not have the right to
possess bullet-spewing hardware. That right is assumed. But the
Constitution neither gives it nor takes it away.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Second Amendment is misused to fog up
discussions about gun control legislation. It has been degraded to
the level of a sound bite, a bumper sticker and an inscription on
souvenir porcelain plate bearing Heston's image that is for sale
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly these Second Amendment allusions, like Heston's plate,
are about money. It provides a rationale to oppose gun control
legislation and keep the contributions rolling in from the NRA, the
gun makers and the gun retailers.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that collectors, hunters and persons who enjoy
legitimate gun sports are in no peril of losing their rights to do
those things. But the Second Amendment has nothing to do with it.
There is a word for what anyone who argues that it does is
committing. And the late Warren Burger used it.

   SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK _ At the new Wuksachi Lodge in Sequoia
National Park, a musty book is tucked in among the reading
selections in the lobby: Hammonds' Illustrated Nature Guide. It
doesn't appear to get much attention from guests, probably because
of its age _ it was published in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Look up the tree species for which this park is famed and you'll
read this entry: ``For how many centuries or millennia our present
sequoias will go on living nobody knows; their chances seem
excellent as they are almost indestructible.''
</P>
<P>
   Irony fairly spills off the page.
</P>
<P>
   Indestructible? Exactly five years before this book was
released, park rangers determined that a sequoia in nearby Giant
Forest Village, leaning ominously, was in danger of flattening some
cabins if it were to topple over. So they lifted the cabins with
jacks, rolled them out of the way, and felled the tree. Cut it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Then they counted rings in the trunk. The tree was more than
2,200 years old. It first poked through the ground and shed its
seed coat in 261 B.C., about the time Roman legions were tangling
with Carthage in the first of the three Punic Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bill Tweed, Sequoia's chief naturalist, can only shake
his head. ``There was a symbol there,'' he said. ``We were cutting
down sequoia trees to make it safe for visitors to come to see
sequoia trees. In the long run, that just didn't add up right.''
</P>
<P>
   The stewardship of the park now conforms to a much different
philosophy, and visitors will notice it the instant they wheel in
among these towering trees _the largest living things on Earth _ in
California's western Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, nearly all the development has been
removed from the Giant Forest Village. Cabins, parking areas, side
roads. Tourist lodging and services were relocated to an area a bit
farther along the road, just past the Lodgepole region, in an area
of pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Wuksachi Lodge, which opened there last spring, accommodates
visitors with 102 rooms, a main lodge building, a restaurant and
bar, a small gift shop. Its most impressive feature: It is safely
removed from any of the sequoia groves that dot these western
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   These are truly magnificent trees. They're not as tall as
redwoods or as old as bristlecone pines, but no organism on the
planet can match its volume. The General Sherman tree here, which
is 275 feet tall and 103 feet around, is estimated to contain
52,500 cubic feet of wood, enough to build 40 houses.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive immune systems enable these trees to grow so tall,
gain such bulk and last so long. Their bark is virtually devoid of
pitch, which creates the equivalent of an asbestos suit, impervious
to fire. Their bark and heart wood is also laced with a bitter
tannin, such that insects attempting to bore in become afflicted
with acute indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these giants have feet of clay _ quite literally. The
sequoia spreads its roots outward in shallow soil, and it has no
tap root. Thus, if its root system is damaged or if its surrounding
soil is eroded, it simply topples over.
</P>
<P>
   The tree can usually hold its own under natural circumstances.
But it faces the fight of its life when trenches for water pipes
are dug nearby, when road beds alter normal drainage, when
pollutants work their way into the surface water. This was the
sequoias' plight after a village was built in their midst in the
early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it was removed over the last three years. A couple of
structures deemed historic remain, notably the market that served
Giant Forest. They're to be converted to a museum and a learning
center, due to open next spring.
</P>
<P>
   In one year's time, the forest has already made a remarkable
recovery. Most of the development in the area had been small cabins
dotted among the trees, not sprawling lodge complexes that would
have required extensive bulldozing. Once the cabins were plucked
out, the ground was smoothed over, covered with mulch, planted with
seedlings and interlaced with irrigation tubing. It regained the
look of natural forest floor rather quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to know if irreversible damage was done by man's
100-year handprint (a tent camp went up in 1899, the last cabins
were removed in 1999). ``Did we do damage that will take a while to
show?'' said Tweed. ``Quite likely, yes. But you have to change
your thinking from human time to sequoia time.''
</P>
<P>
   A given tree might topple prematurely, but that could happen in
100 years, 500 years, he said _ only a fraction of a life that can
span 30 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Tweed does not impose a harsh judgment on his
forebears in the park. ``It's not that people were in any way evil
or shortsighted,'' he said. ``Sometimes it just takes time to see
the impact of what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the development was in the `20s and `30s. We've later
seen that it was located in sensitive areas. When most of the
national parks were in development _ Yosemite, the Old Faithful
area of Yellowstone _ visitation was a fraction of what it is
today. No one knew how mobile the society would become.''
</P>
<P>
   If you visit today, and you venture out on your own in the
sequoia zone, you'll be a member of a distinct minority. Most
tourists, it seems, are content to observe the trees from behind
their windshields on a drive along the Generals Highway, making
only an obligatory stop at the General Sherman tree.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman tree, the largest living thing on Earth, is only
steps from the main road, and has its own parking lot. Visitors who
stop here quickly learn that they can't backpedal far enough to
capture its 275-foot height in their camera viewfinders.
</P>
<P>
   From the edge of the parking area, you can embark on the
Congress Trail, a relatively easy, 2.1-mile loop that is kind of a
sequoia civics lesson _ trees or clusters of trees are named for
such institutions as the presidency, the Senate and the House, and
the individuals honored include William McKinley and Robert E. Lee.
(The Sherman tree honors the Union general who put the torch to the
South because James Wolverton, the cattleman who named it in 1879,
had served under William Tecumseh Sherman in the Civil War.)
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing route that branches off the Congress Trail is
the Trail of the Sequoias. It is a 5.1-mile loop that wends its way
around, under and even through fallen giants, skirts three meadows
and takes in Tharps Log, a cabin built into a hollow fallen sequoia
by an eccentric cattle rancher in the 1800s. (In this literal log
cabin, there are a table, benches, stone fireplace _ and enough
head room for an NBA forward.)
</P>
<P>
   This trail is impeccably maintained and very well marked. You'd
have to work pretty hard to get lost while navigating it. It was
also utterly deserted on a Saturday afternoon in January, just
before the season's snows arrived. Visitors don't seem inclined to
stray far from their cars or the paved roads.
</P>
<P>
   At least the makeover of Sequoia National Park has forced them
to get out of the Giant Forest before they lie down to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   A cross section of the tree sacrificed to tourist comfort in
1950, by the way, is on display today. It is turned on its edge
near the General Sherman tree. Black marks in the rings signify
fires it survived during its lifetime, and a sign chronicles them _
one roughly coinciding with William the Conqueror's arrival in
England, another with Columbus' landfall in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beginning to lean,'' said Tweed. ``The primary cause of
death for sequoia trees is that they eventually fall over. They're
resistant to fire and disease, but they develop balance problems.
Maybe the next year, maybe the next 100 years or 200 years, it was
going to fall over.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the distant future, naturalists will examine the
trunk of a stately giant sequoia that toppled over from natural
causes. Imagine them assessing the rings in the trunk and drawing
these conclusions: Survived fires of 699 and 980, made it through
drought of 1258, recovered from sewer-line trench of 1961 ...
flourished for another three centuries. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
IF YOU GO:
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Sequoia National Park, which lies south of
Yosemite and due east of Fresno in the western Sierra Nevada, is a
233-mile drive from Los Angeles. After proceeding north via I-5 and
Highways 99 and 65 to Lindsay, the route jogs and twists a bit
before picking up Highway 198 into the mountains and the park;
simply follow the signs for ``Sequoia'' or ``National Park.'' It's
a good idea to allow between four and five hours for this drive,
particularly if there is snow on the sharply curving roadway above
Three Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: Admission to the national park is $10 per vehicle, good
for seven days. It is $5 per person for cyclists and visitors on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: The new Wuksachi Lodge has three room categories,
graduated according to view and space. Rates are $75, $90 and $105
until June 1, at which time they'll rise to $110, $125 and $155 for
the summer peak. Rooms are simply furnished but comfortable, and do
not have TVs. Reservations: (888) 252-5757. Front desk: (559)
565-4070. Web: www.VisitSequoia.com.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The Wuksachi serves breakfast, lunch and dinner in a
vaulted-ceiling dining room with impressive views through picture
windows. The fare is both tasty and reasonably priced _ dinner
items in the $10 to $20 range. Nearby, the Lodgepole market, closed
for renovations through most of the winter, is scheduled to reopen
Saturday. Never leave picnic items locked in your car unattended _
the bear-proof car door or window has yet to be invented.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Lodgepole Visitors Center, which lies between
the Giant Forest and the Wuksachi Lodge, can be reached at (559)
565-3782. The National Park Service maintains an office in Three
Rivers. Phone: (559) 565-3341. Web: www.nps.gov/seki.

pitch, which creates the equivalent of an asbestos suit, impervious
to fire. Their bark and heart wood is also laced with a bitter
tannin, such that insects attempting to bore in become afflicted
with acute indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these giants have feet of clay _ quite literally. The
sequoia spreads its roots outward in shallow soil, and it has no
tap root. Thus, if its root system is damaged or if its surrounding
soil is eroded, it simply topples over.
</P>
<P>
   The tree can usually hold its own under natural circumstances.
But it faces the fight of its life when trenches for water pipes
are dug nearby, when road beds alter normal drainage, when
pollutants work their way into the surface water. This was the
sequoias' plight after a village was built in their midst in the
early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it was removed over the last three years. A couple of
structures deemed historic remain, notably the market that served
Giant Forest. They're to be converted to a museum and a learning
center, due to open next spring.
</P>
<P>
   In one year's time, the forest has already made a remarkable
recovery. Most of the development in the area had been small cabins
dotted among the trees, not sprawling lodge complexes that would
have required extensive bulldozing. Once the cabins were plucked
out, the ground was smoothed over, covered with mulch, planted with
seedlings and interlaced with irrigation tubing. It regained the
look of natural forest floor rather quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to know if irreversible damage was done by man's
100-year handprint (a tent camp went up in 1899, the last cabins
were removed in 1999). ``Did we do damage that will take a while to
show?'' said Tweed. ``Quite likely, yes. But you have to change
your thinking from human time to sequoia time.''
</P>
<P>
   A given tree might topple prematurely, but that could happen in
100 years, 500 years, he said _ only a fraction of a life that can
span 30 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Tweed does not impose a harsh judgment on his
forebears in the park. ``It's not that people were in any way evil
or shortsighted,'' he said. ``Sometimes it just takes time to see
the impact of what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the development was in the `20s and `30s. We've later
seen that it was located in sensitive areas. When most of the
national parks were in development _ Yosemite, the Old Faithful
area of Yellowstone _ visitation was a fraction of what it is
today. No one knew how mobile the society would become.''
</P>
<P>
   If you visit today, and you venture out on your own in the
sequoia zone, you'll be a member of a distinct minority. Most
tourists, it seems, are content to observe the trees from behind
their windshields on a drive along the Generals Highway, making
only an obligatory stop at the General Sherman tree.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman tree, the largest living thing on Earth, is only
steps from the main road, and has its own parking lot. Visitors who
stop here quickly learn that they can't backpedal far enough to
capture its 275-foot height in their camera viewfinders.
</P>
<P>
   From the edge of the parking area, you can embark on the
Congress Trail, a relatively easy, 2.1-mile loop that is kind of a
sequoia civics lesson _ trees or clusters of trees are named for
such institutions as the presidency, the Senate and the House, and
the individuals honored include William McKinley and Robert E. Lee.
(The Sherman tree honors the Union general who put the torch to the
South because James Wolverton, the cattleman who named it in 1879,
had served under William Tecumseh Sherman in the Civil War.)
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing route that branches off the Congress Trail is
the Trail of the Sequoias. It is a 5.1-mile loop that wends its way
around, under and even through fallen giants, skirts three meadows
and takes in Tharps Log, a cabin built into a hollow fallen sequoia
by an eccentric cattle rancher in the 1800s. (In this literal log
cabin, there are a table, benches, stone fireplace _ and enough
head room for an NBA forward.)
</P>
<P>
   This trail is impeccably maintained and very well marked. You'd
have to work pretty hard to get lost while navigating it. It was
also utterly deserted on a Saturday afternoon in January, just
before the season's snows arrived. Visitors don't seem inclined to
stray far from their cars or the paved roads.
</P>
<P>
   At least the makeover of Sequoia National Park has forced them
to get out of the Giant Forest before they lie down to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   A cross section of the tree sacrificed to tourist comfort in
1950, by the way, is on display today. It is turned on its edge
near the General Sherman tree. Black marks in the rings signify
fires it survived during its lifetime, and a sign chronicles them _
one roughly coinciding with William the Conqueror's arrival in
England, another with Columbus' landfall in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beginning to lean,'' said Tweed. ``The primary cause of
death for sequoia trees is that they eventually fall over. They're
resistant to fire and disease, but they develop balance problems.
Maybe the next year, maybe the next 100 years or 200 years, it was
going to fall over.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the distant future, naturalists will examine the
trunk of a stately giant sequoia that toppled over from natural
causes. Imagine them assessing the rings in the trunk and drawing
these conclusions: Survived fires of 699 and 980, made it through
drought of 1258, recovered from sewer-line trench of 1961 ...
flourished for another three centuries. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
IF YOU GO: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Sequoia National Park, which lies south of
Yosemite and due east of Fresno in the western Sierra Nevada, is a
233-mile drive from Los Angeles. After proceeding north via I-5 and
Highways 99 and 65 to Lindsay, the route jogs and twists a bit
before picking up Highway 198 into the mountains and the park;
simply follow the signs for ``Sequoia'' or ``National Park.'' It's
a good idea to allow between four and five hours for this drive,
particularly if there is snow on the sharply curving roadway above
Three Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: Admission to the national park is $10 per vehicle, good
for seven days. It is $5 per person for cyclists and visitors on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: The new Wuksachi Lodge has three room categories,
graduated according to view and space. Rates are $75, $90 and $105
until June 1, at which time they'll rise to $110, $125 and $155 for
the summer peak. Rooms are simply furnished but comfortable, and do
not have TVs. Reservations: (888) 252-5757. Front desk: (559)
565-4070. Web: www.VisitSequoia.com.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The Wuksachi serves breakfast, lunch and dinner in a
vaulted-ceiling dining room with impressive views through picture
windows. The fare is both tasty and reasonably priced _ dinner
items in the $10 to $20 range. Nearby, the Lodgepole market, closed
for renovations through most of the winter, is scheduled to reopen
Saturday. Never leave picnic items locked in your car unattended _
the bear-proof car door or window has yet to be invented.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Lodgepole Visitors Center, which lies between
the Giant Forest and the Wuksachi Lodge, can be reached at (559)
565-3782. The National Park Service maintains an office in Three
Rivers. Phone: (559) 565-3341. Web: www.nps.gov/seki.

SILENCE DOESN'T SOLVE RACIAL ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost overnight, the tone of her letters changed.
</P>
<P>
   When they first began arriving, the writing was warm and
flattering, sometimes detailing the things we had in common, like
children and our Mississippi heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every week they arrived via e-mail. I'd read them,
smiling sometimes, and then I'd respond. Sometimes, we carried on a
dialogue by exchanging several letters.
</P>
<P>
   Then I wrote a column saying I supported affirmative action.
This did not sit well with my new-found friend, and she told me so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we finally disagree, big time,'' she wrote. ``If it was
1968, not 1998, when I was reading your article I would have said,
Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen then made her case against affirmative action. That was
June 7, 1998. I responded the way I always had, but this was the
last time I would hear from my ``admiring white e-mail friend,'' as
she called herself.
</P>
<P>
   I found this odd and wondered why she needed to remind me that
she is white.
</P>
<P>
   I remembered Kathleen the other day when another such e-mail
arrived from an Arlington, Texas, man accusing me of ``fanning the
racial flames'' because I questioned how the jury in the Amadou
Diallo case could've acquitted the four New York City cops accused
of killing him. The cops were white and four members of the jury
were black.
</P>
<P>
   ``It causes people like me, little by little, to trust
African-Americans less and less,'' he wrote. ``It tells us what you
really think of us. It causes me, personally, to think twice these
days before I go out of the way to perform an act of kindness
toward an African-American. And that's the shame of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember if he has ever written to me before, but I
responded, telling him shame on him because nothing he did or said
to me could cause me to withhold a kindness from someone white.
</P>
<P>
   Reading his note, remembering Kathleen's, I couldn't help
thinking how being candid can impose a terrible loneliness,
especially when dealing with issues of race.
</P>
<P>
   For those who would like to believe racism is a thing of the
past, it's much easier to accuse me of perpetuating anger,
self-pity, victimization and, yes, racism. I understand that.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't change the way many African-Americans view the
world in which we live, that often African-Americans are the last
to be hired and the first to be fired, viewed through a criminal
lens, and denied loans by lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
   If you think those things only happen in Mississippi, think
again. For all the progress we've supposedly made, there's no evil
worse than the one you can't see, the racism _ often unspoken _
just beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   I wish there were something new I could add, something to turn
the light bulb on in the hearts and minds of some people. But I
simply shake my head. If there are words to put this in its proper
perspective and put this issue to rest once and for all, they
escape me.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced we will never arrive at a place of understanding
if we are unwilling to point out the injustices, regardless of
whether doing so is considered too sensitive or not politically
correct. Avoiding these issues has only led to more lies.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a plea to get us talking more about race. There's
been an ongoing dialogue for years about the way that we treat one
another.
</P>
<P>
   It's time now to start listening to each other.

GOVERNMENT BLACKMAIL AGAINST A LEGAL PRODUCT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No self-respecting gun fighter would have done what Smith &AMP;
Wesson did to its industry colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   They shot 'em from behind.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson went maverick on all the other gun manufacturers
when it broke ranks and cut its own deal with the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development to get out from under dozens of
pending lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, gun manufacturers had been negotiating with the feds
for months in an attempt to reach a compromise on issues such as
trigger locks, background checks and multiple purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson, in an act described by company CEO Ed Shultz as
a move to ``save itself,'' secretly met with HUD Secretary Andrew
Cuomo in a series of meetings that culminated in last week's widely
publicized agreement. Shultz agreed to a ``code of conduct'' that
includes guns with built-in trigger locks, developing ``smart
guns'' within three years and a number of other concessions; Cuomo
promised that at least 10 of the 29 cities and counties suing
Shultz's company for negligent marketing of a defective product
would drop the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Heralded by gun control advocates as an enlightened move by the
gun maker to change the way business is done in America, the
settlement is little more than extortion disguising itself as
policy making.
</P>
<P>
   For people who respect the Constitution, which clearly says laws
are supposed to be made in the state house and not the White House
or the court house, this capitulation to a threat to bankrupt the
company is viewed as one more back-door attempt to legislate by the
executive branch. The Constitution's explicit separation of
governmental powers is once again bruised and battered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real goal of the litigation was to bypass the legislative
process which, despite the scourge of high-profile multiple
killings, has been remarkably unreceptive to a variety of gun
control measures,'' said Robert A. Levy, senior fellow in
constitutional studies for the Cato Institute. ``So if the
legislature doesn't cooperate, just commandeer public resources to
file suits across the nation until gun makers cry uncle. That's no
better than blackmail masquerading as law.''
</P>
<P>
   They had a choice, cry the gun control advocates. If Smith &AMP;
Wesson officials thought they were standing on firm footing, then
the company should have had its day in court.
</P>
<P>
   My, but isn't the high ground dry when you aren't facing
economic ruin.
</P>
<P>
   These suits are nuisance litigation. When it's brought by
entities that have bottomless bank accounts _ funded with public
dollars, no less _ then the playing field becomes more than a
little muddied.
</P>
<P>
   Think that's an overstatement? Then read the words of New York
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer: ``We have the capacity to squeeze
manufacturers like a pincers and hurt them in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   What a twisted nation this has become _ strong-arming companies
that manufacturer legal products because some amorphous ``we''
doesn't like what happens when the products are misused.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of folks compare these lawsuits to the ones filed against
the tobacco industry. The similarity is the fact that legal
businesses which Congress has chosen not to mess with are being
threatened with extinction by having to mount financially crippling
legal defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The huge difference between tobacco and firearms is how they've
been marketed. Tobacco officials for years swore that nicotine was
not addictive, and that the health risks to habitual smokers were
non-existent. They lied to the American people. Tobacco kills.
</P>
<P>
   Gun manufacturers have never said their products were anything
but lethal _ someone pulls a trigger and that little piece of metal
leaving the barrel at a very high velocity is going to put a hole
in whatever it hits _ a paper target, a white-tail deer, a human
being. When used properly, it can kill. But it can also save lives.
Studies completed by statistical academicians who have nothing to
gain or lose by their findings show that firearms are used anywhere
from 1.5 million to 2 million times a year to thwart crime _ many
times without firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, and where the focus of this entire debate should
remain, is on the purpose of the person pulling the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Every honest gun owner in America wants to find a way to keep
firearms away from people who shouldn't have them. Age limits for
purchasing firearms are reasonable. Permanently revoking the right
to gun ownership from anyone convicted of a crime involving a gun
is reasonable. Background checks on all sales at gun shows are
reasonable, as long as they occur instantaneously. Selling trigger
locks with each new firearm purchase is reasonable, but don't come
after me as the felon if someone breaks into my childless house and
steals a gun _ trigger locked or not _ to use in a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to put gun manufacturers out of business by
governmentally sanctioned blackmail is not and never will be
reasonable.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK _ At the new Wuksachi Lodge in Sequoia
National Park, a musty book is tucked in among the reading
selections in the lobby: Hammonds' Illustrated Nature Guide. It
doesn't appear to get much attention from guests, probably because
of its age _ it was published in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Look up the tree species for which this park is famed and you'll
read this entry: ``For how many centuries or millennia our present
sequoias will go on living nobody knows; their chances seem
excellent as they are almost indestructible.''
</P>
<P>
   Irony fairly spills off the page.
</P>
<P>
   Indestructible? Exactly five years before this book was
released, park rangers determined that a sequoia in nearby Giant
Forest Village, leaning ominously, was in danger of flattening some
cabins if it were to topple over. So they lifted the cabins with
jacks, rolled them out of the way, and felled the tree. Cut it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Then they counted rings in the trunk. The tree was more than
2,200 years old. It first poked through the ground and shed its
seed coat in 261 B.C., about the time Roman legions were tangling
with Carthage in the first of the three Punic Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bill Tweed, Sequoia's chief naturalist, can only shake
his head. ``There was a symbol there,'' he said. ``We were cutting
down sequoia trees to make it safe for visitors to come to see
sequoia trees. In the long run, that just didn't add up right.''
</P>
<P>
   The stewardship of the park now conforms to a much different
philosophy, and visitors will notice it the instant they wheel in
among these towering trees _the largest living things on Earth _ in
California's western Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, nearly all the development has been
removed from the Giant Forest Village. Cabins, parking areas, side
roads. Tourist lodging and services were relocated to an area a bit
farther along the road, just past the Lodgepole region, in an area
of pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Wuksachi Lodge, which opened there last spring, accommodates
visitors with 102 rooms, a main lodge building, a restaurant and
bar, a small gift shop. Its most impressive feature: It is safely
removed from any of the sequoia groves that dot these western
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   These are truly magnificent trees. They're not as tall as
redwoods or as old as bristlecone pines, but no organism on the
planet can match its volume. The General Sherman tree here, which
is 275 feet tall and 103 feet around, is estimated to contain
52,500 cubic feet of wood, enough to build 40 houses.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive immune systems enable these trees to grow so tall,
gain such bulk and last so long. Their bark is virtually devoid of
pitch, which creates the equivalent of an asbestos suit, impervious
to fire. Their bark and heart wood is also laced with a bitter
tannin, such that insects attempting to bore in become afflicted
with acute indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these giants have feet of clay _ quite literally. The
sequoia spreads its roots outward in shallow soil, and it has no
tap root. Thus, if its root system is damaged or if its surrounding
soil is eroded, it simply topples over.
</P>
<P>
   The tree can usually hold its own under natural circumstances.
But it faces the fight of its life when trenches for water pipes
are dug nearby, when road beds alter normal drainage, when
pollutants work their way into the surface water. This was the
sequoias' plight after a village was built in their midst in the
early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it was removed over the last three years. A couple of
structures deemed historic remain, notably the market that served
Giant Forest. They're to be converted to a museum and a learning
center, due to open next spring.
</P>
<P>
   In one year's time, the forest has already made a remarkable
recovery. Most of the development in the area had been small cabins
dotted among the trees, not sprawling lodge complexes that would
have required extensive bulldozing. Once the cabins were plucked
out, the ground was smoothed over, covered with mulch, planted with
seedlings and interlaced with irrigation tubing. It regained the
look of natural forest floor rather quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to know if irreversible damage was done by man's
100-year handprint (a tent camp went up in 1899, the last cabins
were removed in 1999). ``Did we do damage that will take a while to
show?'' said Tweed. ``Quite likely, yes. But you have to change
your thinking from human time to sequoia time.''
</P>
<P>
   A given tree might topple prematurely, but that could happen in
100 years, 500 years, he said _ only a fraction of a life that can
span 30 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Tweed does not impose a harsh judgment on his
forebears in the park. ``It's not that people were in any way evil
or shortsighted,'' he said. ``Sometimes it just takes time to see
the impact of what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the development was in the `20s and `30s. We've later
seen that it was located in sensitive areas. When most of the
national parks were in development _ Yosemite, the Old Faithful
area of Yellowstone _ visitation was a fraction of what it is
today. No one knew how mobile the society would become.''
</P>
<P>
   If you visit today, and you venture out on your own in the
sequoia zone, you'll be a member of a distinct minority. Most
tourists, it seems, are content to observe the trees from behind
their windshields on a drive along the Generals Highway, making
only an obligatory stop at the General Sherman tree.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman tree, the largest living thing on Earth, is only
steps from the main road, and has its own parking lot. Visitors who
stop here quickly learn that they can't backpedal far enough to
capture its 275-foot height in their camera viewfinders.
</P>
<P>
   From the edge of the parking area, you can embark on the
Congress Trail, a relatively easy, 2.1-mile loop that is kind of a
sequoia civics lesson _ trees or clusters of trees are named for
such institutions as the presidency, the Senate and the House, and
the individuals honored include William McKinley and Robert E. Lee.
(The Sherman tree honors the Union general who put the torch to the
South because James Wolverton, the cattleman who named it in 1879,
had served under William Tecumseh Sherman in the Civil War.)
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing route that branches off the Congress Trail is
the Trail of the Sequoias. It is a 5.1-mile loop that wends its way
around, under and even through fallen giants, skirts three meadows
and takes in Tharps Log, a cabin built into a hollow fallen sequoia
by an eccentric cattle rancher in the 1800s. (In this literal log
cabin, there are a table, benches, stone fireplace _ and enough
head room for an NBA forward.)
</P>
<P>
   This trail is impeccably maintained and very well marked. You'd
have to work pretty hard to get lost while navigating it. It was
also utterly deserted on a Saturday afternoon in January, just
before the season's snows arrived. Visitors don't seem inclined to
stray far from their cars or the paved roads.
</P>
<P>
   At least the makeover of Sequoia National Park has forced them
to get out of the Giant Forest before they lie down to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   A cross section of the tree sacrificed to tourist comfort in
1950, by the way, is on display today. It is turned on its edge
near the General Sherman tree. Black marks in the rings signify
fires it survived during its lifetime, and a sign chronicles them _
one roughly coinciding with William the Conqueror's arrival in
England, another with Columbus' landfall in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beginning to lean,'' said Tweed. ``The primary cause of
death for sequoia trees is that they eventually fall over. They're
resistant to fire and disease, but they develop balance problems.
Maybe the next year, maybe the next 100 years or 200 years, it was
going to fall over.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the distant future, naturalists will examine the
trunk of a stately giant sequoia that toppled over from natural
causes. Imagine them assessing the rings in the trunk and drawing
these conclusions: Survived fires of 699 and 980, made it through
drought of 1258, recovered from sewer-line trench of 1961 ...
flourished for another three centuries. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
IF YOU GO: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Sequoia National Park, which lies south of
Yosemite and due east of Fresno in the western Sierra Nevada, is a
233-mile drive from Los Angeles. After proceeding north via I-5 and
Highways 99 and 65 to Lindsay, the route jogs and twists a bit
before picking up Highway 198 into the mountains and the park;
simply follow the signs for ``Sequoia'' or ``National Park.'' It's
a good idea to allow between four and five hours for this drive,
particularly if there is snow on the sharply curving roadway above
Three Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: Admission to the national park is $10 per vehicle, good
for seven days. It is $5 per person for cyclists and visitors on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: The new Wuksachi Lodge has three room categories,
graduated according to view and space. Rates are $75, $90 and $105
until June 1, at which time they'll rise to $110, $125 and $155 for
the summer peak. Rooms are simply furnished but comfortable, and do
not have TVs. Reservations: (888) 252-5757. Front desk: (559)
565-4070. Web: www.VisitSequoia.com.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The Wuksachi serves breakfast, lunch and dinner in a
vaulted-ceiling dining room with impressive views through picture
windows. The fare is both tasty and reasonably priced _ dinner
items in the $10 to $20 range. Nearby, the Lodgepole market, closed
for renovations through most of the winter, is scheduled to reopen
Saturday. Never leave picnic items locked in your car unattended _
the bear-proof car door or window has yet to be invented.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Lodgepole Visitors Center, which lies between
the Giant Forest and the Wuksachi Lodge, can be reached at (559)
565-3782. The National Park Service maintains an office in Three
Rivers. Phone: (559) 565-3341. Web: www.nps.gov/seki.

RIGHTS GROUP ACCUSES SAUDIS OF EXTENSIVE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In a sharply worded report, Amnesty International
on Monday accused the government of Saudi Arabia of widespread
human rights abuses including arbitrary arrests, the torture of
detainees and the barring of prisoners' access to family members or
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it had received and published graphic accounts of
mistreatment, discrimination against religious minorities and
suppression of political dissent in the gulf kingdom for years. But
Saudi Arabia has escaped international condemnation for its record,
Amnesty officials added, because oil-dependent nations like the
United States have not wanted to offend the kingdom's rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials, who rarely respond to outside critics, this
time reacted swiftly, emphatically rejecting Amnesty's findings as
biased and inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to hide in human rights,'' said Prince Turki
bin Mohammedi, the deputy foreign minister responsible for
international organizations, in a telephone interview from the
Saudi capital Riyadh. ``There is no harm in having their point of
view, but they have to be more accurate in their information.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of Amnesty's U.S. affiliate, William F.
Schulz, said the human rights organization will try to spotlight
the Saudi record through a worldwide publicity campaign this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amnesty International does launch one or two major campaigns a
year aimed at countries with particularly serious human rights
violations,'' said Schulz. ``In the case of Saudi Arabia, the
country has gotten away with arbitrary detention and torture for
years, while escaping international scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will begin on Tuesday with a truck-mounted
billboard _ the most aggressive tactic ever used by Amnesty's
American office _ that will be driven around Washington. The
billboard will feature an amputated hand over the slogan: ``This
suffering is the secret of Saudi justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amnesty report consolidated accounts of mistreatment of
detainees and more general human rights abuses that it said it had
received or learned through media reports about Saudi Arabia during
the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this research clearly reveals is that people who are
arrested in Saudi Arabia for whatever reason find themselves
trapped in a criminal justice system that provides them with no
information about their fate, allows them no prompt contact with
their families or a doctor, and offers them no hope of contacting a
lawyer,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the organization's report concerned the broader Saudi
system itself, which bans political parties as well as criticism of
the royal family and government. Amnesty maintained that extralegal
torture and arrests take place and that even the country's legal
forms of punishment violate international norms in their cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   The critique ventures into the sensitive issue of how the rulers
and religious leaders in the tightly controlled and insular kingdom
interpret Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi legal system is based on its leaders' strict
interpretation of Shariah, or Islamic religious law, undiluted by
any attempt to reconcile it to modern sensibilities. Death
sentences are carried out by a firing squad for women and by
beheading, often in a public square, for men. Capital crimes range
from murder and drug smuggling to apostasy and moral corruption.
The punishment for repeated thievery is the amputation of one or
more of the convicted person's limbs.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of these penalties, the Amnesty report said, is
made worse by a lack of safeguards to guarantee fair trials and
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a request for comment on the Amnesty report, the
Saudi Foreign Ministry said the country's laws already provide
stringent guidelines for how police and security officials should
deal with prisoners and people they arrest. It also said that
contrary to the human rights group's report, most trials are open
to the public, according to Saudi law, and prison conditions are
fair.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, in its annual report on human rights
practices in various countries around the world, has carefully
raised criticisms of life in Saudi Arabia similar to those cited in
the Amnesty report. Most Middle Eastern countries, in fact, are
faulted in the yearly summaries for their treatment of prisoners,
conditions of detention and discrimination against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The recently published 1999 State Department report on Saudi
Arabia said the government ``commits and tolerates serious human
rights abuses.'' It noted arbitrary detention of citizens and
foreigners and credible reports of torture by security forces,
heavy-handed censorship, and violence against religious minorities
and women.

TRIMBLE'S THIN MARGIN EXPOSED SKEPTICS IN PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ When David Trimble staved off a challenge to his
leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party on Saturday, his margin of
victory was described as narrow and a major disappointment to him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 57 percent of the votes from the 860-member Ulster
Unionist Council that Trimble drew marked only a 1 percent drop in
what he got last November when he received a cautious endorsement
of his decision to form a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing, before the IRA began disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Saturday's unenthusiastic endorsement of Trimble's
leadership gave empirical evidence that many middle class
Protestants in Northern Ireland remain deeply skeptical about the
peace process, and especially about again sharing power with Sinn
Fein until the IRA begins turning in its hidden arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   It was Trimble's willingness, stated in Washington two weeks
ago, to re-form the suspended power-sharing government without IRA
disarmanent up front that precipitated Saturday's challenge to his
leadership. Luckily for Trimble, his challenger, Martin Smyth, a
68-year-old Presbyterian minister, could neither stir the masses
nor offer a viable alternative to the Good Friday Agreement of
1998, which was supposed to end Northern Ireland's long-running
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth has always opposed the historic compromise in which
Protestant unionists who want to maintain the union with Britain
agreed to recognize the legitimacy of Irish nationalist aspirations
for reunification with the Irish Republic, while nationalists
accepted that Northern Ireland would remain part of the United
Kingdom until a majority voted otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Like Smyth, many of those who want to see Trimble go are
reactionaries who long for the days when unionists could
unilaterally dictate to Catholic nationalists. But more worrying to
Trimble is the coalition between the old guard and a younger, more
cynical generation. The Young Unionist organization and its leader,
Peter King, backed Smyth's insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the peace process even more than the flagging
support for Trimble was a motion passed by the council which
stipulates the party will not rejoin the power-sharing government
unless the British government reverses its decision to change the
name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police
force.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Ronnie Flanagan, chief of the RUC, had pleaded with the
party not to endorse such a motion, saying it would politicize his
force by aligning it with one party and one political tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But so angry are most unionists over what they see as the
British government's appeasement of the IRA that they ignored both
Flanagan's and Trimble's warning that such a motion would allow
nationalists to claim that the RUC, despite pledged reforms,
remains the military wing of unionism.
</P>
<P>
   During the St. Patrick's festivities in Washington, Trimble
scored big points with the White House and the rest of the
international community by saying he was willing to resume the
power-sharing government that was suspended last month even before
the IRA begins turning in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But what is seen as statesmanship outside Northern Ireland is
often seen as treason within. Some unionists were outraged at
Trimble's offer, saying he has compromised so often on principle
that his party's word means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Elected as party leader in 1995 because he was the most
uncompromising of the candidates, Trimble has reinvented himself as
a resourceful, resilient politician who is willing to call Irish
republicans on their bluff _ to challenge whether those who for 30
years tried to destroy Northern Ireland with violence are truly
committed to reforming it through democratic politics.
</P>
<P>
   For his efforts, Trimble has been lauded internationally,
sharing the Nobel Peace Prize with John Hume, the pacifist
nationalist leader. But inside Trimble's own party, the Nobel Prize
is sneered at by some as proof of an international conspiracy that
sides with nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, Trimble has made unionism more respected
internationally, slowly deconstructing the stereotype that
unionists are intransigent, anti-Catholic bigots. And yet the more
successful Trimble is at improving the image of unionism abroad,
the more he undermines himself with those inside his party who
believe he is sliding down the slippery slope to a united Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists are at a crossroads, unsure of whether to go forward
on the uncharted path of the peace process, or retreat to the
well-trodden trail of ``No Surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble may eventually become a victim of his own success.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: GROWING PAINS AS THE OSCARS PLAY TO JADED
STARGAZERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We can't blame Canada for this one. When Robin Williams sang
``Blame Canada'' from the ``South Park'' movie, joined by a chorus
line dressed as Mounties, it was the highlight of this year's
Academy Awards show and a revelation. The evening's first
production number, this all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza was,
significantly, a parody of the inadvertently hilarious routines the
Oscar show has made famous.
</P>
<P>
   Coming an hour-and-a-half into the ceremony on Sunday, it was
also the night's last sign of hope that the new producers, Richard
Zanuck and Lili Fini Zanuck, might make good on their promise to
transform the event into something sleek and contemporary.
Conceptually, they got the idea. So why did the four-hour show turn
into a zombie, as if some pod creature had sucked the life out of
it?
</P>
<P>
   The answer has everything to do with how the entertainment
industry has changed. How big a deal is it, after all, to see Kevin
Spacey or Annette Bening or even Tom Cruise dressed up and ready to
act humbly grateful these days? After the Golden Globes and the
Screen Actors Guild awards, after all the movie plugs on late-night
talk shows and the Oscar campaigns chronicled by ``Entertainment
Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood'' as if they were the Middle East
peace talks, not very big. The overload of star presence makes
every appearance ordinary, and that's what the producers of the
Academy Awards can't bear to admit: however prestigious and
powerful the Oscars may be in the film industry, in our
celebrity-saturated television age stargazing is just not special
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   On some level old Hollywood understands that change, but doesn't
know what to do. That is clear in the mixed messages sent by the
Oscar show and the pre-and post-shows surrounding it. The show the
Zanucks produced for ABC came with a savvy understanding of the new
rules. They kept what was best from Oscars past. The deft and funny
host, Billy Crystal, sang his traditional medley about the
best-picture nominees, turning the ``Green Acres'' theme into ``The
Green Mile.'' But the hokey banter between presenters was kept to a
minimum and the best-song nominees were compressed into one
no-frills sequence. There were enough Halloween-ready fashions to
keep viewers entertained: Erykah Badu's pea-green dress and
matching mile-high turban made her look like the Jolly Green Giant,
and Angelina Jolie came dressed as Morticia Addams. Everything
started out swift and bright.
</P>
<P>
   And the show tacitly acknowledged being part of a larger showbiz
world. The announcer used to be a disembodied voice; this year
Peter Coyote was shown backstage, a move that played to the
viewers' sense of being insiders. When he announced that American
Express was a sponsor, the tag line resonated with a similar
flattering attitude: ``Whether you're seeing a movie or making one,
we can help you do more.'' Even the commercials blended with the
show into one seamless package, as Sally Field made fun of her
``You like me'' Oscar acceptance speech in an ad for the investment
company Charles Schwab. This is far from the days when moviegoers
worshiped stars from afar.
</P>
<P>
   But before the show was halfway through it became bloated with
tributes that the Academy clings to: segments on dead people, child
actors and a Burt Bacharach sequence of old nominated songs.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's identity crisis extended to the fusty pre- and
post-Oscar shows. Joan Rivers, who made a reputation for being
snarky about fashion on the E! channel special, now has arriving
stars groveling for her approval. Groveling in return, she asked
Michael Mann, the director of ``The Insider,'' why his film
flopped: ``Is it too intelligent?''
</P>
<P>
   Too much intelligence was not anyone's problem on Sunday. ABC
now has its own lame pre-show. This year its giddy host was
Meredith Vieira of ``The View,'' who capped the half-hour by
dashing into the auditorium and sitting on Clint Eastwood's lap.
Trying desperately to be cute and irreverent, the show flashed this
information on the bottom of the screen as Cruise was interviewed:
``Tom can be seen in his underwear in eight of his films, including
`Magnolia.'''
</P>
<P>
   The ABC show ignored the evening's only truly outrageous stunt,
which the Rivers special had the wit to include. The best-dressed
men of the evening were the creators of ``South Park.'' Trey Parker
arrived in a copy of the pink prom gown Gwyneth Paltrow wore last
year, and Matt Stone wore a knockoff of Jennifer Lopez's
cut-to-the-navel Grammy Awards dress.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's supposedly irreverent ``Politically Incorrect'' went in
the other direction, getting serious in its post-Oscars show and
asking the conservative critic Michael Medved about gender-bending
roles and family dysfunction in the movies. It was a wrongheaded
approach, especially at 1 a.m., but a suitable ending to
Hollywood's big confused night.

&HT;     WEALTH OF COLLEGE MONEY AVAILABLE, EVEN TO THE AFFLUENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RICK KARLIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ One of the 15 or so college scholarships that
Heidi Schumacher is pursuing is the Seth Hokanson Memorial
Scholarship for students of Scandinavian extraction who have a
musical bent.
</P>
<P>
   She read about the $1,000 scholarship in the Swedish American
Newsletter, which her parents receive, and figured her Swedish
lineage and her participation in traditional Scandinavian music
pageants made her well-qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Yelena Biberman, a fellow Albany High School senior and Jewish
immigrant from Belarus, is applying for about 10 scholarships,
including a $1,500 award from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. She
also is hoping for money from the Chinese American Alliance, which
she heard also tries to help immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these Albany High School students have high grade-point
averages and are near the top of their class. They also are seeking
berths in the Ivy League schools, with Biberman hoping to go to
Princeton and Schumacher looking at Yale. For their second choices,
Schumacher wants to attend Duke University, and Biberman is looking
at Wellsley and the State University of New York at Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to all the outside scholarships such as the Hokanson
and Immigrant Aid awards, the schools to which they are applying
may offer grants or scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a big difference between the two students.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher's parents are physicians, and while she has another
sister in college and a younger brother in private school, she says
her family could probably afford to pay most if not all of her
college costs.
</P>
<P>
   Biberman is part of a single-parent family _ her mother works as
a nursing home clerk and studies English in most of her spare time.
She has virtually no money for college and will be relying heavily
on grants and scholarships to get her through. Princeton may be
farther off for her than Yale is for Schumacher due to the simple
fact that Ivy League schools tend to dole out less grant money.
</P>
<P>
   That is a change from the way things used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Up until a few years ago, it would go without saying that
Biberman could get a lot more money than Schumacher.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, schools are making awards based on performance
instead of need. And the grants from schools are typically larger
than the various scholarships, such as the Hokanson or Immigrant
awards, noted Jill Rifkin, who runs College Options, a Delmar-based
advisory service for college applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward merit-based rather than need-based awards is an
example of how government policies are being played out in homes,
classrooms and college admission offices across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   It started in the 1980s in Georgia when then-Gov. Zell Miller
started the Hope Scholarship, which awarded free tuition to state
schools for students with B averages or better.
</P>
<P>
   The concept caught on nationally, said Tom Mortenson, an
Iowa-based researcher who follows college finance issues. Many
states, including New York, now offer some kind of award to top
students.
</P>
<P>
   The shift from need to merit also is a byproduct of the fierce
competition among colleges and universities to get the best
students they can in order to boost their standing in various
rankings, such as U.S. News and World Report college surveys and
other similar venues, Mortenson said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of simple math.
</P>
<P>
   If a school has $10,000 to award, it can give it all to a needy
but smart student.
</P>
<P>
   Or it can split the money among four or five students who may be
less needy but just as smart. That way, the school boosts its
number of high-achieving students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong inclination among the financial aid people is to go
toward merit,'' Mortenson said.

WITH THE POPE GONE, ISRAEL RETURNS TO POLITICS-AS-USUAL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ And so Pope John Paul II flew away and took his
positive karma with him. This is how the morning after looked in
Israel: diminished prospects for peace with Syria, the opening of a
politically explosive criminal investigation into a leading rabbi,
and five separate parliament votes of no confidence in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit did produce a salutary ripple, though, buoying
the Israeli government's image internationally, the Israeli
public's state of mind and Prime Minister Ehud Barak's political
stature, at least temporarily. This afforded something of a cushion
when they fell back to earth from their pope-inspired contemplation
of the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   The first blow came on Sunday night, hours after the pope
boarded an El Al plane to return to the Vatican. Despite high
expectations, President Clinton failed to revive the Israeli-Syrian
peace talks in a Geneva summit meeting with Hafez Assad, the
president of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction here on Monday ranged from dire pessimism, which
included anxieties about another flare-up in the war zone in
southern Lebanon, to a kind of forced hopefulness that this was
just another disappointment that could be overcome. The
middle-of-the-road position was the glum assessment by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's security adviser, Danny Yatom, that it was
hard to imagine junior-level diplomats bridging gaps after the two
presidents failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel and Syria traded blame for who was at fault,
Israelis, including the left, believe that Barak had made it clear
that he wanted to make a deal and was willing to make significant
concessions. Some here said that in contrast to the past, Israeli
intransigence could not be blamed this time for derailing a peace
effort. Israelis, from right to left, increasingly believe that
Assad is so reluctant as to be an untrustworthy partner in
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make a peace agreement, each side has to climb inside
the skin of the other side and try to understand him,'' said Matan
Vilnai, a Cabinet minister and a dovish former general. ``President
Assad still does not do this. In the end, because our interest
remains strong, we will get to this,'' to peace. ``But maybe it
won't be with President Assad.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barak has pledged to withdraw Israeli troops from
southern Lebanon by July, and he hoped to do so as part of a peace
agreement with Syria. So the highest-ranking military official on
Monday urged the government not to abandon efforts to find a way
back to the negotiating table. The fear is that Syria, the power
broker in Lebanon, will sabotage an Israeli withdrawal by fostering
violent attacks in southern Lebanon or into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to seal the issue and say it's over,'' said Lt.
Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the army chief-of-staff, uncharacteristically
venturing an assessment about a diplomatic issue. ``It's possible
it will still change. Everyone in Israel and especially in the army
would prefer leaving Lebanon within the context of an agreement.
And from Israel's point of view, the door is still open'' to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Although the possibility of violent confrontation is unpleasant,
Barak might draw temporary political advantage from the failed
summit meeting. It is now difficult for him to be portrayed by the
opposition as willing to sell out Israel for a deal; while
flexible, he clearly was making some demands that Syria was
unwilling to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, the interior minister, who has said his Russian
immigrant party will leave the government if Barak returns the
Golan Heights to Syria, on Monday complimented the prime minister
for not ``giving in'' to Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Barak now has some breathing room, diplomatically and
politically, to focus on the Palestinian peace track, and to tackle
intense political disharmony within his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, his most balky coalition partner,
loses a lot of its potential power if a deal with Syria and a
national referendum on a deal is not imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs Shas as his ally going into a national vote on his
peace efforts. Shas' value, relative to the trouble it causes,
momentarily decreases if such a vote is not on the immediate
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   That might explain why political chaos did not immediately
follow Monday morning's decision by the attorney general to open a
criminal investigation into Shas' spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef. The Torah sages who guide Shas' 17-member delegation in
Parliament, Israel's third largest, decided Monday night not to
bolt the government _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of Shas supporters gathered outside Yosef's home
in Jerusalem. The rabbi addressed them from behind bars covering a
window, leading them in singing, ``Please oh Lord redeem us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yosef, who is seen as a political kingmaker in Israel, is being
investigated because of a recent sermon in which he issued a
blistering attack _ including a curse _ on the leftist education
minister, Yossi Sarid. In the sermon, which was broadcast to his
followers, he described Sarid as Satan, said his name and memory
should be obliterated, and said that just as God ``extirpated
Amalek,'' the biblical tribe that attacked the Israelites after
their exodus from Egypt, ``so may he extirpate'' Sarid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance will be visited upon him,'' the rabbi said, ``just
like vengeance was visited upon Haman,'' the ancient Persian enemy
of the Jews whose death by hanging is celebrated in the festival of
Purim.
</P>
<P>
   Yosef will be investigated on charges of ``praising or
encouraging violence that could lead to death or injury,''
insulting a public employee and slander.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his decision to open the investigation, the
attorney general, Elyakim Rubenstein, noted that he had declined to
do that last year after the rabbi insulted Supreme Court judges.
Among other things, Yosef had said that the judges ``fornicated
with impure'' or menstruating, women, which is proscribed in a
strict interpretation of Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sensitive issue,'' the attorney general said,
``primarily because we exhibit self-restraint in using a criminal
tool in a case of expression because of the special status of the
freedom of speech. Naturally, the status of Ovadia as a leading
Torah scholar and as the spiritual leader and political
decision-maker of a large political party, also did not make the
decision any easier, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rubenstein said the rabbi's statements could be heard by his
followers as an incitement to violence against Sarid, whether he
intended them that way or not. ``What is the meaning of the
vengeance that is to be visited upon Sarid, heaven forbid?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Given the political sensitivity, the police asked Rubenstein to
delay announcing his decision until after the pope left. They have
increased security around the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Barak issued a statement of respect for the decision to
investigate and urging ``public leaders, ministers and members of
Parliament to show restraint and to respect civilized norms of
debate and mutual respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the right decision,'' said Sarid, who has been feuding
with Shas over the reorganization of their large, indebted
religious school system.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Yishai, Shas' leader, decried the investigation as
``racist'' and ``anti-religious,'' since it singled out the leader
of a movement representing ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Jews of Middle
Eastern origin. He noted that the rabbi had clarified his sermon,
and specifically instructed his followers not to resort to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the parliament, there is a tendency to use extreme measures,
like votes of no confidence in the government, to make political
points. Among Monday's five motions, the most serious one attacked
Barak's presumed intent to give away neighborhoods abutting
Jerusalem to the Palestinians and his policy on Jerusalem in
general. All five motions failed.

RETRACING JESUS' STEPS IN JERUSALEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Taking a pilgrimage in Jerusalem, one of the great
religious cities of the world, can be difficult. There are too many
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to retrace the path of Jesus and the disciples as they
proceeded on one of the most earthshaking journeys in religious
history.
</P>
<P>
   Great idea, but not original. Pilgrims coming to this holy city
have been doing it for thousands of years. Still, I wanted to try
it for myself.
</P>
<P>
   My plan was to begin at the top of the Mount of Olives, walk to
the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus agonized over his coming
death, and then follow the Via Dolorosa, the street of sorrow that
Jesus took on his way to his Crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   My climb to the top of the Mount of Olives along a narrow paved
path progressed without interruption until I ran into Alli Kumbar,
who makes his living showing people around the area. He motioned
for me to come through an iron gate into the ancient Jewish
cemetery that covers much of the hillside.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to show me a great view of the city. The vista was as
breathtaking as he promised.
</P>
<P>
   He then handed me a small stone that he had picked up off the
hillside and instructed me to place it on top of a marble slab at a
grave site. Hundreds of other stones were already on the grave,
each in memory of victims of the Holocaust in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   When I left, Kumbar asked for a contribution, and I gave him
some shekels. As I was leaving, the congenial Kumbar turned his
attention to about 20 other tourists and began showing them around.
</P>
<P>
   Near the top of the Mount of Olives, I encountered a sign
indicating that this was the site of the tombs for the prophets
Haggai and Malachi.
</P>
<P>
   I was looking into a deep pit when Fareda Othman appeared,
picked up a kerosene lamp and took me and a German couple into a
cave that holds 50 graves. Two of the graves are marked with
symbols identifying them as tombs of the two prophets.
</P>
<P>
   To escape the chill and wind, I sat at a patio overlooking the
city and drank a cup of strong black coffee that Othman offered
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   I learned that Othman lives on the site, which her family has
owned for more than 100 years. Her laundry was hung out to dry near
the patio. She told us that the cave where Malachi and Haggai are
buried was originally covered by a large stone.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally made it to the top of the Mount of Olives,
hundreds of tourists were being photographed there.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing along the accepted path of Jesus and his disciples, I
stopped at the Garden of Gethsemane, the most impressive spot of my
pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   In A.D. 379, the Byzantines built a church over the place where
Jesus was believed to have prayed before he was crucified. The
sanctuary there now, the Church of All Nations, was built between
1919 and 1924. But the flooring of the original Byzantine church
can be seen through glass at some locations.
</P>
<P>
   The large stone identified by the earlier church as the place
where Jesus agonized before his death is at the altar. It is
encircled by ironwork resembling a crown of thorns.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people were kneeling and kissing the rock when I
arrived. I also kneeled and prayed there.
</P>
<P>
   Outside are gnarled olive trees that look old enough to have
been there during the lives of Jesus and his disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Around the garden of olive trees are signs reminding us of what
happened there. One cites a verse from the book of Matthew: ``Could
you not watch with me for one hour? Watch and pray that you may not
enter into temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Garden of Gethsemane, I walked through St. Stephen's
Gate, also called the Lion Gate because of the figures carved into
its stone face. From there, I continued down the Via Dolorosa.
</P>
<P>
   On my way to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, I stopped at
chapels and churches that mark events leading up to Jesus'
Crucifixion. For example, the Church of the Flagellation identifies
where Jesus is believed to have been scourged and crowned with
thorns.
</P>
<P>
   At some of the 14 stations of the cross, it is difficult to
concentrate because merchants hawk their wares and tour guides are
talking in many languages.
</P>
<P>
   I finally arrived at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which
marks the place where Christ is believed to have been crucified.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who was in Israel all last week, prayed at
the Garden of Gethsemane and its church and followed the Via
Dolorosa for a distance in a trimmed-down popemobile _ the
glass-enclosed vehicle in which he frequently travels _ and then
prayed at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
</P>
<P>
   For him, I am sure, it was an inspirational moment.
</P>
<P>
   And the only distractions were the thousands of pilgrims trying
to get a glimpse of him.
</P>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is rare indeed for commercial television to produce a program
of such high quality and importance as the two-and-a-half-hour
documentary, ``Cancer: Evolution to Revolution,'' to be aired at 8
p.m. Eastern time March 30 on HBO. Produced and directed by Joseph
F. Lovett, five of whose family members had cancer and four of whom
died of it, the film is at once realistic and hopeful about the
life-and-death battles being waged daily against this disease.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the need for as many Americans as possible to view
this extraordinary, information-packed effort by Lovett, who is
also the film's host, HBO is making it available to all cable
subscribers, even those who do not have access to HBO, and will
show it three more times: on April 5 at 4:30 p.m., on April 8 at 10
a.m. and on April 17 at 2:30 p.m. If you do not have cable, I urge
you to visit a friend who does or ask someone to tape it for you.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because there is not a family in America that has not been
or will not be touched by cancer. Because most people, when given a
diagnosis of cancer, fly into a panic that gets in the way of clear
thinking. Because many doctors initially consulted by cancer
patients are not up on the latest and most effective treatments for
their disease.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is widespread misunderstanding of the nature of
clinical trials and the enormous potential they offer for improving
cure rates and long-term survival. Because there is help out there
and hope for every cancer patient, even those with rare diseases,
if only people know how to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Take Gary Schine, for example. Told by his doctor that there was
no cure for hairy cell leukemia, the 46-year-old businessman from
Providence, R.I., sought a second opinion and discovered a new
treatment in a clinical trial in San Diego that has kept him
cancer-free now for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Another who refused to accept an imminent death sentence was
Arnold Sitton. With the help of the only oncologist in his rural
community, he went to France for an experimental drug treatment for
his advanced colon cancer that bought him nearly two years beyond
his initial prognosis of months to live, a total of two-and-a-half
years of quality time for himself and his wife, along with their
children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is little Jessica Turri, who at 10 received a
diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Jessica, an extremely
articulate, practical and charming child, cannot help but bring
hope and moral support to every family facing childhood cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows her through the course of her treatment at St.
Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and documents the
day-to-day trials _ and rewards _ of coping with cancer and its
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A head-in-the-sand attitude toward cancer is tantamount to a
death sentence should you get the disease. And one woman in three
and one man in two in this country will at some point develop a
potentially life-threatening cancer. Each year, 1.2 million
Americans are found to have cancer (not counting the more than one
million cases of superficial skin cancer) and 560,100 will die of
the disease this year.
</P>
<P>
   But as Dr. Richard Klausner, director of the National Cancer
Institute, notes in the film, Americans are plagued by ``an
alarming myth that a diagnosis of cancer is a death sentence.'' To
the contrary, he says, ``Now the majority of people diagnosed with
cancer will not die of that cancer.'' In fact, there are now more
than eight million Americans alive who have had cancer (again, not
counting superficial skin cancer), and most of them will beat the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Have we made significant progress against cancer? You bet.
Especially against childhood cancers. In the early 1950s, only 20
percent of children with cancer survived. Today, more than 70
percent are being cured, including 80 percent of children with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia. And in the last decade, a revolution
in cancer genetics has unfolded that explains both the origins of
many cancers and offers the possibility of new and more effective
treatments, comparable to the drug Herceptin that is now improving
survival of breast cancer patients with a particular genetic
defect.
</P>
<P>
   Even without any new discoveries, people already know how to
eliminate at least one-third of cancer deaths: by eliminating
cigarette smoking and other forms of tobacco consumption. Another
one-third of cancers might be prevented by other changes in living
habits, namely dietary improvements, increased physical activity
and achieving and maintaining a normal body weight.
</P>
<P>
   It is also known how to prevent at least two common cancers,
colorectal cancer and cervical cancer, through detection and
treatment of precancerous conditions. And it is known how to
maximize the chances for cure through early detection of breast
cancer, the most common cancer in women, and prostate cancer, the
most common cancer in men. The HBO film spells out all these
possibilities graphically and tells viewers how to reach the people
and groups associated with the techniques described. How to Become
a Winner
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again, the film emphasizes the importance of
taking an active role as a patient, of seeking out as much
information as possible about one's disease, finding the best
available treatments and obtaining a second opinion if the first
offers little long-term hope or recommends an outdated therapy. As
the father of a cancer patient states in the film, ``The care you
get is largely dependent on you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Schine, for example, the treatment that saved his
life had been published in a major medical journal just three weeks
before his leukemia was diagnosed, but the first doctor he
consulted knew nothing about it. Little Jessica's advice to other
children with cancer, ``Never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Also important is a willingness to be a guinea pig for
experimental cancer treatments. As Lovett so accurately notes,
nearly every bit of progress made against cancer has come out of
clinical trials in which patients were randomly assigned to receive
either the best available therapy of the day or a promising new
treatment. Participants in many clinical trials are treated at
government expense and are given the most careful and caring
treatment available.
</P>
<P>
   As for the common objection that the doctors who run clinical
trials are ``more concerned about their data than about you,'' Dr.
Michele Donato of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston,
asserts: ``My primary obligation is to the patient. The goal is not
for the patient to benefit the trial, but for the trial to benefit
the patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The film clearly recognizes that even with the very best

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ ``Fresh new life!'' Dr. Nancy Hopkins
exulted. ``These are the ones I love. They look so innocent,
somehow. Did you notice you can see right through their brains?''
</P>
<P>
   She was peering through a microscope at a day-old zebra fish
that resembled a speck-sized, transparent iguana wrapped around a
beach ball _ one of about 150,000 zebra fish that make her
Massachusetts Institute of Technology laboratory look in places
like a pet store overrun by its guppies.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later she was consulting with her visiting fish-food
man about the price of brine shrimp. Moments after that, she poked
in a fridge and pulled out, ``Ah, bubble brains from Friday!'' and
a ``bleached blond,'' another mutant fish, equally beautiful to
Hopkins in that its mutation was instantly visible: ``Born Saturday
_ three days later and you can tell by eye,'' she said. ``Now
that's my kind of screening.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, her kind of screening is much more complex than that.
In the race to identify genes that typify this dawning genomics
era, her lab has developed a technique that uses retroviruses to
induce mutations of single genes in zebra fish.
</P>
<P>
   The technique allows for quick isolation and cloning of the
mutated genes and, Hopkins said, should ultimately help define a
kind of ``construction kit'' of the genes necessary to make, say, a
heart, or a brain, or a whole baby fish.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Hopkins said, her lab is cloning three genes per
week for a total so far of 44 _ when all other labs combined have
cloned only about 30 and taken months or years on each one. The lab
used to celebrate each gene it cloned with a bottle of champagne,
she said, but now she can barely decide when to party.
</P>
<P>
   As the zebra fish genes roll in, this is an especially jubilant
time for Hopkins, 56, who is the Amgen professor of biology at MIT.
She laughs about the fungal fish-tank infection that stalled her
work for months, or the time half her postdoctoral students and
technicians were jumping ship in disgust, or how an administrator
told her she would not like running a large lab and should not try.
</P>
<P>
   But for years Hopkins was struggling on two related fronts. She
was engaged in the scientific fight to gain the time, resources and
knowledge to take unproven methods and make them work, and she was
waging something of a guerrilla battle along with a small band of
other senior women in science against sex discrimination at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   In large part, she seems to have won. But neither fight looks
really over.
</P>
<P>
   Though her science is a continuing source of joy to her, Hopkins
said, it also breeds a kind of parental anxiety. Every day, she
said, ``I get up and worry about the health of our fish.'' If
anything goes wrong with the fish, she said, ``It's over _ the
project is done.''
</P>
<P>
   The fish will have totaled more than 1 million by project's end.
Hopkins is aiming to isolate 1,000 of the 2,500 genes believed to
be necessary to make a normal fish, she said, and needs another
year and a half to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert A. Bosselman, the senior research director for Amgen
Inc., which stepped in to support Hopkins when federal grant-givers
said her work was too risky, said that her work looked quite
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a probability, although a small one, that she will
find some genes that are significant,'' Bosselman said. ``She has
characterized less than 10 percent of what she eventually hopes to
reveal through this approach, and I think we should just wait and
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sex-discrimination front, Hopkins and her comrades
created a national splash last year when they issued a report
saying they had documented a pattern of largely unintentional but
pervasive discrimination against women in the MIT School of
Science, and top administrators, including the dean and the
university president, backed them up.
</P>
<P>
   They found discrimination in areas that included hiring, awards,
promotions, inclusion on important committees, and allocation of
laboratory space and research money.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins was deluged with ``Here, too!'' e-mail messages from
women at other institutions, and with invitations to speak. She was
even invited to the White House, where the Clintons thanked her on
behalf of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been something of a backlash as well, including a
Wall Street Journal editorial in December calling the MIT study and
others that have followed ``junk science'' used to ``advance group
demands,'' and a report by Judith S. Kleinfeld, a University of
Alaska psychology professor who has also challenged studies that
found that schools shortchanged girls. She criticized the MIT study
as lacking data (the data were not made public, because they were
confidential) and said it amounted to ``little more than a
political manifesto.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins, though, stands behind the study. And while she praises
high-level administrators like President Charles M. Vest, who
backed her, she remains concerned about university life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until you put women in positions where they're
decision-making, I don't think you can change this problem,'' she
said. Hopkins also calls for a re-examination of the structure of
science jobs designed for men with full-time wives at home.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James D. Watson of double-helix fame, who turned Hopkins on
to biology when she was an undergraduate at Radcliffe, and who
still speaks highly of her, noted, ``Changing MIT is sort of like
changing the Citadel.'' Women have gotten in, even risen high, but
``that doesn't mean your battles are over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he added, men face similar battles, and in general,
scientists seeking resources are ``like chicks trying to get food
from the mother; the one who's biggest will get the most.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be a scrapper,'' Watson said. ``Nancy was brought
up to treat people well, and that isn't necessarily the way men
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, raised in New York, where she absorbed a slight British
intonation from her grandmother, Hopkins does seem to have learned
late how to really scrap.
</P>
<P>
   She did not demand to have it all. ``I knew it was out of the
question to have children and do this job,'' she said, ``and
probably out of the question to marry and do this job. If I hadn't
gotten divorced, I would have maybe become a mother and been very
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she embarked on an intense and successful career
studying tumor viruses, and remained in virology for 17 years, part
of a surging area of research that was delving into areas that
could bring some understanding of the genetic factors in cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember where you were standing when someone first told
you about oncogenes, just as people remember where they were when
JFK was shot,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, however, after 17 years in virology, Hopkins
wanted to shift focus. She decided on genetics. The zebra fish,
that staple of home aquarium stores, was in its infancy as a model
organism for genomics and developmental biology. The fish offered
clear advantages _ they had fast life cycles, and as vertebrates
they resembled humans more than, say, fruit flies did.
</P>
<P>
   They were also, to Hopkins, ``very cute.'' If one could just
develop the right molecular tools, she thought, how much fun it
would be.
</P>
<P>
   It is often hard to make the transition from one field of work
to another, riskier one. But when Hopkins tried, it began to seem
more than expectably hard _ it seemed, even, suspiciously hard. She
fought for more than a year to persuade her administrator to give
her even 200 square feet of work space, she said, even though she
calculated that she had less space than assistant professors did in
her building, and half of what full male professors had. Finally,
she had to go above the administrator's head.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more of the same, and in 1994 she got mad. She
turned to other senior women professors to see if the resistance
she was meeting was her imagination. It was not, they said. The
committee on women was born.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, Hopkins combined her scientific work
with activities like, as she likes to put it, tiptoeing around with
tape measures to compare men's space with women's space.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, when Hopkins ran the women's committee, she
asked for nothing for herself; but later, she said, when a
colleague was running it and her own need for space became
desperate, she appealed to the dean, who, already educated by the
committee and impressed by Hopkins' ability to raise money, helped
her.
</P>
<P>
   Her work on fairness for women only multiplied the risk of her
scientific work: If her science failed, it would seem only right
that administrators had denied her support.
</P>
<P>
   But by the fall of last year, she could tell that her technique
of inserting viruses to make the fish mutate was working; on a time
line that she sketched to chronicle her progress, she wrote,
``Sept.-Oct. (EQUALS) high point of my scientific life to date _ it
worked!!!''
</P>
<P>
   To tour Hopkins' lab is to understand why space mattered so
much. The fish tanks take up room, and scale matters in the great
genomics rally that is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christiane Nusslein-Volhard, a Nobel Prize winner from
Germany, has performed a similar gigantic screening on zebra fish,
but using chemical agents rather than viruses to produce the
mutations, so it remained tremendously difficult to isolate the
gene that had mutated.
</P>
<P>
   That ``is like knowing you're a millionaire but being unable to
find the million,'' said Dr. Phillip A. Sharp, another Nobelist
and, as chairman of the MIT biology department from 1991 to last
year, a backer of Hopkins. ``Now Nancy, at the same time she
identifies the million, she's putting a bread crumb there'' _ a tag
that marks the gene _ ``that allows her to find it quickly, and
that's what's new about her work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, he said, such work is meant to lead to an
understanding of how organs are formed that could, in turn, lead to
approaches to fight problems like kidney failure or to regenerate
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins is aiming for a sweeping picture of the genes necessary
to make an embryo, but individual members of her team and other
collaborators are focusing on specific organs _ the ear, the heart
and more. Under her deal with Amgen, the company gets a look at the
sequence of a gene before she publishes it, to see whether it is
worth patenting, she said; so far, no genes have qualified.
</P>
<P>
   She is also sharing her fish with five other laboratories that
are doing their own screenings, she said, and exploring possible
large-scale collaboration with others eager to adopt her retroviral
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Such scientific progress, in the end, is what Hopkins wants to
be known for. So the fact that the public knows her better for her
anti-discrimination work brings some interesting ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that if these 15 tenured women at MIT make the
lives of a generation of women scientists easier, that would be a
wonderful thing,'' she said. ``But my passion is really science.''
So she worries, she said, ``Will this work I've done, which is
amazing, be recognized for what it is?''
</P>
<P>
   Watson was blunter. ``The victory is hollow unless you use it to
show that you're as good and generally better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone says, `Who's doing exciting work here?' `Nancy!'
That's the real victory, doing what she wants to do, which is
science.''

SNEEZING IN THE DARK

<P>
   Q. Why don't you sneeze when you are asleep? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Nobody has specifically studied this aspect of sneezing, said
Dr. Gillian Shepherd, an allergist at New York Weill Cornell
Medical Center, but there are logical reasons that would explain
why people do not sneeze overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason people sneeze is that the inside of the nose swells
up, much like blowing up a balloon,'' Shepherd explained, ``and
when a windblown particle of anything, an allergen or just a
particle of dust, impacts the swollen lining, a sneeze results.''
When the wind blows or a door opens or a strong odor wafts in, a
sneeze is likely to be set off.
</P>
<P>
   However, in most bedrooms, there is no airflow at night, not
even anyone walking around stirring up dust, so no particles blast
the nose. Many people complain of sneezing attacks when they first
wake up, throw off the covers, open closets and stir up particles
that settled overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The nose lining actually tends to be even more swollen when
people are lying down, but the lack of a breeze protects against a
sneeze. Even with air-conditioning, Dr. Shepherd said, there is
generally a filter, so particles get stirred up only if the unit is
turned off for a while in a dusty room. In that case, the first
blast of air may throw particles at the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``An allergic person by a window in pollen season will sneeze
his head off all night,'' Shepherd said, but in that case, the
person would probably not be asleep. &QL;

   FERTILITY: American Sperm, as Hardy as Ever
</P>
<P>
   For some years now, scientists have been debating whether there
is any evidence to show that environmental problems may be causing
a significant decline in the quality of human sperm, posing a
threat to fertility.
</P>
<P>
   New findings by researchers at the University of Southern
California's Keck School of Medicine suggest that, at least for
American men, there may be no grounds for worry.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the journal Fertility and Sterility, the researchers
say they examined 1,347 men over three years and found that their
sperm quality was similar to that seen in men in a landmark study
59 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers made their observations after studying a group
of men who, with their wives, were seeking treatment for fertility
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a much-cited study reviewed 25 years of data involving
men who reported that they were fertile; it concluded that there
had been a significant decline in sperm concentration. The authors
theorized that this could have been the result of environmental
toxins. Later studies had conflicting results.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the group studied would be expected to have sperm
problem, Dr. Rebecca Z. Sokol, lead author of the report, said,
``We do interpret that it gives added credence to the idea that the
counts aren't changing.''
</P>
<P>
   They also wanted to know how many men in infertile relationships
had sperm problems. They found that about half the group had at
least one abnormality, usually involving the sperms' ability to
propel
</P>
<P>
   BEHAVIOR: Adding to the Risk for Teen-age Drivers
</P>
<P>
   The greater the number of passengers in a car driven by a 16- or
17-year-old, the higher the risk of a fatal car crash, a new study
reports. The findings appear in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, and the authors urge greater use of graduated
licensing systems that restrict young drivers' ability to carry
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The lead author, Li-Hui Chen of the School of Public Health at
Johns Hopkins, said researchers could only speculate about
explanations, but the study noted earlier research that linked
reckless driving and peer pressure. Her study did not determine how
many of the teen-agers had been drinking or the precise role the
passengers might have played in the crashes.
</P>
<P>
   For a 16-year-old carrying one passenger, the risk of death per
10 million trips was 39 percent higher than for a 16-year-old
driving alone. With two passengers, the fatality rate was 86
percent higher than with no passengers, and with three or more
passengers, it was 2.8 percent higher than with no passengers. The
figures were similar for 17-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Car crashes are the leading cause of death among American
teen-agers. The increased risk of death reported in the study was
significant across the board, regardless of time of day or the sex
of the driver, although it was especially bad for male drivers and
late at night.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reached their conclusions after reviewing
federal statistics on road deaths.
</P>
<P>
   PREVENTION: A Lifesaver That Often Goes Unused
</P>
<P>
   In a world of heart bypass surgery, angioplasty and beta
blockers, maybe aspirin just doesn't have the high-tech cachet that
patients want.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, a new study has determined that only a
quarter of patients with heart disease are regularly taking
aspirin, even though experts agree that it helps prevent new heart
attacks and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report published in Circulation, the journal of
the American Heart Association, taking aspirin cuts heart patients'
risk of future problems  &QC; by one-third by interfering with blood
clots.
</P>
<P>
   The heart association recommends that people who have had heart
attacks and those who suffer from unstable angina take aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   But because taking aspirin can bring about its own set of
problems, among them ulcers and allergic reactions, patents are
urged to discuss the situation with their doctors first.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital, the Harvard
affiliate, found that in 1996, three-quarters of those people who
might have benefited were not taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study did find that from 1980 to 1996, aspirin use
among heart patients rose to 26 percent from 5 percent. The
conclusion was based on a review of 10,942 doctor visits by people
with heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   More men than women were found to use aspirin (29 percent,
compared with &QC; 21 percent), as well as more people under age 80 (28
percent, compared with 17 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Cardiologists' patients were the most likely to report using
aspirin, with 38 percent saying they did so, compared with 12
percent for general practitioners' patients.
</P>
<P>
   STANDARDS: 6 of 13 Herbal Brands Fail a Label Test
</P>
<P>
   A test of 13 brands of a popular herbal product, Sam-e, found
that only seven had contents in keeping with the label, according
to Consumerlab.com, an online independent group that tests
supplements sold in this country. A synthetic version of a chemical
that naturally occurs in the body, Sam-e is used to treat
depression and osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The mislabeled brands had lower amounts of Sam-e and some had
far lower, said Dr. Tod Cooperman, the group's president. Cooperman
said he could not be sure whether dishonesty or simple ignorance
was behind the mislabeling. But he said it was one of the worst
cases his group had seen. Details of the testing are available at
www.consumerlab.com, the company's Web site.

PLAY IT AGAIN, EARTH  
 A FEAST TO DIE FOR  
 ICY SEARCH FOR LIFE

   Carole King had it right: the earth (italics)did(end italics)
move under her feet. In fact, it is still moving, and not just
whenever some heartthrob is around. The earth is continuously
vibrating, although at extremely low frequencies (on the order of
once every couple of hundred seconds or so) and amplitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Just what makes the earth hum has been unknown, though
scientists who confirmed the hum several years ago speculated that
the earth might be oscillating in resonance with the atmosphere.
Now, new research reported in the journal Science supports that
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, from Japan, examined how the amplitude of this
background vibration varied over 10 years, as measured continuously
by specialized seismometers. They ignored periods when strong
earthquakes sent vibrations off the scale.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the amplitude varied annually, reaching peaks in
July and August. This, of course, corresponds with summer in the
Northern Hemisphere. And they noted that convective turbulence, the
movement of warm air to the top of the atmosphere, is greatest in
northern summers (the effect in summer in the Southern Hemisphere
being more effectively mediated by oceans). All this convective
cycling, the researchers suggest, results in dynamic pressure on
the earth that keeps it humming along. &QL;

   As dedicated sushi lovers know, eating fugu (puffer fish) is
like playing chicken with death. Certain parts of the fish contain
a nerve toxin, and unless the raw fish is prepared by someone who
knows what he is doing (fugu chefs in Japan are licensed by the
government), a delicate meal of fugu might be a diner's last.
</P>
<P>
   The poison, tetrodotoxin, is produced by a bacterium in the
fish. It has been isolated from other sea creatures as well,
including squid, but even though it is a powerful poison, it leaves
puffer fish and its other hosts alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, a marine organism has been found to have been
affected by the poison. Scientists from the United States and the
Caribbean island of Curacao, studying a mass die-off of sea urchins
off Curacao in January 1997, found that the dead urchins, which had
progressively lost their characteristic spines, contained a
tetrodotoxin-producing bacterium that is closely related to the one
found in puffer fish.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported in Nature, has implications for the ecology
of coral reefs (because urchins feed on the algae around them,
helping to maintain an ecological balance), and for public health.
Urchin roe is eaten by some people. If a person ate roe from an
urchin that was dying from a tetrodotoxin outbreak, the results
could be the same as eating bad fugu. &QL;

   Lake Vostok, a huge body of fresh water under two miles of ice
in East Antarctica, has been the subject of much speculation as to
whether it harbors life.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say that it may be the earthbound equivalent of
what are thought to be ice-covered oceans on Jupiter's moon Europa,
and that if microbes can exist in the lake, then perhaps they can
exist on Europa as well.
</P>
<P>
   The lake has still not been sampled, because no one has figured
out how to reach it without contaminating it. But promising
evidence emerged last year, when ice cores taken from a drill hole
that stopped several hundred yards above the lake were shown to
contain bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   New work, reported last month in Nature, also has implications
for the prospects of life in the lake. Researchers analyzed radar
images taken in the 1970's to determine what is happening where the
lake and ice sheet meet. The data show that the ice is melting near
the western edge of the 140-mile lake, and that about 500 feet of
ice has been gained as water refreezes in the south.
</P>
<P>
   What this means, the scientists say, is that water must be
circulating, and that impurities and sediments in the ice must be
entering, and staying, in the lake, with implications for the
survival of any life that might exist there.

 OAKLAND'S DIGISCENTS PUTTING AROMAS ON THE NET  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Quick, what does the Web really need?
<P>
   If you said more eloquence and fewer dancing cursors, clearly
you don't have what it takes to be a high-stakes dot-com wheeler
and dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The right answer: Smells.
</P>
<P>
   So says an Oakland, Calif., company that has invented a computer
add-on that can produce hundreds of odors on command.
</P>
<P>
   Buying perfume online? Plug DigiScents Inc.'s iSmell into your
PC and you can sniff before you spend. Sending an e-mail love
letter? Bathe it in the aroma of a dozen roses (cheaper than the
real thing). Addicted to Soldier of Fortune? Smell the blood, sweat
and tears of your enemies as you rend them limb by limb.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds absurd.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what people in the '20s first said about the talkies,
counter Joel Bellenson and Dexster Smith, DigiScents' founders.
They have lined up $10 million in financial backing and say they
have e-commerce and game firms who are eager to give customers a
new sensory experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offers another dimension of communications, not just
automated scratch 'n' sniff,'' Smith said. Having a PC-connected
personal scent dispenser ``opens up a whole new world to the
average person.''
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, these guys can smell the money.
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents hopes to sign up licensees _ e-commerce companies
selling everything from body lotions to wine, and game firms that
want their games to be immersive experiences _ to subsidize their
$200 device, infusing the world with several hundred thousand
iSmell boxes soon after it's ready for prime time. They project
U.S. release early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having that peripheral actually print a sample for you could
be a very, very powerful way to sell fragrance on the Internet,''
said Jim Kenney, chief executive of San Francisco's Sephora.com, a
leading online store for perfume, cosmetics and body care products.
He declined to say whether Sephora would use the iSmell. And
lingering like the stench of month-old cottage cheese is the
question: Do computer users really want to sniff while they surf?
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside of the whole computing experience is that it can
be kind of sterile,'' said Jim Penhune, an analyst with the Yankee
Group in Boston. ``But also one of the nice things about this flat,
visually oriented medium is that you don't get involved with some
intrusions you deal with in daily life, like smells. I'm not sure
how many consumers will be eager to have that much smelling going
on as part of their computing experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people who are keenly aware of the olfactory world
would find it an addition to their current activities,'' said
Charles Wysocki, a neuroscientist with Monell Chemical Senses
Center, a Philadelphia research institute that investigates taste
and smell.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there might be different acceptance depending on the
context.'' Inhaling bursts of fragrance along with Web ads ``might
feel like an invasion of privacy,'' while experiencing scents in
games ``could create a heightened awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketers have begun to increasingly exploit the power of scent.
``There's a trend toward multisensory environments in retail and
public spaces,'' said Terry Molnar, director of the Olfactory
Research Fund, a New York nonprofit that funds aroma studies.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping malls pump out the smell of fresh-baked cookies or use
fir scents to stimulate thoughts of holiday presents. Used-car
dealers spray ``new car smell'' on their vehicles to send a
subliminal message that they're factory fresh. Hotels give their
lobbies a whiff of ocean spray or woods to create a welcoming
environment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Bellenson and Smith were kicking back in Florida, busy
``being retired bachelors,'' when they were ``swept away with the
sensory experience -- the ocean, suntan lotion, perfume, food,''
Bellenson said. That triggered a brainstorm: They would create a
way to digitize scents and transmit them over electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision is to empower people to gain mastery over scented
media,'' Bellenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Forget sticky, the mantra for most Web sites. These guys want to
make sites stinky.
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson and Smith envision music lovers composing ``scent
tracks'' to accompany favorite tunes and videos, people crafting
their own personal fragrances online, aromatherapy over the Net.
``Millions of people could become scentographers'' _ using scent as
a medium of self-expression _ Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents says a major corporation, ``the Disney of consumer
products'' has licensed the technology, but won't disclose its
plans for two months.
</P>
<P>
   By summer DigiScents plans to open the ``Snortal,'' a ``scented
portal'' where Web surfers can flock to engage in aromatic
behavior, like sending smelly e-mail. The company convinced
RealNetworks to add DigiScents software to its RealPlayer, which
means its 80 million users will be able to plug and play, er,
sniff, the iSmell boxes.
</P>
<P>
   And Bellenson and Smith are talking to advertising, music and
movie companies about potential deals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides licensing the technology to companies, DigiScents plans
to make money by selling replacement cartridges of ``primary
odors'' for the devices at $25 to $35 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Bellenson and Smith have traveled the startup road together
before: In 1991, they founded the Oakland biotech firm Pangea,
which makes software for researching gene sequences, and have since
bowed out of its day-to-day operations. Now renamed
DoubleTwist.com, the company is about to go public.

 DIGITIZED ODORS DON'T APPEAL TO THIS NOSE  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
I tried to stop and smell the digitally synthesized roses, really I
did.
<P>
   When DigiScents founder Dexster Smith fired up the company's
iSmell gadget for a demo, I wanted to believe. He clicked on a fir
tree icon on the computer screen and said, ``There's pine.''
</P>
<P>
   I closed my eyes briefly and tried to imagine myself romping
through a verdant forest, as if I were starring in a Clairol Herbal
Essence commercial. But the cloying blast from the device was more
like pine-scented air freshener baking in a summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   And I didn't do much better with the fruit or flowers. Smith
rolled his mouse over pictures of bananas, grapes and watermelon.
All I got from iSmell was a sickly sweet smell.
</P>
<P>
   The various floral odors were so harsh that I felt my eyes start
to tear and my throat clutch.
</P>
<P>
   A video clip of a breakfast scene from ``Pleasantville'' was
``enhanced'' with the odor of blueberry pancakes, which I could
discern as three separate, all unpleasant aromas: the fake butter
of movie popcorn, blueberry with all the subtlety of Jell-O, and a
sickly sweet smell that must have been maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Just as DigiScents promised, each scent dissipated quickly,
which made the experience more tolerable than if they had lingered.
The ability to quickly whisk away odors has been a big issue in
past attempts at linking odors and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Smell-O-Vision (a 1950s attempt at
integrating smells with movies that flopped miserably) was they
couldn't get rid of it,'' said Terry Molnar, director of the
Olfactory Research Fund, a New York nonprofit that funds aroma
studies. ``They'd pump each scent into the theater and it would
stay there, so you'd end up with a big stink.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at DigiScent, watching a video clip of ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' it was fun to smell poppies as Dorothy and the gang romped
through a field of them and the Wicked Witch crooned, ``Poppies
will put them to sleep.'' But a scene from the witch's tower with
the flying monkeys and a bubbling cauldron _ where I was treated to
essence of monkey and something else unpleasantly rancid (perhaps
eye of newt?) _ didn't do anything for me. If I wanted an odor like
that, I could just open my son's closet door and breathe deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, my senses are not the most discerning.
</P>
<P>
   I'm one of those people who fails blind taste tests and I can
never figure out what flavor the various Jelly Bellys purport to
be.
</P>
<P>
   But after my visit to DigiScents' office, I was happy to be back
out on the fresh streets of Oakland, with a breeze blowing exhaust
fumes at me from an AC Transit bus.

GAMMA RAY CRAFT EXITING IN BLAZE OF GLORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory's days are numbered. After
nine years of orbiting Earth, the $670-million, truck-size
spacecraft has lost one of its steering instruments and so will be
brought crashing back over a remote area of the Pacific Ocean on
June 3 while it can still be controlled to avoid smashing into
populated lands.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing the decision last week, officials of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration emphasized that this was a
prudent safety measure and noted that the spacecraft had already
far exceeded its expected lifetime. They acknowledged that the
imminent loss would not be popular with scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pleasant day when you have to make a conscious
decision to stop doing world-class, forefront research,'' said Dr.
Edward J. Weiler, the associate administrator for science. ``How
much science is worth the risk of even one human life?''
</P>
<P>
   Since its launching in 1991, the Compton observatory has
provided the first comprehensive view of the most powerful but
enigmatic fireworks in the universe. Gamma ray astronomy has become
a vibrant field promising new insights into cosmic evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``New discoveries made by Compton changed our view of the
universe in fundamental ways,'' said Dr. Alan Bunner, NASA's
director of cosmic studies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, astronomers lamented that the spacecraft's loss would
leave them with as many mysteries as discoveries, and they are not
likely to solve the mysteries without replacement spacecraft.
Earth's atmosphere absorbs incoming gamma rays, which is fortunate
for all living things but prevents direct ground-based
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Though invisible to the human eye, gamma rays are
electromagnetic waves with energies far greater than visible light,
ultraviolet radiation or even X-rays. They must be coming from the
most violent of cosmic phenomena: the shock waves of stellar
collisons and explosions, the rapid spin of extremely dense dead
stars, the awesome power of those gravitational sinks known as
black holes or something as yet unimagined. The sky is aglow in
gamma rays, some beaming steadily and others appearing at random in
brief bursts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Compton observatory's four telescopes has recorded
more than 2,500 of these mysterious gamma ray bursts from deep
space. Astronomers suspect that these intense bursts come from the
most powerful explosions known since the Big Bang, the theorized
explosion at the creation of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Other Compton instruments have detected and charted more than
400 examples of steady emitters of gamma rays, 10 times as many as
were previously known. The observations generally are not precise
enough to identify any objects as the sources of these radiations.
But a surprisingly large number of the sources appear to be in the
Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, as the decision to end Compton's mission was
being made, scientists reported the discovery of an apparently new
distinct group of unidentified gamma ray sources. Their findings
are described in the current Nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are objects we've never seen before,'' said Dr. Neil
Gehrels, the Compton mission's chief scientist at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the lead author of the journal
article. ``We can't make out what they are yet, but we know they're
strange and, boy, there's a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   These gamma ray emissions are steady and come from within the
Milky Way galaxy. Of the 170 yet-unidentified stable gamma ray
sources in the galaxy, about half lie in a narrow band along the
galactic plane. The other half, the ones in the newly recognized
class, are closer to Earth, a few hundred light-years away. They
lie off the galactic plane in the Gould Belt, a region filled with
gas clouds and massive stars.
</P>
<P>
   Here as in most other cases, astronomers are unable to determine
the nature of the phenomena producing the gamma ray emissions
because they cannot find any conspicuous objects shining in other
radiations near these locations.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary accompanying the Nature report, Dr. Isabelle A.
Grenier, an astrophysicist at the University of Paris, said that
the Compton scientists had shown that the gamma ray sources in the
Gould Belt ``are distinct in their intensity and spectral
properties from the sources in the plane'' of the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   These findings, Grenier concluded, ``provide compelling evidence
that the belt is an important birthplace of gamma ray sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists can only speculate on what is causing these powerful
radiations. They could be from jets of particles accelerated by
black holes. They could be from clusters of pulsars, the rapidly
spinning dense objects known as neutron stars. Or they could be
produced by huge stars 10 to 20 times as massive as the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Such stars may be ejecting high-velocity particles in the
surrounding space, and when the particles slam into gas atoms, they
could produce gamma rays. The Gould Belt is thought to be the
remnant of a violent event millions of years ago. As gas and young
stars expanded outward from the violent event, they collided with
the interstellar gases, creating shock waves bringing about the
birth of massive stars and perhaps black holes and pulsars.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists may have to wait five years for some answers to the
mysteries uncovered by the Compton observatory. The most ambitious
replacement spacecraft, the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope,
or Glast, is to be launched in 2005. But astronomers pointed out
that Glast would lack the broad survey capabilities of the Compton
observatory.

 HOW DIGISCENTS' ISMELL WORKS  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just like a printer, DigiScents' iSmell is a small device that
attaches via cable to your PC.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of graphics software that instructs a printer how to mix
red, blue and yellow inks to create the right shade of cherry red,
the DigiScents software tells the iSmell how to blend up to 128
``fragrance elements'' or ``primary odors'' to synthesize the scent
of cherries.
</P>
<P>
   But for the software to know what cherries, or anything else,
``smells'' like, someone at the firm has to digitize that specific
scent by analyzing its molecular structure and sensory properties.
This information is used to create a kind of recipe for the iSmell
to generate that odor.
</P>
<P>
   DigiScents says it has digitized about 1,000 scents so far, but
its fragrance elements potentially could generate as many as 10 to
the 128th power of odors _ far more scents than the most
sophisticated nose could recognize.

MICROCHIP HELPS A PARALYZED MAN WALK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   With an electronic microchip implanted in his back, Marc Merger,
of Strasbourg, France, is now able to take a few halting steps for
the first time in 10 years. Merger, 38, had been immobilized since
his spinal cord was severed in a car crash. In a project involving
six European nations, the IBM Corp. and French scientists, Merger's
leg muscles were stimulated by electronic charges fired by a
program stored in the chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``His first step was very difficult _ to get those muscles
moving after all that time,'' said Dr. Charles Lebesnerais, head of
IBM's laboratory in Corbeil-Essonnes, France. ``The goal,'' he
said, ``was to give people the possibility of standing and walking
a little in their apartment. Merger will have to have a great deal
of training, and we still face problems in programming the chip
with all the intelligence that goes into walking.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time paralyzed patients have been assisted
in ``step'' walking, in which leg muscles are made to respond to
electric stimuli rather than to brain impulses.
</P>
<P>
   But medical researchers said the effort to program the proper
muscle movements of walking and the electronic impulses that
trigger them was laudable. ``If 10 years down the road our efforts
to repair the spinal cord itself are not successful, a patient
might opt for this,'' said Dr. Evan Snyder of the Harvard Medical
School.

 &HT;    Researchers find stress, blood pressure link
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRBORN, Ohio _ The researchers weren't poring over data or
peering into microscopes when they made their discovery earlier
this month. They were just talking in a room where there were
laboratory mice when one of the researchers dropped a notebook.
</P>
<P>
   The noise when it landed was loud enough to startle the mice,
certainly. Mice ordinarily respond to that kind of stress with a
sudden surge in blood pressure, the same way a person would react
to an unseen firecracker going off.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we noticed in these animals there was no change in their
blood pressure,'' says Mariana Morris, a Wright State University
professor who chairs the medical school's department of
pharmacology and toxicology.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious reason probably jolted her own blood pressure. These
mice had been genetically engineered to knock a hormone out of
their systems, called oxytocin. It is associated with maternal
behavior, usually thought of as a ``women's hormone,'' but in both
mice and humans, males and females have equal amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very exciting,'' says Morris, who confirmed the
observation with data and plans to publish the finding with her
research associates. ``It's the first time, using a genetic model,
that anyone has been able to completely remove the effect of stress
on blood pressure. This could eventually give us insight into the
whole scheme by which stress affects the cardiovascular system.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris has spent her career studying how the brain regulates
blood pressure, and the implications that has on high blood
pressure. Hypertension, as it's called, affects as many as 25
percent of the American population, putting them at increased risk
for heart disease and stroke without offering symptoms to warn
them. Scientists have figured out how to control hypertension in
some people with drugs that act on the brain, but Morris says the
process that causes it still has not been fully discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The field has changed dramatically in the last five to 10 years.
Advances in biotechnology have made her work possible by providing
ways to delete or add certain proteins in animals by changing their
genes. ``This allowed us to ask the critical question,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a ``different environment'' for women in research, she
says. Morris came to Wright State from Wake Forest University in
1997 as a department head, welcoming the chance to expand and
develop the department and its research. One thing she established
was a varied team of experts in genetics, molecular biology and
pharmacology. Another was the creation of one of the first labs to
focus on how genes influence cardiovascular physiology.
</P>
<P>
   She also supplied the lab with instruments that could measure an
animal's blood pressure without disturbing it, enabling the
researchers to continuously monitor conscious mice. ``Not many labs
are looking at that,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The continuous measurements enable scientists to look at how
certain genes affect the whole body, from food and water intake to
kidney and heart function, and also to examine why heart attacks,
for example, are more likely to happen in the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   And without the constant monitoring, Morris says, the
researchers might not have noticed how stress didn't upset the mice
without oxytocin.
</P>
<P>
   Research isn't day after day of forehead-slapping moments
shouting, ``Eureka!,'' but even when the results are more
incremental, Morris says, ``You're always discovering something
new. I think we have the best job in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Morris' work has explored the impact of stress and salt
intake on the brain functions that affect blood pressure. She has
looked extensively at renin and angiotensin, hormones critical in
regulating blood pressure. They're the target of some drugs for
treating hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is interesting that some animals are very sensitive to salt
intake,'' she says. We already know that's the case with humans.
Some people can reduce their high blood pressure simply by taking
salt out of their diets. It also turns out that giving salt to
salt-sensitive mice makes their blood pressure all the more
responsive to stress.
</P>
<P>
   This information could eventually make it easier to pinpoint not
only which people can't tolerate salt, but also why they can't.
Morris says it's a step to learning how changing a gene _ through
new drugs if not new genes _ could change a person's reaction to
salt or to stressful conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to interpret results from the data is the most fun part
of the job,'' Morris says. ``You have to emphasize to students that
any finding is valid, even if it's against whatever dogma you're
testing.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important part of research, says Morris, is picking the
right question to ask. In the case of oxytocin, it was part of an
endocrine system that blood-pressure researchers have largely
overlooked. But Morris says ``I'd always been interested in the
oxytocin axis'' because any kind of stress causes oxytocin levels
to rise. The next logical thing was to look at what happens to an
animal without it.''
</P>
<P>
   She resists calling herself an explorer, but she agrees the
human body is as uncharted a frontier as the globe was 500 years
ago. ``When you're faced with the problems of how little we know
about the human body, about how drugs work, it gives you a sense of
awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Morris think it's more than a coincidence that it took
a woman researcher to zero in on this ``women's hormone.'' She's
just a scientist, like her father the Texas oil chemist and her
grandfather, the family doctor she used to visit at her dad's
childhood home in Dayton. Among Morris and her four sisters, she's
one of two with Ph.D.s and another one's a physician.
</P>
<P>
   In the boys' club that is scientific research, she says, ``I
just had to become a member of the boys' club.'' Although the
situation is improving, men still tend to play the leadership roles
nationally, and a recent study showed they still dominate medical
school department chairs out of proportion to their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only about five or six women (out of 125) chairing
anatomy departments,'' says Jane Scott, who heads Wright State's
anatomy department and joins Morris among the medical school's four
women in senior management. But at least it's no longer common for
women researchers to be asked when they're going to start a family
and how much money their husbands make, as it was when Scott was
beginning in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to look at you as a gamble,'' Scott says. ``They'd
invest this money to educate you and you would drop out of the
career track. Now people realize we can have both families and
careers.''
</P>
<P>
   So whatever prejudice still exists hasn't stopped Morris from
helping to organize a national conference on gene therapy in Boston
this June. That's an area that excites her because she believes
gene therapy might some day be used for controlling blood pressure
in humans, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way to there from the mice in her laboratory, but as
Morris puts it, ``First you have to understand how the genes
normally control physiology.'' That's her job.

   When Rachel's father died from leukemia, the 3-year-old asked
her mother, ``When is he coming back?''
</P>
<P>
   Mark, 7, complained of chest pains after his father died, and
took to wearing his father's boxer shorts and ties. ``He is gone,
kaput, he's dead,'' Mark explained to a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary, 12, was embarrassed when her mother cried at her
father's funeral, and refused to visit the cemetery in the weeks
afterward. ``Crying won't help,'' she said. ``Why should I go to
the cemetery? I talk to my father all the time anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Sigmund Freud believed that young children did not have the
capacity to mourn: The psychological tasks involved in resolving
grief, Freud asserted in ``Mourning and Melancholia,'' are too
difficult for children to negotiate. Only in adolescence, when
development is more advanced, does true grieving become possible,
he maintained.
</P>
<P>
   But a new book, based on a large-scale study by researchers at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center of families coping with the
illness and death of a parent, offers a very different
understanding of children's ability to come to terms with loss.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Healing Children's Grief: Surviving a Parent's Death From
Cancer'' (Oxford, 2000), Dr. Grace Hyslop Christ, an associate
professor in the School of Social Work at Columbia University who
was one of two principal investigators in the Sloan-Kettering
study, makes it clear that children, even very young children, do
grieve, though their grieving differs at different ages, and often
bears little resemblance to the mourning reactions of adults.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Christ, who gave her young subjects pseudonyms
in her book to protect their identities, found that given adequate
support and assistance, most of the children were able to move on
with their lives, without developing serious psychological
problems, at least for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society tends to think about this experience as either
devastating to children, that they should be kept from it, or the
opposite, that kids are resilient and will bounce back on their
own,'' Christ said. ``But we found that while children do go
through pain, they can also learn, grow and recover with the help
of supportive adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, investigators have begun to gain a greater
understanding of the impact of losing a parent early in life. Some
studies have tackled the topic retrospectively, interviewing adults
about their early experiences. Others, like the Sloan-Kettering
study, have charted children's reactions as they unfold.
</P>
<P>
   What is apparent from such studies is that losing a parent is
not a single event, which then has predictable consequences for the
child. Rather, the way a child responds to the loss is the result
of a complex interweaving of circumstances, including the emotional
responses and parenting abilities of the surviving parent and the
presence or absence of other stressors _ financial difficulties,
for example, or the death of another family member. Much also
depends on the child's own natural strengths and weaknesses, and
the child's changing relationship with the dead parent over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a kid is as vulnerable as his parents and the support
system around him,'' said Dr. Phyllis Rolfe Silverman, author of
``Never Too Young To Know: Death in Children's Lives'' (Oxford,
1999), and co-director of the Harvard Bereavement Study, a
long-term survey of 125 children who had experienced the death of a
parent.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Sloan-Kettering study, which followed 157
children, aged 3 to 17, through the parent's illness and for 14
months after the death, offers a best case example.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers not only studied the 88 families involved,
administering a battery of psychological tests and interviewing the
parents and children, as well as teachers and other family members
in some cases, but they offered the families help, providing
educational counseling and support in the months leading up to the
death and afterward.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Christ and her colleagues offered parents
suggestions of ways to handle problems with their children if such
problems emerged, and talked with the children themselves about
what they were feeling and thinking. Children who had known
psychiatric problems before the parent fell ill were excluded from
the study, since it would be difficult to tell if subsequent
difficulties were related to the parent's death.
</P>
<P>
   Under these conditions, most of the children who took part in
the study did relatively well. Of the 139 children above preschool
age, for example, 84 had returned to normal levels of functioning
at school and in relation to other family members and their peers
by 8 to 14 months after the parent's death. Another 32 were
functioning normally in all but one area, and were improving in
that area.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 23 children were either experiencing difficulties
in two or more areas and showed no sign of improvement, or had
developed new psychological symptoms since the parent's death.

</P>
<P>
   Children of different ages, Christ and her colleagues found,
coped with the parent's illness and death in very different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Preschoolers, from 3 to 5, had the most difficulty understanding
the irreversibility of death, even when they had been told ahead of
time that the parent was going to die. For weeks, or even months
after the death they would ask when their mother or father was
coming back, and they often needed very concrete explanations of
what death meant; for example, that the body no longer functioned,
and that death made people feel sad and cry.
</P>
<P>
   Once the children accepted that the parent would not return,
they often showed signs of distress, including night terrors,
bed-wetting, whining, stomach aches and intense anxiety when
separated from the surviving parent. They were upset when the
surviving parent showed strong emotions, and soon after the death,
many began to demand that their lost mother or father be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel, for example, told her mother, ``I don't have a daddy,
but everyone else has a daddy.'' She offered to be her mother's
husband, but her mother replied, ``You are my daughter and I really
want you to be my daughter.'' Rachel then suggested that perhaps
their housekeeper could be her mother's husband, and when told that
would not work, nominated the husband of her mother's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly older children, from 6 to 8, were generally quick to
appreciate the permanence of death, but they were also likely to
conclude that they were responsible for the death, or to draw other
illogical conclusions about what was happening. An 8 year-old girl
in the study, for example, did not want to talk to the researchers
about the probability that her mother would die: she was afraid
that talking about it would make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very vulnerable age,'' Christ said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the children talked explicitly about wanting to die to
be with the lost parent. But such statements, Christ said, usually
represented intense longing and an expression of grief rather than
suicidal feelings. At the same time, the children loved to talk
about the deceased parent, and to tell stories about things the
family had done together. One child, for example, cherished the
memory of how her mother squeezed her hand on the day she died.
</P>
<P>
   For children from 9 to 14, the process of mourning was more
complex, and also at times more frustrating for the surviving
parents. Many preadolescents felt in danger of being overwhelmed by
the pain they experienced. As a result, they often shoved their
feelings away, and were reluctant to talk about the death,
preferring to escape into school activities or visits with friend.
</P>
<P>
   Adolescents 12 to 14 were sometimes the hardest for the
surviving parents to reach. Their egocentricity could be shocking
to parents coping with their own grief: a 13-year-old, told of her
father's diagnosis, went out to a party with friends. ``What was I
supposed to do?'' she said to her mother. ``Stay home and cry?''
</P>
<P>
   Most did not want to hear about the parent's death, or to learn
about the nature of the illness. One boy told his mother, who kept
trying to keep him informed about his father's condition, ``I want
a report every three days unless something else happens.''
</P>
<P>
   They missed the parent as a caretaker, and also as a role model.
But they hated the idea of showing emotion. ``The mantra of this
age group was `I cry, but in my room alone,''' Christ said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the oldest children in the study, she continued, those
from 15 to 17, who most resembled adults in their approach to
death. Many went through a sustained period of grief immediately
after the death. They were able to be helpful and supportive to
surviving parents _ sometimes so much so that the parent forgot
that the child was still a child.
</P>
<P>
   For all age groups, the researchers found, children who adjusted
most successfully had parents who were communicative and shared
information about what was going on. Children in families where the
parents refused to acknowledge or deal with the death, or where the
loss was compounded by other stresses _ money, the illness of other
family members, a surviving parent's plunging into severe
depression _ had more trouble coping. In many cases, children in
the study reported more stress and anxiety in the period before the
parent died than afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Albert Cain, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan who has studied bereaved children, praised the
Sloan-Kettering study for its insights into the ways children deal
with a forthcoming death.
</P>
<P>
   But he pointed out that because of the counseling offered to the
families, it was difficult to tell how much of the later adjustment
of the children was due to the intervention and how much to other
factors, like the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   And he cautioned that there was still much to learn about the
long-term effects of the death of a parent in early life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all agreed that no one walks away from that
without enduring scars,'' he said, ``but the issue is the extent to
which you get continuing _ if not escalating _ interference with
development or distortions of adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Christ said that one of the most interesting findings of
the study was that some parents who had serious psychological
difficulties before a spouse died still managed to pull themselves
together and prove very effective in parenting their children after
the death.
</P>
<P>
   And while many dying parents worried that their children would
remember them in the worst stages of their illness, Christ found
that more often, the reverse proved to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children really focused on the positive aspects of the
parent,'' she said, and they often worked to construct an image of
the parent that they could remember and take with them into their
later lives.

<P>
   Astronomers at Ohio State University have photographed feeding
frenzies at the hearts of a score of galaxies, images of gas and
dust draining into what may be black holes like water spiraling
down a bathtub drain.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard W. Pogge and Paul Martini used an infrared camera on
the Hubble Space Telescope to take pictures of the centers of 24
bright nearby galaxies suspected of harboring black holes and
combined them with visible-light images in order to compensate for
the brightness of the stars and to bring out the faint dust clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting images of 20 of the galaxies show dust swirling
around a center where, presumably, a black hole is gobbling it up.
</P>
<P>
   The research, Pogge said, will give theorists something to work
on. ``Nobody's ever done a systematic assay of the centers of these
galaxies,'' he said. ``We're seeing structures we would expect for
what the theorists tell us would be plausible.''
</P>
<P>
   Among many questions, Pogge said, is why material falls into
these black holes and not into others (including the black hole
that is thought to be at the center of the Milky Way). The spiral
arms of the clouds may be evidence of some kind of shock that
occurs that robs the dust of enough of its orbital energy so that
it starts to fall inward.

LINKING CHILDREN'S HEALTH TO FAMILY MEALS 
</HEADLINE>
 TOGETHER-NYT   (The Science Times)

 By RANDI HUTTER EPSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Psychologists have long praised the family meal as an
opportunity for conversation and bonding. Now a large Harvard study
shows that children who eat with their parents frequently may have
healthier eating habits than those who rarely do.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which included more than 16,000 children of nurses
and was published this month in Archives of Family Medicine, found
that children who had family meals were one and a half times as
likely to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables every day as
those who rarely ate with parents. A nutritional analysis of the
diets showed that children who ate with their parents frequently
had the highest intake of many important nutrients, like calcium,
fiber, folate, iron and vitamins B and E.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible moms and dads are serving healthy food at the
meal,'' said Dr. Matthew W. Gillman, the lead investigator of the
study. ``But it is also possible that children get the idea of
health and nutrition by role modeling or by discussing nutrition,
and then using this information in their daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillman, an associate professor of ambulatory care and
prevention at Harvard Medical School, stressed that the study
should not be read as a condemnation of working parents, since
nearly all the mothers in the study were employed and the
differences were found among them. The study did not address what
the children of nonworking parents ate.
</P>
<P>
   The survey included 8,677 girls and 7,525 boys, ages 9 to 14,
who were asked about their daily food consumption. They were not
asked specifically about dinner. The participants were children of
volunteers in the Nurses' Health Study II, a continuing health
survey of more than 116,000 women in nursing.
</P>
<P>
   The children were divided into three groups: those who ate
dinner as a family every day; most days, or barely at all.
Investigators found that the more families ate together, the more
fruits and vegetables and the less fried food were consumed. There
was no difference in the amount of dairy or beef eaten.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that children who ate family dinners often
tended to have healthier diets throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of teaching your children good habits, the dinner
table is great,'' said Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, an associate
professor of clinical pediatrics and medicine at New York
Presbyterian Hospital at Columbia University, who did not
participate in the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like saying, `do your homework before television,'''
he added. ``It's a fun way to teach healthy habits. No one can set
a better example regarding healthy eating than parents. And there
is a tremendous amount of data to show that healthy habits learned
early persist into adulthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Loraine Stern, co-editor of ``The American Academy of
Pediatrics Guide to Your Child's Nutrition'' (Villard, 1999), said:
``We know that families that sit together and have civilized meals
can instill better eating habits. It's not because parents are more
directive about what children eat, because that can be
counterproductive to be so controlling. It's because when parents
share meals, it usually means there are more healthful choices on
the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, wondered whether the findings from this study fit
the average American family.
</P>
<P>
   For one, all of the participants are sons and daughters of
nurses, who may be more likely to talk about nutrition than parents
who are not health professionals. Second, the vast majority of
volunteers were white, who may have a different diet than other
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience is that there are some differences in what
families consider healthy foods that have to do with ethnicity that
this survey would miss,'' said Dr. Joseph Levy, a professor of
clinical pediatrics at Columbia University and Babies and
Children's Hospital at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's different for nurses who want to make the meal a
teaching experience,'' he said. ``But I do think it's a very
interesting attempt to find out whether the presence of parents in
the house at the time of the meal has an impact on health habits
and what is consumed.''
</P>
<P>
   Such thoughts, of course, will come as little surprise to many
parents, working or not, or even many children. One parent called
it ``news from the science of duh.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Baldwin, a television producer and mother of three in
London, said her children persuaded the baby sitter recently to
serve their favorite meal: spaghetti mixed with French fries,
having told her that was what their mother ``always made for
dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   A 6-year-old in New York City said simply that meal times were
``more fun'' when his parents were not home _ macaroni and cheese
with a slice of pizza.

I'M OK, YOU'RE ... ODD: A GUIDE TO ECCENTRICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if there were not enough to sort out in life, now comes this:
How do we know if we are merely odd, truly eccentric or completely
insane?
</P>
<P>
   And is eccentricity a steppingstone to total madness?
</P>
<P>
   Those are the questions raised in the recently released book
``The Mammoth Book of Oddballs and Eccentrics'' (Carroll &AMP; Graf
Publishers, $11.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``As (normal) human behavior ranges from rigid conformity at one
end of the scale to utterly bizarre nonconformity at the other, how
do we know whether someone is eccentric, quietly neurotic or
completely barking mad?'' asks author Karl Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw sets up a three-tier categorization of weird behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Most extreme is madness, which is behavior that would be
considered insane no matter which era. It may have eccentricity as
one of its outward signs, but it is different. It is often tragic
and hopeless. In this category, we could file the chilling example
of Jeffrey Dahmer.
</P>
<P>
   Next is eccentricity, which according to Shaw is compulsive,
usually with the eccentric entirely unaware or indifferent to the
fact that his or her behavior seems weird.
</P>
<P>
   Eccentricity flourishes in tolerant environments, thus often is
the hallmark of the powerful or the secluded. With tolerance as a
prerequisite, eccentricity occurs more frequently among men than
among women, Shaw writes. Under the category of eccentrics, think
of Matthew McConnaughey playing the bongos naked in his Austin-area
home.
</P>
<P>
   Subcategories exist. On one level, we have those who are
blissfully unaware. On the other, we have those who carefully
cultivate their eccentricities. Salvador Dali's walking his ocelot
on a leash is considered by Shaw to be a studied form of
eccentricity, kind of a funny public relations attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes mere oddness, a kind of going against the flow of
current decorum or trends. Think of the unisex bathroom on TV's
``Ally McBeal'' (although the cast itself is a study in
eccentricity).
</P>
<P>
   Shaw amasses 483 pages describing the acts of history's
dysfunctional rulers, strange scientists, peculiar performers and
unhinged politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Here, from Shaw's books, are several comforting examples that
may make you feel you aren't so odd yourself:
</P>
<P>
   Legal eccentrics: Texas state District Judge Charles Hearn of
Houston, who signed a death warrant and next to his signature drew
a happy face. A defense attorney in 1993 complained, saying the
happy face was akin to saying ``Have a Nice Death,'' but Hearn said
he had always included happy faces next to his signature as an
expression of his Christian beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Also: In 1972, a Los Angeles judge awarded $4,500 in damages to
the owner of an elephant called Bimbo. The judge ruled that as a
result of injuries received in a road accident, Bimbo had
completely lost interest in dancing and water skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Religious eccentric: The Shrine of the Weeping Shirley MacLaine
is situated in the Beta Israel Temple in Los Angeles. It was
inspired by a vision a man had while traveling in the actress's
private jet. He said he saw a large photograph of him with
MacLaine, and she was shedding tears.
</P>
<P>
   Creative eccentrics: Gustav Mahler (1860-1911) was famous for
his funeral marches. He wrote his first when he was 6 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Ferdinand Flocan (1800-66) made it his life's ambition to render
the French Civil Code more accessible by turning all 22,891
articles, statutes, amendments and annotations into a 120,000-word
poem. He died in obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican entertainer Ramon Barrero played the world's smallest
harmonica until 1994, when in midperformance he inhaled a D-minor
and accidentally choked to death.
</P>
<P>
   Eccentric genius: Alexander Graham Bell tried to teach his dog
to talk. He also kept his windows permanently covered to keep out
the ``harmful rays'' of the full moon.
</P>
<P>
   Political eccentric: Charles Watson-Wentworth served as prime
minister of England during the reign of King George III. He was an
eccentric gambler who once organized a race from Norwich, England,
to London between five geese and five turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   Also, U.S. President Chester A. Arthur owned 80 pairs of
trousers, changed clothes several times a day and was known as
``Elegant Arthur.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminally eccentric: In Toronto, Canada, in 1993, one man beat
another to death after an argument got out of hand over which of
them had the longer criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a German filmgoer was beaten to death by ushers in a
Bonn cinema because he had brought his own popcorn.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Amid concern nationally about the scarcity of
women in the high ranks of major research centers, a University of
California at San Francisco scientist is charging that the male
power structure on campus has made it impossible for her to work
there.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiologist Sally Blower, an associate adjunct professor who
has published in leading scientific journals, is leaving UC-San
Francisco to become a full tenured professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles in July. Early last month, she sent a
scathing e-mail to a British medical journal and several
colleagues, accusing two leading UC-San Francisco scientists of
misconduct and bullying.
</P>
<P>
   But some who have dealt with Blower during her five years on
campus say she has been demanding and impossible to please. In
addition, faculty and administrators interviewed for this story
said the school went to great lengths to accommodate Blower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is not always fair,'' said Diane Ware, the
associate dean for minority and women's affairs. ``But in this
particular case I truly believe the institution has gone further to
try and accommodate an individual, almost more than I can
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Blower's accusations have been the talk of the campus since
Nature Medicine, a top scientific journal published monthly,
followed up on her charges by sending a ``straw poll'' to female
faculty at UC-San Francisco asking if they had experienced gender
discrimination or harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The survey irritated some recipients, who objected to a
scientific journal conducting what amounted to an unscientific
poll.
</P>
<P>
   As the matter became public, Chancellor J. Michael Bishop asked
Zina Mirsky, associate dean of the school of nursing, to
investigate Blower's e-mail allegations. Late Thursday, Bishop
announced in an e-mail sent to the faculty that Mirsky found no
wrongdoing nor any evidence of sexism against Blower.
</P>
<P>
   Blower, 42, a native of Britain who attended the University of
Edinburgh and received her doctorate from Stanford, has neither
brought formal charges nor filed a lawsuit. She called the internal
investigation ``a complete and utter sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of gender bias have dogged UC-San Francisco and
other big research institutions for several years. The highly
competitive environment of academic medicine, full of big egos and
powerful department chairs, is known to be especially hard on
women.
</P>
<P>
   While women make up almost half of all medical students in the
United States, they are barely visible in the upper reaches of
medical academia.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found
evidence of widespread sex bias at UC-San Francisco in 1993 when it
reinstated and awarded $200,000 in back pay to a psychiatrist who
was laid off and whose job was given to a less qualified man.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1997, UC-San Francisco paid $1.5 million to a former
medical professor who filed a wrongful termination and sex
discrimination suit, charging she was made a scapegoat for
financial practices put in place by higher-ranking men.
</P>
<P>
   But UC-San Francisco is far from alone among high-powered
academic institutions in struggling with charges of sexism.
</P>
<P>
   A respected brain surgeon at Stanford University two years ago
published a book about her experiences with sexual harassment and
discrimination there. A Stanford research scientist is now suing
the university, claiming she was reduced to a ``girl Friday,'' and
then fired for complaining about sex discrimination at the medical
school.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, women throughout the University of
California system formed an organization called WAGE (We Advocate
Gender Equity) to combat what they saw as widespread
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   WAGE board member Marjorie Mosier, who worked at UC-Irvine, said
Blower's story rings true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly what the rest of us have experienced in spades,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the men accused say they are baffled by Blower's charges,
which they strongly deny.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the dean of the School of Medicine, Haile Debas, said
he did more on her behalf than he has done for any other faculty
member.
</P>
<P>
   Even the head of the school's affirmative action office, who has
been sympathetic to Blower, called her portrayal of events
``overblown and out of perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   In the lengthy e-mail, Blower complained that she and her
postgraduate assistants had been relocated four times in five
years. In one case, Blower said she was evicted because she refused
to give honorary authorship to a male scientist who had not worked
on nor funded any of her research.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he `owned me,''' Blower wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Moss, the researcher accused, called the charges
``disturbing and baseless.'' He said she was asked to move from his
space because their collaboration had ended, and she was planning
to expand her research group.
</P>
<P>
   Like many faculty, Blower has had problems getting space. The
Parnassus campus is so crowded that about half the epidemiology and
biostatistics department is housed in a building downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Department Chairman Stephen B. Hulley said after Blower and Moss
dissolved their collaboration, he offered her space downtown, but
she declined. Blower said no such offer was made, and she worked
out of her home, where she lives with her husband and two sons, for
several months.
</P>
<P>
   In her e-mail, Blower said she asked Hulley to intervene but
that he declined ``and said Andrew could do what he liked.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulley does not recall her telling him that Moss had sought to
be named as an author on research he had nothing to do with.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she had brought a complaint to me, I would have had to
investigate it,'' Hulley said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Blower said that when her complaints reached
Debas, he apologized on behalf of the university and offered to set
her up with a better position within the Department of Medicine. He
also granted her $30,000 from his discretionary fund for her
research, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Debas said he has repeatedly tried to satisfy Blower, whose
husband, Nelson Freimer, has been a key part of UC-San Francisco's
human genetics program. He, too, is leaving for the Los Angeles
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what we did, we did to retain her husband,'' Debas
said.
</P>
<P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Blower is unquestionably an accomplished scientist, Debas
said her work in the mathematical modeling of disease epidemics did
not coincide with other areas of research at UC-San Francisco,
complicating efforts to find her a permanent home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Debas said he prevailed upon Department of Medicine Chairman Lee
Goldman to find a place for her. Blower said her first interview
with Goldman was humiliating and offensive.
</P>
<P>
   She said Goldman told her that she would be on probation for a
year while they ``dated,'' during which he would evaluate whether
she could stay on. During that time she needed to make him
``happy,'' but when she asked what criteria he would use to judge,
she said it became clear that it was not based on scholarly
achievement _ though he would not say.
</P>
<P>
   She said she left the office and turned him down through an
e-mail response. She said Goldman later summoned her to his office
and yelled at her for defying him.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Coates, head of the UC-San Francisco AIDS Research
Institute, also was there at Goldman's request, Blower wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, she said, ``was for Dr. Goldman to make very clear
to me that a) he is a very powerful man, b) he can do exactly what
he wants, and c) even when I have a witness they will not speak
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman could not be reached for comment. But in an e-mail
response also widely circulated, he denied her accusations and has
demanded a retraction.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Coates has an entirely different recollection of
events. He was there because Blower was to be assigned to his
division within the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like other meetings I've attended of that nature, in
which things are explained'' about an offer of employment, Coates
said. ``I think Dr. Goldman explained things in a very
businesslike, professional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates added that after the meeting, Blower burst into tears,
which he found baffling. Like others, he said he worked hard to
accommodate her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was offered much more than any other faculty in my unit,''
Coates said.
</P>
<P>
   Blower said that since Coates works under Goldman, he is afraid
to speak out against his powerful chair. She claims she took her
complaints to many throughout the university's hierarchy to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   She said she contemplated filing suit, but believed it would be
costly and drag on for years.

REMOVAL OF DIABETES DRUG MEETS WITH MIXED FEELINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mo., Mass.)  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The removal of the diabetes drug Rezulin from the market did not
come soon enough to help Monica George, a 68-year-old former nurse
in Rockville, Md.: The drug had already caused her death, her
daughters said. But its removal upset Frank Hopkins, a Virginia
horse-farm owner, who said it had greatly improved his health and
brought his diabetes under control.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the drug by the Food and Drug Administration last
week brought anger, confusion and a stream of questions. Doctors
and patients alike asked whether the agency had approved the drug
too quickly, without regard to the severe liver damage it could
cause. When liver failure and deaths began to occur, did the agency
act too slowly in removing the drug? If so, why?
</P>
<P>
   The FDA approved Rezulin in March 1997 as the first of a class
of drugs called insulin sensitizers that help the body respond more
effectively to its own insulin production, thereby reducing the
patients' need to give themselves insulin shots. It was prescribed
heavily and almost immediately: By last week 1.5 million patients
had used it, and it had generated $1.7 billion in sales for the
manufacturer, Parke-Davis, a subsidiary of Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the evidence was clear in the clinical trials
that Rezulin could cause severe liver problems but that the agency
had approved it for marketing without proper warnings or
recommendations that it be monitored. Eight months later, after
problems arose, warnings of liver problems and recommendations that
patients be closely monitored were issued.
</P>
<P>
   By March of last year 26 deaths had occurred and by last week
the number had risen to 63, with a total of 90 cases of liver
failure reported, of which 14 resulted in a need for transplants.
The FDA advised patients to talk to their doctors about what they
should do next. Since Rezulin was introduced, two similar
medications have been put on the market with less risk, Actos and
Avandia.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA defends its actions in both approving and then
withdrawing the drug, saying it was unfair to suggest in hindsight
that it could have predicted what happened. In some cases, the
agency says, the liver failure happened so fast that even close
monitoring would not have prevented it.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients interviewed were angry that the drug was approved
so quickly, but in the end they generally regarded the drug's
removal as good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This needed to happen,'' said Elaine M. Shaw, a
special-education nurse in Charlottesville, Va., and one of Monica
George's three daughters. ``It does not bring my mother back, but I
think it will save lives.'' Shaw said that her mother, a geriatric
nurse, was ``savvy about her own liver function and she knew she
had elevated liver enzymes _ but she did not know there were
concerns about liver toxicity with the new drug.''
</P>
<P>
   George was a ``vibrant, healthy woman, in a good place with her
life, traveling, enjoying grandchildren,'' her daughter said, when
she was put on Rezulin in November 1997. But she then began to
complain of fatigue, weight gain, poor circulation and other
symptoms associated with liver problems. Her doctor at the time,
Shaw said, told her mother that fatigue was normal, but he did not
check her liver function and kept her on Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   George switched doctors and was promptly taken off the drug in
August 1998, but after several weeks of intense suffering she died
of severe liver damage, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the day after the FDA acted, Elaine Shaw and her
sisters, Andrea Shaw and Donna Louise George Storey, filed suit
against the first doctor and Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis. In the
suit, they said the company's clinical trials showed the drug could
cause ``serious liver damage leading to death or requiring liver
transplant.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughters said that Rezulin was initially marketed without
warnings or explanations sufficient to reflect the severity of
possible liver problems, but that eight months later the company
added information about possible toxic effects and recommended
monitoring patients' liver conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, the suit says, the labeling was changed again to
say that ``cases of liver failure leading to death and liver
transplants had been reported, and that injury occurred after both
short-term and long-term use of Rezulin.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's lawyers, at Littlepage &AMP; Associates of Houston, said the
company deliberately withheld important information needed by
doctors and their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ford, a spokesman for Warner-Lambert, said he could not
comment on the specifics of the Monica George lawsuit. But in
regard to claims of adverse reactions, he said the company had
``adequately warned about the risks associated with the product,''
and he said that it intended ``to vigorously defend any lawsuits.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Shirley Griggs, 66, of Smithville, Mo., the adverse reaction
was severe. She said that after she was put on Rezulin, she gained
43 pounds, but that her doctors failed initially to detect liver
damage. By the time she was taken off the drug, she said, she was
in constant pain and her liver was crippled. She is now on a
transplant list but ``thousands are ahead of me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there is little doubt that the drug helped some.
Frank Hopkins, who raises racehorses in Darlington, Md., said that
when his blood-sugar levels became high and his doctors could not
bring it down, they referred him to Dr. Christopher D. Saudek, head
of the diabetes center and professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Saudek, he said, put him on Rezulin in 1998, which brought the
blood sugar down, but he also checked blood samples and liver
function monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said he was upset that the drug was being withdrawn. ``I
think the number of people who have received a negative reaction is
so minimal, so why should the rest of us have to suffer?'' he said.
But he said he was relieved to learn that similar but less risky
drugs had become available.
</P>
<P>
   Saudek said that in general the insulin sensitizers were an
``exciting new class of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Beaser, at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, and
others said that patients were rightfully angry and confused but
that it was important not to allow that to erode confidence in the
drug-approval process. ``I am concerned about the process and so
are my patients. If it was legitimate, fine, but we need
reassurance,'' he said. ``And if it was not, there needs to be an
investigation to find out why and restore confidence in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Whitty, 54, a first-grade teacher from Walpole, Mass., has
not lost confidence. ``Three years ago, I was giving myself insulin
injections, once in the morning, once at night,'' she said. ``This
is not really such an easy thing.'' Dr. James Rosenzweig at the
Joslin clinic put her on Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within just a few months,'' she said, ``I was able to come off
the shots completely.''
</P>
<P>
   For Whitty, Rezulin's removal was not a problem. She simply
switched to the more recently introduced Actos, the same type of
drug as the one she said had changed her life. ``I can't tell you
how grateful I am,'' she said.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS DEVISE A PLAN TO RESCUE CORAL REEFS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government has issued a long-term plan
to save coral reefs along the coast of the United States and its
territories, setting aside many sites as ecological preserves over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for 20 percent of all coral reefs in
American-controlled waters to be designated ecological preserves by
2010, protecting them from pollution, fishing and other activity
that could harm the reefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Protecting 20 percent of all U.S. reefs and other decisive
actions called for in the new plan is crucial because two-thirds of
the world's reefs may be dying,'' said D. James Baker, the
undersecretary for oceans and atmosphere at the Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``If current conditions continue,'' Baker said, ``an alarming 70
percent of the world's reefs may be gone by 2050. This rapid
decline represents a serious threat to businesses, consumers,
communities and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Corals are tiny plant-like animals that thrive only in clean,
clear water with plenty of sunlight. They gradually build coral
skeletons that form the elaborate reefs that then become home to
thousands of fish, lobsters, sea turtles and other species.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has about 6,500 square miles of coral reefs,
mostly off Florida, Texas, Hawaii and around American territories
in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The reefs are particularly vulnerable because they prosper in
shallow water near shore, which exposes them to pollution from
marine debris and chemicals, overfishing and destructive actions
like fishing with cyanide and dynamite, vessel grounding and
anchoring, and even global climate change.
</P>
<P>
   This year's budget contains the first federal money directed
toward saving the coral reefs: $6 million to the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration and $5 million to the Interior
Department. President Clinton has requested $25 million for the
2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate effort, the National Park Foundation, a nonprofit
partner of the National Park Service, is studying the effectiveness
of transplanting healthy fragments of coral to damaged reefs in the
waters of the Virgin Island National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to jump-start reef recovery by transplanting
healthy, naturally occuring, broken-off pieces of fast-growing
coral species to new locations where they are more likely to
survive,'' said Ginger Garrison, the project's principle
researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs and their ecosystems support billions of dollars of
tourism each year, federal officials said, with over a billion
dollars generated in the Florida Keys alone. The reefs' value of
the reefs for commercial and recreational fishing is nearly $200
million a year. In all, reef-related activities generate as much as
$375 billion annually, the Commerce Department says.
</P>
<P>
   They are also considered as possible sources of new medicines.
</P>
<P>
   And, they are natural buffers along shorelines protecting
against erosion and property damage.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ecological preserves, the plan sets goals for
mapping all coral reefs in the United States by 2009. The oceanic
administration also wants to create a national monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
   But commercial and recreational fishing interests, concerned
about fishing bans, are seeking alternatives, possibly including,
catch-and-release policies in protected areas.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Cameron, a tournament fisherman from Morehead City, N.C.,
said a ban on fishing and other activities would be too extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a need to protect the resources,'' said Cameron, who
fishes extensively along the coasts of Virginia, North Carolina,
Florida and Texas. ``But a ban would be devastating for the people
who fish and dive on the reefs. It would absolutely devastate the
Keys.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger T. Rufe, president of the Center for Marine Conservation
in Washington, applauded the action, but he said that more needed
to be done to combat water pollution, including legislation that
would provide sufficient money for a plan ``to ensure complete
protection and conservation'' of coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Sobel, a program director at the center, pointed out that
for a resource that provides many billions of dollars of revenue,
the money proposed in the plan was ``limited and shortsighted,''
only a first step toward appreciating ``the real value of the coral
reefs.''

 &HT;    MUBARAK: EGYPT OPEN FOR HIGH -TECH BUSINESS
 &HT;    Moving in (i) International and (f) financial categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HERNDON, Va. - Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Monday said he
wants to establish his country as a leader in the Middle East's
push into the new, Internet-driven economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this major crossroads in human history, the peoples of the
Middle East cannot be by-passed or marginalized,'' Mubarak said.
``They are determined to be integrated in the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of a week-long visit to Washington D.C., the Egyptian
leader visited the high-tech hotbed of Northern Virginia. Speaking
at a luncheon attended by hundreds of tech industry executives and
local congressmen, he called the United States a ``most qualified
and trusted partner'' in business matters, and urged Americans to
strengthen economic ties to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   These ties have already worked well for Egypt's Middle East
neighbor, Israel, which has won global recognition as a high-tech
hotbed.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mubarak pointed to several reasons why his country
would make a good home for technology-driven companies.
</P>
<P>
   First, ``our society has become aware of the need for
information technology'' and is eager to use it. A high-tech
business that invests there will not only find eager customers, but
will gain access to a larger regional market. ``Egypt is a gateway
to the Middle East and Africa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Egypt is rich in human resources,'' he said. Last
year, colleges there graduated 154,000 people. ``These graduates
are the most important components of a successful information
technology industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak also said his country offers packages of tax breaks and
other incentives to investors.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, he noted that the government is creating national
databases and information networks to better link the country to
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to progress is long and difficult,'' he said. ``But
we are lucky; we have the resources and we have the will and we
have the friends'' in the United States to help make technology
blossom in Egypt.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ With John McCain off the bus and back in the
Senate, and George W. Bush back in Texas and off to try to avenge
his father's 1992 defeat, reporters with time on their hands are
musing about whether Bush can woo McCain voters.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Bush had better hurry. Someone else has his eye on them.
Patrick J. Buchanan, the fearless storyteller, is known for
stirring the pot, challenging convention and going against the
grain. Now pursuing the presidential nomination of the Reform
Party, Buchanan is targeting the followers of McCain, who built a
presidential campaign on stirring the pot, challenging convention,
and going against the grain. A recent ``Newsweek'' poll suggests
that McCain voters are up for grabs. Only 41 percent of McCain
voters said they would support Bush, while 48 percent sooner would
back Al Gore. So much for the allure of campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alibi Al'' outdid himself when questioned about 45 illegal
phone calls made from his office. Gore, who has denied a
``controlling legal authority'' over the calls, told investigators
that he drank iced tea during briefings and could have been in the
men's room when the law was discussed: The vice president's defense
has gone from no legal control to no bladder control.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's control over McCain supporters is just as weak. Chaos
brings opportunity, and Buchanan sees in such chaos an opportunity
to market himself as the reformer in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan began the marketing campaign at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government. Gone was the humorless, combative and
intolerant firebrand who in 1992 declared the country engaged in a
``culture war.'' In his place, stood a kinder and gentler Pat
Buchanan eager to discuss what he called the ``only real issue'':
campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Like a boxer alternating between rights and lefts, Buchanan
rattled off abuses by both parties. Moving from Maria Tsia to the
Wyly brothers to the Buddist Temple, he confused the audience,
which must have felt like booing one minute and cheering the next.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Washington is hooked on money, and neither party
can kick the addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither Beltway party is going to drain this swamp, because to
them it isn't a swamp at all, but a protected wetland and their
natural habitat,'' he told the audience. ``They swim in it, feed in
it and spawn in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan called for campaign contributions to be voluntary and
come from individuals, not corporations or unions. He also said
members of Congress should have to raise half of their funds within
their districts.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of students tried to use Buchanan's own words against
him with questions about things he had written. That was easy. The
guy's paper trail is a four-lane highway. Self-identified Democrats
who in 1992 excused Bill Clinton's marijuana use and draft-dodging
as youthful indiscretions rushed to judge Buchanan for words
scribbled 20 years ago. Buchanan didn't flinch, equivocate or claim
that he was in the bathroom. Asked about a column in which he wrote
that ethnic Catholics and Christians are underrepresented and
discriminated against at Harvard, Buchanan tossed the grenade back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply because you're at Harvard does not exempt you from the
same kind of rules and regulations that Harvard lovingly imposes
upon the rest of America,'' he said. ``Pat Buchanan is not a
beloved figure in America, but neither is Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan didn't take any guff from the Ivy Leaguers. And they
loved it. Given that a recent poll by the school's Shorenstein
Center found that 87 percent of respondents believed politicians
will say anything, Buchanan scored points for saying what he
believed and challenging listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Who does that sound like? No wonder Buchanan thinks he has a
shot at McCain supporters. If America really wants straight talk,
then the talk doesn't get any straighter than coming from Pat
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The inference will be unsettling to McCain, who has been a harsh
critic of Buchanan. The lads can't even agree on World War II.
After Buchanan raised the question of whether the United States
needed to go to war against Hitler, McCain, whose grandfather
commanded operations in the Pacific, fumed. Asked by a reporter if
he thought Buchanan should leave the Republican Party, McCain said,
``Mr. Buchanan has already left my Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   When Buchanan did leave, McCain wished him good riddance with
the words of a country music song: ``Thank God and Greyhound,
you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The similarities, and differences, between the two men raise a
question: If Buchanan gets the Reform Party nomination, how will
his third-party candidacy go over in McCain's back yard of Arizona?
In a state divided into haves and have-not, Buchanan's populist
reform message may play well with those who feel disconnected from
the political process, like the poor, the young, and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast, says a former Arizonan who attended Buchanan's
speech. Anthony Chavez, a 1997 graduate of Arizona State University
and now a public-policy student at the Kennedy School, acknowledges
that Buchanan's message of reform, limited government and
protection for the working class might appeal to some in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Buchanan's makeover as a reformer can't cover up
his views on immigration, English-only or affirmative action _
views that will hurt him with Arizona Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   As will his criticism of government: To a lot of Hispanics,
government is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government helps people achieve their goals, and Buchanan's
anti-government rhetoric isn't likely to help him with those kinds
of voters,'' Chavez said. True enough. Buchanan's dug his grave
with some folks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Arizona and across the country, voters aren't as
easily shocked as they used to be. They're tired of politics as
usual and of the usual politicians. As McCain proved, they don't
want pandering, but honesty and leadership. They want a change from
Clinton-Gore, but they may not be ready for another George Bush.
They do want choices. After years of going against the grain,
Patrick Buchanan now may be coming along at just the right time. &QL;

   Bill Muller takes a quick look at some current magazine issues
and a website:
</P>
<P>
   ``KMT'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Egypt 'R' Us. If seeing ``The Mummy'' just wasn't enough, check
out this quarterly publication, subtitled ``A Modern Journal of
Ancient Egypt.'' (KMT is the spelling of the name for Egypt in
ancient Egyptian.) The spring issue includes a story on the Museum
of Mummification in Luxor (Egyptian city, not Vegas casino).
Article notes that only the most independent traveler stumbles on
Luxor's best-kept secret, the first museum of its kind, dedicated
solely to the ancient art of preserving bodies (the Dick Clark wing
is a must-see). Turns out that mummification was not limited to
humans. The Egyptians also preserved animals, including crocodiles,
cats and apes. Also includes an interesting piece on the
restoration of six tombs in the Valley of the Kings, with color
photos of the brilliantly painted interiors, pillars and
sarcophagi. Of course, the exhibits are limited to items not swiped
by the British, who carted away Egypt's antiquities by the boatload
around the turn of the 20th century. Blimey! &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MOTHER JONES'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're all fired up to vote for George W. Bush this fall, you
might skip this month's issue, in which Molly Ivins knocks Dubya
off his pins with an adaption from her book, ``Shrub: The Short But
Happy Political Life of George W. Bush.'' With more clarity and
brevity than the recent tree-killer in ``Harper's,'' Ivins manages
to outline how Bush parlayed his family name into big money by
bouncing from loser company to loser company, always to be bailed
out in the end. ``In oil, as in politics, Dubya's MO is
consistent,'' Ivins writes. ``Leverage the family name and a small
investment into really big money, always provided by others.''
Ivins also notes that Bush flipped his oil companies, unloaded
stock as a corporate insider before the price plummeted and walked
away with ``more money than Bill Clinton ever dreamed of making on
a little real-estate deal now known as Whitewater.'' Still, she
says, Texas will forgive him as it did the likes of John Connally,
Lloyd Bentsen and Phil Gramm. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``VANITY FAIR'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is our favorite issue every year, the one full of those
cool photographs of Hollywood stars in Annie Leibovitz-type poses
(even though many of the photos are not taken by Leibovitz this
year). Best photo reunites the cast of ``American Graffiti.''
Amazing special effects allow George Lucas' ego to somehow fit in
the frame. Another favorite is Chuck Jones (OK, I'll admit it, I
thought he was dead), popping up out of a ``wabbit'' hole in the
desert. And then there is George Clooney, looking eerily like Clark
Gable (dead, we checked). Low point is Demi Moore naked with her
kids. Make the bad woman go away! The cranky guys over at ``Slate''
(www.slate.com) called this issue as ``hagiographic as ever,'' and
once we consulted a dictionary (www.dictionary.com) to figure out
what that means (worshipful biography) we have to agree. The
Slaters must be having one of those secret staff contests to get
obscure words into print. They also managed to work in the word
odalisque (harem girl), last used by Tennyson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WIRED'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cover story is frightening piece on the future of the human race
written by Bill Joy, chief scientist at Sun Microsystems, inventor
of UNIX and Java and all-around genius-boy. Joy paints a picture of
homo sapiens dominated by a robot population of their own creation.
It sounds far-fetched until Joy makes his eloquent case, noting
that technology soon will be able to create extremely advanced,
self-replicating robots that could make old-fashioned biological
organisms obsolete. Quoting the Unabomber (ironic, because Joy was
once a prime target of the anti-technology terrorist), Joy warns of
unintended consequences that could spring from robotics, genetic
engineering and nanotechnology. ``By 2030,'' he writes, ``we are
likely to be able to build machines, in quantity, a million times
as powerful as the personal computer of today _ sufficient to
implement the dreams'' of those who imagine a world of robot
servants. If you want to know how this works out, rent the film
``The Forbin Project.'' &QL;

this Web site, which keeps a running tally of the 50 most popular
subjects on the Internet, ranging from Pokemon cards at No. 1 to
prom dresses ('tis the season) at No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The list, based on a count of search words punched into Lycos
each day, is perfect for those who want to find something on the
Web quickly without a lot of searching. For example, as tax time
nears, the IRS site is steaming up the charts, landing at No. 8
last week.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good way to gauge public opinion. For example, with
Major League Baseball about to start, you might think that people
would be pouring into the MLB sites. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the top sports-related sites included, at No. 2,
March Madness (NCAA basketball tournament); at No. 6, the WWF
(wrasslin' and, no, we don't want to get into that argument); and,
at No. 16, NASCAR (vroom, vroom). Baseball was No. 40.
</P>
<P>
   As further evidence that the Internet is dominated by
14-year-old boys, a number of top sites involve popular Web pinups
such as Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Anna Kournikova, Jenny
McCarthy, Carmen Electra and, of course, Pamela Lee.

Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE TIPPING POINT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were skeptical when we picked this up, having become adept
over the years at detecting books that aren't about anything
(they're like the emperor's new clothes _ they try to dazzle you,
but there's nothing to them). It wasn't long, however, before we
were hooked. If the premise does grow a bit thin _ Gladwell sounds
at times like an author inventing reasons to rattle on _ for the
most part it is thought-provoking and presented with an appealing
eye toward popular culture. The ``tipping point'' of the title is
the moment at which something becomes an epidemic, a word Gladwell
applies to fashion trends, fads, crime statistics, the success of a
bestselling book. His examination of how this happens is
dumbfoundingly interesting, and it includes discussion of the
resurgence of Hush Puppies (the shoes) in the mid-1990s, the
phenomenon of ``Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' (the book)
when it was released in paperback in 1998, and the ``word-of-mouth
epidemic'' created by Paul Revere (the silversmith) in 1775.
Gladwell works for ``The New Yorker,'' in which the tipping-point
theory made its first appearance. &QL; 
 &UR; ``I WILL BEAR WITNESS: A DIARY OF THE NAZI
 &UR; YEARS, 1942-1945'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Victor Klemperer (Random House, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Jewish rumors: There had been mass murders in Poland in
the course of withdrawals. On the other hand, Jews had been allowed
out of Hungary after a Hungarian agreement with the USA. We
consider Point 1 very likely; Point 2 can be correct only if
Hungary has broken away from Germany. Did it? We are tapping in the
dark.'' Klemperer, the son of a Berlin rabbi, wrote this in his
diary during the hot, humid summer of 1944, as he and his wife
lived through the Nazi terror in Dresden. His remarkable diaries
(the first volume, which covers 1933 to 1941, was published in
1998) re-create the confusion, fear, humiliation and emotional
claustrophobia that ruled the lives of German Jews. Included in
this volume are rumors of the crimes at Auschwitz and other camps,
the fragile link to survival that Klemperer's marriage to an
``Aryan'' afforded him and an account of the bombing of Dresden.
It's a riveting and invaluable glimpse of what life was like for a
Jew living in Nazi Germany. Klemperer died in 1960. &QL; 
 &UR; ``A GARDEN IN LUCCA'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Paul Gervais (Hyperion, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone left in America who does not own a villa in the
hills of Tuscany? Certainly the American literati have established
a presence there, the better to write books that make the rest of
us back home weak-kneed with envy. A prerequisite of this new life
in Italy, it seems, is that the villa in question must need work _
Frances Mayes and her boyfriend renovated theirs in her book
``Under the Tuscan Sun,'' and now Gervais (his novel
``Extraordinary People'' was nominated for a PEN/Faulkner award in
1991) and his companion do it here. The twist Gervais offers is
that the huge house they bought in 1982 in the small town of Massa
Macinaia in Lucca province came with its own huge, run-down garden.
This was new to Gervais, who grew up in New England and who knew
nothing of gardening, so he learned on the job, making lots of
mistakes until he hit upon a plan. We know he was successful,
because his book opens with a California horticultural foundation
booking his garden for its next tour. That's right _ foundation
members traveled 7,000 miles to see it. This is not as seductive as
the Mayes book, but it will make you jealous just the same.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``GOOD BREEDING'' &QL; 
 &UR; Photographs by Yann Arthus-Bertrand (Abrams, $49.50)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do not laugh. No, do not laugh. Yes, those are pigs on the cover
and they are handsome devils, don't you think? All of the animals
in this book are handsome, because they are bred to be.
Arthus-Bertrand offers grand portraits of prizewinning domestic
livestock (sheep, cattle, goats, horses and swine) posed with their
very proud owners, breeders or trainers. The creatures are
astonishing. They are also a little _ well, odd, to the untrained
eye. Huge in just about every respect, if you know what we mean.
Dauntingly larger than the human beings who stand with them
(there's a Blonde D'Aquitaine bull on Page 47 that looks like it
could take out Manhattan). Muscled, veined, groomed and dandy, they
pose as if they are fully aware of just how excellent they are.
This is, in case you have not surmised it by now, a strange but
endearing book. You might be tempted to laugh (but don't) as you
look through it, but you quickly get caught up in the spirit of the
thing. Except when you see the pigs. You can laugh at them.  &QL;

ISRAELI INTERIOR MINISTER PLEDGES TO RETURN LAND TO ARAB VILLAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Interior Minister Natan Sharansky announced Monday
that he would restore to an Israeli Arab village part of its land
that had been taken to develop a neighboring Jewish town.
</P>
<P>
   The move was the first of its kind, and it has potentially
far-reaching implications. The action contradicts decades-old
policies under which Arab-owned land had often been expropriated to
build Jewish communities.
</P>
<P>
   The step was intended ``to strengthen the democratic character
of the state of Israel and to provide equal opportunity to all
citizens,'' Sharansky, a former human rights campaigner who had
been jailed in the Soviet Union, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the move said that it set a dangerous precedent and
that it would encourage Israeli Arab villages and towns across the
country to demand that land lost to neighboring Jewish communities
be returned to them.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was another step toward equality for the 1 million
Arab citizens in Israel. This month, the Supreme Court ruled that
an Israeli Arab couple could not be barred from a community that
had been built just for Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky said he had decided to restore 250 acres of vacant
land that had been taken from Kafr Kassem, northeast of Tel Aviv.
The land was seized decades ago for what were described as security
reasons but was later turned over to the neighboring Jewish town of
Rosh Haayin for an industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
   After residents of Kafr Kassem had pressed to recover the land,
an Interior Ministry committee recommended in 1997 that the area be
restored to the village. But the interior minister at the time, Eli
Suissa of the Orthodox Shas Party, did not carry out the
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky said that he had decided to restore the land after the
mayor of Rosh Haayin had rejected a proposal that the area be
jointly developed by both communities as a shared industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
   Kafr Kassem could now use the site to set up its own industrial
zone and benefit from the income, Sharansky said, adding that his
decision was meant to promote ``social justice'' and to help
``close gaps'' between Arabs and Jews in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Yigal Yosef of Rosh Haayin warned that returning the area
to Kafr Kassem would lead other Arab communities to demand that
their boundaries be redrawn at the expense of neighboring Jewish
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're asserting historic rights, but if we accept this claim
the whole country will be theirs,'' Yosef said. ``The whole
ideological basis of setting up a Jewish state is slipping away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Community leaders in Kafr Kassem, the site of a massacre of 49
villagers by Israeli border guards who were enforcing a curfew in
1956, welcomed Sharansky's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State of Israel owes a special debt to Kafr Kassem because
of the tragedy of the massacre,'' the chairman of the local
council, Sami Issa, said. ``I hope this will be the start of a new
policy of planning for the Arab sector that will solve its
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli Arab towns and villages are short of land for
expansion. Large areas have been expropriated over the decades for
Jewish communities.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Abdullah Nimr Darwish, a leader of the Islamic Movement in
Israel who lives in Kafr Kassem, said Sharansky's past as a Soviet
dissident had made him sensitive to the needs of Israeli Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person who suffered repression,'' Darwish said, ``he
knows that injustice breeds hatred.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries meeting here to discuss raising oil production
by as much as 1.7 million barrels a day adjourned Monday night
after squabbling over the exact size of the increase.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference in respective positions was about 200,000
barrels daily, and all sides publicly predicted some rise in
production. Iran was said to still be resisting a Saudi-backed plan
for pumping 1.7 million more barrels a day, arguing that the amount
should be smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The oil ministers, who resume their discussions on Tuesday,
consulted informally for a few hours Monday prior to their formal
session. The countries represented here have talked for weeks about
expanding production and have held intensive meetings in the last
few days.
</P>
<P>
   Such an increase would be larger than many analysts had
expected, although it would be less than the 2.5 million barrels
sought by a Clinton administration worried about the ramifications
of high gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   The rise, once approved, could make oil cheaper by several
dollars a barrel, but when that price reduction would happen and
whether it would be passed on to consumers remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   One senior OPEC official said the proposed increase would just
about reverse the production cuts the cartel agreed upon one year
ago, which sent oil prices soaring and ignited a political uproar
in the United States as U.S. gasoline prices have surged to more
than $1.60 a gallon in many cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this number will result in bringing back market
stability,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity
before Monday's meeting. ``It is a reasonable increase, a very
reasonable increase to make sure there are reasonable stocks in the
second quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was much uncertainty about the outcome, he firmly
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   The oil ministers are also expected to announce plans for a
follow-up meeting in June at which they could choose to again raise
production levels if the price stays near $30 a barrel. Saudi
officials want to get the price down to about $25 a barrel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Iran, OPEC's second largest producer after Saudi Arabia, is
among several countries still opposed to such a big boost in
production. But other OPEC officials predicted that they would
agree on an increase of at least 1.5 million barrels a day _ but
more likely 1.7 million _ levels that have been urged by the
Saudis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is being discussed is a return of the 1.7 million barrels
that were removed from production last year,'' Kuwait's oil
minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah, said in an interview here
Monday night. Although he described an increase in production as a
move driven by politics rather than economics, he predicted that
the agreement would be close to the levels sought by Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   He added that oil prices were likely to fall: ``The market will
look at this as an increase, and will react by reducing prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The surge in gasoline prices has become a major election-year
topic in the United States. Lawmakers in Congress have lambasted
OPEC countries in recent weeks and accused Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
of paying no heed to the role the United States played in rescuing
Kuwait from Iraq during the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has
called for a big reduction in gasoline taxes. Vice President Al
Gore, the expected Democratic nominee, has been peppered with
complaints and the Clinton administration has waged an intense
lobbying campaign to persuade OPEC countries to agree to a large
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cautioned that the expected increase would probably
have only a modest impact on gasoline prices, probably no more than
10 cents a gallon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said Gary N. Ross, president of PIRA Energy Group,
an oil industry consulting firm, the increases would have a
tangible impact and coincide with unexpectedly weak demand for oil
in the first months of this year. ``They have made it clear they
want to see lower prices,'' Ross said, referring to the Saudis.
``They want to get oil out of the newspaper headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two years have shown that oil prices are notoriously
difficult to predict. Few analysts, if any, expected prices to
plunge as low as $11 a barrel one year ago; just as few, if any,
predicted the abrupt surge to about $28 a barrel today.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ginoux, head of the oil trading desk at Salomon Smith
Barney in London, said increasing OPEC's quota by 1.7 million
barrels is inherently less than it appears.
</P>
<P>
   That is because OPEC nations are already cheating on their own
restrictions, overshooting their official limit of 23 million
barrels a day by about 1 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   But because the limits are always exceeded to some extent, he
said, the real net increase could be about 1 million barrels a day.
And though cheating could continue at nearly the present pace, many
smaller OPEC producers are already producing at nearly their
current capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noncompliance can only come now from the big guys, and they
are the ones who are charged with keeping prices up,'' Ginoux said
Sunday. ``If we take the net new supply to be 1 million barrels a
day, I am horribly afraid that this will go to restocking _ and
probably keep prices right where they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Within OPEC, the view is considerably different.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has argued loudly that OPEC should not raise production by
more than about 700,000 or 1 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   And even pro-Western countries like Kuwait are worried about a
repeat of the catastrophic decline in prices that came after OPEC
raised production modestly in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the total increase in production extends beyond the
official OPEC quotas. Mexico, Norway and Oman, which are not
members of the oil cartel, moved in tandem with OPEC last year,
slashing their combined production by about 400,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have said they plan to raise output by as much
as 300,000 barrels. Norway said it would decide the issue after
OPEC meets, but it would probably go back to its earlier levels as
well.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that there is Iraq, which is part of OPEC but is
allowed to pump at maximum levels under a system regulated by the
U.N. sanctions program put in place after the Gulf War. Iraq cut
its production by about 700,000 barrels a day last year,
complaining that it could not get the parts it needed to maintain
its oil industry's infrastructure. But after conciliatory moves by
the United Nations, Iraq announced last week that it would go back
to full production in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have refused to comment on OPEC's likely
production increases, saying that would be premature. Although the
increases are expected to be less than those advocated by Bill
Richardson, the U.S. secretary of energy, the Clinton
administration will likely express relief.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many OPEC countries that have good relations
with the United States were angry at the Americans' pressure in
recent weeks. ``It is strange that the champion of the free market
economy is acting in a way that would put Marxists to shame,'' the
daily Saudi Gazette said in an editorial on threats by Congress to
impose sanctions if OPEC did not raise production. The editorial
called the effort ``an atrocious proposal which violates the norms
of the market and defies common sense.''

COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO WITHHOLDING WELFARE FROM LEGAL
IMMIGRANTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill.)   (Eds: Will be updated.) 
(nk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a
challenge to portions of the 1996 welfare law that made legal
immigrants ineligible for various kinds of federal welfare
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The justices turned down an appeal by the city of Chicago, which
was supported by New York and other cities, of a federal appeals
court's ruling that the disqualification did not violate the
immigrants' constitutional right to equal protection because it was
not ``wholly irrational.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the overhaul of the welfare system, the provisions
aimed specifically at immigrants received relatively little
attention, but greatly angered officials of the cities where,
because of sizeable populations of impoverished or elderly
foreign-born residents, the elimination of food stamps,
Supplemental Security Income and other benefits would be most
sharply felt.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of the 1996 law will be delayed because, after
initially eliminating supplemental security income and food stamps
for noncitizens, Congress the next year restored benefits for some
immigrants who were in the country when the law took effect on Aug.
22, 1996. That shifted the impact to those who arrived after that
date.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law also imposed a 5 year waiting period before
noncitizens could receive Medicaid benefits or Temporary Assistance
for Needy Families, the new program that replaced the cash grants
of the old welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   The law, and the case challenging it, had nothing to do with the
debate over illegal immigration. All the provisions at issue apply
to lawful permanent residents, admitted into the country with the
right to remain and to work.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, Chicago said the federal government ``is solely
responsible for the presence of lawful noncitizens in the country''
and ``should not be allowed to shirk all responsibility for their
welfare.'' Chicago said the law had the effect of an ``unfunded
mandate,'' while New York City, in its brief supporting Chicago's
appeal, said the 1996 law ``is really about shifting the financial
and social burdens of immigration to state and local governments.''

PLAYER PROTESTS RISE WITH ODDS IN TEXAS LOTTERY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A plan that would make it harder to win the
Texas Lottery's biggest jackpots is back.
</P>
<P>
   And so are the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Stymied by sluggish &UR;  &LR; Lotto ticket sales, the agency in charge of
the games has revived a plan that was ditched last fall because of
an outcry from players.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for adding four more numbered balls to the 50
that are used to draw the lottery numbers for the twice-a-week
jackpots.
</P>
<P>
   A player's odds of matching six numbers from 1 to 50 to the six
numbers that are drawn is 15.8 million-to-1. Under the new plan,
scheduled to start in June, the six balls would be drawn from a
pool of 54, causing the odds to leap to 25.8 million-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   The rule change, which was announced March 14, primary election
day, drew little immediate attention. So far the public has sent
about 200 letters and e-mails to the Texas Lottery Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The fight against the stiffer odds is being led by Dawn Nettles,
a Garland resident who dispenses lottery tips on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the voters and the paying customers. It is our game,''
Nettles told her Web site readers last week.
</P>
<P>
   Other irate players were just getting warmed up, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can take their new game and four balls and stick 'um you
know where!'' one player wrote to Nettles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the chances of winning are already way too slim,''
wrote another.
</P>
<P>
   Several others said they will refuse to play the new game and
said poor marketing, not small jackpots, was to blame for
disappointing sales. But most expressed doubt that a second round
of protests would reverse the commission's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loud outcry last year, some of the lottery
commission's public hearings on the rules change only attracted a
handful of opponents. Whatever the response this time, lottery
administrators say they have little choice but to find a way to
make the jackpots bigger. Lotto Texas ticket sales are running from
$8 million to $25 million a week, depending on jackpot sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the odds could increase the average jackpot from $9
million to about $19 million, lottery operators said. And jackpots
in the double-digit millions are what is needed to cure lottery
``fatigue,'' the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we've got a problem with our Lotto game because we
don't see our players coming into the game until we see our jackpot
get up to $18 million and above,'' said lottery Director Linda
Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's winner, former Dallas Cowboy Thomas ``Hollywood''
Henderson, for example, said he never bothered to played unless the
jackpot was in the $20 million range.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to increase the number of balls in the Lotto drawing
was one of the final acts of commission Chairwoman Harriet Miers,
who resigned last week, saying the games were on the road to
recovery after months of lackluster sales.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-ball game still requires final approval by the
commission. That could happen after a formal public comment period
that is set from April 1 through May 1, if the proposed rules
appear on schedule in the Texas Register by March 31.
</P>
<P>
   One hint that the commission will stand its ground this time is
that rather than having a series of statewide public hearings, the
commission has only one planned: 10 a.m. April 19 at commission
headquarters in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles and other devoted players plan to testify against the
change. But Cloud says he believes opposition isn't as strong this
time around, and an advertising campaign is already in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the states are having to look at their games. It's like
any business. You've got to keep changing that product to keep the
people interested,'' Cloud said. A few states have done what Texas
is contemplating _ Pennsylvania's players choose numbers from 69
balls facing odds approaching 130 million-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing we're seeing _ Internet gaming _ is starting
to be a real problem for us,'' Cloud said. ``There's illegal
gambling out there right now _ about 700 gaming sites _ and that's
going to have tremendous impact on all the lotteries.''
</P>
<P>
   She said last week's ticket-buying frenzy was fresh evidence
that big jackpots excite Texas players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Harriet said in our commission meeting,'' Cloud
said. ``Our players are voting with their dollars. They're just not
coming into the game until the jackpot gets up to a certain
level.''

<P>
   It was a moonless night on Hudson Bay. Dr. David S. Evans, a
physicist, was freezing as he tinkered with gear in the dark.
Suddenly the sky seemed to explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredibly brilliant, casting shadows on the ground,''
Evans recalled. ``You could have read a newspaper by it. That was
the most stunning thing I've ever seen. It just lit up the
landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks of a similar kind, if not so bright, but alive in
shimmering waves of color and brilliance, may soon be visible
around the globe as the sun approaches the peak of its 11-year
cycle of storms. The heavy rain of solar particles, interacting
with Earth's magnetic field, will light up the skies with heavenly
fire known in the Northern Hemisphere as the aurora borealis.
During solar disturbances, auroras materialize in places where most
people never expect to see them.
</P>
<P>
   The eerie lights, associated in times past with spirits,
mystical powers and portents of danger, can appear as luminous
arcs, bands, patches, streamers, veils, rays, beads, filaments and
curtains. Shapes can pulsate, flicker or explode.
</P>
<P>
   The glow often starts out greenish white in color, but can
include reds, yellows, blues, purples and a delicate shade of pink,
which is often too faint for the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of seeing one of the ghostly dances are now unusually
high, despite the growth in recent years of light pollution near
cities. The main reason is strides in forecasting solar eruptions,
which produce auroras big enough and bright enough to extend down
from northern latitudes into the lower regions where most people
live. The lights last anywhere from a few hours to days. And
lately, the improved forecasts have led to global alerts for
auspicious viewing times, which are routinely posted on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web predictions are pretty good,'' said Dr. Robert H.
Eather, author of ``An Aurora Watcher's Guide,'' in the March issue
of Sky &AMP; Telescope. ``They can guarantee good aurora over North
America, with up to two-day advance warnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles S. Deehr, a forecaster at the Geophysical Institute
of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, said night skies were
already pulsating. ``It's been a nice spring,'' he said. ``Right
now, our models indicate we're going to have a lot of good activity
this coming week.''
</P>
<P>
   The peak of solar storminess is expected to occur in the next
few months and to go well into next year, with the earthly
fireworks lasting much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auroral activity stays high for a year or two after the
sunspot peak,'' said David H. Hathaway, a senior solar physicist at
NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. ``A lot of
the stuff that causes auroras comes later, like coronal mass
ejections. And the sun's magnetic field gets tilted. We're just
starting to understand it all.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the English astronomer Richard Carrington who first
suggested a link between the sun and auroras, laying the basis for
accurate predictions. In 1859, he observed a solar flare. Two
nights later, the skies over much of Europe lighted up, and he
promptly noted the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Today, scientists know the terrestrial fire is linked in a
circuitous way to sunspots, which are easy to observe and provide a
handy measure of solar storminess. These magnetic darkenings of the
sun have relatively low temperatures, as compared with the rest of
the sun's surface, and their numbers rise and fall more or less
steadily in a mysterious 11-year cycle. And that, in turn, is tied
to an equally enigmatic 22-year cycle of reversals in the Sun's
magnetic field. Whatever their cause, sunspots are associated with
bright patches known as faculae, as well as flares and other huge
ejections of solar matter into space.
</P>
<P>
   The solar wind, whether steady or tempestuous, is formed when
such matter breaks up into streams of particles, mostly electrons.
After speeding through space, the particles loop around Earth's
magnetic fields and hit air molecules, causing them to glow. In
television sets and computer monitors, something analogous happens
when electron guns fire beams that illuminate screens.
</P>
<P>
   The aurora is a relatively stable feature at high latitudes.
Viewed from space, it appears around both of Earth's magnetic poles
as halos of fire. NASA routinely photographs the northern one with
a high-flying satellite and posts a link to the image on its

<P>
   Auroral displays occur between altitudes of 60 and 600 miles,
where Earth's atmosphere thins. Typical ones are hundreds of miles
high but often less than a mile wide, and their most common color
is green.
</P>
<P>
   During solar tempests, the aurora grows stronger and expands
southward. The lag between eruption and expansion is the time it
takes the burst of solar particles to traverse 93 million miles of
space. At times, superstorms on the Sun can drive the northern
lights almost to the equator and cause widespread havoc in radars,
radios and power grids.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, experts say, auroras that surge toward the equator
tend to be more colorful and intense.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting the peak of the action can be difficult. The length
of the sunspot cycle can vary anywhere from eight to 15 years,
averaging 11 years, and stormy times can crest sooner rather than
later, or vice versa. Cycles also vary in strength. Cycle 19, which
peaked in 1958, was a blockbuster. The current one, cycle 23, looks
more routine so far.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, the Hudson Bay researcher, is an auroral physicist at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Environment
Center, in Boulder, Colo. He said high chances of seeing an aurora
in the New York region were now likely to occur about once a month.
The odds rise in higher latitudes, he added, and fall in lower
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a place like Cuba has seen the aurora,'' Evans said.
``But there it's getting to be a once-in-a-lifetime kind of
phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The moon is now waning, so nights this week and next will become
increasingly favorable for auroral viewing. The new moon, when its
face is totally dark, occurs a week from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Trond S. Trondsen, an auroral expert at the Institute for
Space Research at the University of Calgary, in Alberta, Canada,
said that he and two colleagues were about to embark for the shores
of Hudson Bay, a mecca for aurora watchers because of its proximity
to the magnetic North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting it to pick up pretty soon,'' he said of the
intensity and frequency of auroral displays. ``By next year, we
should see a dramatic increase.'' Trondsen and his colleagues plan
to photograph the show through a 10-inch telescope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get tired of it,'' he said. ``Sometimes I lie down and
let myself get swept away. The colors are amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Armchair experts unwilling to travel to dark wildernesses need
not despair. Coming in late spring or summer to Imax theaters is
``Solarmax,'' which is to feature auroras dancing over the wilds of
Alaska and Greenland. Still photographs cannot convey the subtle
movements that are the soul of the northern lights.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that fewer than 5 percent of the people on
Earth have seen auroras, most of them residents of northern
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, a space shuttle flew through an aurora sown by a
solar flare in 1985, and the astronauts took videos of gigantic
arcs of light undulating over the Pacific. The surprise came during
a solar minimum, when the skies should have been dark.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial jets flying high above clouds, seas and continents
can offer a ringside seat comparable to shuttles and mountain
peaks. ``I once saw an aurora from Cleveland to Nebraska,'' Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
   For people on the ground, the best time to look northward is on
clear, dark nights with no moon, when the viewer is as far as
possible from city lights. Often, the aurora is most active and
visible around midnight.
</P>
<P>
   A cutting edge of research aims at trying to capture
photographically and explain such things as extraordinarily thin
curtains that shimmer across the dark sky. ``Theory says it
shouldn't happen,'' said Trondsen, who is targeting such elusive
phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James F. Spann, a auroral physicist at NASA's Marshall
center, is on a team that examines such spectacles from space with
NASA's polar satellite, whose elliptical orbit goes out as high as
32,000 miles. Launched in 1996, during the solar minimum, the craft
is gathering data so scientists can make a comprehensive portrait
of auroral growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to maximize the repetition rate'' of the
satellite's camera, Spann said, to increase the chances of
capturing fast action that is extremely short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite's camera works in ultraviolet wavelengths, letting
it see auroras day and night. One surprise, Spann said, is how
auroral activity at night is sometimes mysteriously echoed on the
day side. ``We're seeing things never seen before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, NASA launched a new $154 million satellite meant to
unravel more of the show's secrets. Known as Image, it is the first
craft dedicated to visualizing Earth's magnetosphere _ the
invisible bands of surrounding magnetism that the solar wind often
perturbs. Among other things, it will monitor auroral brightenings
and the complex engine behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forecasts are getting pretty good,'' said Deehr of the
University of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really enthusiastic,'' he added, about making them even
better so more people can see the rare spectacle of the ghostly
lights.

<P>
   Talk about a fast-growth forest: A research team at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., has created tiny ``trees''
using flashes of extreme heat to deposit carbon atoms in piles on a
graphite surface.
</P>
<P>
   The structures, which average about one one-hundredth of an inch
in height and can be as narrow as five-millionths of an inch in
diameter, are made by a process called chemical vapor deposition,
in which a graphite electrode is rapidly heated in a pressurized
atmosphere of methane and helium.
</P>
<P>
   As the temperature rises to between 2,000 and 4,000 degrees
Fahrenheit, carbon atoms from the methane are deposited directly on
the surface of the electrode, forming nodules that build into
towers through successive heating cycles. The effect is something
like making a sand castle by dribbling wet sand into a spire.
</P>
<P>
   Chemical vapor deposition is a well-known technique, but other
researchers have generally used metal particles on the electrode as
a catalyst to promote deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with using a catalyst is that you always end up
with a metal particle in the structure,'' said Dr. Pulickel Ajayan,
an associate professor of materials science and engineering at the
institute and the leader of the research team. Their work was
reported in Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Ajayan said he and his colleagues had been looking for a way to
grow the structures without using a catalyst, and through
experimentation came up with the flash heating technique. ``We
found that by tuning the conditions, we could create these
fascinating morphologies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As carbon falls on the surface of an electrode, Ajayan said, it
tends to form islandlike structures. Under more normal heating
conditions, the islands link to create a thin continuous layer.
``But if you do it fast enough, there's no real time for these
islands to merge,'' Ajayan said. ``The only way to grow is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they can be observed only with electron microscopes,
the trees are still larger than nanotubes, those cylindrical
molecules of carbon that have been the subject of so much recent
research. Nonetheless, the trees may have some of the same
potential applications, if they can be produced on a commercial
scale. The trees have hollow portions and are porous, Ajayan said,
making them good candidates for gas storage and for use in
displays.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A potent low-pressure system will drag a cold front across New
England on Tuesday, bringing a steady rain to parts of Maine and
northern New Hampshire. Farther south, a second surge of cold air
will cross the Middle Atlantic states. Ahead of this chilly air, a
line of showers and a few thunderstorms will develop, with small
hail and gusty winds likely. Behind this second cold front,
flurries and snow showers will fall in the northern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms, some of which will be strong, will
develop in the Red River Valley later Tuesday as low pressure and
its attendant warm front push onto the southern Plains. Farther
south, it will be very warm in Texas under mostly sunny skies.
Mountain snow and valley rain showers will accompany a cold front
as it sweeps across the northern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WINTER'S COMEBACK
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the mercury soared to a record 58 degrees in
Marquette, Mich., as southerly breezes directed warm air to the
Canadian border. March 2000 has been warm in the Great Lakes,
especially in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where Marquette has
set temperature records on a quarter of the days this month. But
Monday, the warmth was in retreat as winter made a comeback.
Wind-driven snow accumulated several inches at Marquette. A cold
low-pressure system will hold steady over Ontario on Tuesday,
insuring further delivery of snow showers and cold air to Northern
Michigan.

CENSUS 2000: COUNTING THE MISTAKES IN THE FORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, April 2)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses
should be set as brackets.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago this week, I received in the mail a census form
that began, ``Please use a black lead pencil only.'' Naturally, I
objected to the loose placement of the  &UR; only &LR; , preferring ``use
only a black lead pencil'' or the even more direct and simple ``use
a black lead pencil.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, reflecting the leap forward in technology, the U.S.
Census 2000 says, ``Please use a black or blue pen.'' I have a blue
pen that writes with black ink; I suppose that's OK. But I also
have a black pen that writes with red ink; is that impermissible?
</P>
<P>
   The clear intent is ``use black or blue ink.'' But if the Bureau
of the Census, conscious of literal correctness, wrote those words,
millions of people unfamiliar with the details of writing
instruments would respond: ``I don't use ink; I use a ballpoint
pen. Does this mean I have to fill this out with a fountain pen?
There'll be big inkblots all over the form. What do they want from
my life?''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, I give the census-form-writers a little leeway. In
return, they try not to make the same mistakes twice. The 1990 form
concluded with the admonition ``Make sure you have ... filled this
form completely,'' and I complained that it was possible to fill
 &UR; in &LR;  or fill  &UR; out &LR;  a form, but not to simply fill a form, because a
form is not a bucket.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 form, the error is averted by the adoption of the
``Thank you for not smoking'' trick: ``Thank you for completing
your official U.S. Census form.'' It seems friendlier and is not
subject to attack by nit-pickers in this space.
</P>
<P>
   However, our intrepid people-counters cannot be counted on for
the correct use of commas. Turning to the first question in the
long form, and aided by my fellow nit-picker Jeff McQuain, we read
``people staying here on April 1, 2000 who have no other permanent
place to stay ....'' If a date in midsentence uses a comma, then
another comma must follow the year: ``on April 1, 2000, who ....''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the form directs, ``Start with the person, or one of the
people living here who owns ....'' This cries out for a balancing
comma: ``person, or one of the people living here, who owns ....''
Better still, forget the commas in that sentence entirely: ``Start
with the person or one of the people living here who owns ....''
Use two commas to separate the phrase or no commas if it does not
need separation.
</P>
<P>
   This comedy of commas continues with ``What is this person's age
and what is this person's date of birth?'' The two independent
clauses call for separation by a comma after ``age.'' (An even
better fix is to obviate the need for a comma by shortening it to
``What are this person's age and date of birth?'')
</P>
<P>
   And the form-writers are tensed up. Right at the start, the past
tense is used in ``How many people  &UR; were &LR;  living or staying in this
house ... on April 1, 2000?'' Then the tense is switched to the
present with instruction to include them ``even if they  &UR; have &LR; 
another place to live.'' Gotta be this or that:  &UR; are &LR;  and  &UR; have &LR;  or
 &UR; were &LR;  and  &UR; had &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The Parallel Construction Workers Union should file a grievance
about the way a question about occupation is phrased: ``patient
care, directing hiring policies, supervising order clerks,
repairing automobiles, reconciling financial records'' are the
examples given. The last four of those listed begin with gerunds;
why, then, does ``patient care'' have no ``ing''? To be in proper
parallel, it should be ``caring for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   At least that was a series of examples not masquerading as a
sentence; correctly, with no verb, no period was placed at the end.
However, in what is called the ancestry question (more precisely
the lineage question), we read ``Italian, Jamaican, African Am.,
Cambodian, ... Taiwanese, Ukrainian, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``and so on'' tries to make it all-inclusive, but there is
no verb to make it a sentence _ and yet in this instance a period
is put at the end. No style is followed. And why, when no other
group is followed by ``Am.,'' is ``African'' so designated _ and
without a hyphen to boot?
</P>
<P>
   Hats off to the writers for sticking to past practice in
identifying aboriginal Americans as ``American Indians'' and not
the confusing ``Native Americans.'' That last could mean anyone
born in America, in contrast to ``Naturalized Americans,'' citizens
born elsewhere. Past designations as Eskimo and Aleut are now
lumped together as ``Alaska Native.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the sensitive question of ``What is this person's race?''
has three main categories: the above ``American Indian or Alaska
Native,'' which follows ``white,'' and three choices of names for
the other _ ``Black, African Am., or Negro.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau explains that the terminology changes with
each generation and that ``Negro'' was put in so that older members
of the group would not feel outdated. What about whites from South
Africa? I presume the form presumes that they will choose to
describe themselves as white. In a triumph of inclusive
self-differentiation, 11 other racial groups are listed, from
``Asian Indian'' to ``Samoan,'' with blank space left for anyone to
write in ``Some other race.''
</P>
<P>
   Language has its limitations. In the question about
relationships, the form includes, among others, ``Husband/wife,
Natural-born son/daughter, Adopted son/daughter.'' That
``Natural-born'' seems awkward; obviously it is there to
distinguish between what the Bible colorfully called ``the fruit of
one's loins'' and an adopted child. But with artificial
insemination and test-tube babies in the mix, what is natural and
what is not?
</P>
<P>
   The delicious bureaucratic euphemism ``POSSLQ'' is gone.
``Persons of the Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters,'' which
appeared in the 1990 census, has been replaced by two categories:
``Housemate/Roommate,'' who shares living quarters ``primarily to
share expenses,'' and the new ``Unmarried Partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Says the bureau: ``Mark the `Unmarried Partner' box if the
person is not related to Person 1, shares living quarters, and who
(( &UR; who &LR;  should be dropped)) has a close personal relationship with
Person 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: In the 2010 census, this last category will be
listed as ``Lovers.'' Also, the form-writers will be warier about
their use and abuse of commas.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore gives campaign finance reform plan a
twist
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore acknowledged Monday he was an ``imperfect messenger''
for campaign finance changes as he offered new proposals _ a
``Democracy Endowment'' and strict disclosure rules _ to attract
John McCain supporters and inoculate himself against George W.
Bush's repeated attacks on Gore's past fund-raising abuses. Gore
announced his plan at a campaign appearance in Milwaukee:
Elimination of soft money and the creation of a $7 billion national
endowment to provide public financing of federal political
campaigns, beginning in 2008. ``The real wounds will be to our
democracy itself unless we address this problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ROBB IN FOR ANOTHER TOUGH FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Charles Robb, whose 1994 race in Virginia
against Iran-Contra figure Oliver North was one of that year's most
bitterly contested, kicked off his campaign for a third term
against another former governor of the state. George Allen has
built a sizable lead in fund-raising and started his campaign
months ago, but Robb warned him that he faces a tough fight for the
only statewide elected office that Republicans do not control.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK ACTIVIST QUITS GOP
</P>
<P>
   A black Republican activist who had been vice chairman of a
high-profile GOP effort to recruit minorities says she has left the
party because a ``pattern of racial blunders'' left her feeling
abandoned. Faye Anderson quit the GOP, according to Gannett News
Service, with no explanation in a terse March 13 letter to Patricia
Harrison, co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Anderson
had been vice chairman of the New Majority Council, which the GOP
established in 1997 to reach out to minorities. But in her weekly
column for politicallyblack.com, Anderson said she switched from
registered Republican to independent because she no longer believes
that party leaders were serious about inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   NOT THE RIGHT KIND OF GAYS?
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, according to ABCNews.com, are
``disappointed by reports'' that George W. Bush has decided not to
meet with the organization and are ready to take their case to the
public. Said Log Cabin spokesman Kevin Ivers: ``It appears from the
latest comments that we are not the right kind of gays, and that we
were McCain supporters _ both of which seem to disqualify us from
even consideration of being part of this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ONLY THE CENSUS BUREAU WILL COUNT HIM
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Democratic Party
lawfully refused to count votes cast for political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche in the 1996 presidential primaries. The court, upholding
lower court rulings, rejected LaRouche's argument that the
Democratic Party's rules should have been cleared by the Justice
Department under the federal Voting Rights Act. Monday's ruling was
issued without an accompanying opinion. The justices merely
affirmed what a federal appeals court had previously ruled.
</P>
<P>
   KEEP A CLOSER EYE ON THE MONEY, GUYS
</P>
<P>
   Whoever emerges as the head of the Reform Party, the Federal
Election Commission says he needs to keep the government better
informed of where the organization's millions of taxpayer dollars
are kept. U.S. District Judge Norman Moon is trying to decide
between two rivals claiming to be the legitimate chairman of the
party: Jack Gargan and Pat Choate. Nearly $2.5 million in public
money that was given to the third party for its nominating
convention was not stored in the Martinsville, Va., bank that party
officers had named in their funding application. Instead, according
to the FEC, the money was spread among at least four bank accounts
from Virginia to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING THE REFORM NAME IN VAIN
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party of New Hampshire announced it will sue Pat
Buchanan's presidential campaign for $10 million, alleging wrongful
use of its name in a recent mailing to the group's members. John
Talbott, the group's acting state chairman, said he also will seek
federal mail fraud charges against Buchanan Reform, the name of
Buchanan's national campaign. Talbott said a pamphlet mailed by
Buchanan's campaign promoted an April 1 meeting in Manchester as
the Reform Party's state convention. He said the Buchanan campaign
does not have the authority to use the party's name or elect state
delegates for the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP(TON) KNIVES COME OUT
</P>
<P>
   If Rudy Giuliani's handlers could have their way, his opponent
in this year's New York Senate race would not be Hillary Rodham
Clinton, but Hillary Sharpton Clinton. Giuliani's aides are doing
everything they can to create the perception that she and Al
Sharpton are siblings in spirit, if not in blood. In campaign
fliers and in public comments, the mayor and his advisers have
stopped just short of portraying the activist minister from Harlem
as a person who advises an attentive Clinton in ways that would set
the republic on the path to perdition. They have begun to respond
to any criticism of the mayor's actions by throwing out one name:
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   TURNING THE TABLES ON CARPETBAGGING
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani is planning three fund-raising events in
Tennessee, and state Democratic leaders say he is ``carpetbagging''
for money. Giuliani has three such events set for April 5 in
Knoxville, Nashville and Memphis. The Tennessee trip ``is a bit of
carpetbagging'' to raise money, a term often applied to Hillary
Rodham Clinton's Senate bid in New York, said Greg Wanderman, head
of the Tennessee Democratic Party. ``I don't know that Rudy has
ever stepped foot in Tennessee except to raise a dime,'' Wanderman
said.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY WELCOMES SMALL PARTY'S SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton picked up the first political party
endorsement of the campaign. ``I consider this the beginning of a
partnership,'' Clinton told the convention of the Working Families
Party, a small, labor union-backed third party. She promised to be
``a voice and a vote'' in the Senate for working families. The
Working Families Party was created in New York two years ago to
push the Democratic Party toward the left, and to help Charles
Schumer against Republican incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. Schumer
won that race.
</P>
<P>
   GOP'S FIRST BABY BOOMER
</P>
<P>
   Youthfulness and a generational shift represent a changing of
the guard for the Republican Party. George W. Bush, whose birthday
is July 6, will be 54 years old when he wins the his party's
presidential nomination in August, as expected. That will make him
the GOP's youngest presidential nominee in 40 years. It also will
make him the first Republican nominee in more than 30 years who is
almost the same age as his Democratic rival _ Al Gore will be 53 at
the Democratic National Convention _ and the first who was born too
late to have had any involvement in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   IMPORTANCE OF STAYING ON FOCUS
</P>
<P>
   Extensive polling and campaign analysis by the Annenberg Public
Policy Center pointed to the value of intensive primary campaigns
to voters and the worth of hammering home what a candidate would do
if elected. If the primary season appeared to hurt George W. Bush
and help Al Gore, the study suggests that Bush's intense fight to
win the Republican nomination, consistent tax-cutting message and
critical focus on Al Gore could pay dividends, said Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, a lead researcher at the Annenberg center at the
University of Pennsylvania.

   A last-minute buyer purchased the 2,220-acre Ambassador
University campus in East Texas last week, pre-empting an April 4
auction where the assets would have been sold piecemeal to the
highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The wooded campus, which includes dorms and classrooms as well
as an airstrip, radio station and two lakes, had been closed since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwide Church of God announced during the weekend that
Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma City retailer, bought the campus and will
lease it to the Institute of Basic Life Principles.
</P>
<P>
   That organization is led by Bill Gothard, a minister from
Oakbrook, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The sale price was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled that we were able to sell the campus intact,''
said Bernard Schnippert, chief financial officer of the Worldwide
Church of God.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gothard's ministry, Schnippert said, ``We don't know
about anything about them except in our dealings with them in this
sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Gothard's ministry plans to offer an orphanage on campus, as
well as to expand its program of training men to respond to
emergencies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency response teams have responded to tornadoes in
Oklahoma and Arkansas and the 1998 floods in Seguin and New
Braunfels, said Maj. Steve Nix, who works with the response teams
in Watersmeet, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, we first looked at this property a little over two
years ago,'' Nix said. ``We currently have this program up here
near the Wisconsin border and we had a need for more space.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, Gothard has conducted seminars for more than
2.5 million people, according to the ministry's Web site. He also
created the ``Character First'' curriculum that has been taught to
businesses and schools, with religious references omitted.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that he teaches blind obedience to
authority figures and instructs women to be subservient to men.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Hobby Lobby couldn't be reached for comment, but
Nix said that the retailer has helped the institute previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've just been a real friend to the ministry,'' Nix said.
``The owners are strong, committed Christian men. It was just
something they chose to do with their money. There was no
solicitation.''
</P>
<P>
   By next fall, Nix said the institute will have about 300
students and staff at the campus. It should expand in upcoming
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale came after the Worldwide Church of God dramatically
changed its views after the death of its founder in 1986. Moving
from beliefs in two Gods and a doctrine that they were the only
true Christian church, the Worldwide Church now holds beliefs
similar to evangelical denominations and has been accepted by most
of those groups.

MADONNA MIA! PREGNANT POP STAR PUSHES THE ENVELOPE _ AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1985, when Madonna paraded through the video for her hit,
``Like a Virgin,'' often touching herself, it was OK.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, when she played the role of a stripper in the
clip for ``Open Your Heart,'' it was, again, OK. Same goes for her
steamy ``Sex'' book. Lesbian pictures of Madonna? OK.
</P>
<P>
   She's the mother of one (Lourdes, 3), and now at 41 _ getting up
there for motherhood _ she announced she has another on the way.
She is not married to either Carlos Leon, her former personal
trainer and father of Lourdes, or Guy Ritchie, British film
director and pop of the forthcoming tot. Nor, according to Madonna,
does she plan on marrying either.
</P>
<P>
   And it's OK.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since she burst onto the music scene in the early '80s,
Madonna has not only altered the climate of pop culture with
fashion and musical trends, she has mastered the art of mastering
us, the media. Whatever Madonna does, we approve, calling it
brilliant, and making you, the public, feel the same.
</P>
<P>
   Racy videos? We call it pushing the envelope. Image makeovers?
Growing up. Having a couple kids without marrying? It's just being
independent and proving to other women that they, too, can raise
kids without the everyday influence of a father.
</P>
<P>
   Bad movies? We don't hold them against her, either.
</P>
<P>
   We crown Madonna cool because, well, we don't have much choice.
She's one of the only female artists to relentlessly push buttons _
fashion, social and sexual. Others _ from Cher to Patti Smith to
Liz Phair _ may have had their precedent-setting moments _ but only
Madonna has been consistently adventurous, always lurking around
the corner with another surprise that the media absorbs and makes
you approve.
</P>
<P>
   Credit that to her savvy manipulation of the media _ she's had
plenty of practice, alternately battling and kissing up to us since
the early '80s. Credit it to the people behind Madonna _ the
publicists, the managers, the image-makers, the agents, the
decision-makers. Credit us for recognizing _ and championing _
someone who's not afraid to go against the grain.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever she does, however she looks, it doesn't matter. All we
care about is: What's next for Madonna? And we _ and you _ can't
wait to find out.

TEDIUM AND CRYSTAL JABS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Billy Crystal pointed out, Regis Philbin took the night off
so ABC could squeeze in a more anticipated set of final answers.
</P>
<P>
   And so Crystal opened the 72d annual Oscarcast with the final
answer in digital trickery, as the shtick-spouting comic was
inserted into classic movies from ``The Graduate'' to ``The
Godfather.'' Along with Crystal's musical homage to the nominated
pictures, it was a brisk beginning to the long Oscar night, but it
wasn't witty stuff, unless you think getting spewed with green
vomit by Linda Blair, or hearing ``Green Mile'' sung to the tune of
``Green Acres,'' is the final answer in funny. And it didn't help
the bulk of Oscar 2000 pass any faster, or end any earlier, as the
event wandered to its final moments just after the four-hour mark,
at 12:35.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal's strengths _ what made first-time Oscar producers
Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck beg him to return for a seventh gig _
are his mensch demeanor and his soft jabs, both of which were in
full bloom Sunday night. Noting that a missing Oscar was hiding in
Erykah Badu's hat, quipping that ``If Roberto Benigni gets out of
hand, I've got the stun gun,'' and, of course, chitchatting with
the sun-
</P>
<P>
   glassed Jack Nicholson from the stage, he delivered the big fat
smirk that is his trademark. He made it clear that the Zanucks were
going for safety and likability, and not the envelope-pushing of
last year's host, Whoopi Goldberg, when they hired him.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was Oscarcast as usual, with unnecessary clip
collages, static song performances, and forced presenter humor. Oh,
and, of course, viewer bribery, as a disproportionate number of
important awards got held back until the final half-hour to keep us
hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Zanucks' promise of a swifter event, featuring
hipped-up music from Burt Bacharach and Don Was, the hours plodded
by with all the expected pomp and bloat.
</P>
<P>
   Even the night's anticipated controversy, Robin Williams'
rendition of ``Blame Canada,'' the expletive-laced song from
``South Park,'' went off without sparks as Williams simply left out
the offending language. After pulling a piece of tape off his
mouth, he sang and danced with a stageful of cartoony characters
who looked like refugees from ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,''
plus a line of leggy Mounties.
</P>
<P>
   And the Oscars seem to move even slower these days, as they come
on the heels of so many other movie awards _ the People's Choice,
the Golden Globes, the Writers Guild, the Directors Guild, the
Screen Actors Guild, the Independent Spirit _ all of which feature
the same nominees uttering the same words of gratitude and pride.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions to the rule of Oscar tedium?
</P>
<P>
   Accepting his supporting-actor statue after a standing ovation,
Michael Caine used his precious time to pay homage to each of the
nominees one by one. Addressing Tom Cruise, he said, ``If you had
won this one, your price would have gone down fast. Have you any
idea what supporting actors get paid? We only get one motor home, a
small one.'' It was a heartfelt and gracious gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting his Irving Thalberg award, Warren Beatty delivered a
remarkably real thank-you speech, looking hard at the audience and
acknowledging the friends who helped him through his solitary
years. He also honored his ``treasure,'' wife Annette Bening, to
whom the camera couldn't seem to get close enough.
</P>
<P>
   And while Hilary Swank delivered her thank-you's for her
best-actress Oscar, noting ``we have come a long way'' for
celebrating a small, controversial movie like ``Boys Don't Cry,''
and ``this movie could not have been made 2 1/2 years ago,'' the
camera cut to her husband, Chad Lowe, with tears streaming down his
face. It was a sweet moment.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the Oscar pre-shows, on E! and then, at 8 p.m., on
ABC? If cleavage were soap, Hollywood would have been squeaky
clean.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-shows were rich in exposure, to say the least, as the
glittery actresses inched their way down the bright red carpet and
into the Shrine Auditorium under the bulging eyes of the press.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the royal family _ princess Nicole Kidman and lady in
waiting Charlize Theron _ went the posterior cleavage route, with
colorful backless numbers. But the predominant motif was very Erin
Brockovich. From the low-key Chloe Sevigny and the frothy Cameron
Diaz, whose black Versace plunged nearly to her belly, to a
scrunched-up Winona Ryder, who arrived Matt Damon-less, the theme
was full frontal.
</P>
<P>
   Call it Girls, Very Busted.
</P>
<P>
   The most eye-popping cleavage, though, was wielded immodestly by
a trio of ironic semi-celebrities named Matt Stone, Trey Parker,
and Marc Shaiman. They're the fellows behind ``South Park: Bigger,
Longer &AMP; Uncut,'' and they arrived dolled up in long gowns.
Greeting them on E!, Joan Rivers was undaunted, of course, as she
admired the boys and asked them to do a swirl for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Looking more Grammy than Oscar, the ``South Park'' dudes were a
welcome relief from the rest of the Hollywood men, dully dressed in
variations of stiff black and white.

`WEIRD LIKE US: MY BOHEMIAN AMERICA': CHALLENGING THE NORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface words in 8th graf are meant to be italicized.
Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JENNY LYN BADER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Jenny Lyn Bader is co-author, with Bill Brazell, of ``He Meant,
She Meant: The Definitive Male-Female Dictionary.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ann Powers has been a record store clerk, a radical scholar on a
Ph.D. track at Berkeley and an editor for The Village Voice. And
for as long as she can remember, she has been a bohemian. In
``Weird Like Us: My Bohemian America,'' she argues that bohemianism
is not only alive and well, it is thriving, and whatever inroads it
makes into the mainstream only provide evidence of its power and
vibrancy.
</P>
<P>
   Part cultural history, part personal memoir and part
sociological theory, ``Weird Like Us'' is a rebuff to anyone who
thinks bohemia is over. (Those who apparently consider it dead
include bohemians in denial, cynics from the suburbs, and left-wing
thinkers who say alternative culture is dead because nowadays it
gets commercialized faster than you can say grunge Barbie.)
</P>
<P>
   For Powers, who writes pop music reviews for The New York Times,
being bohemian means more than wearing rumpled clothes in cafes; it
embodies a set of beliefs and ideals that not only can but also
should influence the norm. She states that both new values and new
tastes historically emerge from bohemia and writes passionately
about the outsider values she believes should trickle in, for the
sake of social progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weird Like Us'' begins on the occasion of the author's first
acid trip, an event that feels mystical and sad, funny and tender.
The reader is immediately hooked on the intimacy of this writing,
which soon gives way to patches of soapbox preaching and
sociological theorizing. But the book remains at its finest when it
is most intimate. Powers has a gift for telling personal histories,
and for making history personal, and her chapter on the history of
rock music moves swiftly through everything you ever wanted to know
about psychedelic art punk, the rave scene, alternative and indie
rock. Her interview subjects are usually her friends, who take ``an
indie-rock approach to life.'' She writes poignantly of the pains
of adolescence, of the high school loners who strive to turn
weirdness into an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Powers has lived in the bohemian trenches. In high school, she
wore hot pink vintage New Wave outfits, followed punk bands and
wrote poetry. After dropping out of college, she lived in a group
house in San Francisco in a building ``the color of cat food,''
with a Violent Femmes poster on the wall and 20 roommates, not
counting the mice who lived in the oven. She experimented with
drugs and life choices with friends she viewed as a surrogate
family. ``We'd gather regularly for Sunday dinners,'' she writes,
``though our Sundays sometimes fell on other people's Wednesdays.''
</P>
<P>
   She is wonderful at invoking the details of her life and the
lives of those around her, from sex radicals to zine editors to
junk culture mavens. Powers takes her lifestyle choices seriously.
It is clear that she is in favor of rhinestones and recycled furs,
whimsical vintage hats and legalizing marijuana. She is against
conformity, wearing suits and the Crate and Barrel catalog.
</P>
<P>
   But she also has a keen sense of irony. In one laid-back group
house, a pair of intense bohemians write a lengthy statement of
purpose about the house and its values and interview prospective
roommates as if they were job applicants. Powers introduces us to a
lap dancer who also works as an accupressurist, a bisexual sex
worker who maintains a strict vegan diet, and a woman named
Cassandra who tries heroin for the first time on the eve of Ronald
Reagan's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Powers is wickedly funny and original on the drug culture. When
she was attending Blanchet High School in Seattle, a boy named
Claude, tripping on drugs, walked through a plate-glass sliding
door. She describes how she and her friends explained away the
incident: ``He had taken PCP _ angel dust, an animal tranquilizer
favored by crazed criminals. A  &UR; bad drug &LR; . Twenty years after that
September, I have still avoided angel dust. Never mind that within
months of Claude's disappearance from Blanchet I was downing
bottles of Robitussin in a juvenile effort at mind expansion, and
by junior year I was dropping acid and drinking cupfuls of mushroom
tea. Those were all  &UR; good drugs &LR; , favored by gentle hippies and
genius bands like the Butthole Surfers, promising bliss and
visions, not permanently warped frontal lobes.''
</P>
<P>
   She reveals more layers of hypocrisy as she discusses those who
just say no to pot but are addicted to Prozac, explores the death
of an acquaintance who was a heroin addict and explains why her
high school buddies thought cocaine was good but speed was only
sometimes good.
</P>
<P>
   Powers even possesses that rare commodity in a cultural
memoirist, self-irony. After a preachy passage, she confesses,
``I'm getting a little evangelical here, and I know that isn't
cool.'' And one of the funniest moments in this book comes when she
is planning her wedding ceremony. (She wore orange and incorporated
elements like handfasting, a neopagan custom in which the couple's
hands are bound together by a cord.) She admits: ``I was earnestly
discussing my ideas with a lesbian friend who is quite opposed to
marriage, relating all the different ways we felt our ceremony
could critique the institution. I went on and on until she
interrupted me: It is going to be fun, too, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the reader occasionally empathizes with said lesbian
friend, wondering why a book about vibrant, defiant communities of
independent souls cannot be just a little more fun, why stories
from the bohemian front must be interrupted by textbook moments
like ``the baby boomers' legacy of commodified youthfulness.'' But
then the stories continue, and they make Powers' case more
eloquently than any manifesto could.

&HT;     LAKE DAVIS' PIKE PROBLEM IS JUST BEGINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TOM STIENSTRA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A stunning letter from the American Fisheries
Society calls California Fish and Game director Bob Hight
irresponsible for settling for anything less than complete
eradication of northern pike at Lake Davis in the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay-Delta's population of salmon, steelhead and several
endangered species would be put at risk if pike escape the lake and
find their way downstream into the spawning grounds of the San
Joaquin Delta, DFG scientists and managers have previously
testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe any action less than eradication is in violation of
state law, and biologically and ecologically irresponsible,''
writes Michael Meinz, director of the Fisheries Society, in a
letter to Hight. ``The plan, by suggesting otherwise, clearly
demonstrates a total lack of knowledge and understanding of fish
population dynamics. This fatal flaw alone destroys the scientific
credibility of the entire plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Hight announced last month, that pike would be ``contained and
controlled'' at Lake Davis. That reversed a 10-year, hard-line
policy of eradication of the predator fish, which look something
like an alligator mouth connected to a tail. Through several
assistants, Hight refused an interview request this past week
regarding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martarano of the DFG defended the new policy, and said
that the department is open to suggestions on how to minimize the
pike threat, short of poisoning the lake or draining it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing the Fisheries Society doesn't realize is that we
consider this a work in progress,'' Martarano said. ``We're trying
a lot of different things, and we're open to suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   Martarano said that poisoning the lake to end the pike threat is
out of the question, a strategy that was successful at Frenchman
Lake near Chilcoot but botched three years ago at Davis. Draining
the lake has been considered and rejected, he said, because with
the current mechanics at the dam, it would take two years to drain
the lake and longer to refill.
</P>

SPREADING THE WORD ON DIABETES _ AND ITS BREAKTHROUGHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixteen million Americans have diabetes, but 5.4 million of them
do not know they have it.
</P>
<P>
   An Arlington, Texas, woman first learned she had diabetes when
she developed a severe fungal infection in her sinuses following
the extraction of an abscessed tooth. Her high blood sugar fueled
the infection, which spread quickly, killing tissue around her eyes
and nose. Her right eye and cheekbone were removed. Still in the
hospital, eight weeks after diabetes was diagnosed, the woman died
of complications of the disease. She was 57.
</P>
<P>
   A Fort Worth man's diabetes was diagnosed while he was under
anesthesia for cardiac bypass surgery. His blood sugar soared so
high that he went into a diabetic coma, and doctors informed his
family that he was in danger of death, not from the heart surgery,
but from diabetes. Why, the surgeon asked, had he not been told
about the diabetes?
</P>
<P>
   Why, the patient asks today, had he not been told that he has
diabetes?
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is often a silent disease. Over the years _ even before
you know you have it _ diabetes can harm the eyes, kidneys, nerves
and heart. It is a leading cause of blindness, kidney failure and
amputation. It kills 180,000 people in this country each year.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic gold medalist Gary Hall Jr. this week is joining the
American Diabetes Association in sounding an alert about the
seriousness of diabetes and the importance of finding the millions
of Americans who have it and don't know it.
</P>
<P>
   America's top freestyle sprint swimmer, Hall, 25, won two gold
and two silver medals at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is training
for this year's Olympic games in Sydney, Australia. He found out
last March that he has diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are almost 6 million Americans with diabetes who don't
know it. I was one of those people,'' Hall said in a phone visit
last week . ``I was experiencing fatigue and dizziness, which I
wrote off as overwork in my training, and my eyesight was becoming
blurry, but I attributed that to the chlorinated water. Finally,
one day I was so dizzy I thought I was going to faint. The next day
I was diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall says he was very scared when he first learned the symptoms
were caused by a life-threatening disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a frightening experience, and even very young children,
even babies, can be diagnosed with diabetes. It's not limited to
any age group or type. It can happen to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so strongly that if I was able to overcome it and swim
better than ever before with diabetes, I could give a sense of hope
to others. You can go out and achieve greatness even with this
disease _ but if you have it, you must know it so you can control
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he hopes to help raise awareness about the seriousness
of diabetes, its risk factors and its complications through
tomorrow's American Diabetes Alert Day, an annual call to action
for people to find out if they are at risk for the disease and to
inform them about the various new tools available to control it.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of the alert is type II diabetes, by far the most
common form. Type II develops very slowly and mainly affects people
over age 40, whose cells become resistent to the insulin they
produce. Sometimes it becomes necessary for them to receive insulin
injections, but often their disease can be controlled with diet,
exercise and oral medications that make their cells more sensitive
to the insulin produced by the pancreas.
</P>
<P>
   Type I, formerly known as insulin-dependent diabetes, usually
develops in childhood or adolesence, often in people with no known
risk factors. The body produces little or no insulin, the hormone
that enables the body's cells to absorb sugar glucose from the
blood and use it for energy.
</P>
<P>
   Primary risk factors for Type II include being overweight,
underactive and over the age of 45 and having a family history of
diabetes. African-Americans, Hispanics, American Indians and women
who have had babies weighing more than 9 pounds at birth are at
increased risk.
</P>
<P>
   Most people with Type II diabetes do not notice any symptoms,
and many patients found to have it are estimated to have had the
disease seven to 10 years before its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you are very thirsty, urinate often or lose weight
without trying, you should call your doctor right away, says
Christine Sammer, certified diabetes educator with the Huguley
Health System.
</P>
<P>
   ``Screening is so important because the symptoms can be so
subtle and can be attributed to many different disease
conditions,'' Sammer says. ``People rationalize and decide they are
thirsty because of the hot Texas weather and that they have to get
up several times during the night to use the bathroom because they
drink so much water.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammer points out that there are many tools available today to
help people control their blood-sugar level, including drugs,
monitors and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important component is education. We teach people all
the important keys to managing their diabetes _ meal planning,
exercise, stress management and medications if needed,'' says
Sammer.
</P>
<P>
   While diabetes is still an incurable disease, new forms of
insulin and monitors to help maintain proper blood-sugar levels are
now giving many people with diabetes much better control over their
disease, and much research is being done on islet cell transplants,
which offer hope of a real cure.
</P>
<P>
   New, improved forms of insulin such as the rapid-acting Humalog,
which is a combination of two types of insulin that can come
pre-mixed in a pre-filled pen for ease and convenience, and
delivery systems, like the insulin pump, which is implanted under
the skin and delivers a slow trickle of insulin when it is needed,
help patients maintain control over fluctuating blood-sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
   Also, new, painless ways to measure glucose levels without
pricking the skin are being developed, and at least one is expected
to be on the market in a few months. In December, the Food and Drug
Administration recommended approval for the GlucoWatch Monitor,
which collects fluid from the surface of the skin to measure the
amount of sugar in the blood. The fluid is absorbed by a small
disposable pad, and the watch automatically checks glucose levels
every 20 minutes for 12 hours. An alarm sounds if the blood glucose
gets too high or too low. The watch is expected to cost about $300,
with collection pads an additional $4 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, researchers reported this month on the first human trial
of a noninvasive technique that uses ultrasound to monitor glucose
levels.

<P>
   TOKYO _ DaimlerChrysler AG, the world's third-largest maker of
motor vehicles, signed an agreement Monday to invest in Mitsubishi
Motors Corp., finally securing the toehold in Asia that it has long
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.1 billion deal would leave Toyota and Honda as Japan's
last major automakers without big foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler will buy newly issued shares that will give it a
33.4 percent stake in Mitsubishi, enough to guarantee it board
representation and limited veto power.
</P>
<P>
   The German-based car company said that the alliance would give
it entree to Asian markets and access to small-car technology that
it would use to expand its Smart car brand. DaimlerChrysler said
Monday that Mitsubishi will supply transmissions and direct
injection gasoline engines for Smart cars, cutting its development
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have closed the circle,'' Juergen Schrempp, chairman of
DaimlerChrysler, told reporters at the company's headquarters in
Stuttgart Monday. ``We have covered all the markets of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal had been expected for the last few weeks, when word
that both sides were close to an agreement first began circulating.
But the official announcement and terms of the partnership still
helped push up Mitsubishi's share price 12 percent Monday, to 470
yen, or $4.40. &UR;  &LR; DaimlerChrysler shares eased 31.25 cents in New
York, closing at $67.1875.
</P>
<P>
   For Mitsubishi, the agreement means survival. With debts that
outweigh equity and a history of poor profitability, the company
needed a partner.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of two years, 7 of Japan's 11 automakers have taken
foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of Japanese automakers, this was the last one
available,'' said Christopher Richter, an analyst at HSBC
Securities in Tokyo. ``Toyota is too big, Honda has no apparent
interest in an alliance and competition for the Korean automakers
is intense.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Monday raised the question of whether
DaimlerChrysler is paying a price for walking away from a deal with
Nissan Motor Co. nearly a year ago. Since then, DaimlerChrysler has
talked with PSA Peugeot Citroen, Fiat and others but failed to
clinch a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding its truck business, which is not part of the
agreement, Mitsubishi has a much smaller product line than Nissan,
and debt accounts for a bigger portion of its balance sheet than
did Nissan's debts.
</P>
<P>
   And it is an integral part of a tightly knit business cluster,
the Mitsubishi Group, which has resisted political and financial
pressure to dismantle itself, unlike other Japanese conglomerates.
Mitsubishi Group companies own, and will continue to own, a larger
portion of Mitsubishi Motors than members of the Fuyo Group held in
Nissan, according to Richter.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kentaro Aikawa, the former chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, Mitsubishi's biggest shareholder, is famous for saying
that shareholders do not matter. ``The notion that accrued profits
belong to shareholders is an American one,'' Aikawa said in 1997.
``In Japan, these profits go to paying employee salaries, even when
the work dries up.''
</P>
<P>
   While Aikawa has since taken an advisory role at the company,
his sentiments have continued to color perceptions of Mitsubishi
Motors, which was once part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the biggest challenges here will be providing
DaimlerChrysler with the management access and participation it
wants while keeping the existing management team in place to keep
the Mitsubishi group happy,'' said Steven Usher, an analyst at
Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo. ``I think that will be very
touchy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nissan announced a year ago that it had sold a
similar-sized stake to Renault S.A. of France, it was clear that
the company had resigned itself to the management of its partner.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Ghosn, a senior executive of Renault, had been identified
at the news conference announcing the deal as Nissan's new chief
operating officer, and he began his job almost immediately. He was
quickly followed by 40 other Renault executives, who made it clear
that they were in charge.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler had no version of Ghosn on hand Monday. Instead,
Katsuhiko Kawasoe, who has tenaciously guarded Mitsubishi's
independence for the last two years, remains as president, or
``shatcho,'' a title that confers a great deal more authority and
weight here than it does in the United States. Ghosn will gain that
title at Nissan in June.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that Daimler will be a passive partner at
Mitsubishi. It has forcefully demonstrated its ability to wield
management control over Chrysler, which has seen a veritable flood
of executives depart in the wake of the merger more than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether Mitsubishi Motors will give DaimlerChrysler as big a
market in Asia as DaimlerChrysler believes is another question.
Mitsubishi Motors has an impressive distribution network in the
region, and its market shares there are higher than Nissan's if its
truck operations are taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitsubishi Motors signed a deal with Volvo last year that
gives the Swedish company a 19 percent stake in Mitsubishi's truck
business, and Volvo has said it is not interested in selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have been a lot more attractive for DaimlerChrysler
if trucks were part of it,'' Richter said.
</P>

and a website:
</P>
<P>
   ``KMT'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Egypt 'R' Us. If seeing ``The Mummy'' just wasn't enough, check
out this quarterly publication, subtitled ``A Modern Journal of
Ancient Egypt.'' (KMT is the spelling of the name for Egypt in
ancient Egyptian.) The spring issue includes a story on the Museum
of Mummification in Luxor (Egyptian city, not Vegas casino).
Article notes that only the most independent traveler stumbles on
Luxor's best-kept secret, the first museum of its kind, dedicated
solely to the ancient art of preserving bodies (the Dick Clark wing
is a must-see). Turns out that mummification was not limited to
humans. The Egyptians also preserved animals, including crocodiles,
cats and apes. Also includes an interesting piece on the
restoration of six tombs in the Valley of the Kings, with color
photos of the brilliantly painted interiors, pillars and
sarcophagi. Of course, the exhibits are limited to items not swiped
by the British, who carted away Egypt's antiquities by the boatload
around the turn of the 20th century. Blimey! &QL; 
 &QL; 
``MOTHER JONES'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're all fired up to vote for George W. Bush this fall, you
might skip this month's issue, in which Molly Ivins knocks Dubya
off his pins with an adaption from her book, ``Shrub: The Short But
Happy Political Life of George W. Bush.'' With more clarity and
brevity than the recent tree-killer in ``Harper's,'' Ivins manages
to outline how Bush parlayed his family name into big money by
bouncing from loser company to loser company, always to be bailed
out in the end. ``In oil, as in politics, Dubya's MO is
consistent,'' Ivins writes. ``Leverage the family name and a small
investment into really big money, always provided by others.''
Ivins also notes that Bush flipped his oil companies, unloaded
stock as a corporate insider before the price plummeted and walked
away with ``more money than Bill Clinton ever dreamed of making on
a little real-estate deal now known as Whitewater.'' Still, she
says, Texas will forgive him as it did the likes of John Connally,
Lloyd Bentsen and Phil Gramm. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``VANITY FAIR'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is our favorite issue every year, the one full of those
cool photographs of Hollywood stars in Annie Leibovitz-type poses
(even though many of the photos are not taken by Leibovitz this
year). Best photo reunites the cast of ``American Graffiti.''
Amazing special effects allow George Lucas' ego to somehow fit in
the frame. Another favorite is Chuck Jones (OK, I'll admit it, I
thought he was dead), popping up out of a ``wabbit'' hole in the
desert. And then there is George Clooney, looking eerily like Clark
Gable (dead, we checked). Low point is Demi Moore naked with her
kids. Make the bad woman go away! The cranky guys over at ``Slate''
(www.slate.com) called this issue as ``hagiographic as ever,'' and
once we consulted a dictionary (www.dictionary.com) to figure out
what that means (worshipful biography) we have to agree. The
Slaters must be having one of those secret staff contests to get
obscure words into print. They also managed to work in the word
odalisque (harem girl), last used by Tennyson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WIRED'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cover story is frightening piece on the future of the human race
written by Bill Joy, chief scientist at Sun Microsystems, inventor
of UNIX and Java and all-around genius-boy. Joy paints a picture of
homo sapiens dominated by a robot population of their own creation.
It sounds far-fetched until Joy makes his eloquent case, noting
that technology soon will be able to create extremely advanced,
self-replicating robots that could make old-fashioned biological
organisms obsolete. Quoting the Unabomber (ironic, because Joy was
once a prime target of the anti-technology terrorist), Joy warns of
unintended consequences that could spring from robotics, genetic
engineering and nanotechnology. ``By 2030,'' he writes, ``we are
likely to be able to build machines, in quantity, a million times
as powerful as the personal computer of today _ sufficient to
implement the dreams'' of those who imagine a world of robot
servants. If you want to know how this works out, rent the film
``The Forbin Project.'' &QL;

   The list, based on a count of search words punched into Lycos

   It's also a good way to gauge public opinion. For example, with
Major League Baseball about to start, you might think that people
would be pouring into the MLB sites. Not so.

<P>
   Last week, the top sports-related sites included, at No. 2,
March Madness (NCAA basketball tournament); at No. 6, the WWF
(wrasslin' and, no, we don't want to get into that argument); and,
at No. 16, NASCAR (vroom, vroom). Baseball was No. 40.
</P>
<P>
   As further evidence that the Internet is dominated by
14-year-old boys, a number of top sites involve popular Web pinups
such as Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Anna Kournikova, Jenny
McCarthy, Carmen Electra and, of course, Pamela Lee.

Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE TIPPING POINT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Malcolm Gladwell (Little, Brown, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were skeptical when we picked this up, having become adept
over the years at detecting books that aren't about anything
(they're like the emperor's new clothes _ they try to dazzle you,
but there's nothing to them). It wasn't long, however, before we
were hooked. If the premise does grow a bit thin _ Gladwell sounds
at times like an author inventing reasons to rattle on _ for the
most part it is thought-provoking and presented with an appealing
eye toward popular culture. The ``tipping point'' of the title is
the moment at which something becomes an epidemic, a word Gladwell
applies to fashion trends, fads, crime statistics, the success of a
bestselling book. His examination of how this happens is
dumbfoundingly interesting, and it includes discussion of the
resurgence of Hush Puppies (the shoes) in the mid-1990s, the
phenomenon of ``Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' (the book)
when it was released in paperback in 1998, and the ``word-of-mouth
epidemic'' created by Paul Revere (the silversmith) in 1775.
Gladwell works for ``The New Yorker,'' in which the tipping-point
theory made its first appearance. &QL; 
 &UR; ``I WILL BEAR WITNESS: A DIARY OF THE NAZI
 &UR; YEARS, 1942-1945'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Victor Klemperer (Random House, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Jewish rumors: There had been mass murders in Poland in
the course of withdrawals. On the other hand, Jews had been allowed
out of Hungary after a Hungarian agreement with the USA. We
consider Point 1 very likely; Point 2 can be correct only if
Hungary has broken away from Germany. Did it? We are tapping in the
dark.'' Klemperer, the son of a Berlin rabbi, wrote this in his
diary during the hot, humid summer of 1944, as he and his wife
lived through the Nazi terror in Dresden. His remarkable diaries
(the first volume, which covers 1933 to 1941, was published in
1998) re-create the confusion, fear, humiliation and emotional
claustrophobia that ruled the lives of German Jews. Included in
this volume are rumors of the crimes at Auschwitz and other camps,
the fragile link to survival that Klemperer's marriage to an
``Aryan'' afforded him and an account of the bombing of Dresden.
It's a riveting and invaluable glimpse of what life was like for a
Jew living in Nazi Germany. Klemperer died in 1960. &QL; 
 &UR; ``A GARDEN IN LUCCA'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Paul Gervais (Hyperion, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is there anyone left in America who does not own a villa in the
hills of Tuscany? Certainly the American literati have established
a presence there, the better to write books that make the rest of
us back home weak-kneed with envy. A prerequisite of this new life
in Italy, it seems, is that the villa in question must need work _
Frances Mayes and her boyfriend renovated theirs in her book
``Under the Tuscan Sun,'' and now Gervais (his novel
``Extraordinary People'' was nominated for a PEN/Faulkner award in
1991) and his companion do it here. The twist Gervais offers is
that the huge house they bought in 1982 in the small town of Massa
Macinaia in Lucca province came with its own huge, run-down garden.
This was new to Gervais, who grew up in New England and who knew
nothing of gardening, so he learned on the job, making lots of
mistakes until he hit upon a plan. We know he was successful,
because his book opens with a California horticultural foundation
booking his garden for its next tour. That's right _ foundation
members traveled 7,000 miles to see it. This is not as seductive as
the Mayes book, but it will make you jealous just the same.  &QL; 
 &UR; ``GOOD BREEDING'' &QL; 
 &UR; Photographs by Yann Arthus-Bertrand (Abrams, $49.50)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do not laugh. No, do not laugh. Yes, those are pigs on the cover
and they are handsome devils, don't you think? All of the animals
in this book are handsome, because they are bred to be.
Arthus-Bertrand offers grand portraits of prizewinning domestic
livestock (sheep, cattle, goats, horses and swine) posed with their
very proud owners, breeders or trainers. The creatures are
astonishing. They are also a little _ well, odd, to the untrained
eye. Huge in just about every respect, if you know what we mean.
Dauntingly larger than the human beings who stand with them
(there's a Blonde D'Aquitaine bull on Page 47 that looks like it
could take out Manhattan). Muscled, veined, groomed and dandy, they
pose as if they are fully aware of just how excellent they are.
This is, in case you have not surmised it by now, a strange but
endearing book. You might be tempted to laugh (but don't) as you
look through it, but you quickly get caught up in the spirit of the
thing. Except when you see the pigs. You can laugh at them.  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the United States is enjoying continuing
prosperity, affordable housing for many of the working poor has
become harder to find, a federal report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of
housing and urban development, said that 5.4 million low-income
families pay more than half their incomes for housing or live in
dilapidated units, an increase of 12 percent since the economic
expansion began in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The government regards housing for low-income people affordable
if does not consume more than a third of a family's income.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the highest need for affordable housing since we have
been taking numbers,'' Cuomo said at a news conference at his
department's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that low-income housing was becoming less available
because ``it is getting old, it is coming out of service, it is
being knocked down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that the housing difficulties for the working poor
were caused by several factors, including the rising economy
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, building owners accepted low-income tenants whose
rent was paid from their own earnings and from a government voucher
program known as Section 8. But because of the nation's rising
prosperity, Cuomo said, many property owners have found that
higher-income tenants have bid up the prices of the apartments
beyond the poorer tenants' abilities to pay, even with the
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, Cuomo said, was that Congress refused to approve
additional Section 8 housing from 1995 through 1998, ``when we went
out of the housing business.'' He blamed the Republicans in
Congress for the lack of new Section 8 units, saying, ``We had
proposals in the tens of thousands for every year, and Congress
said zero.''
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton asked for an additional 120,000 housing
vouchers in his State of the Union message in January, Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., acknowledged that no new vouchers had been approved
by Congress in the four-year period, but he said that there were
good reasons for that .
</P>
<P>
   A cause of Republican objections, he said, was a ``take one,
take all'' provision that required landlords who accepted any
families with housing vouchers to accept all families with them.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' complaints were satisfied, Lazio said, and
Congress approved 50,000 new housing vouchers in 1999 and 60,000
more last year.
</P>
<P>
   As to Clinton's request for 120,000 more this year, Lazio said,
``I support the additional use of vouchers, but it is incumbent on
us to be responsible in paying for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he had introduced a measure calling for 100,000
units, ``so we are very close.'' He said that the Clinton
administration had to show where the money would come from and not
resort to budget ``gimmicks'' to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that the additional 120,000 housing vouchers, which
would cost $6 billion, would help ease the ``cruel irony'' of the
strong economy hurting the poor by driving up rents. ``Many people
are being left behind and they need help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his own department, which has jurisdiction over
housing, should not share in the blame for the shortage, Cuomo
said, ``If there was any failure, it was our failure to persuade
Congress to provide funds.''

ADVERTISING: BIZARRE IS THE POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain)  (mk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ At first glance, the commercial seemed like a spoof, a
comedy skit that could appear on ``Saturday Night Live.'' Nicholas
Leeson, the rogue stock trader who caused the collapse of Britain's
oldest merchant bank, Barings PLC, is appearing in a campaign that
promotes a Swedish dot-com stock trading company. It may sound as
bizarre as having the captain of the Exxon Valdez endorse Bounty
paper towels, but the commercial's creators said bizarre was very
much the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds strange if you're not here in the market,''
said Johan Almquist, chief executive of TBWA Stockholm, who came up
with the concept of using Leeson as an endorser. ``We always do odd
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Leeson, 32, is infamous for racking up a staggering $1.4 billion
in losses while wildly trading futures at Barings' Singapore
office, sinking the bank, which was later sold for 1 pound to ING
Group of the Netherlands. After four years in jail in Singapore,
Leeson returned to London last summer just after his story was
released as a film called ``Rogue Trader,'' based on his memoir,
which was published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   When Almquist began brainstorming advertising ideas for his
client, Matteus.com, the online trading company, he wanted to
differentiate the site from rivals that were setting up shop in
Sweden, including ETrade of the United States. Because Matteus also
serves as a traditional brokerage house providing financial
planning and stock advice, TBWA crafted a campaign that points out
the risky side of gambling in the stock market on the Internet and
portrays Matteus as the best alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought to ourselves, `Who could warn people that this is a
dangerous game?''' Almquist said. ``It occurred to us that Nick was
the best example.'' Getting Matteus' executives to go along with
using Leeson as an endorser was the easy part _ ``They laughed a
lot and said, `Of course,''' Almquist said _ but getting Leeson to
agree to appear was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Because Leeson still owes 100 million pounds, or $159 million,
to Barings' liquidators, all appearance fees have to be negotiated
by an army of lawyers. All fees are divided in half _ 50 percent
going to Barings and 50 percent going to Leeson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick gets offers all the time for endorsements,'' said Ian
Monk, Leeson's agent, who also represents Barings' liquidators.
``We wanted to do something socially responsible. He's the world's
best example of how things can go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   To TBWA's surprise, Leeson agreed to do the ad. ``We thought
there was an outside chance,'' Almquist said. Both TBWA _ part of
the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group _ and Monk refused to
divulge how much Leeson was paid for his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which is in English with Swedish subtitles, begins with
clips of news footage from when Barings collapsed and Leeson was
arrested. The commercial then cuts to a somber _ if not deadpan _
Leeson against a white backdrop staring at the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me four years and 2000 prison meals ago,'' he says in a
way reminiscent of a public service announcement. ``Barings went
bankrupt. I lost my life. It's a very risky business. You can make
a lot of money fast, but we all make mistakes. It's easier than you
think to lose everything overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The television commercial, which just finished its initial
three-week run, is scheduled to be repeated this spring and summer.
A separate print ad that included a picture of Leeson and his saga
ran in large Swedish daily newspapers and financial magazines and
is also scheduled for a second run. TBWA declined to disclose the
cost of the campaign, which is running only in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Leeson spent three days in Stockholm, Sweden, filming the
advertisement. ``He's a regular guy,'' Almquist said. ``We talked
about football and girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Almquist said the campaign had received a positive response,
``and of course a lot of press.'' He said the audience in Sweden,
which has one of the highest Internet-use rates in the world,
appreciated the commercial for its message, not simply as a gag.
</P>
<P>
   As for ING Barings' response, a spokesman who couldn't contain
his laughter said, ``No comment.''

&HT;     ROBERT STRAUSS, ETERNALLY YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Living legends in the nation's capital are rare.
The rich and powerful tend to burn out early or give up on the
political wars, and sometimes they go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   But one man has outdistanced practically everyone, friend and
foe alike. Superlawyer Robert Strauss is the ultimate insider, an
influential adviser to both Republican and Democratic presidents.
He is a wheeler-dealer of the old school who is as much an
institution hereabouts as the Senate's wonderful bean soup.
</P>
<P>
   Now a vigorous 81 years old, Strauss proved again in a speech
last weekend before a gathering of big-name journalists that he has
lost neither his fabled sense of humor nor his remarkable political
savvy. He first spoke at the Gridiron Club dinner 25 years ago. He
was then Democratic National Committee chairman and he gave his
party's response to a speech by Republican Vice President Nelson
Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss outclassed Rockefeller that night in 1975, and on
Saturday he also triumphed over his newest partisan competitor at
the podium, former Republican National Committee Chairman Haley
Barbour. Strauss uses humor to make his points, but he knows the
difference between mockery and malice.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, now a high-priced influence peddler like Strauss,
doesn't have that knack. His jokes had more bile than bite.
Strauss, however, concluded his remarks by noting, ``Civility does
not have to be something that only old men like me recollect.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss, a Texan and protigi of former Gov. John Connally, rose
in the Democratic ranks the hard way. He earned his fame through
loyalty to his conservative mentors and a skillful mix of politics
and business interests. For years he labored behind the scenes as
an obscure fund-raiser and back-slapper.
</P>
<P>
   He took over the Democratic Party after George McGovern's
disastrous left-wing presidential campaign in 1972 left the party
in ruins. Strauss shoved the leadership back toward centrist common
sense. But he has always had friends and allies across party lines,
as any good mover-and-shaker must. Bob Dole is a buddy, as is
former President George Bush, a fellow Texan who appointed Strauss
ambassador to the old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss ran Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign and became
Carter's special trade representative and Middle East envoy.
Between government jobs, he returns to the law firm he helped to
found, one of the most powerful in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss was not born to great wealth, but he has it now. He has
not neglected his own bank account in his love for politics.
Self-sacrifice is not included in his business code. He is
successful at what he does, which is mostly a corporate law
practice that puts the right people together with other right
people. Nothing wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once joked that ``he makes his living giving people
advice on how to undo the advice he gave someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all his closeness to power and money, Strauss has
maintained a reputation for keeping his own hands clean.
Politicians of both parties trust his word. Media types, at least
those of us of the older generation, think he's by far the best of
his breed.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss is famous for getting money out of heavy Democratic
givers, which the Gridiron Club duly noted last weekend in a song
dedicated to the fine art of fleecing the rich. Vernon Jordan, his
latest protigi and President Clinton's golfing chum, is a law firm
partner and Strauss's potential successor as premier Democratic
deal-maker.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Strauss jovially noted that he and Jordan were
recently discussing politics. ``I asked him, `Who in the hell
coined that phrase `Clinton fatigue?' Jordan said, `Mrs.
Clinton.'''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss' jokes were carefully bipartisan. ``George W. thought
that Fettuccine Alfredo was the president of Italy,'' he said. But
he also ribbed Vice President Al Gore's tendency to exaggerate.``I
had no idea he saved John McCain's life in that prison camp!''
</P>
<P>
   So how does Strauss do it? How does he keep going at the top of
his game decade after decade?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   Lace everything with a dollop of humor, some of it
self-deprecating, some of it of a put-down nature, which targeted
recipients take in jolly spirit. Do everything with warm
enthusiasm, making companions feel truly wanted and your presence
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your word. Keep your mouth shut about the embarrassing
stuff. Stick to your friends when they are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Be practical. Forget the ideological traps and deal with the
real world.
</P>
<P>
   Like everybody and they will like you. Make the right friends.
</P>
<P>
   Don't cheat. Play it straight, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   And never be a shrinking violet. A little chutzpah goes a long
way.
</P>
<P>
   I think Bob Strauss is great, but don't ask me to explain why.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For inexplicable reasons, in a recent column I promoted Rep.
John Edward Porter, R-Ill., to chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee. He is chairman of the Appropriations Committee's labor,
health, human services and education subcommittee.

   NEW YORK _ ``La Clemenza di Tito,'' the opera Mozart wrote for a
coronation in Prague a few months before he died, was long
undervalued but now seems absolutely immediate. Not only is it
filled with great and glorious music _ strongly presented in the
new City Opera production _ but it speaks to concerns that are
ours. An era is passing away, and all that people feel they can
trust is the world of private emotion. How, though, are they to
tell the formal gesture, the attitude, from the native impulse of
the heart? And can the machinery of a state go on under these
circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   Right from the first, at Sunday afternoon's opening performance,
the musical caliber was high. Harry Bicket, the conductor, had the
overture played with a light touch, speedily and exactly, and the
orchestra remained deft and adroit. The choruses, marches and other
evocations of grandeur were swift and simple, without pomposity.
The important solos on clarinet and basset horn were beautifully
phrased by Laura Flax.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, in the central role of Sesto, asked for
the audience's understanding because of a viral infection, but it
is impossible to imagine how she could have sung better. In
``Parto, parto,'' the aria in which Sesto agrees to execute a
palace revolution on behalf of his beloved Vitellia, Hunt
Lieberson's vocal presence and coloring conveyed all the
character's determination and deep underlying regret. Her
impressive performance here gave her confidence and propelled her
into powerfully expressive singing in the accompanied recitative
before the first-act finale. In the second act, her big aria was
again a masterpiece of phrasing and feeling, the two working
together with the help of rich color, perfectly molded sound and a
wide dynamic range.
</P>
<P>
   As Vitellia, Marie Plette had a few problems with the coloratura
in the first act, but in ``Non piu di fiori,'' where she at last
sets aside her imperial ambitions, she was magnificent, her sound
warm and beautifully placed, her demeanor serene. No longer aiming
for the throne, she became majestic.
</P>
<P>
   Tito, the emperor so much plotted against and loved, was sung by
Kurt Streit, with the ringing timbre, lightness and energy that
have made him one of the most sought-after Mozart tenors. His sound
seemed affected more than the others by the amplification.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Tucker, as Sesto's friend Annio, created the image of a
noble youth with creamy yet fresh tone, sensitively phrased and
colored. Tracy Dahl was a bubbly Servilia and Jake Gardner a fine
Publio, at once sound and suave in his singing.
</P>
<P>
   The much traveled production, by Stephen Wadsworth, sets the
piece at the time of its composition, in front of ancient, high,
windowless brick walls that are there throughout and challenge the
lighting. There are some nice moments, especially in how principals
are placed among or against the chorus, but the essential action is
sentimentalized.

 BOSTON: ... Kennedy recalls.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Ohio State Murders'' is a semiautobiographical tale based
on that experience. The lead character reenacts her student years,
a time when she was so tense, she injured the flesh on her head.
Her dreams are left to decompose at the bottom of a lonely ravine.
</P>
<P>
   While many details are factual, Kennedy says the story itself is
fiction. ``When I went to Ohio State, I met my husband-to-be and
clung to him for dear life,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her character, the playwright got married in the
mid-1950s and moved to New York, where her husband, Joseph, was a
graduate student at Columbia University. (They've since divorced,
but remain friends.) Still a daydreamer and a hopeless romantic,
she longed to mingle with the movie stars and the serious writers
of the day and yearned to see her name appear in the gossip columns
of the local tabloids. ``Oh, I was very romantic about
everything,'' she recalls. ``I was this young housewife with a
baby, and I wore these little cotton dresses and had this vague
idea in my mind that I wanted to be a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   The writing life
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She didn't find herself as a writer until she accompanied her
husband to Africa in the early 1960s. All the hallucinogenic images
that had been swirling around in her mind jelled during that trip,
and she fired off ``Funnyhouse.'' The playwright Edward Albee
produced it off-Broadway in 1964. In the play, a college student is
haunted by images of Jesus, Queen Victoria, and the slain African
leader Patrice Lumumba.
</P>
<P>
   Her plays often unfold on that sort of surreal landscape, where
racial hatred can turn an innocent daydream into a vicious
nightmare. Racism is the underlying force of ``Sleep Deprivation
Chamber,'' a play she co-wrote with her son, Adam, that won an Obie
Award in 1996. The play is based on a real incident when Adam, now
38, was beaten by a police officer who followed him home to his
father's house in a tony Virginia suburb. ``It happened in my
husband's front yard,'' Kennedy says. ``I think of all those years
he worked to buy this white house with yellow shutters and a forest
behind it. It was his dream house, but somehow I realized we were
living in a kind of dream world. It was a shock for this to happen
to my son, a real shock.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't like to talk about the incident in too much detail:
Her emotional response is recorded in the play, which depicts a
mother's worst nightmare. After all, the teacher preparing to meet
her students still astonishes herself when that other woman _ the
one who writes the plays _ dredges up such blood-curdling images.
``I still get very upset,'' she says gently before heading to
class.
</P>
<P>
   She decides to allow the visitor to observe the seminar. In
class, one student reads a synopsis of her play, painting harrowing
images of a Christlike figure in a train station, a suicide, a dead
baby, a troubled woman with a troubled past. The student is a timid
type, and Kennedy urges her to be protective of her apocalyptic
vision. ``You have to be careful about listening to other people
because you don't want to get too logical,'' she tells the student.
``You have to be careful with this material because it's very
fragile.'' In those few moments, Adrienne Kennedy the teacher could
be addressing Adrienne Kennedy the playwright. In those brief
moments, she becomes the benevolent teacher she never had at Ohio
State.

 &HT;    FOCUS SHIFTS TO 'REMEDIES' AS MICROSOFT RULING NEARS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an out-of-court settlement of the federal antitrust suit
against Microsoft Corp. remained uncertain Monday, the focus
shifted to the penalties the company could face if a federal judge
rules it has flouted antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told attorneys for
both sides last week he was prepared to issue a ruling as early as
Tuesday unless settlement talks mediated by another federal judge
in Chicago showed substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
   There was little sign of such progress by Monday evening. But
there were reports that Jackson might delay his ruling so that some
of the 19 state governments that have joined the federal government
as plaintiffs could further study a complex settlement proposal
that Microsoft offered Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson does issue a ruling on ``conclusions of law'' in the
case, it is widely expected to be unfavorable to Microsoft. In
``findings of fact'' he issued last year after an earlier phase of
the trial, Jackson said Microsoft enjoyed a monopoly with its
Windows operating system and had used that monopoly to restrict
competition, stifle innovation and harm consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's next step after ruling would be to hear further
arguments from both sides as he weighs ``remedies'' for Microsoft's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Jackson would have to choose between ordering
changes in the company's business practices, as proposed by
Microsoft, or the breakup of the software giant, as favored by some
members of the prosecutorial team.
</P>
<P>
   A breakup could divide the company into several competing firms,
or could sever Windows from the rest of the company.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Microsoft has already sent a clear signal of what
it believes the remedies should be in the settlement offer it
transmitted last week through Judge Richard Posner, head of the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the key mediator in the case.
</P>
<P>
   A central aspect of the Microsoft plan is to no longer offer
preferential discounts for Windows products to hardware makers it
considers partners. The company has also offered to open up its
Windows source code, which would make it easier for rivals to to
make their own programs work smoothly with the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is reportedly also willing to sell a version of
Windows without a bundled Web browser. This has been a prime
objective of the government. Previously, Microsoft held the browser
was locked into the code and could not be removed without damaging
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concessions, continuing disagreement in the
prosecutorial camp could make to more difficult for Jackson to
frame a clear-cut proposal, said University of Baltimore Law School
professor Bob Lande.
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts of bench conferences during the trial indicate that
Jackson will insist that the Justice Department and the 19 state
attorneys general present a common brief on remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be unreasonable to assume that were some
hard-liners among the states who were willing to take their chances
with Judge Jackson,'' said William Kovacic, a George Washington
University Law School professor who has followed the case closely.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is likely to give both sides a month or so to submit
briefs and rebuttals. The key legal players will then appear in
court for the final time to present their oral arguments on what
should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by past practice, Jackson will be inclined to also seek
the advice of outside experts in intellectual property law and high
technology before deciding Microsoft's fate. At his option, he
could eventually adopt or ignore the proposals suggested by the
litigants.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides would then remain free to appeal, all the way up the
Supreme Court, a legal process that could consume several years.

<P>
   The removal of the diabetes drug Rezulin from the market did not
come soon enough to help Monica George, a 68-year-old former nurse
in Rockville, Md.: The drug had already caused her death, her
daughters said. But its removal upset Frank Hopkins, a Virginia
horse-farm owner, who said it had greatly improved his health and
brought his diabetes under control.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the drug by the Food and Drug Administration last
week brought anger, confusion and a stream of questions. Doctors
and patients alike asked whether the agency had approved the drug
too quickly, without regard to the severe liver damage it could
cause. When liver failure and deaths began to occur, did the agency
act too slowly in removing the drug? If so, why?
</P>
<P>
   The FDA approved Rezulin in March 1997 as the first of a class
of drugs called insulin sensitizers that help the body respond more
effectively to its own insulin production, thereby reducing the
patients' need to give themselves insulin shots. It was prescribed
heavily and almost immediately: By last week 1.5 million patients
had used it, and it had generated $1.7 billion in sales for the
manufacturer, Parke-Davis, a subsidiary of Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the evidence was clear in the clinical trials
that Rezulin could cause severe liver problems but that the agency
had approved it for marketing without proper warnings or
recommendations that it be monitored. Eight months later, after
problems arose, warnings of liver problems and recommendations that
patients be closely monitored were issued.
</P>
<P>
   By March of last year 26 deaths had occurred and by last week
the number had risen to 63, with a total of 90 cases of liver
failure reported, of which 14 resulted in a need for transplants.
The FDA advised patients to talk to their doctors about what they
should do next. Since Rezulin was introduced, two similar
medications have been put on the market with less risk, Actos and
Avandia.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA defends its actions in both approving and then
withdrawing the drug, saying it was unfair to suggest in hindsight
that it could have predicted what happened. In some cases, the
agency says, the liver failure happened so fast that even close
monitoring would not have prevented it.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients interviewed were angry that the drug was approved
so quickly, but in the end they generally regarded the drug's
removal as good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``This needed to happen,'' said Elaine M. Shaw, a
special-education nurse in Charlottesville, Va., and one of Monica
George's three daughters. ``It does not bring my mother back, but I
think it will save lives.'' Shaw said that her mother, a geriatric
nurse, was ``savvy about her own liver function and she knew she
had elevated liver enzymes _ but she did not know there were
concerns about liver toxicity with the new drug.''
</P>
<P>
   George was a ``vibrant, healthy woman, in a good place with her
life, traveling, enjoying grandchildren,'' her daughter said, when
she was put on Rezulin in November 1997. But she then began to
complain of fatigue, weight gain, poor circulation and other
symptoms associated with liver problems. Her doctor at the time,
Shaw said, told her mother that fatigue was normal, but he did not
check her liver function and kept her on Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   George switched doctors and was promptly taken off the drug in
August 1998, but after several weeks of intense suffering she died
of severe liver damage, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the day after the FDA acted, Elaine Shaw and her
sisters, Andrea Shaw and Donna Louise George Storey, filed suit
against the first doctor and Warner-Lambert/Parke-Davis. In the
suit, they said the company's clinical trials showed the drug could
cause ``serious liver damage leading to death or requiring liver
transplant.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughters said that Rezulin was initially marketed without
warnings or explanations sufficient to reflect the severity of
possible liver problems, but that eight months later the company
added information about possible toxic effects and recommended
monitoring patients' liver conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, the suit says, the labeling was changed again to
say that ``cases of liver failure leading to death and liver
transplants had been reported, and that injury occurred after both
short-term and long-term use of Rezulin.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's lawyers, at Littlepage &AMP; Associates of Houston, said the
company deliberately withheld important information needed by
doctors and their patients.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Ford, a spokesman for Warner-Lambert, said he could not
comment on the specifics of the Monica George lawsuit. But in
regard to claims of adverse reactions, he said the company had
``adequately warned about the risks associated with the product,''
and he said that it intended ``to vigorously defend any lawsuits.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Shirley Griggs, 66, of Smithville, Mo., the adverse reaction
was severe. She said that after she was put on Rezulin, she gained
43 pounds, but that her doctors failed initially to detect liver
damage. By the time she was taken off the drug, she said, she was
in constant pain and her liver was crippled. She is now on a
transplant list but ``thousands are ahead of me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, there is little doubt that the drug helped some.
Frank Hopkins, who raises racehorses in Darlington, Md., said that
when his blood-sugar levels became high and his doctors could not
bring it down, they referred him to Dr. Christopher D. Saudek, head
of the diabetes center and professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Saudek, he said, put him on Rezulin in 1998, which brought the
blood sugar down, but he also checked blood samples and liver
function monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said he was upset that the drug was being withdrawn. ``I
think the number of people who have received a negative reaction is
so minimal, so why should the rest of us have to suffer?'' he said.
But he said he was relieved to learn that similar but less risky
drugs had become available.
</P>
<P>
   Saudek said that in general the insulin sensitizers were an
``exciting new class of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Beaser, at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, and
others said that patients were rightfully angry and confused but
that it was important not to allow that to erode confidence in the
drug-approval process. ``I am concerned about the process and so
are my patients. If it was legitimate, fine, but we need
reassurance,'' he said. ``And if it was not, there needs to be an
investigation to find out why and restore confidence in the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Whitty, 54, a first-grade teacher from Walpole, Mass., has
not lost confidence. ``Three years ago, I was giving myself insulin
injections, once in the morning, once at night,'' she said. ``This
is not really such an easy thing.'' Dr. James Rosenzweig at the
Joslin clinic put her on Rezulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within just a few months,'' she said, ``I was able to come off
the shots completely.''
</P>
<P>
   For Whitty, Rezulin's removal was not a problem. She simply
switched to the more recently introduced Actos, the same type of
drug as the one she said had changed her life. ``I can't tell you
how grateful I am,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: As a matter of policy, we do not hire
employees who used to work here. Right now, we are looking at an
individual who worked here a few years ago, and then quit. He was a
good employee and we were sorry to lose him, but I'm not convinced
it's a good idea to rehire employees. What do you think? C.T.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It is a good policy to periodically review your policies
to make sure they are doing what they are supposed to do. If the
policy regarding former employees is supposed to help the company
hire the best applicants, it may be falling short.
</P>
<P>
   There are some managers who fervently believe that if an
employee quit working at their company in the past, he or she will
do so again. Of course, these managers will then go on and gladly
hire someone else who has most likely quit his or her last job, or
was fired from it.
</P>
<P>
   Former employees should be screened in the same way as other
applicants. One advantage is that since they are known commodities,
some of the guesswork in the hiring and placement process is
removed. In addition, former employees who are rehired typically
feel extra positive about the company, as they have seen what
things are like at the competition. And further, as other employees
hear what the re-hired employees have to say, they may be less
likely to consider leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Good employees are hard to find, no matter where they used to
work. When looking at former employees, it makes more sense to
check them out rather than screen them out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our supervisor is a nasty and critical person, the manager
over her is just as bad, and they both are especially mean to me. I
am friendly with my fellow employees, and they have all noticed
that I am picked on and blamed more than anyone else. I don't know
what to do. N.D.
</P>
<P>
   A: On the management scale, this less-than-dynamic duo is
definitely in the featherweight category. Much of management today
is based on respect, trust, fairness and support, but your
so-called leaders seem to believe that it is based on little more
than abuse.
</P>
<P>
   This type of treatment does not go away by itself, and if you
let it continue, it will most likely become worse. For whatever
reason, these ``leaders'' sense that you are an easy target.
</P>
<P>
   This means that your first step is to meet with each of them.
Make sure that they know about your successes on the job, along
with your job objectives. Then tell them that you are concerned
about the working relationship, and you would like to see it
improve. Give them specific examples of the behaviors that are
particularly distressing, and then clearly state that you want this
type of treatment to stop. Your next step will depend on their next
step.
</P>
<P>
   If they continue their target practice, you and your fellow
employees should consider meeting with them as a group, and if you
do not find satisfaction, all of you should go up the organization.
If the problems continue to generate stress, then you need to
decide whether fight or flight is right for you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are getting a new boss in two weeks. I am wondering if
there are any tips that can help me make a better first impression
on him. L.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: If there is one tip that may help you make a positive
impression on your new manager, it is for you to listen carefully
to what he says, observe how he operates, and try to respond in
kind. For example, if you observe that he is detail minded,
cautious and careful, your behaviors should reflect the same
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   If this new manager senses your thoroughness, he is likely to
perceive a commonality between the two of you, and his first
impression of you may be more favorable. The key word here,
however, is ``first.'' In very short order, the quality and
quantity of your work will be the key factors that determine his
real impression of you.
</P>
<P>
   It is a myth to think that first impressions are lasting, as
they only endure until additional data are gathered over time.
Think back about people you have met who initially impressed or
even overwhelmed you, but whom you now regard as underwhelming. The
opposite occurs too, as you probably have examples of people who
were rather unimpressive at first, but who actually turned out to
have far more on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on your new manager's objectives, standards and style
can help build a positive first impression, but focusing on your
performance and productivity can help build a positive lasting
impression.

RULING A BLOW TO LaROUCHE 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday struck a blow to fringe
presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche, upholding a lower court
ruling that the Democratic Party legally refused to count votes
cast for him during the 1996 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   LaRouche said the party violated the federal Voting Rights Act
by discounting electoral support he received in Arizona, Louisiana,
Texas and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The voting rights law requires these states, due to a history of
discriminating against minority voters, to get approval from the
Justice Department or a federal judge before they change their
methods of tabulating votes. LaRouche argued that the states
ignored that requirement in allowing the Democratic Party to void
votes cast for him.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., dismissed
LaRouche's claim. The court said the Voting Rights Act does not
apply to political parties, which have a constitutional right of
association to exclude undesirables from their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, who considered the appeal directly from the
district court, issued no opinion in upholding the decision but
simply issued a one-line statement saying they affirmed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   LaRouche has run unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential
nomination in every election year since 1976, including while he
was serving five years in prison for mail fraud and conspiracy
during the early 1990s.

 ARE TONSILS NECESSARY?

 (FOR RELEASE MON., APRIL 3, 2000) 
 (EXCERPTED FROM MEN'S HEALTH) 
 By the Editors of Men's Health 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: When I was a kid I had my tonsils removed. Didn't I
need them for something? _ J,D., Waukegan, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: They're your first line of defense against germs, but
you can get by without them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonsils are made of lymphoid tissue and exist to fight
infection,'' says Dr. Ralph Wetmore, associate professor of
otolaryngology at the University of Pennsylvania school of medicine
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But in battling bacteria the tonsils can become infected,
swollen and irritated, and that can make you even sicker than the
germs can. In the past, infected tonsils were often removed. Today,
antibiotics are the treatment of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Being tonsil-free isn't a big deal, Wetmore says. The back of
your throat has lymph nodes that perform the same function as the
tonsils.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My face turns beet-red after I drink half a glass of
alcohol. I'm Asian, and I've noticed that this happens in other
Asian men. What causes this, and is there anything I can do about
it? _ D.C., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: See your general practitioner or a dermatologist before
you start looking like W.C. Fields. It sounds as if you may have
rosacea, a chronic skin condition that occurs in Asians but is more
prevalent in people of northern European or Celtic descent, says
Dr. Sherwin K. Parikh, a dermatologist at New York-Presbyterian
Medical Center. People with rosacea experience flushing in response
to sun, hot water, alcohol or eating spicy foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol is a common trigger, so is exercise,'' Parikh says.
``But I don't recommend giving them up completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Facial flushing is caused by dilated blood vessels, and the
extra blood at the skin's surface causes the reddish hue. If your
doctor diagnoses rosacea, he may prescribe topical creams
containing sulfur or cortisone or oral antibiotics to help keep the
skin calm and under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can also ease rosacea by knowing your triggers, rinsing
your face with cool water after exercise and using sunscreen,''
Parikh says.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a machinist and am on my feet for 10 hours a day,
five days a week. At the end of the day my feet, ankles and knees
are killing me. How can I stop them from hurting? _ A.A.,
McKeesport, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: Make the ground you're standing on a little softer. Put
in a request for a contoured mat, says Justin Wernick, professor
and chairman of orthopedic sciences at New York College of
Podiatric Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be much easier on your feet than standing on a hard
concrete floor,'' Wernick says.
</P>
<P>
   Next, you probably need to change what's on your feet. Buy a
pair of shoes specifically designed for industrial use _ not
sneakers, no matter how comfortable they feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletic shoes are designed for movement, not long periods of
standing, so they compress quickly and wear out fast,'' Wernick
says. ``Red Wing, Coleman and Drew are three companies that make
good industrial footwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Your shoes should be leather with a firm heel cup and a flexible
crepe or Vibram sole that bends with your foot. You're better off
if you buy ankle-high shoes, which provide more support than
lower-cut ones. You might also want to line your shoes with a
contoured insole. They're available at drugstores. &QL;

 (EXCERPTED FROM PREVENTION) 
 (Includes electronic art.) 
 By MARGO TROTT 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the birth of her third child seven years ago, Perri
Newell, 44, of Huntington Beach, Calif., was looking for a fun way
to get back into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a team activity, not something solo where your
only goal is fitness,'' Newell says.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper article about a local women's soccer league and her
daughter's participation in the sport sparked her interest. It
wasn't long before she caught soccer fever.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Newell's love of the game did more than just keep her
fit. It also helped her cope with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept focusing on looking forward to playing again, and my
teammates were very supportive,'' she says. Today, Newell is back
on the soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   Newell is not a lone star. Since the U.S. women's victory in the
1999 World Cup, the number of adult women's, men's and coed leagues
is increasing, with first-time players _ many in their 30s, 40s and
50s _ coming out to get exercise, learn a new sport and socialize.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY FUN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not only a soccer mom, but a soccer-playing mom,'' says
Sue Emerson, 44, of West Friendship, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 12-year-old son coaches me and watches me play. He thinks
it's great that I'm out on the field, and it gives us something in
common to talk about, especially as he gets older.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many women of her generation, soccer wasn't an option when
Chris Curran, 42, of Cincinnati, was growing up. But while coaching
her daughter's soccer team, Curran was drafted by other parents to
play. Being part of a team has made exercising easier _ and more
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a social aspect connected to exercise, you're
more likely to show up,'' Curran says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO EXPERIENCE? NO PROBLEM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a superstar to play,'' Newell says.
</P>
<P>
   The team works together, so novices get support from experienced
players. There are teams for all levels of ability _ from
recreational teams for beginners to more competitive, premier teams
for the experienced. In recreational leagues, no one expects you to
be Pele, so don't fret if you can't bounce the ball off your head
or juggle it from knee to knee.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on running and kicking. Let your legs do most of the work.
Soccer requires some stamina, so if you're looking to get back in
shape safely, start by being a substitute player, going in for a
few minutes here and there. This gradually improves your endurance
and helps the team by letting others take a break.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to volunteer to coach or referee. You'll learn
the game, get some exercise and have fun working with the kids.
Most leagues are happy to have new volunteers, and they'll gladly
train you.

 MEDICINAL TEAS: WHAT WORKS, WHAT DOESN'T

 (EXCERPTED FROM PREVENTION) 
 (Includes electronic art.) 
 By VARRO E. TYLER, Ph.D., Sc.D. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last fall, I was doing some pharmacy window-shopping in Germany
and was struck by the amazing assortment of herbal teas on display.
It was a reminder that teas are a very effective way to prepare
many herbs. But medicinal teas aren't nearly as popular in America
as they are in other countries. Most of the herbal teas sold here
are simply flavorful combinations of unspecified composition.
</P>
<P>
   The term herbalists use for teas is infusions. Like your morning
cup, infusions are prepared by adding boiling water to plant
material, usually leaves or flowers, and without applying
additional heat, allowing the preparation to steep while the brew
cools slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Teas are not to be confused with herbs boiled in water. Those
are called decoctions. Many herbs, especially tough woody barks or
roots, are best prepared this way. Practically all traditional
Chinese medicines are made by boiling a mixture of 10 to 12
different herbs in water, then cooling, straining and drinking the
mixture. Another morning cup _ boiled coffee _ is a common example
of a decoction.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GREAT HERB, NOT-GREAT TEA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Teas, or infusions, are best used for herbs whose ingredients
are water soluble or where precise dosage is relatively
unimportant. Teas are also useful for herbs that don't require high
concentrations of active principles in order to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Ginkgo, for example, shouldn't be made as a tea because its
active constituents _ flavonoid glycosides and terpenoids _ must be
concentrated about 50 times to obtain a useful dose. Even
extra-long steeping may not increase the concentration. Also, its
active principles are not very water soluble. They need to be taken
in uniform doses for maximum benefit. Finally, ginkgo leaves
contain poison-ivy-like constituents known as ginkgolic acids that
could cause allergies unless removed during processing.
</P>
<P>
   Other herbs that don't work effectively as teas include
echinacea, milk thistle and saw palmetto. These herbs, and others
with similar chemistry, are best extracted in alcohol, not water.
An alcohol extraction is called a tincture. It's made by steeping
the herbs in alcohol instead of water.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAKING MEDICINAL TEAS THAT WORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Volatile oils, which give certain herbs their distinctive aroma,
are not particularly soluble in water, but many plants containing
them can be made into effective teas when properly prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Much of chamomile's effectiveness in soothing an upset stomach
is due to its volatile oil content, but useful flavonoids and
coumarins are also present. To prepare the best chamomile tea, the
dried flower heads must be relatively fresh and highly aromatic.
</P>
<P>
   Buy the whole flower heads, making sure that they are relatively
free of useless stems or leaves. Crush them a bit between your
fingers, place 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls in a tea strainer, add a cup of
boiling water and steep in a covered vessel for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting beverage will contain enough of the various
ingredients, including the volatile oil, to be truly effective. It
will also taste delicious.
</P>
<P>
   Other volatile oil-rich herbs are prepared in a similar fashion.
Some examples include fennel, anise, ginger and peppermint for
digestion and lemon balm for sleep.
</P>
<P>
   A word of caution is in order concerning peppermint. There is a
tendency in the popular literature these days to use the word mint
in a very general way. For this reason, peppermint (Mentha x
piperita) is often confused with spearmint (Mentha spicata). This
may create a problem because peppermint, with its menthol and
derivatives, is an effective digestive aid whereas spearmint, which
contains mainly carvone, is not.
</P>
<P>
   Some herbs can be quite effective when taken as teas but for
various reasons are best used in other forms. Valerian tea can be
an effective sleep aid, but it can make your entire kitchen smell
like dirty socks. Use valerian in its tincture or solid extract
form to stem the stench.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GETTING YOUR WATER TOO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Teas made from goldenrod or juniper, which promote healthy
kidney function (aquaresis), have the added advantage of also
making you drink more water, which may be highly desirable in such
cases. The same is true of rose hips, licorice, slippery elm,
capsicum or mullein teas taken to alleviate some of the symptoms of
colds and coughs. The added moisture helps relieve the dryness
often associated with respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ginseng has long been used as a tea. The active principles
(ginsenosides) are water soluble. The recommended dose range is so
broad (1 to 2 grams) that the variation which occurs in the
preparation of the tea is relatively unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   Another beneficial tea is tea itself (Camellia sinensis),
especially the green variety. A single cup of green tea contains
300 to 400 milligrams of healthy polyphenolic antioxidants.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the culinary herb tea mixtures sold in the United States
are flavor enhanced with volatile oils or other aromatic
ingredients that make a tastier drink but don't add healing
benefit. I strongly recommend preparing medicinal teas from
carefully selected, freshly dried whole herbs rather than from
tea-bag mixtures.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to drink a caffeine-free herbal tea simply for its
taste, scrutinize the label carefully. Some herbs, such as cinnamon
or cloves, are so overpowering in taste that any tea containing
even small quantities of either will taste like cinnamon or cloves.
Any other ingredients might as well be absent as far as flavor is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   These tips will allow you to use many herbs both safely and
effectively as teas. Remember, though, that most of the active
principles that make herbs useful as health-maintaining or
therapeutic teas are much less stable when they are dissolved in
water than in their dried form.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to take your herb in the form of a tea, it will be
most effective if it's prepared prior to consumption. Old, stale
products not only taste bad, they are also much less effective.

 (EXCERPTED FROM PREVENTION) 
 By the EDITORS OF PREVENTION 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; COSMETIC ACUPUNCTURE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can you smooth wrinkles with Chinese therapy? As a healing
technique, acupuncture boasts an impressive track record.
</P>
<P>
   By inserting tiny needles into various areas of the body,
practitioners of this Chinese therapy have shown the value of
acupuncture in relieving pain, easing nausea and lowering blood
pressure. Now, acupuncturists say that their services can also
erase signs of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic acupuncture works in a variety of ways, says licensed
acupuncturist and traditional-Chinese-medicine practitioner Phyllis
Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Inserting a needle into the skin causes oxygenated,
nutrient-rich blood to rush to that spot. This promotes circulation
and healing. Second, facial muscles relax during the treatment,
Olson says, which lessens the appearance of wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncturists believe that the body's energy, or chi, takes
certain pathways. By using needles to access points on those
pathways, an acupuncturist can move the energy where it's needed to
speed healing or eliminate damage.
</P>
<P>
   While there's no scientific evidence to back up these claims,
cosmetic acupuncture may have some benefits, says Dr. Barney Kenet,
a dermatologic surgeon at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to the sun, contraction of facial muscles is the major
cause of wrinkling. That's why we get smile lines and
crow's-feet,'' Kenet says. ``If acupuncture relaxes the muscles, it
might reduce wrinkling temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the increased blood flow, at most it will probably give
you a temporary rosy complexion _ something you don't want if you
have an inflammatory condition such as acne or rosacea. Otherwise,
cosmetic acupuncture is relatively harmless.
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in trying it, keep expectations in check
and enjoy the experience. Aside from the momentary stings,
acupuncture is really quite relaxing, Olson says.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment _ depending on the amount of wrinkles _ consists
of about 20 to 25 superfine needles being inserted into the face,
ear or hand. The price runs from $60 to $100 per session.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of results can you expect? Improvement after the first
treatment can last about a week. After 10 weekly sessions, the
body's energy will begin moving into these areas on its own.
Monthly treatments can maintain the results, Olson says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A GENTLER AND MORE ACCURATE HEART TEST &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a study of patients recovering from a first heart attack,
myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) plus a drug that increases blood
flow to the heart predicted future heart attacks better than the
standard exercise-stress test. The technique can be performed 48
hours after a heart attack, compared with a five-to-seven-day
waiting period for the stress test.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's danger of a second cardiac event, this can enable
physicians to make lifesaving treatment decisions earlier,'' says
Dr. Kenneth A. Brown, author of the study and director of the
nuclear-cardiology and cardiac-stress laboratories at the
University of Vermont in Burlington, where the study was conducted.
MPI is available at most large and medium-size hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOSE DROPS EASE MIGRAINE PAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lidocaine nose drops, available by prescription, may offer the
fastest relief from a migraine headache. In a study at the Southern
California Permanente Medical Group in Woodland Hills, researchers
found that the medication eased pain within 15 minutes for 36
percent of patients, compared to 7 percent of those given a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   A follow-up study found that the treatment brought relief within
30 minutes to more than half of the migraine sufferers who tried
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best candidates for lidocaine are those who have
occasional migraines,'' says Dr. Morris Maizels, lead study author
and a family-practice doctor at Permanente. If you experience
symptoms before the migraine itself, Maizels advises, ``a quick
lidocaine treatment may prevent the pain from setting in at all.'' &QL;

   GORE-REACT (Washington) _ Assessing the reaction among political
donors and fund-raisers to Vice President Al Gore's latest campaign
finance proposal. Gore on Monday proposed the elimination of the
unlimited donations known as soft money and creation of a $7
billion endowment to finance all general election campaigns for
Congress, using tax-deductible contributions from the corporations,
unions and individuals that now underwrite most political
campaigns. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN-MUSEUM-SUIT (New York) _ The city and the Brooklyn
Museum settle a dispute arising from the Sensations exhibit. The
city agrees to back off, in accordance with a temporary restraining
order obtained by the museum, and make the capital repairs it had
hinted it might not be kindly disposed toward. Each side pays its
own legal fees. By Alan Feuer.
</P>
<P>
   NJ-SENATE-CAMPAIGN (Trenton, N.J.) _ Running against motherhood
or apple pie you could understand. But running against the boom?
With much of New Jersey awash in prosperity it seems like an odd
strategy. But in New Jersey's U.S. Senate contest, unlike any major
political race in the country, unusual circumstances have
transformed the Democratic primary into a race that has put the
economic boom on trial. Jon Corzine, the former co-chairman of
Goldman Sachs, has said that his work on Wall Street helped New
Jersey companies create and retain hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Those arguments have prompted his opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio,
to warn voters that a dark cloud has been obscured by the economic
silver lining. On issues ranging from Social Security and pension
funding to corporate mergers, trade policy and government
borrowing, Florio has hammered his opponent with the kind of
class-based attacks Democrats usually aim at Republicans. By David
Kocieniewski.
</P>
<P>
   NY-FOSTER-CARE (New York) _ Thousands of young adults in New
York City's foster care system, many of whom were neglected or
abandoned during the height of the city's crack epidemic a decade
ago, have been ``aging out'' of the system in recent years, left at
age 18 to fend for themselves, often with little in the way of
education or financial resources. By Somini Sengupta.

</P>
<P>
   DISABLED-FARMERS (Ackley, Iowa) _ Rising before dawn for Sunday
chores, Darwin Hoffmeister fed the pigs, checked the cows and
mended a trampled fence. But he could not tie his shoes.
Hoffmeister, a 50-year-old Iowa farmer, lost four fingers and the
use of his left arm in a combine accident five years ago, the kind
of dreadful mishap that makes farming one of the nation's most
dangerous professions. He is one of thousands of farmers in America
with disabilities who have triumphed over physical adversities, a
survival made possible by technological advances and the changed
nature of farming, which today relies more on brain power and
computer skills than mere brute strength. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT23,24.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ Pope John Paul II flew away, and
this is how the morning after looked in Israel: diminished
prospects for peace with Syria, the opening of a politically
explosive criminal investigation into a leading rabbi, and five
separate Parliament votes of no confidence in the government. By
Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   (MOVED)
</P>
<P>
   GUYANA-HAMMOCK-WEAVERS (Lethem, Guyana) _ This village in the
remote southern savannah could easily be taken for one of those
far-flung places untouched by the digital revolution. It had no
phones until two years ago, and the concept of paying with money is
still quite foreign to many residents. But it was here that an
organization formed by indigenous women of two tribes revived the
ancient art of hand-weaving large hammocks from locally grown
cotton _ and then took their exquisite wares online. They hired a
young member to create a Web site. And last year, they sold 17
hammocks to people around the world for as much as $1,000 apiece,
gigantic sums in these parts. But the foray into electronic
commerce created tension between the weavers and the traditional
regional leadership. Threatened by the women's success, regional
leaders moved in and took control of the weavers' organization. The
woman who created the Web site quit in a fury, and the group has
been struggling since then to get by. By Simon Romero.

   Menopause occurs when a woman's ovaries run out of eggs, marking
the end of her reproductive years. The average age for menopause in
the United States is 51.
</P>
<P>
   But when you speak of menopause, you're probably referring to
the symptoms that you've heard about. Those, including hot flashes,
can begin as soon as the early 30s or as late as the mid-50s. They
often begin during perimenopause _ the sometimes lengthy period
right before menopause _ and continue through the postmenopausal
period.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW LONG DOES IT LAST? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The entire menopausal phase can last from one to 10 years,
depending on family history and lifestyle factors.
</P>
<P>
   Women who smoke, for example, may have an earlier menopause that
lasts longer with more pronounced symptoms, Walsh says. That's
because smoking lowers the body's level of estrogen, the sex
hormone that plays a key role in regulating the menstrual cycle.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, women who are overweight tend to have fewer
symptoms. Fat tissues help convert other hormones into estrogen for
a protective effect. As a result, estrogen levels typically don't
fall as low.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that you should encourage your partner to bulk
up. Women who are overweight and have high estrogen levels are at
increased risk of developing uterine cancer and breast cancer,
Walsh says. Also, being overweight increases her risk for heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Some lucky women, for unknown reasons, go through menopause
without any symptoms. And most women, fortunately, are bothered
very little by symptoms. In one survey of 750 women, the majority _
who were already menopausal or experiencing symptoms _ felt either
neutral or positive about menopause.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT'S WITH THOSE HOT FLASHES? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those red-in-the-face, sweaty moments are the most common
menopausal symptom. Up to 80 percent of menopausal women will
experience these sudden surges of body heat that are caused by a
drop in estrogen levels.
</P>
<P>
   During a hot flash, the woman's inner thermostat _ the part of
the brain that regulates body temperature _ becomes unstable and
thinks that the body is too hot. To cool down, blood vessels dilate
and send a rush of blood to the surface of the skin, typically on
the face, neck and upper body. As a result, the woman's skin
becomes very hot and appears red. She may sweat and even feel an
uncomfortable prickly sensation. The entire episode lasts anywhere
from five to 15 minutes, although discomfort may linger.
</P>
<P>
   Hot flashes can strike without warning at any time of the day or
night. When hot flashes happen at night, they may awaken your
partner from sleep. She may find herself drenched in sweat.
</P>
<P>
   These nocturnal firestorms can cause insomnia, fatigue and a
range of related symptoms such as irritability, anxiety, poor
concentration and forgetfulness.
</P>
<P>
   While you may feel helpless when your partner starts to flush,
there is something you can do. Act as her hot flash coach and help
her breathe through them, suggests Diane Wetzig, Ph.D., chief of
psychology for University Hospitals Health System/Laurelwood in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHY DOES SHE BITE MY HEAD OFF? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You'd be cranky too if you suffered from hot flashes, night
sweats and sleep deprivation. Add to that some fluctuating hormones
and the stress of this midlife transition time, and you've got a
perfect setting for a blowup _ or meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep disruption is the most profound thing that happens with
menopause,'' says Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, clinical professor at Yale
University School of Medicine and co-author of ``What Every Woman
Needs to Know about Menopause'' (Yale University Press, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone isn't sleeping well, she may be a bit short at
times. Guys need to understand that. They need to be supportive
and, if necessary, encourage her to get help from a health-care
provider,'' Minkin says.
</P>
<P>
   For some women, reaching menopause may serve as an unavoidable
reminder that they're getting older, Wetzig says. They may worry
about things such as wrinkles, weight gain and graying hair. They
may feel less attractive, leading to feelings of insecurity and
anxiety. For some women, just knowing that menopause is approaching
can be distressing because it marks the beginning of a new and
unknown era.
</P>
<P>
   But you can help by making it a point to reaffirm your partner's
attractiveness and worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell her that you value the one-of-a-kind, marvelous woman
that she is and that you look forward to growing old together,''
Wetzig says.
</P>
<P>
   When your partner gets cranky, try to keep your own spirits
high. Although bad moods can be contagious, it's far more
productive _ and harmonious _ to find out what you can do to help
ease her irritability and work through it together. But wait until
emotions subside before opening talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your partner is no longer irritable, you need to say,
'Let's problem-solve. How can I help you?' You need to act, rather
than react, to her irritable or anxious moods,'' Wetzig advises.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IS HER DEPRESSION PART OF MENOPAUSE? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The idea that menopause inevitably causes depression is largely
a myth, says Sheryl Kingsberg, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and
assistant professor in the department of reproductive biology at
Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a small group of women who experience mood
changes because they're very sensitive to hormonal changes _
similar to those who experience postpartum depression or
premenstrual syndrome,'' Kingsberg says. ``But this is not common,
and I wouldn't always chalk up depression to menopause alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Figure that any depression is serious and may need professional
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``A partner is often the first to recognize the signs of
depression and can encourage the woman to get treatment,''
Kingsberg says. ``Don't try to comfort her by saying, 'It's OK.
You're just experiencing that change.' That's not a just. Clinical
depression is real and needs to be treated.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When playing Lee, one drapes himself over the
refrigerator doors; the other practically dives in. One jabs away
at the typewriter keys in a struggle to start writing; the other
simply stares at the blank page. One wears 1940s dress shoes and an
overgrown beard; the other, 1970s leather boots and tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   As Austin, they spray the plants differently, sponge the counter
differently, unravel differently.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly take turns playing the
lead roles in Sam Shepard's ``True West,'' which opened on Broadway
to rave reviews on March 9, and that naturally invites comparisons.
But critics seem to agree that neither casting configuration is
better than the other.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the play in The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote:
``If you've followed Hoffman's and Reilly's work on film, you
probably have your own ideas of who was meant for which part.
Forget it. Whichever way you've sliced it, you're right.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience seems to agree; people leap to their feet at the
end of each performance, and the production has broken the record
for weekly gross sales at Circle in the Square Theater, with a
total of $243,063 for the week ending March 19. (The previous
record holder was Eugene O'Neill's ``Hughie,'' which had a
best-grossing week of $234,410 in August 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   In exploring the volatile relationship of these brothers who
practically kill each other over a screenplay, the actors said they
focused less on trying to be different than on working as partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found moments together,'' said Hoffman, 32. ``But we
created them by ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, 34, added: ``It's not like each one of you are playing
both parts. You are sharing the work of the play. We're this team,
and we have this common goal to make this thing sail.''
</P>
<P>
   Both actors described Lee, a gruff but searching outlaw, and his
brother Austin, a placid but simmering screenwriter, as two sides
of the same man, and said they saw each man as a side of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of this exercise is to explore the fact that these
characters can inhabit two different bodies and still be the same
person,'' Hoffman said. ``The play is about one person. The play is
about the battle of two parts of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, one cannot help wondering to what degree Hoffman
and Reilly learned from each other in developing their
performances, imitated each other or consciously chose different
methods of smashing the typewriter or drenching themselves with
beer.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews separately and together in the green room of
Circle in the Square, both actors used the word ``osmosis'' in
describing how they incorporated each other's work into their own
performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things that were troubling you, you see the other guy take a
different tack on it,'' said Reilly. ``It makes it seem possible:
he found a way, so there's got to be a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the intense interdependence the play demands, both
actors said, it was important to trust each other and to be
generous about sharing ideas. ``You couldn't be precious about what
was mine,'' Hoffman said. ``Even though we're going to interpret
everything differently, we're both responsible for the same part.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that the two men were already friends, having worked
together on Paul Thomas Anderson's films ``Magnolia,'' ``Boogie
Nights'' and ``Hard Eight.'' Reilly brought Hoffman into the stage
project. When Reilly met with the play's director, Matthew Warchus,
last fall, he asked for suggestions about who might play the other
brother. ``The first name out of my mouth was Phil,'' Reilly said.
(Warchus said he also had Hoffman in mind.)
</P>
<P>
   In interviewing actors for the play, the director said, he asked
them to suggest possible partners because he felt a foundation of
mutual respect was essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very territorial thing to create a role as an actor;
it's quite private, and you're quite vulnerable when you're doing
it,'' Warchus said by telephone from London. ``And if you are being
asked to share that territory with another actor, it can be a real
strain. If there is any kind of competitiveness, it can get very
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hoffman nor Reilly initially liked Warchus' idea that
they alternate roles; they switch every third performance. But they
said the director made a compelling argument along the lines of, as
Warchus put it, exploring ``two opposing characters who mutate into
versions of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Warchus also said that alternating roles was a literal way to
celebrate the play's changes from night to night and to show that
there are different ways of telling the same story.
</P>
<P>
   Once on board, the actors said, they worried about how hard the
work would be, whether it would be confusing, how they would
memorize both sets of lines, which amounts to memorizing an entire
play, since the brothers almost never leave the stage. (Robert
LuPone and Celia Weston play the two supporting roles.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We had four and a half weeks to put up two shows,'' Hoffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Warchus said there had been a point in rehearsals that he
characterized as a crisis. ``The actors were finding it difficult
to learn the lines,'' he recalled. ``They said: `I can't do this. I
have half of Lee in me and half of Austin. I don't know who I
am.'''
</P>
<P>
   But while the work has been grueling, the actors said, changing
roles actually turned out to be a luxury. Both said it was a relief
to move from one character to another, particularly since each part
had different vocal and physical demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I was able to do much more extreme things than I
could if I were playing one character,'' Reilly said. ``I'm willing
to completely lose my mind as Austin or go completely bonkers as
Lee, knowing I don't have to play that guy all week.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly added that switching roles was a welcome exercise in
empathy and had enriched the acting experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're doing a play, I think everybody starts to think
about the other characters and wonders, `What would it be like to
walk in this person's shoes?''' he said. ``It seemed natural to me
because I knew both these guys were in me. Almost exactly what
happened to Austin happened to me. And in terms of Lee, there but
for the grace of God go I.''

 NEW YORK: God go I.''   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of six children in an Irish family, Reilly grew up in
Chicago and started appearing in plays when he was 8. His father
worked in the industrial linen business, and his mother looked
after the children and worked in a cafeteria. He attended the
Goodman School of Drama at DePaul University and quickly landed a
bit part in Brian DePalma's movie ``Casualties of War.'' DePalma
liked his performance so much, he made the part bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, who lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Alison Dickey, a
film producer, and their child, has been acting steadily ever
since. (He recently finished filming ``A Perfect Storm.'') He said
``True West'' had meant the most to him so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does feel like my whole life's work was to get where I am
right now, to be doing a play on Broadway by Sam Shepard,'' he
said. ``Sam Shepard: to me that is America. Everything he says in
his plays about family, how he manages his life and fame, he's a
real hero to me. He and Tom Waits are probably it in terms of
heroes to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Hoffman, even with all the success he has had lately
in films like ``The Talented Ripley,'' put ``True West'' in another
category. ``This means more,'' he said. ``The film stuff is great.
I did OK with all of them. But in the end you want to be part of
something that is the event itself, something that's bigger than
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``If done well, it's hopefully one of the experiences people
will remember from the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of defining theatrical experience _ seeing
``All My Sons'' when he was in the seventh grade _ that made
Hoffman want to become an actor. ``It blew me away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Rochester, N.Y. His father, now retired and
pursuing a degree in social work, worked for Xerox. His mother, a
lawyer, would take him to the Geva Theater. ``I just loved it from
the get-go,'' Hoffman said. ``I thought it was the most amazing
thing in the world. How could people go through that in front of
me?''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to attend the Tisch School of the Arts at New York
University and began working off off-Broadway. As a Manhattan
resident and co-artistic director of the Labyrinth Theater Company,
an off-Broadway group, Hoffman said, he never planned to become
part of Hollywood. ``I saw acting in films as something different,
not about me,'' he said. ``It didn't seem as real to me.''
</P>
<P>
   His first big break, at 24, was the movie ``Scent of a Woman.''
And although he has now done more films than plays, Hoffman said he
had made a point of returning to theater once or twice a year.
``The give and take, the communal quality of people coming
together,'' he said, ``you can't go to the 14-plex and have that
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for ``True West,'' the two actors said, they drew
on relationships with their own brothers. (Reilly has three,
Hoffman one.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't take a lot of research,'' Reilly said. ``The
interchange between these two guys I've been through on both
ends.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly also said the play resonated for him in terms of his
relationship with his father, and that Warchus made a place for
this kind of personal excavation. ``How much we talked in
rehearsals about our families, it was really extraordinary,''
Reilly said. ``We were so open.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors said they had also discussed the characters in depth
and agreed that up to a certain age Lee and Austin were probably
very much alike. They further determined that no matter how high
the resentment rises between them during the play, there is always
love there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath, there is a real affection for each other,'' Reilly
said. ``You can't outrun your blood.''

 &HT;    Crescendos of hype raise expectations for markets
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There have always been losers and winners in the stock
market. But never before has Wall Street raised expectations so
high, and never before have the media been cheerleaders and
stock-pushers, Business Week (April 3) reports.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasts from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange have
propelled once-obscure financial journalists to celebrity status
and has made CNBC to investors what ESPN is to sports fans, the
magazine notes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, says Professor Bing Liang of Case Western Reserve
University, is that when ``experts'' recommend a stock in the
media, the resulting abnormal returns and trading volumes are
driven by ``noise trading from naive investors.'' On average,
investors following these recommendations lose 3.8 percent over six
months.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as the bull market roars forward, Business Week says
the press releases will spew forth, the brokerage ads will offer
images of easy money, the business-TV pundits will pontificate _
and the public, with its growing propensity for short-term trading,
``will continue to lap it up.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report (April 3) engages in a bit of what
Business Week was talking about with an article on ``market
mania,'' which offers ``some help'' to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine suggests a set of ``new tools'' that investors can
use in their decision-making, replacing the ``old tools'' of the
old market. For example, the magazine says the price-to-earnings
ratio, used to value share price against profitability, can be
replaced by a ``business model'' that looks at such items as
advertising as a percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   FEMALE-FRIENDLY PROFESSION
</P>
<P>
   TV journalism may be hype to Business Week, but Working Woman
(April) sees it as an avenue of success for women. It profiles
Willow Bay of CNN's ``Moneyline'' as an example.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of years ago, she was co-hosting a Saturday
basketball program on NBC. ``Now, the former model and wife of
Disney bigwig Bob Iger is making her market as the highest-profile
financial reporter on CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasting is not the only outlet for women, says the
magazine, citing 10 women who run multimillion-dollar Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   A FORD IN FORD'S FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   William Clay ``Bill'' Ford Jr. is a fourth-generation descendant
of Henry Ford. But when he decided to claim the job of chairman at
Ford Motor Co., he had to battle Chief Executive Alex Trotman, says
Fortune (April 10). The big question, the magazine asks, is can the
younger Ford ``jump-start this Old World auto company and keep
employees, customers and investors happy?''
</P>
<P>
   OLD-FASHIONED STILL WORKS
</P>
<P>
   In today's dot-com world, it's easy to assume that new ideas
only come from young kids working in basements. Not necessarily,
says Inc. (May), which profiles profitable brick-and-mortar
companies that are also winners in the online world.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LES MAQUIGNONS, France _ Almost 40 years ago, as if summoned by
the ghosts of successive generations of American writers who made
their names in Paris, an aspiring young poet called Gustaf Sobin
left Boston for the French capital, seemingly persuaded that being
an expatriate was a key to literary success. Certainly it was a
form of exile that had worked for two of his favorite writers,
Ernest Hemingway and Ezra Pound, fixtures of the Left Bank scene
between the wars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no sooner had he arrived in Paris in 1962 than his plans
were disrupted by a chance meeting with Rene Char, a French poet
whom he much admired. ``If you love my poetry,'' Char told him,
``you must visit Provence, because my poetry comes out of the
earth, the land, the light.'' Sobin traveled to the south and fell
under its spell. The next year he bought an abandoned stone
building on the edge of a Provencal village and made it his home,
forever.
</P>
<P>
   In Provence, he had found a sense of place that had eluded him
during his upbringing in New England. And now, able to survive on
$2,000 per year, the income from a trust fund, he was in no hurry
for success. He continued to write poetry, as he had from the age
of 20, but it went unpublished until 1972, when he was 37. In 1988,
by now respected as a poet, he turned his hand to prose, but his
first two novels, ``Venus Blue'' and ``Dark Mirrors,'' went largely
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his third novel, ``The Fly-Truffler,'' published in
January, wider recognition has suddenly come his way. And he is a
bit taken aback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I didn't write novels for the attention,'' the
64-year-old writer said shyly, sipping apple juice in his home,
which was enlarged over the years to accommodate his wife,
Susannah, a painter, and their two now-grown children, ``but it is
certainly a pleasure to receive.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for a man who opted for a rural life of isolation and
reflection, attention in some distant city remains all too abstract
a concept. More real is the repetitive rhythm of his daily life in
the unchanging landscape of Vaucluse, 20 miles east of Avignon.
</P>
<P>
   At dawn, as peasants head for their fields, he goes to work in a
tiny studio on a nearby ridge. And from its window, he looks across
a vineyard, above the tiled roofs of Les Maquignons and over a
sprawling valley toward towering Mount Ventoux. His muse _ this
land and its lore _ is all around him.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, since he moved here 37 years ago, Provence has changed.
Centuries-old farms and cottages have been taken over by northern
Europeans, whose very invasion was symbolized and stimulated by
Peter Mayle's huge 1990 best seller, ``A Year in Provence.''
</P>
<P>
   And the ancient Provencal language, once routinely heard in
village cafes, is now spoken only by old peasants and a handful of
intellectuals. ``The Fly-Truffler'' does not turn back the clock,
but it is Sobin's poignant hymn to a vanishing Provence.
</P>
<P>
   Its central character, Philippe Cabassac, a loner nearing 50,
lectures at the University of Avignon on the Provencal language,
itself an exercise in linguistic archaeology and conservation.
There he meets Julieta, a beautiful student half his age who is
writing her dissertation on silkworms, another lost feature of
Provencal life.
</P>
<P>
   Julieta moves in with Cabassac, at first seemingly for
convenience, then sharing his bed and soon, pregnant, exploding
with passion. But she loses her child, slowly disconnects from life
and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Sobin's 155-page novel actually tells the story differently,
more as a flashback relived by Cabassac through dreams provoked by
eating truffles. The truffle season is short, at most December to
February, and it is then that Cabassac wanders his property looking
obsessively for the golden flies that identify truffles growing 1
or 2 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual is important. He keeps the dark tubers for three
days, and then dices them into ``perfect little rounds'' that he
adds to three beaten eggs. After eating the omelet he retires to
bed and picks up his previous night's dream of Julieta. He is happy
only when in this truffle-induced reverie, and his ordinary life
falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing what he called Sobin's ``marvelous, mesmerizing new
novel'' in The New York Times last month, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt
wrote: ``It is one of those rare, haunting novels that you consume
in a single sitting and that you put down wondering what day it is
and where you are, as if awakening from one of Cabassac's
enrapturing dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobin said he set out to write a book that he, as its first
reader, would find persuasive. ``One has to fall almost into a
hypnosis, the hallucination one has created,'' he said. ``And if
one doesn't, no one else will.''
</P>
<P>
   Having plotted out his book, however, he still had a problem.
How could truffles induce dreams? ``You can't put that one over, I
thought, it's impossible,'' he recalled. ``And I asked a young
peasant friend, by consuming the truffle, could one have a
beautiful dream? He said something so delicate: He said no, but it
could put you in the disposition to have a beautiful dream. This
word, `disposition,' was the click. I knew I had my novel.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a novel in which Cabassac's excavation in search of
truffles aptly symbolizes Sobin's own relationship with Provence.
The writer laments the popularization of Mayle's ``superficial
glitzy vision of Provence'' and tries to counter it by digging ever
deeper to find, like Cabassac, a form of redemption. ```The
Fly-Truffler' isn't about a year in Provence,'' he said. ``It's
about an eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   This eternity is all too present in another book that Sobin has
recently published, ``Luminous Debris: Reflecting on Vestige in
Provence and Languedoc,'' which comprises 26 essays inspired by
remnants of earlier life in the region, from prehistory through
Roman times.
</P>
<P>
   It is a life extant outside his very home: He looks out over a
vineyard where a Roman villa once stood, and in an adjacent
dry-stone structure that resembles a beehive he once found a stone
altar to the Celtic god of wind.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, wind and light are Provencal eternals that have
also influenced what Sobin likes to call his ``poetry of
celebration of desire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistral, which rushes down the tunnel of the Rhone Valley,
is a dry, sterile male wind, harrowing, exhausting, exhilarating,''
he said. ``Then, we have the marinade that comes out of the south,
wet and warm and richly fertilizing for the earth. These winds are
pure opposites, yet there is this wonderful coexistence between
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Light, too, is a defining spirit here, drawing generations of
painters to its illuminated colors. ``Some people even consider it
divine, this beautiful diffused luminosity, without any mist,
uninterrupted by tall trees,'' the writer said, recalling his
excitement many years ago at the thought that Picasso could be
painting in the same light. ``You're really under the eye of God or
whomever. It can be quite cosmic, quite metaphysical, quite
overwhelming.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Again, then, there is the sense of place. ``All my poetry starts
with the physical presence of being here,'' he said. ``And
curiously, the more rooted it is in place, the more it rises out of
place, that is, the more anchored in specifics, the more I can rise
to a higher level.'' Indeed, when he turned to prose, his
sustenance remained Provence, even though ``Venus Blue'' and his
next novel, ``For Her Lashes Alone,'' are not set there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Provence is continuously nourishing for work, reflection,
thought,'' he said. ``I'm here and there is enough here for the
poetry and prose and essay writing for 10 lifetimes. I don't need
to move except for wonderful field trips into the mountains or down
to the sea. But I find that everything is here, at least within the
breadth of my imagination and the limits of my intellect, enough
for 10 lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But what makes it all possible is the instrument of language, in
his case the conciseness of poetry that gives intense sensuality to
his prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``As so, choosing one word over another,'' he writes of Julieta
in ``The Fly-Truffler,'' ``hesitating here, precipitating there,
editing her own speech a bit everywhere, she offered Cabassac a
portrait of herself _ of her wayward existence _ in which the
words, seemingly, had far more consistency than the events
themselves.'' In the end, then, for Sobin too, it is the words that
count.

 &HT;    Bass Hotels targeting Latin America
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts is expanding its family of
midmarket hotels in Latin America and plans to double its presence
in the region within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Arasi, president of Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts, the Americas,
said the global lodging giant plans to increase the number of
Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, Staybridge Suites and Crowne
Plaza hotels. The upscale Inter-Continental brand, which Bass
acquired in 1998, already has a significant presence there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take that existing operating base and use it to
grow through the other price segments,'' Arasi said. Latin America
``is a market that has a lot of international and domestic demand.
This is a market of growing importance for us.''
</P>
<P>
   London-based Bass maintains headquarters for its Americas
operations in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Scott D. Berman, a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers in Miami
and an expert in the lodging industry, said the Latin American
market is ``screaming for an affordable choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America presents a tremendous opportunity for midmarket
hotel brands because so few exist today,'' Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Arasi said Bass is targeting major markets in countries such as
Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Ecuador. The company plans five new
Holiday Inns each in Brazil and Argentina during the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil will be the site of a Staybridge Suites by Holiday Inn,
an extended stay hotel. Staybridge will open a 356-suite, 18-story
hotel in mid-2002. A 100-suite Staybridge Suites is to open in
Brasilia as part of a project that will also house an
Inter-Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Bass is primarily interested in managing and franchising brands
in Latin America, with no company-owned hotels planned.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bass signed a deal with a major Mexican
hotel company to triple the number of Crowne Plaza hotels in that
country over the next decade.

<P>
   LETHEM, Guyana _ This village in the remote southern savannas,
little more than an airstrip and scattered mud huts, could easily
be taken for one of those far-flung places untouched by the digital
revolution. It had no phones until two years ago, and the concept
of paying with money is still quite foreign to many residents.
</P>
<P>
   But it was in this community of 2,000 people that an
organization formed by indigenous women of two tribes revived the
ancient art of hand-weaving large hammocks from locally grown
cotton _ and then took their exquisite wares online. They hired a
young member to create a Web site. And last year, they sold 17
hammocks to people around the world for as much as $1,000 apiece,
gigantic sums in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps too gigantic. The foray into electronic commerce created
tension between the weavers and the traditional regional leadership
in the same way, perhaps, that many a geeky start-up has sent
shivers down the spines of corporate titans. Threatened by the
women's success, regional leaders moved in and took control of the
weavers' organization. The woman who created the Web site quit in a
fury, and the group has been struggling since then to get by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the classic tale of old power reacting to new power,''
said Terry Roopnaraine, an expert on the indigenous population here
who teaches at Cambridge University. ``When you bring in the
Internet and start to empower people, that doesn't maintain the
status quo. So the status quo quite rationally reacts to defend its
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Guyana, the lone English-speaking country in South America,
illustrates the effects of decades of economic isolation. Rickety
Land Rovers dating from before 1966, when the country gained
independence from Britain, vie for space on unpaved roads with old
British-built army trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The indigenous peoples here are known as Amerindians, to
distinguish them from the majority population, descendants of
indentured servants from India. The Amerindians rely heavily on
help from international aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A worker with one group, Matthew Squire of Britain's Voluntary
Service Overseas, was instrumental a decade ago in reviving hammock
making by Amerindian women of the Rupununi, as this region is
called.
</P>
<P>
   Using 19th-century accounts and illustrations of the hammocks
made by European travelers, Squire and several women reintroduced
the process, from cultivating the cotton on small family plots to
weaving the brown-and-white hammocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something that was untainted by the rest of the world
that was still alive in memory,'' said Squire, who now lives in
Sussex, England.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, the weavers, 300 women from the Wapishana and
Macushi tribes known as the Rupununi Weavers Society, had sold a
hammock to the British Museum in London. The museum called it ``one
of the most perfect forms of indigenous art we have purchased this
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were obstacles in transforming the hammock
production into a modern venture. The Rupununi is linked to the
capital, Georgetown, by an unpaved road that can take days to
traverse. The small airstrip here makes flights possible, but
costly.
</P>
<P>
   And because the concept of money was foreign, the weavers'
society had to devise how to compensate members with alternatives.
One preferred currency is salt, used to preserve meat.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, as the weavers tried to sell their hammocks to
museums and collectors by mailings through an unreliable postal
service, Guyana Telephone and Telegraph installed telephone lines
here using an innovative satellite system.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, the chief executive of the company, Bill
Humphries, an American, offered the weavers society two telephone
lines, free Internet access and $12,000 worth of equipment,
including a desktop computer and a scanner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a marvelous opportunity to get good publicity and free
advertising,'' said Humphries, now an executive with a
telecommunications company in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Someone was needed to coordinate maintaining a Web site capable
of marketing the hammocks. The phone company paid for Sharla
Hernandez, a promising young member of the group and a protegee of
Squire, to go to Georgetown to learn about the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After Hernandez returned here with knowledge of the Web, the
enterprise took off. Since mid-1998, the society has sold 20
hammocks over the Internet. Although their prices seem high here,
they are not much considering that an estimated 600 hours of work
goes into each hammock.
</P>
<P>
   For the powers of Lethem, though, Hernandez and the weavers were
perhaps too successful, bringing attention and potentially
substantial income to people who under the existing leaders have
known only poverty and powerlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became a huge threat,'' Hernandez, 21, with a fashionable
haircut and the colorful clothing of an American college student,
said in an interview. Accelerating a push to gain power over the
organization, a push that began even before telephones and the
Internet arrived, establishment figures like Muacir Baretto made a
successful effort to take control of the weavers' society.
</P>
<P>
   Baretto, 47, is the Rupununi district chairman, an elected post
similar to a state governor in the United States, and a former
``touchau,'' or chief, of his village near Lethem.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken Amerindian, he rides a Chinese-built motorcycle
around town. Like other members of the country's political class,
he received part of his education in Moscow when Guyana had
Communist leanings after gaining independence.
</P>
<P>
   Baretto said in an interview that one lesson he brought back
from Moscow was ``that the socialist economic model was not
viable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also learned that strong leadership was necessary for
any organization to function properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Using his influence, Baretto persuaded the weavers' society to
elect him chairman, although the group began as a nongovernmental
entity with support from international aid organizations intent on
keeping such operations separate from government.
</P>
<P>
   He has since stepped down as chairman. But from behind the
scenes, Baretto remains the most influential management figure.

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The struggle for power has not just been between the women who
provide the labor for the enterprise and the region's men. Shirley
Melville, owner of a general store that doubles as the main
watering hole and money-lending operation here, is a crucial member
of the governing body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to make sure our culture is not damaged,'' said
Melville, 40, an Arawak Amerindian from another part of Guyana who
has married into one of the dynastic cattle-ranching families of
the Rupununi.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said she felt she was being marginalized and resigned
from the organization in February.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I was made to cry by these people, especially once when
Shirley told me, `You are a twinky little thing and I am a tiger,
so you watch out, girl,''' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since her resignation, the weavers' society has had just one
inquiry about buying a hammock over its Web site,
www.gol.net.gy/rweavers.
</P>
<P>
   For people used to a bitter economic existence, the turn of
events is perhaps no surprise. ``We women do most of the work and
the men get rewarded, so what is the difference here?'' a weaver,
Violet Eusebio, asked.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Clement, another member of the organization who grows
cotton and works as a weaver, said of Baretto: ``He's a one-quarter
leader providing one-quarter results. The Internet, the phones,
they've brought attention to the society that is being used for
self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baretto sees it differently. ``Regardless of what has
happened and been said,'' he said, ``we have the best interests of
the society's members at heart.''

LABELING GM FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This page supports the genetic modification of crops as a
service to mankind and believes that most of the protest against it
is unscientific and wrong. However, for an industry rightfully
confident of the safety of its products, biotech companies are
surprisingly resistant to requirements that foods carry labels
identifying genetic modification. The industry's fear that a
gene-modified label will become a symbolic ``skull and crossbones''
and hurt sales only reflects the challenge facing the industry to
better educate consumers. The answer to consumer ignorance is not
more ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   As safe as every test examined by the Food and Drug
Administration, the Department of Agriculture, and the
Environmental Protection Agency has shown these foods to be, the
public has a right to know what goes into its corn flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being more up-front about the fact that a third of
all US-grown corn and about 55 percent of all soybeans are already
gene-modified, the industry has treated this change as a slight
adjustment in fertilization schedules. It isn't _ it's a revolution
in the way crops are developed.
</P>
<P>
   Used primarily until now to give crops built-in protection
against pests or weed-killers, the technology offers the promise of
substantially increasing the nutritional value of foodstuffs.
Already, there is talk of ``golden rice'' bolstered with
beta-carotene to combat Vitamin A decifiency, a major problem in
many developing countries. Ultimately, a genetically modified tag
on a grocery item is likely to be a selling point, just as the
label ``pasteurized'' on milk has long been.
</P>
<P>
   Many European countries already require the labels. The industry
has fiercely resisted labeling in this country, but it shouldn't.
By not acknowledging the role of bioengineering in modern
agriculture and arguing for its merits in public forums, the
industry runs the risk of a backlash by a public that thinks it has
been hoodwinked.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late for industry to adopt a full disclosure
policy, both on labels of GM products and to the public of what
this ultimately beneficial change in food production is all about.

   WASHINGTON _ A former top Clinton administration official will
appear before a congressional panel Tuesday to answer allegations
that Medicare improperly forgave more than $200 million owed by
three of the nation's biggest health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vladeck, who headed the Health Care Financing
Administration from 1993 to 1997, was expected to challenge the
findings of an eight-month investigation that he pressured his
staff to negotiate the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The three deals, settling $332 million in debts to Medicare,
were so lenient that they were kept secret, partly so they would
not become precedents for other health care providers, said a
report by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said the debt settlements were never reviewed by
government lawyers. In fact, one official working under Vladeck
told the GAO that he avoided consulting attorneys because he feared
the ``deals would go up in smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Monday that ``the evidence
suggests that HCFA staff short-circuited the routine process
because of pressure applied by'' Vladeck.
</P>
<P>
   Collins chairs the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
which will question the major players in the controversy Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report said the HCFA agreements may have violated the
Federal Claims Collection Act, which requires most debt settlement
plans over $100,000 to be cleared by the Justice Department.
Moreover, the investigation faulted Vladeck for having an
appearance of a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck had previous ties with two of the health care groups
involved. Before joining the Clinton administration, he served on
the board of directors of the New York City Health and Hospitals
Corp. The corporation negotiated its $155 million debt for improper
past billings down to just $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   He also had sat on an advisory committee for the Visiting Nurse
Service of New York, which won an agreement to repay $67 million of
the $98 million it owed Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In the third settlement, HCFA accepted $28 million as repayment
for $79.4 million in debts owed by the Department of Health
Services in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   The debts dated as far back as 1991. Under Medicare procedures,
reimbursements are reviewed, and Medicare seeks repayment for
services that are found to be improper or undocumented. The three
cases represented some of the largest owed Medicare during the past
decade. All were settled during Vladeck's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Anello, an attorney who was helping Vladeck prepare for
his testimony Tuesday, said Monday that the former official
``endeavored to convey the message, inside the agency and out, that
the primary responsibility of HCFA was to ensure that its
beneficiaries had access to high-quality health care when they
needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlements at issue, which he did not negotiate, did just
that. They ensured continued and uninterrupted health care to
millions of this countries' poorest citizens and among some of its
sickest.''
</P>
<P>
   HCFA, responding to the investigation, has said that it has
begun its own review of the debt settlement issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident there has been no violation of the Federal
Claims Collection Act,'' said HCFA spokesman Chris Peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said the agency has hired a certified public
accountant to oversee debt collection and has developed ``a number
of new checks and balances,'' he said.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Gore gives campaign finance reform plan a
twist
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Gore acknowledged Monday he was an ``imperfect messenger''
for campaign finance changes as he offered new proposals _ a
``Democracy Endowment'' and strict disclosure rules _ to attract
John McCain supporters and inoculate himself against George W.
Bush's repeated attacks on Gore's past fund-raising abuses. Gore
announced his plan at a campaign appearance in Milwaukee:
Elimination of soft money and the creation of a $7 billion national
endowment to provide public financing of federal political
campaigns, beginning in 2008. ``The real wounds will be to our
democracy itself unless we address this problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM PARTY GIVEN OVER TO CHOATE
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party chairmanship belongs to Pat Choate, Ross
Perot's 1996 presidential running mate. That's what a federal judge
decided Monday in a tug-of-war that had weakened the party's
standing in the 2000 campaign. U.S. District Judge Norman Moon in
Lynchburg, Va., ordered Jack Gargan, who had fought Choate for the
chairmanship, and Treasurer Ronn Young to stop all activities
relating to their previous positions, including soliciting
donations on behalf of the Reform Party, spending the party's
money, operating an official Web site and planning the party's
convention. ``This will now allow us to go forth and mount a
competitive race for the White House this fall,'' Choate said.
</P>
<P>
   ROBB IN FOR ANOTHER TOUGH FIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Charles Robb, whose 1994 race in Virginia
against Iran-Contra figure Oliver North was one of that year's most
bitterly contested, kicked off his campaign for a third term
against another former governor of the state. George Allen has
built a sizable lead in fund-raising and started his campaign
months ago, but Robb warned him that he faces a tough fight for the
only statewide elected office that Republicans do not control.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK ACTIVIST QUITS GOP
</P>
<P>
   A black Republican activist who had been vice chairman of a
high-profile GOP effort to recruit minorities says she has left the
party because a ``pattern of racial blunders'' left her feeling
abandoned. Faye Anderson quit the GOP, according to Gannett News
Service, with no explanation in a terse March 13 letter to Patricia
Harrison, co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Anderson
had been vice chairman of the New Majority Council, which the GOP
established in 1997 to reach out to minorities. But in her weekly
column for politicallyblack.com, Anderson said she switched from
registered Republican to independent because she no longer believes
that party leaders were serious about inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   NOT THE RIGHT KIND OF GAYS?
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, according to ABCNews.com, are
``disappointed by reports'' that George W. Bush has decided not to
meet with the organization and are ready to take their case to the
public. Said Log Cabin spokesman Kevin Ivers: ``It appears from the
latest comments that we are not the right kind of gays, and that we
were McCain supporters _ both of which seem to disqualify us from
even consideration of being part of this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ONLY THE CENSUS BUREAU WILL COUNT HIM
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Democratic Party
lawfully refused to count votes cast for political extremist Lyndon
LaRouche in the 1996 presidential primaries. The court, upholding
lower court rulings, rejected LaRouche's argument that the
Democratic Party's rules should have been cleared by the Justice
Department under the federal Voting Rights Act. Monday's ruling was
issued without an accompanying opinion. The justices merely
affirmed what a federal appeals court had previously ruled.
</P>
<P>
   KEEP A CLOSER EYE ON THE MONEY, GUYS
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission says the Reform Party needs to
keep the government better informed of where the organization's
millions of taxpayer dollars are kept. Nearly $2.5 million in
public money that was given to the third party for its nominating
convention was not stored in the Martinsville, Va., bank that party
officers had named in their funding application. Instead, according
to the FEC, the money was spread among at least four bank accounts
from Virginia to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING THE REFORM NAME IN VAIN
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party of New Hampshire announced it will sue Pat
Buchanan's presidential campaign for $10 million, alleging wrongful
use of its name in a recent mailing to the group's members. John
Talbott, the group's acting state chairman, said he also will seek
federal mail fraud charges against Buchanan Reform, the name of
Buchanan's national campaign. Talbott said a pamphlet mailed by
Buchanan's campaign promoted an April 1 meeting in Manchester as
the Reform Party's state convention. He said the Buchanan campaign
does not have the authority to use the party's name or elect state
delegates for the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   SHARP(TON) KNIVES COME OUT
</P>
<P>
   If Rudy Giuliani's handlers could have their way, his opponent
in this year's New York Senate race would not be Hillary Rodham
Clinton, but Hillary Sharpton Clinton. Giuliani's aides are doing
everything they can to create the perception that she and Al
Sharpton are siblings in spirit, if not in blood. In campaign
fliers and in public comments, the mayor and his advisers have
stopped just short of portraying the activist minister from Harlem
as a person who advises an attentive Clinton in ways that would set
the republic on the path to perdition. They have begun to respond
to any criticism of the mayor's actions by throwing out one name:
Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   TURNING THE TABLES ON CARPETBAGGING
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani is planning three fund-raising events in
Tennessee, and state Democratic leaders say he is ``carpetbagging''
for money. Giuliani has three such events set for April 5 in
Knoxville, Nashville and Memphis. The Tennessee trip ``is a bit of
carpetbagging'' to raise money, a term often applied to Hillary
Rodham Clinton's Senate bid in New York, said Greg Wanderman, head
of the Tennessee Democratic Party. ``I don't know that Rudy has
ever stepped foot in Tennessee except to raise a dime,'' Wanderman
said.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY WELCOMES SMALL PARTY'S SUPPORT
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton picked up the first political party
endorsement of the campaign. ``I consider this the beginning of a
partnership,'' Clinton told the convention of the Working Families
Party, a small, labor union-backed third party. She promised to be
``a voice and a vote'' in the Senate for working families. The
Working Families Party was created in New York two years ago to
push the Democratic Party toward the left, and to help Charles
Schumer against Republican incumbent Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. Schumer
won that race.
</P>
<P>
   GOP'S FIRST BABY BOOMER
</P>
<P>
   Youthfulness and a generational shift represent a changing of
the guard for the Republican Party. George W. Bush, whose birthday
is July 6, will be 54 years old when he wins the his party's
presidential nomination in August, as expected. That will make him
the GOP's youngest presidential nominee in 40 years. It also will
make him the first Republican nominee in more than 30 years who is
almost the same age as his Democratic rival _ Al Gore will be 53 at
the Democratic National Convention _ and the first who was born too
late to have had any involvement in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   IMPORTANCE OF STAYING ON FOCUS
</P>
<P>
   Extensive polling and campaign analysis by the Annenberg Public
Policy Center pointed to the value of intensive primary campaigns
to voters and the worth of hammering home what a candidate would do
if elected. If the primary season appeared to hurt George W. Bush
and help Al Gore, the study suggests that Bush's intense fight to
win the Republican nomination, consistent tax-cutting message and
critical focus on Al Gore could pay dividends, said Kathleen Hall
Jamieson, a lead researcher at the Annenberg center at the
University of Pennsylvania.

THE CASE FOR CAUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the brave new world of accelerated drug approvals by the US
Food and Drug Administration, the case of the diabetes medicine
Rezulin is a cautionary tale. Introduced in 1997 as a way to lower
blood sugar by making the body more sensitive to its own insulin,
Rezulin was pulled off the market last week after its use was
linked to 90 cases of liver failure and 63 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, this would seem to be an indictment of the
process that approved the drug after tests in 2,500 patients. In 2
to 4 percent of patients, there were liver abnormalities, but no
cases of actual liver failure. It was only when Rezulin began to be
prescribed in great quantities _ 1.9 million people have used it _
that its full risks became known.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is really more in the failure of regulators to
require close liver monitoring from the first use of Rezulin. While
doctors from the start were advised not to prescribe it for
patients with liver problems, it was only after the first cases of
liver failure were reported that the FDA actually recommended liver
monitoring. Eventually, the FDA required monthly tests.
</P>
<P>
   For some diabetics Rezulin is so effective that the FDA might
not have withdrawn it were there not two promising and apparently
safer replacements available. What the Rezulin case best
demonstrates is that, since many drugs have serious side effects,
their introduction into the market must be accompanied by more
stringent precautions, such as close screening of patients
receiving the new drug and frequent monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the lesson in the decision last week by another
pharmaceutical manufacturer to withdraw a drug for severe
heartburn, Propulsid, from the market this summer. Propulsid has
been associated with 80 deaths and 341 heart-rhythm abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for regulators, drug makers, physicians, and
patients is to balance the severity of the condition the drug
treats with the frequency and gravity of side effects and the
availability of alternatives. And always they must err on the side
of caution in requiring close screening and monitoring.

TILTING TOWARD INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's visit to the Indian subcontinent, the first
by an American president in a generation, accomplished little in
the short run but reflects a historic, long-range shift in US
national interests.
</P>
<P>
   The president failed to get either the Indians or the Pakistanis
to give up their atomic weapons or to ameliorate their quarrel over
Kashmir. Nevertheless, the proportionality of the five days in
India and the five hours in Pakistan signified the shift in
American priorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades following the birth of independent India there
had been a certain antagonism between the United States and India.
Indians found Americans overbearing and obsessed with Cold War
politics. Americans found Indians insufferably sanctimonious. India
may have been ``the world's bigget democracy,'' or so went the
cliche, but India's adherence to socialism went down badly in
Washington, and India's close friendship with the Soviet Union was
worse. Indians could never understand why the United States was so
interested in China and so uninterested in cultivating their
country.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did the United States pick up Pakistan, India's archrival,
with whom India would fight three wars, as an American client. The
Pakistanis weren't particularly democratic, but they were a
straightforward Cold War ally. When India went to war with Pakistan
over Bangladesh, then-President Nixon ordered a ``tilt'' toward
Pakistan. When it came time to organize a resistance to the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan, Pakistan and the United States again
worked closely together.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now. Pakistan is no longer needed
in the Cold War struggle, and its undemocratic, near-dysfunctional
state has become an embarrassment. India, on the other hand, with
its great size, its democratic institutions, and, perhaps more
important, its new industrial strength in computer sciences, is
beginning to loom large in Washington and in board rooms across
America.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Indians and the Pakistanis understood the message
behind Clinton's visit, even though he did not articulate it
directly, proving the old adage that nations don't have friends,
only interests.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ A long line of limousines waited to send their
passengers onto a red carpet bathed in television lights and
leading to a black canvas tent sprawling across Canon Drive in
Beverly Hills, closed to traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, red rose arrangements decorated the tables, waiters
passed through the black-tie throng with trays of Champagne and
pink-hued cosmopolitans, Hollywood's hot cocktail of the moment. In
the adjacent Spago restaurant, to which the tent connected,
hundreds more mingled and munched and applauded the arrival of
Oscar winners clutching their lustrous trophies like power totems.
</P>
<P>
   And on the outside of the tent, every few feet, the same word
was emblazoned over and over: DreamWorks ... DreamWorks ...
DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after this mini-studio was founded by Steven
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen and only three years
after it began releasing movies, DreamWorks SKG had at last risen
to the top of the pecking order, for one night, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The studio's ``American Beauty,'' a relatively low-budget ($15
million) comedy about dysfunctional suburbanites, was the big
winner at Sunday night's Academy Awards, taking honors for best
picture (to its producers, Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen), best actor
(Kevin Spacey), best director (the first-time filmmaker Sam
Mendes), best original screenplay (Alan Ball, also a first-timer)
and best cinematography (Conrad L. Hall, who last won an Oscar, his
first, for ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid'').
</P>
<P>
   It was sweet vindication for the studio, which last year saw its
heavily favored ``Saving Private Ryan'' lose the best-picture Oscar
to Miramax's ``Shakespeare in Love,'' although Spielberg won the
award for best director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a compliment to be considered to be in rivalry
with Miramax, which has been around doing great work for quite a
while,'' said Walter Parks, head of the motion picture division at
DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than a few eyebrows raised in October 1994 when
the three principals announced they were forming Hollywood's newest
movie studio. The skepticism increased when several years passed
before the first film (``The Peacemaker'') was released by the
studio, when plans to build a new studio complex near Los Angeles
International Airport were shelved and when Spielberg, the studio's
most notable filmmaking asset, went on a two-year hiatus from
directing.
</P>
<P>
   But DreamWorks officials contend that the awards are a sign of
the fledgling studio's growing strength and the sense that it is
finally coming together.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that the wins for `American Beauty' does,''
said Parks, ``is it continues a shift in focus in the company away
from being just about our three very visible founders onto where we
all think it was always meant to be: on all of our filmmakers and
the movies they make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the simplest level,'' he said, ``I hope the fact that a
traditional Hollywood studio would not only make a movie like
`American Beauty' but would know how to market it aggressively and
would act as a magnet for a certain kind of filmmaker we'd love to
work with the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the ``American Beauty'' Oscar triumph mean that DreamWorks
has at last turned the corner and begun to jell? Its executives say
yes, pointing to a new film lineup that includes Russell Crowe in
Ridley Scott's ``Gladiator,'' Will Smith and Matt Damon in Robert
Redford's ``Legend of Bagger Vance'' and ``Chicken Run,'' the first
animated feature by Nick Park, the three-time Oscar-winning
short-film director of the ``Wallace and Gromit'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only dark cloud for DreamWorks on Sunday night came
when Annette Bening, nine months pregnant and sitting in the Shrine
Auditorium here after watching her husband, Warren Beatty, win the
academy's Irving G. Thalberg Award, lost the best-actress Oscar to
25-year-old Hilary Swank.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, it announced the potential arrival of a major new
star. The relatively little-known Swank not only won the award for
playing a young woman who pretends to be a man in ``Boys Don't
Cry,'' but she also did it in a relatively small, independent film
and beat out one of Hollywood's most popular actresses.
</P>
<P>
   With ``American Beauty'' going into the awards as such an early
favorite, much of the inevitable Dreamworks-versus-Miramax
controversy was muted. So Oscar had to look elsewhere for its
dustups.
</P>
<P>
   Many were wondering whether Spacey's victory over Denzel
Washington, the early Oscar favorite for his critically praised
performance in Norman Jewison's ``Hurricane,'' had resulted partly
from the uproar over the accuracy of the film, based on the life of
the boxer Hurricane Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest post-Oscar fuss seemed to be swirling around the
documentary award. For years, there were complaints from
documentary filmmakers that the voting process was skewed to favor
academy insiders and often resulted in awards to films few had
seen. In recent years, the rule was changed to allow all academy
members to vote in the category, but only if they had seen all five
nominated films.
</P>
<P>
   This year's contenders included two films, ``Buena Vista Social
Club'' and ``On the Ropes,'' that were widely released in theaters.
But the winner, ``One Day in September,'' about the murder of
Jewish athletes at the 1972 Olympics, was screened for academy
members in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco and once in
Boston but not widely released.
</P>
<P>
   So producers of the other films were saying Tuesday that despite
the rule changes the system could still be exploited by an insider
_ it was the third victory for the filmmaker Arthur Cohn _ by
greatly reducing the voting pool. ``Because voters have to see all
five films, the film which is seen by the fewest number of people
thereby has as much of a chance as `Buena Vista Social Club,' which
grossed millions of dollars,'' said Wendy Lidell, a vice president
of WinStar Cinema, the distributor of ``On the Ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Academy Award for documentary feature is going to help
documentaries succeed in the theatrical marketplace, which is very
difficult, then re-examining what constitutes a theatrical release
is perhaps what needs to be done,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Lidell said, ``It always seems to be the film that
nobody's heard of that wins.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday Cohn said that the complaints were
``sour grapes.'' He said he had released it as soon as he was able
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   All of the ``American Beauty'' winners took pains to thank
DreamWorks for, as Parks said, making the dark little comedy and
then marketing it into a $100-million-plus hit and orchestrating an
ambitious and ultimately successful Oscar campaign for it. Mendes
said he was grateful to DreamWorks for giving a first-time film
director whose background was on the British stage a chance to
direct a comedy about American suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have done this movie for free, and I practically
did,'' he said, gesturing toward Spielberg. ``He owes me a couple
of quid, you know?''

&HT;     ROBERT STRAUSS, ETERNALLY YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Living legends in the nation's capital are rare.
The rich and powerful tend to burn out early or give up on the
political wars, and sometimes they go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   But one man has outdistanced practically everyone, friend and
foe alike. Superlawyer Robert Strauss is the ultimate insider, an
influential adviser to both Republican and Democratic presidents.
He is a wheeler-dealer of the old school who is as much an
institution hereabouts as the Senate's wonderful bean soup.
</P>
<P>
   Now a vigorous 81 years old, Strauss proved again in a speech
last weekend before a gathering of big-name journalists that he has
lost neither his fabled sense of humor nor his remarkable political
savvy. He first spoke at the Gridiron Club dinner 25 years ago. He
was then Democratic National Committee chairman and he gave his
party's response to a speech by Republican Vice President Nelson
Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss outclassed Rockefeller that night in 1975, and on
Saturday he also triumphed over his newest partisan competitor at
the podium, former Republican National Committee Chairman Haley
Barbour. Strauss uses humor to make his points, but he knows the
difference between mockery and malice.
</P>
<P>
   Barbour, now a high-priced influence peddler like Strauss,
doesn't have that knack. His jokes had more bile than bite.
Strauss, however, concluded his remarks by noting, ``Civility does
not have to be something that only old men like me recollect.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss, a Texan and protigi of former Gov. John Connally, rose
in the Democratic ranks the hard way. He earned his fame through
loyalty to his conservative mentors and a skillful mix of politics
and business interests. For years he labored behind the scenes as
an obscure fund-raiser and back-slapper.
</P>
<P>
   He took over the Democratic Party after George McGovern's
disastrous left-wing presidential campaign in 1972 left the party
in ruins. Strauss shoved the leadership back toward centrist common
sense. But he has always had friends and allies across party lines,
as any good mover-and-shaker must. Bob Dole is a buddy, as is
former President George Bush, a fellow Texan who appointed Strauss
ambassador to the old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss ran Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign and became
Carter's special trade representative and Middle East envoy.
Between government jobs, he returns to the law firm he helped to
found, one of the most powerful in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss was not born to great wealth, but he has it now. He has
not neglected his own bank account in his love for politics.
Self-sacrifice is not included in his business code. He is
successful at what he does, which is mostly a corporate law
practice that puts the right people together with other right
people. Nothing wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once joked that ``he makes his living giving people
advice on how to undo the advice he gave someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all his closeness to power and money, Strauss has
maintained a reputation for keeping his own hands clean.
Politicians of both parties trust his word. Media types, at least
those of us of the older generation, think he's by far the best of
his breed.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss is famous for getting money out of heavy Democratic
givers, which the Gridiron Club duly noted last weekend in a song
dedicated to the fine art of fleecing the rich. Vernon Jordan, his
latest protigi and President Clinton's golfing chum, is a law firm
partner and Strauss's potential successor as premier Democratic
deal-maker.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Strauss jovially noted that he and Jordan were
recently discussing politics. ``I asked him, `Who in the hell
coined that phrase `Clinton fatigue?' Jordan said, `Mrs.
Clinton.'''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss' jokes were carefully bipartisan. ``George W. thought
that Fettuccine Alfredo was the president of Italy,'' he said. But
he also ribbed Vice President Al Gore's tendency to exaggerate.``I
had no idea he saved John McCain's life in that prison camp!''
</P>
<P>
   So how does Strauss do it? How does he keep going at the top of
his game decade after decade?
</P>
<P>
   Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   Lace everything with a dollop of humor, some of it
self-deprecating, some of it of a put-down nature, which targeted
recipients take in jolly spirit. Do everything with warm
enthusiasm, making companions feel truly wanted and your presence
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your word. Keep your mouth shut about the embarrassing
stuff. Stick to your friends when they are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Be practical. Forget the ideological traps and deal with the
real world.
</P>
<P>
   Like everybody and they will like you. Make the right friends.
</P>
<P>
   Don't cheat. Play it straight, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   And never be a shrinking violet. A little chutzpah goes a long
way.
</P>
<P>
   I think Bob Strauss is great, but don't ask me to explain why.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For inexplicable reasons, in a recent column I promoted Rep.
John Edward Porter, R-Ill., to chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee. He is chairman of the Appropriations Committee's labor,
health, human services and education subcommittee.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Microsoft Corp. and the U.S. Justice
Department continued negotiations Monday on a possible settlement
to the government's landmark anti-trust lawsuit, but government
officials expressed skepticism that a deal could be made before
Tuesday's expected ruling in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, U.S. officials rejected a last-minute proposal
by the software giant, saying it didn't meet enough of the
government's demands.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson warned both
sides last week that he would issue his ruling Tuesday unless he
saw progress on the settlement talks, giving rise to speculation
that he might postpone the Tuesday deadline as long as both sides
were still negotiating. The judge's ruling would be on the question
of whether Microsoft's business practices were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision by Jackson to postpone his ruling would be
influenced by the views of Judge Richard Posner, chief judge of the
7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, who has been mediating the
case since last November when Jackson asked him to help both sides
reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft nor representatives of the Justice Department
and the 19 states that brought the suit in 1998 had any official
comment on where things stood Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If he issues his ruling, Jackson is expected to deal harshly
with the Redmond, Wash.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, Jackson issued his ``findings of fact'' that said
Microsoft had used its monopoly power to stifle innovation, reduce
competition and hurt consumers by bundling its Internet Explorer
browser with its Windows operating system. A computer's operating
system is the core program that allows other programs, such as word
processing applications, to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Because Windows runs 95 percent of all computers, Jackson said,
Microsoft's bundling, or tying together, of its operating system
and its browser means that browser competitors _ such as Netscape _
would be at a severe disadvantage when it comes to selling their
own browsers. This led to less competition and less innovation,
which hurt consumers, he said. Microsoft contends that the browser,
which allows users access to the World Wide Web, is not a separate
product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The November findings represent Jackson's conclusions about
which side presented the most compelling and believable case during
the year-long hearing that opened in his court on Oct. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will use those findings to determine whether Microsoft's
actions actually broke the law. But since Jackson's finding of
facts were against the company, many antitrust experts say they
expected he will conclude that Microsoft's actions added up to
violations of antitrust law. Assuming Jackson's ruling goes against
Microsoft, the case would then move to its final phase: the penalty
stage. During the penalty stage, Jackson would determine what to do
to Microsoft to ensure the company doesn't break anti-trust law
again.
</P>
<P>
   The most drastic remedy being considered is breaking up the
company into separate parts to end its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's latest proposal to settle the case reportedly would
allow manufacturers of computers or software to modify the Windows
source code to attach rival products, such as Internet browsers, to
the operating system. The company also would offer a version of
Windows that wouldn't feature Microsoft's own Internet Explorer
browser.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal, Microsoft also reportedly offered equal pricing
and shipping terms to all computer makers who use its Windows
operating system software. Such a move would end Microsoft's
ability to offer pricing breaks to computer retailers that favor
other types of Microsoft software, such as Microsoft Word, over
competing products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea here would be to preclude Microsoft from punishing
companies that are cooperating with their competitors,'' said
William Kovacic, an anti-trust expert at George Washington
University who has followed the case.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing uniform pricing on Microsoft has one huge advantage:
It's a legal remedy that's easy to enforce and would require
minimal policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Justice doesn't want is a decree that requires constant
supervision and regulation, which is difficult for both the
government and the company,'' said Ronald Cass, anti-trust expert
at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers reviewed Microsoft's proposal over the
weekend but decided it lacked enough assurances that the company
would not bundle future software products to Windows, government
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   While backing away from proposals to break up the company, the
Justice Department was expected to demand that Microsoft limit the
number of software products that the firm can add to Windows.
Justice officials believe that Microsoft uses this strategy to take
away market share of rival products, leading eventually to their
demise.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic said Microsoft has tremendous incentive to stop the
lawsuit before Jackson issues his verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact showed that he found the government's
case against the company credible and that he rejected as
``specious,'' as he stated in one part, virtually all of
Microsoft's arguments. As a result, the company can reasonably fear
that Jackson's final verdict would find Microsoft guilty of
maintaining its monopoly by unlawful means.
</P>
<P>
   With a half-dozen private antitrust suits now filed against
Microsoft, Gates has strong incentives to strike a deal. Otherwise,
plaintiffs' lawyers would be able to use any negative ruling by
Jackson as a potent weapon in their civil suits against the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft doesn't want to give all these other lawsuits that
kind of ammunition,'' Kovacic said.

&HT;     GORE-BUSH CLASH OVER CAMPAIGN MONEY MAY NOT SPELL ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The clash between Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush over reforming the financing of federal
election campaigns pushed the arcane issue front-and-center in the
presidential campaign Monday but offered little prospect for
immediate, comprehensive action.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute
who studies Congress, said the lone chance for quick congressional
action will be a tactical political decision by Bush and his Senate
allies to have the Republican-led Senate endorse watered-down
reforms to protect Bush from criticism that the GOP has done
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Rules Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has
begun hearings on various proposals but he does not plan to craft a
final version of Senate legislation until mid-May. The House
approved legislation to overhaul campaign financing last year.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show Americans have little interest in the
issue. A nationwide ABC News-Washington Post survey completed in
January showed that campaign finance ranked at the bottom of the
list of seven issues discussed in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 percent of the 1,007 adults surveyed said they considered
campaign finance reform the ``single most important issue'' in
deciding which candidate to support.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' battle over the issue will ``heighten interest
and get the debate going,'' Ornstein said, adding that the ongoing
debate ``will continue to draw the contrast between Gore who has a
bold plan and Bush who says the current system is just dandy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried to court supporters of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and
inoculate himself against criticism for his 1996 fund raising by
announcing an ambitious proposal to finance House and Senate
campaigns beginning in 2008 with a $7.1 billion tax-free endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told students at Marquette University in Milwaukee that he
will ``lead'' and ``fight'' to ``redeem the soul of our
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore hoped to bolster his appeal to supporters of McCain's
failed presidential campaign by appearing with Sen. Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., who co-sponsored landmark campaign finance
legislation with McCain. Gore promised to submit their legislation
to ban soft money donations on his first day in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not give up, I will not back down, I will not walk away
until McCain-Feingold, the people's will, is the law of the land,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who unveiled his own plan to revamp the campaign finance
laws to undercut McCain during their hard-fought contest for the
Republican nomination, scoffed at Gore's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a taxpayer-financed government takeover of campaigns that
replaces individual spending decisions with decisions made by an
unelected government committee,'' Bush said in a statement issued
in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ought to ``live by and enforce the laws we currently have
on the books'' before undertaking a new commitment to ``reforming
the fund-raising practices of others,'' Bush added, in a reference
to fund-raising practices in 1996 that forced the Democratic Party
to return almost $3 million in donations from foreign donors.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain said he welcomed ``any good faith proposal
to reform our broken campaign finance system.'' But McCain added
that Gore has to ``convince a skeptical public that his efforts are
sincere and not an election-year conversion'' by supporting ``a
complete and open investigation of 1996 campaign finance
irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has struggled to defend his party's questionable
fund-raising practices in 1996, including the party's acceptance of
$2.8 million from foreigners that was subsequently returned and his
own attendance at a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in
California where $55,000 in donations was funneled through ``straw
donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Existing federal election law provides a loophole to campaign
donation limits to candidates by permitting corporations, unions,
special interests and wealthy individuals to donate unlimited,
unregulated ``soft money'' contributions to political parties for
so-called ``party building'' purposes. Both parties have deftly
used the money to support issues closely associated with a
candidate, or to attack an opponent's positions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal would outlaw the contributions as well as
discourage independently financed ``issue ads'' by guaranteeing
targeted candidates with equal time to respond. Gore also would
require special interest lobbyists to disclose their activities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal would ban soft money donations to parties by
corporations and unions; index the permitted $1,000 per-person
contribution to inflation; bar registered lobbyists from making
campaign donations to members of Congress while Congress was in
session; and require ``near instant'' disclosure of contribution on
the Internet.

 &HT;    Ad raps with an old meter, sticks
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A woman is at the crossroads _ a
bustling big-city street corner _ and she's unsure which way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, strangers approach. They take turns speaking to her _
powerfully, passionately. They have the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two roads diverged in a yellow wood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And sorry I could not travel both.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And be one traveler, long I stood... ''
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute! What is this? Rappers ripping off another oldie?
Bad flashback to high school English?
</P>
<P>
   Nope, just a commercial. Just another hip, mysterious,
what-the-heck-are-they-trying-to-sell-me TV spot, except this one
is so stark, so surreal and so slick you just have to watch.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ad for Monster.com, a worldwide Internet clearinghouse
for job listings. Compared with Budweiser's ``Whassup?''
commercials, and the fast-cutting ``Do The Dew'' ads, the spot is
downright cerebral. This is no jingle. This is classic American
poetry _ ``The Road Not Taken,'' by Robert Frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that poem from somewhere,'' says Edward
Boches, chief creative director at Mullen, the agency that created
the commercial. ``We tested (the poem) in focus groups, and it was
interesting: Out of 10 people, 10 had heard the phrase `the road
less traveled by,' and eight knew it was a poem. Only one or two
out of 10 remembered the poet was Robert Frost. But it didn't seem
to matter. It still seemed to resonate with people.''
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Frost's poem _ taking the less-popular path in life
_ is compelling. And it fits perfectly with the image Monster.com
is going for, Boches says: a serious, sensitive approach to finding
a job.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Frost is getting some free _ albeit posthumous _
advertising in all of this. Not that it's working. There seems to
be ``absolutely no'' resurgence in his popularity, according to
local bookworms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only book we have by Frost is `In the Clearing,' and it
hasn't been checked out since last fall,'' a librarian at the Lake
Worth city library admits. Ditto for bookstores: ``No one's brought
it to my attention,'' says one apologetic employee at Barnes &AMP;
Noble Booksellers in Palm Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   High school teachers say the same thing. No students have
mentioned the commercial to them, and no classroom discussions have
been sparked by the poem.
</P>
<P>
   But Monster.com isn't disappointed. The commercial debuted the
night before the Super Bowl and was repeated for the game. For 24
hours afterward _ from Jan. 31 to Feb. 1 _ more than 4.4 million
job searches were conducted on the site.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the 24-hour period, Monster.com was getting 5,600
searches per minute. More than 19,000 online resumes also were
submitted. And then there's the e-mail. Lots of it. It's still
coming in, and all of it's praise, says Anne Hollows, senior vice
president of global brand strategy at Monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   According to Monster and Mullen, it was risky going ``serious''
for the Super Bowl. The game is the highest-visibility venue,
well-known for high concepts, high comedy, and what Hollows calls
``shock-vertising,'' that in-your-face commercial style that leaves
you talking.
</P>
<P>
   Monster wanted something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the production stage, we said, `We don't want to do
something traditional, we don't want to recycle an old rock song,
we don't want to follow what everyone is doing for the Super
Bowl,''' Boches says. ``And that poem is the antithesis of those
more-expected advertising solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up a good point. What's the next big thing for
advertisers? History lessons? Biology labs? Algebraic equations? X
 &QC;  Y not buy this?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Hollows says Monster.com saw an opportunity and
grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' she says. ``There are only four really big
things in life: Your health, your religion, your family and your
work. If you can't say something sophisticated about one of those,
then you're probably missing an opportunity. We didn't want to miss
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road Not Taken,'' by Robert Frost
</P>
<P>
   Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
</P>
<P>
   And sorry I could not travel both
</P>
<P>
   And be one traveler, long I stood
</P>
<P>
   And looked down one as far as I could
</P>
<P>
   To where it bent in the undergrowth;
</P>
<P>
   Then took the other, as just as fair,
</P>
<P>
   And having perhaps the better claim,
</P>
<P>
   Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
</P>
<P>
   Though as for that the passing there
</P>
<P>
   Had worn them really about the same,
</P>
<P>
   And both that morning equally lay
</P>
<P>
   In leaves no step had trodden black.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I kept the first for another day!
</P>
<P>
   Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
</P>
<P>
   I doubted if I should ever come back.
</P>
<P>
   I shall be telling this with a sigh
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere ages and ages hence:
</P>
<P>
   Two roads diverged in a wood, and I _
</P>
<P>
   I took the one less traveled by,
</P>
<P>
   And that has made all the difference.

RAY BRADBURY IS ACTIVE AGAIN, FOLLOWING STROKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TERRY PACE   
 TimesDaily, Florence, Ala.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Bradbury was a struggling, unknown writer when he proposed
to a young Los Angeles bookstore clerk named Marguerite McClure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell in love with books and with each other,'' said
Bradbury, the creator of ``The Martian Chronicles,'' ``Something
Wicked This Way Comes'' and other classic works of literary magic
and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her friends said, `For God's sake, don't marry Bradbury _ he's
going nowhere,''' the writer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to her: `My dear, your friends are wrong. I'm going to
the moon, and then I'm going to Mars. Do you want to come along?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradburys are now in their 53rd year of marriage, and books
by the beloved author are recommended reading in high schools and
colleges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived a good life,'' said Bradbury, who turns 80 in
August. ``I've done all the things I've wanted to do. I like to
encourage people to do likewise, to follow their hearts and be
endlessly excited about the things they love.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury is continuing a remarkable recovery from a stroke last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared the hell out of me,'' he said. ``At the time, I
wasn't sure I would make it, but I did make it. Along the way you
lie awake and think, `Good God, is this the last night of my life?'
Then morning comes, and then the next day and the next night.
Finally, slowly, you come out alive again.''
</P>
<P>
   He is now adding the finishing touches to a new mystery novel,
``Let's All Kill Constance,'' and he resumed his touring schedule
in late January. In lectures, Bradbury shares his ageless lust for
life _ a philosophy he calls ``optimal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to encourage people to stay in touch with the passion
and wonderment that starts when you are very young,'' he said.
``I've learned a very good lesson along the way I learned just to
be myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be in Sheffield, Ala., on May 21 for a stage anthology
called ``The World of Ray Bradbury.'' The showcase, which runs May
19 through 21, features seven Bradbury works, adapted by the
author.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the immediacy of theater,'' said Bradbury, who has
lived in Los Angeles for the past 56 years. ``It's incredibly
rewarding to have flesh-and-blood actors act out characters you've
had in your head for years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular collection brings together plays based on a
few of my short stories and selected scenes from a couple of longer
works,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The production blends fantasy, science fiction, horror,
adventure and satire with journeys through ``The Foghorn,'' ``To
the Chicago Abyss,'' ``Kaleidoscope,'' ``The Third Landing'' from
``The Martian Chronicles,'' ``The Veldt,'' ``Pillar of Fire,'' and
``The Book People'' from ``Fahrenheit 451.''

   ``I continue to write what I want to write, not what someone
else wants me to write,'' Bradbury said. ``People always come up to
me and say, `Why don't you write realistic fiction or something
political?' I tell them, `Don't ask me to play the tuba when I play
the violin.'''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Waukegan, Ill., Bradbury had childhood passions
encompassing Lon Chaney's grotesque silent-screen roles and Willis
O'Brien's stop-motion movie dinosaurs, the spectacle of circuses
and sideshows, and the fantastic space adventures of John Carter on
Mars and ``Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was madly in love with Buck Rogers comic strips,'' Bradbury
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I collected those Buck Rogers strips, day after day, the
summer of my ninth birthday,'' he said. ``In the fifth grade, all
the kids were contemptuous of me and my collection. They made such
fun of me that finally, one afternoon, I tore up all my comic
strips.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the boy burst into uncontrollable tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself: `Why am I crying? Who died? Whose funeral am
I attending?''' Bradbury said. ``The answer was: `Yours, you fool.
You killed the future. You tore up the very thing that was the
center of your life. Now what can you do about it?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went back to collecting Buck Rogers again,'' Bradbury said.
``That made my life whole, and I've never listened to another damn
fool since.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nathan Leventhal announced Monday that he would step
down as president of Lincoln Center in December after nearly 17
years in the job, through which he helped bring jazz, an
adventurous summer festival and al fresco swing dancing to a
bastion of opera, ballet and classical music.
</P>
<P>
   His departure, which he said he had discussed with friends over
the last few years, comes at a crucial time for the center, which
is considering a $1.5 billion campaign to upgrade its 40-year-old
11-acre campus. Leventhal, 57, said he felt it was right to pass
the decadelong construction project into new hands and that he had
long hoped to change his work-intense life. He spoke of spending
more time at his Connecticut country house and working at a variety
of other pursuits, none full time.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Sills, Lincoln Center's chairman, said Monday she
planned to form a search committee to find a replacement and that
she would propose that Leventhal join the board on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was far too early to think about candidates for the
president's job, the center's $525,000-a-year senior management
position, overseeing an annual operating budget of more than $60
million. ``As his friend, I understand exactly what he wants to do
and his need to do it,'' she said. ``As his collaborator, it's a
devastating loss, and I don't intend to deal with it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the legendary tensions between Lincoln Center for the
Performing Arts Inc., the organization that manages the arts
complex and sponsors its own artistic events, and its 11 often very
powerful constituent groups _ including the Metropolitan Opera and
the New York City Ballet, each of which is represented on the board
_ one might suspect that Leventhal had simply grown tired of the
job.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting for an interview with Sills, 70, in his office
Monday, Leventhal, while acknowledging the pressures, said he had
long ago planned to scale back his workload and had enjoyed good
relations with the constituent groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who know me know I had always said that if I were ever
in the position to do so, I would have a lifestyle that was not so
chock full of work,'' Leventhal said. ``I think the organization is
particularly well positioned now. It all seemed right.'' With the
time he will gain, Leventhal said, he plans to spend more time at
his country home, to which he is building an addition, play tennis,
and resume piano lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal, a lawyer who served as deputy mayor for operations
under Mayor Edward I. Koch and special assistant to Mayor John V.
Lindsay, said he was also considering making a connection to a
university or law firm or doing some consulting. ``If I wanted to
stay working full time, I'd stay right here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having overseen the construction of the $150 million Samuel B.
and David Rose Building, which includes student housing, studio and
rehearsal space and administrative offices, Leventhal said it made
sense for the next major construction effort to be led by someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal said he would also use his remaining time in the job
to get the project off the ground. ``For the next nine months it's
business as usual,'' he said. ``We've got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the joint interview both Sills and Leventhal characterized
their relationship as close and constructive, despite reports of
tension from time to time. Although Leventhal was resented by some
constituent groups as the personification of Lincoln Center Inc.,
he generally seems to have earned respect for running the complex
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``By searching out the kinds of presentations that would not
ordinarily be at Lincoln Center, he brought a new audience,'' said
Schuyler G. Chapin, the city's commissioner of cultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Leventhal is credited with bringing productions
to Lincoln Center stages that once were dark during the summer and
with trying to bring in new audiences with nontraditional
programming. Jazz at Lincoln Center, for example, has become a
major operation and soon will have its own space in the former
Coliseum site at Columbus Circle. And for the last decade Midsummer
Night Swing has drawn crowds to dance in the open air of Lincoln
Center's plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything I wanted badly that we weren't able
to accomplish,'' Leventhal said.
</P>
<P>
   There have nevertheless been rough spots. Last year the board
came under vehement criticism for endorsing the sale of a
monumental painting by Jasper Johns that has hung in the lobby of
the New York State Theater for 35 years. The board ultimately
decided not to sell the painting, which had elicited offers of more
than $15 million. (Leventhal and Sills declined to discuss the
incident.)
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal said he had shared his decision-making with Sills.
When he handed her his letter of resignation Monday, she asked him,
``Is this your final answer?'' But other cultural experts and
Lincoln Center executives seemed caught off guard by his
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat surprised, but not completely,'' said Martin E.
Segal, chairman emeritus of Lincoln Center, who brought Leventhal
on board in the first place. ``He's been in the job a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Leventhal said he himself was not even sure he would make the
move until until this past weekend. ``I'm prepared for a huge
decompression and feeling of loss when I realize what I've done,''
he said.

 &HT;    ER' meets `Cuckoo's Nest' in new ABC hospital drama
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A deranged man shoots a cop on a crowded
Times Square street. A man attempts suicide because his wife is
leaving him. A pregnant doctor is stabbed in the stomach. A son
bites off his mother's finger _ and eats it.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the grim world of ``Wonderland,'' an intense new
series about life in a New York City mental hospital. The ABC
drama, a cross between ``ER'' and ``One Flew Over The Cuckoo's
Nest,'' certainly won't win ``The Feel Good Show Of The Year''
award. Watching the often distressing series, created by former
``Chicago Hope'' star Peter Berg, is like getting kicked in the
stomach over and over. It's not pretty and it hurts. Shot in an
in-your-face documentary style, ``Wonderland'' practically puts you
in the middle of the action.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point. Many years ago, Berg, who played headstrong
Billy Kronk on ``Hope,'' saw a documentary about a Boston
psychiatric hospital. It was, he says, the most personal experience
he ever had watching a film. His mother also volunteered at a New
York psychiatric hospital when he was a kid. So the idea of making
a series about what those facilities are like always percolated in
the back of Berg's head. ``There has never been a realistic show
that explores the human mind,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The actor-director certainly did his homework. For eight months,
he spent time in New York's famed Bellevue Hospital. He talked with
patients. He interviewed doctors. He observed. ``That gave me a
real appreciation of how large the scope of mental illness is and
how heroic many of this psychiatrists are,'' Berg says. ``Movies
always paint them as villains.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, ABC is a villain. ``Wonderland'' airs on
Thursdays at 10 p.m. In case you forgot, another highly successful
medical series airs at the same time. But Berg refuses to trash ABC
(publicly, at least) for the tough time slot. ```ER' who?'' Berg
jokes. ``Hopefully we can garner some critical success.''
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be too hard. ``Wonderland'' is blessed with a
first-rate cast led by Michelle Forbes (``Homicide: Life on the
Street'') as a caring administrator and Ted Levine (``Silence of
the Lambs'') as the head of the hospital's forensic psychiatry
department.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many dramas, most of ``Wonderland's'' stories won't be
wrapped up in a neat, 60-minute bow. Berg hopes viewers won't find
the lack of tidy endings frustrating. ``We don't have clear-cut
resolutions that television audiences are used to being provided
with,'' he says. ``In a typical cop show, the bad guy is either
caught or he gets away. On a hospital show ... a patient either
lives or dies, is cured or not cured. In the world of psychiatric
hospitals and the mentally ill, the resolutions are much more
ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in ``Wonderland's'' case, possibly more compelling.

`YOU'RE IN THE HALL OF FAME, CHARLIE BROWN!'

<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Baseball's Hall of Fame will honor late
cartoonist Charles Schulz with a ``Peanuts'' exhibit that will open
at the Cooperstown, N.Y., museum in May and run through the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame officials said they want to honor Schulz because he
loved baseball and featured the sport in one of every 10
``Peanuts'' comic strips.
</P>
<P>
   In one oft-repeated scene, pitcher Charlie Brown bears down,
determined to finally strike out a batter _ perhaps even win a game
_ but the batter slams a drive that knocks the hapless blockhead's
socks off.
</P>
<P>
   ``With some 1,800 comic strips about baseball, Schulz was truly
one of the game's great ambassadors,'' said Dale Petroskey,
president of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The special exhibit, set to open May 20, will be called,
``You're In the Hall of Fame, Charlie Brown!'' It will feature
original comic strips, larger-than-life artwork and ``Peanuts''
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be a video of interviews with Schulz and
highlights of his 50-year career as the world's best-known
cartoonist. The Hall of Fame's Bullpen Theater will show
``Peanuts'' TV specials, including ``Charlie Brown's All-Stars''
and ``It's Spring Training, Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, a sports fan who also loved golf, tennis and ice hockey,
died Feb. 12 at his home in Santa Rosa &UR;  &LR; at age 77.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Jeannie, said last week she was delighted that her
late husband's work was going to the Hall of Fame because baseball
was something dear to him all his life. She said a new book on the
sport retells a story that he told many times about a particular
summer on a sandlot in his hometown of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sparky'' Schulz was 14, he would say, when a young man he
recalled only as Harry started an informal, four-team baseball
league at one the city's ballfields. There were no fancy uniforms
or official umpires or travels to other diamonds _ just a bunch of
kids playing baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that was the best summer of his life,'' his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame exhibit is the latest in a series of posthumous
tributes and honors to be bestowed on Schulz, who also amassed an
enormous collection of awards while he was alive and creating
``Peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is processing a proposal to award the cartoonist a
posthumous Congressional Gold Medal. And in May, fellow cartoonists
will honor Schulz with the National Cartoonists Society's lifetime
achievement award.

`YOUNG AMERICANS' TO LAUNCH FROM `DAWSON'S CREEK' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Md.)  (lb) 
 By ALLISON BALLARD   
 Morning Star, Wilmington, N.C.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ ``Dawson's Creek'' is now filming the finale
for its third season. In addition to the usual cliff-hanging
suspense that producers plan for fans, there is a twist in the
works _ a spinoff series that will premiere this summer on the WB
network. Producers hope the fans of one high school drama will
start following another.
</P>
<P>
   The star of the new show, Rodney Scott, has come to Wilmington,
where ``Dawson's Creek'' is filmed, to appear in three of Creek's
last four episodes this season before moving on to ``Young
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Spinoffs, in general, have a spotty track record. Consider some
recent examples: Jennifer Love Hewitt's ``Time of Your Life,'' an
offshoot of Fox's ``Party of Five,'' is facing cancellation, and
``Ally,'' the 30-minute ``Ally McBeal'' spinoff, didn't make it
through the season.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some spinoffs have stood the test of time;
``The Jeffersons,'' ``Maude,'' ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'' and ``Rhoda''
are all television classics. And ``Frasier'' consistently does well
in ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Most spinoffs use established characters to start the new show,
but that is not the case for ``Young Americans.'' ``Melrose Place''
had a similar start from ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' _ with an
introduced character starring in the new show. This is technically
called a cross promotion, said series creator, Steven Antin. ``It's
not a spinoff.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what you call it, Scott may have the potential
star power to get ``Americans'' off to a good start. After moving
to Los Angeles two years ago, Scott not only landed the series
pilot but he also had the role of David Cassidy in ``Come On, Get
Happy: The Partridge Family Story'' and was a guest star on
``X-Files.'' He was also named as a fresh face in Teen People.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Americans'' is set at a New England boarding school _
just a few fictional hours' drive from Dawson's Capeside. Antin got
the idea for the series while driving in New England. At a gas
station, he spotted prep school boys flirting with some local
girls.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot for the series was filmed last April. It wasn't picked
up for this season but studio executives had the idea to do a cross
promotion with ``Dawson's Creek,'' which is also on WB.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `I have not heard a better idea,''' Antin said. ``I am
a big fan of `Dawson's Creek.' And what better platform to launch
`Young Americans?'''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's character (Will Krudski) is a long-lost friend of Joshua
Jackson's character (Pacey). Because his home life is troubling,
Will decides to pay a visit to Capeside. There he meets the
Dawson's Creek buddies _ and develops a strong friendship with
Meredith Monroe's character (Andie McPhee).
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how close, Monroe said, fans will have to wait and see.
Scott filmed his final Creek appearance last week. It included a
scene where he tells Andie he is leaving Capeside.
</P>
<P>
   The cross promotion continues with a possible appearance by the
Creek cast on the new show _ maybe Joshua or Andie will make that
two-hour drive to the boarding school, Raley Academy, that is the
main setting of ``Young Americans,'' Monroe said.
</P>
<P>
   The boarding school ``is pretty much high school without parents
_ and no uniforms,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   The story line of the new series has a lot of popular themes _
blue-blooded rich kids vs. local townies, a young men's school
across the river from a young women's school, and coming of age in
a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
   He said the show is a little racy. ``It is very edgy,'' he said.
``It's more like an HBO series.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many actors on ``Dawson's Creek,'' Scott, 22, will be an
adult playing the role of a high school student, but that doesn't
bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get older there is, supposedly, a maturity that goes
with it _ and that makes it easier to handle the situation and the
long work days,'' he said. ``And you've been through all that with
high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the opportunity to work with the Creek cast and crew
was a great experience.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmington and Charlotte are being considered as possible
filming locations, but Baltimore is the most likely locale for the
production, said a publicist for the show.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the pilot episode needs to be reshot and then the
cast will start filming the series. A definite air date has not
been set, but fans should look for ``Young Americans'' beginning in
June.

&HT;     BUSH STAFF SAYS ABSENT GOVERNOR STILL KEEPS TABS ON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PEGGY FIKAC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's quest for the White House
has left him with little time to spend on state business in the
Texas Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   According to the governor's official calendar and records kept
by his campaign, during the 25-week period from Oct. 1 through
March 23, Bush spent 103 days out of the state campaigning and 20
days in his state office doing the job he tells voters qualifies
him to be president.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign funded that travel. But taxpayers have picked up
the tab for the governor's security detail, provided by the Texas
Department of Public Safety: an estimated $1.3 million this year,
twice that amount in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's calendar, which tracks his Monday-through-Friday
work week, shows Bush was in his office just one day each in
January and February, three so far this month, three in December
and six each in October and November.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bush began his campaign in June, he generally has spent 10
or fewer days a month in his state office, according to his
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   But aides note the calendar provides less than a complete
picture of the time Bush spends taking care of Texas business.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't track weekends, days he shows up unscheduled in his
office, meetings he has had at the Governor's Mansion, or time he
has spent keeping in touch on the telephone from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it illustrates the time it takes to be a presidential
candidate, particularly during peak periods such as the hectic
early primary season in February.
</P>
<P>
   Previous governors who have run for president _ including Bill
Clinton of Arkansas and Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts _ have
faced the same balancing act, as have other officials, such as Sen.
John McCain, the vanquished Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 4 1/2 months of 1992, for example, when Clinton was
campaigning for the Democratic Party nomination, he was absent from
Arkansas for all but 22 days.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, after winning the nomination, Dukakis initially tried
to spend two or three days a week in Massachusetts tending to state
business. But he came under criticism for not spending enough time
on his presidential campaign, and his time at the Statehouse was
reduced to a single day by his campaign officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public understands anyone who is running for president
just about has to give up their day job,'' said Larry Berman, a
political scientist and author of ``The New American Presidency.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, Bush's day job is governor,'' Berman said.
``John McCain's was senator. When Bill Clinton ran in 1992, his was
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush's Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, has
said he realized it was more important to speak for himself as a
presidential candidate than concentrate on being the best possible
vice president, Berman said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the governor's campaign schedule, Bush and his staff
said he has kept an eye on the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the way communications work today, it's easy to stay in
touch,'' Bush said recently in a combination staff meeting-photo
opportunity in his Capitol office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the governor has kept in
close contact with his staff and makes good use of his time when he
is in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a relatively short period of time that he has been
gone a large number of days,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas House Speaker James E. ``Pete'' Laney, a Democrat, and
Republican Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, the acting governor when Bush is
absent, also said Bush keeps in touch with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe in the early 1900s a governor being gone that long would
have a negative impact on the state,'' Perry said. ``With the
communications that we have, George Bush knows everything that's
going on in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bush is out of state from midnight to midnight on a given
day, Perry gets the governor's daily salary of $316.01. That
happened on 59 days last year and 43 this year, as of March 23.
</P>
<P>
   Bush voluntarily forfeits his state salary on the days Perry is
paid for doing his job.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Bush's campaign travel has increased, so has the state's cost
of providing security.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, for example, before the governor announced plans to
seek the presidential nomination, the Department of Public Safety
spent $285,873 on his security detail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, when the governor began his campaign, the cost jumped
to $2.65 million.
</P>
<P>
   From January through March 20 of this year, the DPS spent almost
$1.3 million on security.

`SURVIVING THE GOOD TIMES': TRACKING A RECESSION'S TOLL ON 2
HARD-HIT FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review; time listed is for New York;

(jt) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a decade, Bill Moyers has been tracking the downs and ups of
two blue-collar Milwaukee families, the Neumanns and the Stanleys.
Both were hit hard in the early 1990s, after Tony Neumann and
Claude Stanley lost their jobs at Briggs &AMP; Stratton, which, like
other industrial mainstays, gave way to recession. The company cut
some 4,000 jobs in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The Neumanns are white and the Stanleys are black, but when bad
times struck, color proved less decisive than economics. Suddenly
the recently well-paid workers found themselves scrambling for
minimum-wage jobs as bills mounted. They ran behind on mortgage
payments and had to accept handouts of food.
</P>
<P>
   Along with battling to make ends meet, both families watched
their neighborhoods deteriorate, with increasingly dangerous
streets posing risks to their children. A bout of illness could
play havoc with the household budget; a fever sent Claude Stanley
to a hospital for two months in 1997, leaving him with a $30,000
bill not covered by insurance. Raising college tuition for an
ambitious son, the first Stanley to get a college degree, required
juggling credit-card debt at an interest rate of 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Neumann and Jackie Stanley pitched in, but earning $6 an
hour while they paid $1.50 an hour for child care didn't ease
matters. The children _ five Stanleys and three Neumanns _ felt the
impact as they tried to help out with odd jobs and adjusted to
homes with both parents working and with domestic tensions rising.
</P>
<P>
   The choice facing both women, as Terry Neumann puts it, was
``Either we make ends meet, or we stay home with the kids.'' She
found a job at a school cafeteria, which paid only $20 a day, but
allowed her to get home before her children. Working a double
shift, Tony Neumann hardly saw them or Terry. ``We don't sleep
together anymore,'' he tells Moyers. ``It stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's title, ``Surviving the Good Times,'' is a comment
on the gap between an America that was prospering during the heady
1990s and hard workers like the Neumanns and Stanleys who were not
able to share in the prosperity. But this report is also a tribute
to the resilience of their close-knit families and the efforts of
all members to pull together. Terry Neumann became a truck driver;
Jackie Stanley went into selling real estate, not easy for a black
woman whose potential clients are limited to the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   As the program ends, the Stanleys are hopeful but still haven't
caught up to what they made in the Brooks &AMP; Stratton years.
Prospects are brighter for the Neumanns, with Tony making $18 an
hour and Terry looking ahead to a Teamsters job at $19 an hour.
``If the money's there,'' she says, ``that's where I'll be.''

 &HT;    Aetna's sale of managed-care plans approved by state
 &HT;    By Amy Schatz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc.'s plans to sell a managed-care subsidiary in Texas
have received a boost from the state Department of Insurance, which
approved the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna was forced to sell managed care company NYLCare Health
Plans in Texas to win federal approval of its $1 billion purchase
of Prudential Health Care. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas
agreed in September to buy NYLCare, which has about 531,000 members
in Texas, for $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators had antitrust concerns about Aetna's keeping NYLCare
because it was the state's largest HMO provider and NYLCare was the
second-largest. Combined, the company would have controlled about a
third of the Texas market.
</P>
<P>
   While NYLCare operates in Austin, the sale will be more keenly
felt in Dallas and Houston, where NYLCare has the bulk of its
members. NYLCare has about 43,000 members in the Austin area,
according to the latest Department of Insurance figures. By
comparison, Blue Cross, which operates locally under the name of
Rio Grande HMO Inc., has about 15,800.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is expected to be finalized by the end of the first
quarter, a Blue Cross spokeswoman said. The company declined to
discuss further details.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will make Blue Cross the state's largest health
insurer, with about 21.8 percent of the HMO market, according to
the Department of Insurance, which approved the sale Friday. Blue
Cross said its total membership in the state will be about 2.7
million, including 806,000 HMO members.

&HT;     LIDO STARELLI, INVETERATE 49ERS FAN, DIES AT 79 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JIM HERRON ZAMORA and AL CORONA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco 49ers have lost their No. 1
fan.
</P>
<P>
   Lido Starelli, who missed only one Niners home game since 1946
and was officially named the team's top fan in 1998, has died of
cancer. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Starelli was the subject of numerous profiles focusing on his
lifelong love of the Niners. He was a 21-year-old construction
worker when the team played its first game at Kezar Stadium on
Sept. 1, 1946, against the long-defunct Chicago Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   His boss in the plastering trade had given him tickets to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all it took,'' he said in a 1996 interview. ``From
there I just went.''
</P>
<P>
   Starelli attended the games alone for the first 10 years of the
Niners _ four in the All America Football Conference and then,
beginning in 1950, the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one ticket,'' Starelli said. ``I couldn't afford two.''
</P>
<P>
   Starelli stuck with the team through many years of losses. He
followed the Niners through up and down years and teams led by
Frankie Albert, Y.A. Tittle and John Brodie, then the glory years
of Joe Montana and Steve Young, and, finally, last fall's losing
squad led by Jeff Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   To many Niners fans, recorded history began in 1980 with the
rise of Joe Montana and continued through five Super Bowl victories
in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Starelli told reporters that his favorite football games
were played back before the NFL dominated television sets every
Sunday from September to January.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite era was the '40s and '50s,'' Starelli said. ``It
was like my first love. You never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Starelli said he was superstitious: He took the Municipal
Railway to every game, wore the same clothes to every game, and
would enter through the same gate, handing his ticket to the same
employee.
</P>
<P>
   Like most true Niners fans, his favorite moment was The Catch:
December 1981, when Montana threw a touchdown pass to a leaping
Dwight Clark to win a playoff game against the Dallas Cowboys. The
ensuing Super Bowl victory ended decades of also-ran status for the
Niners.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Clark made that catch, I was crying like a baby,''
Starelli said. ``Tears of agony had become tears of ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   The only game Starelli missed was on Dec. 5, 1959 _ the day his
father died.
</P>
<P>
   But Starelli still got the program to that game. Over the years,
he not only kept programs from games he attended but managed to
track down those from every single Niners away game.
</P>
<P>
   He kept them all, believed to be the only set of its kind, in a
basement room of his San Francisco home that became a shrine to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Starelli also collected every 49er media guide, lapel pin,
stationery Christmas card and pocket schedule from the last half
century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he was named by the team as their No. 1 fan and won a
free trip to the pro football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. He
traveled there again last year after learning that he was ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Receiving the No. 1 fan award was the thrill of his life,''
his son John said Sunday. ``He lived and breathed the 49ers since
1946.''
</P>
<P>
   During his life, Starelli said that his vast collection would
never be sold _ that he would leave it to his son in hopes it would
someday end up in museum or library.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to go somewhere where it can always be appreciated by
people,'' Starelli said in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   John Starelli said he would not continue collecting programs but
he would continue collecting memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Italian town of Lucca, Starelli moved to San
Francisco as a boy and started in the building trades as a young
man, eventually becoming a journeyman plasterer. He was a 47-year
member of Local 66 of the plasterers' union.
</P>
<P>
   Starelli is survived by his wife of 55 years, Frances; his son
John Starelli and daughter-in-law Michelle; his daughter Gloria
Bruno and her husband John Bruno; and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be at 10 a.m. Thursday at St. Elizabeth's
Roman Catholic Church at 450 Somerset St. in San Francisco.

 &HT;    Trail Blazers spinning out of control
 &HT;    Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly a month after swallowing a shot of reality served by the
Los Angeles Lakers, Portland still nurses the world's longest
hangover.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers, hosts to San Antonio tonight, have lost seven
of their last 13 games. The decline began with a loss to the Lakers
in Portland on Feb. 29. Portland, now barely visible in the Lakers'
rear-view mirror, trails by seven games in what is no longer a race
for the No. 1 seed for the Western Conference playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich, whose own team struggles
while trying to mount a defense of its NBA championship, does not
consider the situation hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one team playing the way we were last year,''
Popovich said. ``The rest of us are floundering around, not
separating ourselves from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago there were two. For the first two-thirds of the
season, the Lakers and Portland were title contenders 1A and 1B, in
no particular order. L.A. had the two most talented players,
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. Portland was two deep at every
position.
</P>
<P>
   A half game separated them, Portland in the lead, when the
all-star break ended on Feb. 15. The Blazers seemed to have an
advantage in scheduling: seven more home games than the Lakers
during the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, the Lakers arrived in Portland for the last of
their four regular-season meetings. Each had a 45-11 record, having
won 11 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers left with a 90-87 victory and didn't stop until their
streak reached 19 games. The Blazers were left with a lot of
self-doubt. In mid-March, Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy said, ``We
haven't played well since the Lakers loss. We've made a lot of
mental mistakes. We're soft overall.''
</P>
<P>
   That condition has not changed after another two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly when you have a big loss, there is a residue to
it,'' Dunleavy said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy might need a back-hoe to remove all the residue. The
Blazers had won 16 straight at home before the Lakers arrived. The
defeat started a 2-5 streak in the Rose Garden, including three
consecutive losses. Toronto won by 19 in Portland six days after
the Lakers. New York left Portland with a victory on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Portland can't attribute its problems to any one factor. The
Blazers' leading scorer, forward Rasheed Wallace, is often
unstoppable when he gets going. He is also uncontrolable, the
league-leader in technical fouls with 32. Now he has company, other
Blazers who frequently complain to the refs.
</P>
<P>
   Portland has become careless on offense, ranking 16th in
turnovers. The Blazers still are among the top defensive teams,
allowing 91.2 points a game, third fewest in the league. But they
are prone to lapses, including a rash of blocking and holding fouls
that suggests they have been a step slow. During a recent five-game
stretch, including four defeats, opponents averaged 106 points
against the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to concentrate more,'' starting center Arvydas Sabonis
said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis won't have to worry about that for a while. He will miss
two to three weeks with a sprained right foot.
</P>
<P>
   When the Blazers put him on the injured list, they activated
former starter Brian Grant, now a key reserve behind Wallace and
Sabonis. Grant missed 12 games, except for eight minutes in one of
them, with a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Blazers nor Spurs are in top form for the game
tonight, both beset by injuries. But the game should nevertheless
provide a guage of where these potential playoff opponents stand.
There is a decent chance they will meet in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace is not among the injured, and he has enabled Portland to
give the Spurs fits this season, winning by 14 at home and by 10 in
San Antonio. Tim Duncan, who averages 23 points for the Spurs, was
limited to 21 in two games by Portland. Wallace, an inch shorter
than Duncan at 6-11, guards the Spurs' star with help from several
long-armed teammates.
</P>
<P>
   HOW IT SHAKES OUT
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have 12 games left, eight against teams that will
reach the playoffs and one with Orlando, which would be there if
the postseason began today. San Antonio will meet Portland, the
Lakers and Sacramento twice apiece and Utah once. The Spurs are 2-7
against those teams.

A TOILET STRATEGY AIMS FOR RESPECT  
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Globalization'' is one of those words that I avoid using
because I don't know what it means.
</P>
<P>
   If I had to guess, I'd probably say it had something to do with
the Internet or maybe skinny Indonesian children gluing athletic
shoes together for 25 cents a day so Michael Jordan can buy a
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out that globalization is really all about toilets.
Not crummy toilets that look like they were installed (and probably
last cleaned) sometime during the Eisenhower administration; I'm
talking about nice toilets. Toilets with heated seats. Toilets
situated in rooms decorated with tasteful paintings and flower
arrangements. Toilets so special that people sign up for guided
tours and maybe even meet for a spot of tea.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a good alternative to Disney World? Well, of course
it does, but before you make your motel reservations you might want
to know that these designer toilets are located in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   According to News of the Weird columnist Chuck Shepherd, South
Korea has thrown open the doors to 580 plush public restrooms as a
means of garnering greater world respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era of globalization,'' said a government cultural
official, ``it is important to become the leader in the world in
the cleanest bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   I definitely think the South Koreans are onto something here,
and it probably has nothing to do with any nerve gas the North
Koreans have sent across the border. There is unquestionably a
worldwide shortage of clean, tastefully decorated restrooms and I
see no reason why South Korea should not become a leader in this
pioneering industry.
</P>
<P>
   I do not think I'm being unpatriotic when I say that the average
American's experience with public restrooms is not always pleasant.
About the best you can hope for is a roll of toilet paper and a
less than an inch of water on the floor; forget about the heated
seats, violin music and flower arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Although the restrooms sound terrific from a South Korean
standpoint, some adaptations might have to be made for the U.S.
market. For one thing, I can't see people meeting in restrooms
after work for a cup of tea. A beer, maybe, or coffee or a soft
drink, but definitely not tea.
</P>
<P>
   The violin music might also be a problem. American taste in
music tends to run more in the direction of Top 40 or rock or
country. It doesn't really make a difference as long as it has a
beat. Violin music might be a little too relaxing to the point that
people will fall asleep, possibly causing damage to the heated
toilet seats.
</P>
<P>
   Selling the idea of a clean, sophisticated, globalized restroom
to American business managers may also pose some problems. Their
thinking is likely to be that an employee who is heating his seat
while admiring tasteful paintings and floral arrangements is an
employee who is not stamping out widgets or, more appropriately in
today's economy, microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   The trick will be to convince management that a relaxed,
warm-bunned, tea-laden employee is more productive than one who is
forced to use a restroom with less elegant furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that workers and management work out their differences
by holding a meeting. Preferably in a South Korean public restroom.

COMMENTARY: BLESS MY SOUL, LIDDY DOLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, everybody is talking about vice-presidential
candidates. Robert Rubin? Colin Powell? Can we bring back John
McCain and Bill Bradley? Tom Hanks seems like a nice person.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Al Gore and George W. Bush make campaign stops these
days, they're asked whether the local governor/mayor/senator is on
the short list. The answer is always yes, because the short list is
incredibly long right now. In fact, people, if none of your elected
officials are being talked about as potential veeps, there is
probably something wrong with your state, and you should consider
moving elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates have some time _ three or four months _ before
they really need to focus on this. We've started speculating early
because the alternative is debating whether Gore is right in
claiming that the Bush tax plan is ``risky,'' or Bush is more
correct in dubbing it ``bold.'' (Friends, when you get right down
to it, does not all boldness contain an element of danger? Is it
possible to have progress while remaining risk-free? And is it not
questions like these that drive us right back to debating the
vice-presidential karma of Gov. Tom Ridge vs. Sen. Chuck Hagel?)
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything lacking in the current crop of potential
running mates, it's that there's not a single off-the-wall
candidate. A couple of months ago the nation's Mentioning Class was
perfectly happy to theorize that the American people might be
interested in letting Jesse Ventura, Donald Trump or Warren Beatty
near the nuclear button. But nobody suggests that the political
parties would make less-than-somber choices for Number Two.
</P>
<P>
   The columnist Robert Novak was thinking outside the box recently
when he promoted the freelance ethicist William Bennett as Bush's
running mate (``a brainy, street-smart Catholic who has never been
accused of immaturity''). On the Democratic front, Mario Cuomo was
quoted by an Italian newspaper as saying that making his son,
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew Cuomo, the first
Italian-American vice president would be ``the best way to debunk
so many odious prejudices against us Italians.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo says his comments lost something _ well, a great deal _ in
the translation. But if either of the candidates wants to strike a
blow for vice-presidential diversity, there's plenty of
opportunity. We've never had a Jewish, Hispanic, African-American
or Asian vice president either. There has never been a woman,
although the Democrats were good enough to nominate Geraldine
Ferraro in 1984, when their chances were so minimal a Hail Mary
pass seemed appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   We have had a Native American vice president (Charles Curtis,
1929-33), and it's possible that we had a gay vice president in
1852, when Franklin Pierce chose William King as his running mate.
King, the only bachelor vice president, was the former roommate of
James Buchanan, the future only-bachelor president, and the two of
them were known as ``the Siamese twins'' because they went
everywhere together as a couple. However, given the fact that King
was dying in Cuba when he was elected, and never even made it back
to Washington, I think we can all agree that whatever his sexual
persuasion, homosexuals still have debunking claims.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush are both presumed to be looking for people who
will balance their weaknesses. On the Republican side, that might
mean a Catholic war hero who knows a lot about foreign policy but
isn't so very bright as to make the top of the ticket look dim.
Gore seems to be in the market for someone who _ how can we put it
delicately? _ has a lot of character.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of strategizing goes way back. Martin Van Buren, who
was burdened with a reputation as a luxury-lover, teamed up in 1836
with Rep. Richard Johnson of Kentucky, who was widely believed to
own only one set of clothes. Johnson had allegedly killed the great
chief Tecumseh during the Indian wars, and when supporters of Gen.
William Henry Harrison cried ``Tippecanoe and Tyler, too,''
Democrats were supposed to retort ``Rumpsey dumpsey, Colonel
Johnson shot Tecumpsey.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed like a good idea at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, how about Denzel Washington? He lost the Oscar, and he
deserves to get something.

EH-OH! CHILDREN'S TV HAS A BIT OF A TUMMY ACHE  
</HEADLINE>
   By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I suppose I ought to put on some shoes and join the posse
chasing after those sneaky, sidewinding, no-account Teletubbies,
but I'm probably giggling too much to hold a torch safely. As much
as I'd like to get in on the fun, I think I'll just have to sit
this one out.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of children's health advocates, including a
couple of prominent psychiatrists from Harvard Medical School,
urged the Public Broadcasting System to yank the eh-ohing little
freaks off the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teletubbies,'' for the uninitiated, is the popular PBS show
starring Tinky Winky, Laa-Laa, Dipsy and Po. You may recall them
from a year ago when televangelist Jerry Falwell declared that Mr.
Winky is gay.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Uncle Jer, I don't spend much time thinking about the
sexual preferences of stuffed animals. I am suspicious of the
Tubsters for other reasons _ they were designed specifically for
tots under the age of 2, a ``demographic'' that TV's wizard
programmers deemed neglected.
</P>
<P>
   The Teletubbies, as their name implies, have TV sets for
tummies, and their lives revolve entirely around watching TV. Gee,
how subtle is that?
</P>
<P>
   The good docs from Harvard and others say the show warps the
mission of public television and exploits babies to sell toys and
junk food.
</P>
<P>
   They're especially upset that the show's creators have signed a
licensing agreement with Burger King and McDonald's. The burger
joints give away Teletubbie toys in hopes of persuading toddlers
and their parents to eat more burgers.
</P>
<P>
   Peddling stuff to children via TV is a hallowed American
tradition, of course. As a kid, I made regular demands of my mother
to buy cereal just to get the cheap trinket inside. But targeting
babies? Even at age 7, I might have recognized that's a little
lowdown and underhanded.
</P>
<P>
   Are fast-food execs so greedy they have to shake down the 0- to
24-month set? Shouldn't they be concentrating on finding enough
kids in the 15- to 18-year-old crowd who can make change well
enough to run the register?
</P>
<P>
   Two things set me to giggling about the Teletubbies furor. One
is the reaction of PBS Vice President Tom Epstein, who says the
protest is by ``a very narrow special interest group that is not
representative of mainstream thought.''
</P>
<P>
   PBS officials clearly are spending too much time on Capitol Hill
groveling for cash. They're starting to talk like congressmen.
Epstein, in a bit of truth-wrestling unworthy of PBS, says the
burger deals ``build an audience and expose more children to the
best educational noncommercial programming on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, so it's french fry philanthropy, eh? Super-size that, would
ya?
</P>
<P>
   I'm also giggling about this because I'm a member of that ``very
narrow special interest group that is not representative of
mainstream thought.'' I'm the proud pappa of an 18-month-old girl,
and I nurture a naive hope that her mom and I can keep Phoebe out
of the marketing clutches of Teletubbies, Barney and such a little
while longer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not one of those vociferous Barney haters. I'm allergic to
the ``I Love You, You Love Me'' song, but other than that, I can
accept the Saccharinosaur in my house.
</P>
<P>
   Partly by accident, partly by design, my little girl has never
seen Barney on TV. But on her birthday and again at Christmas,
relatives and friends gave her Barney paraphernalia, including a
stuffed doll.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Phoebe showed little interest in any of it.
Then one day, as I pushed a shopping cart down the toy section of a
grocery store, I was startled to hear her scream, ``Buy me! Buy
me!''
</P>
<P>
   Criminy, I thought, she's awfully young to demand that I buy her
stuff. I tried to keep moving, but she kept gesturing at the toys.
</P>
<P>
   I followed her pudgy little fingers and studied the display for
clues. Slowly it dawned on me that she wasn't hollering ``Buy me!
Buy me!'' She was yelling, in toddler-speak, ``Barney! Barney!''
</P>
<P>
   There was an array of purple toys lining the aisle. She'd
spotted her friend and wanted me to know it.
</P>
<P>
   So there we stood, father and daughter, caught up in admiration
of the Barnster. To her, he was just a cuddly stuffed animal _ not
a TV star, not an elaborate marketing ploy, not the subject of a
multimillion-dollar licensing agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but I would have thought that was too old-fashioned, too
dull, too subtle to work.
</P>

BUSINESS AND INVESTORS HOPE PUTIN ACTS QUICKLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-POLITICS, RUSSIA-U.S.) 
(lb) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MOSCOW _ After hearing Vladimir Putin's pre-election plans to
create a sounder economy and a friendlier investment climate,
foreign investors and local business people say the new Russian
president must take decisive action in the next few months for the
country to see marked increases in investment.
</P>
<P>
   The tasks Putin faces are daunting, partly because years of
neglect under the government of Boris Yeltsin have deepened so many
problems. Business people are counting on his carrying out
long-delayed initiatives like tax and customs reform.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important, Putin has to nurture an environment where
business people feel they are treated fairly. That means reducing
Russia's corruption and the profound influence that powerful
business people, domestic conglomerates and upstart regions have on
the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generally more favorable economic situation in Russia
helps,'' said Andrea Rutherford, a director of Brunswick Warburg, a
Moscow brokerage firm. ``There's a budget surplus, revenues coming
in from higher oil prices, all of which mean that the government
doesn't have to spend its time putting out fires and can now
address real structural changes. People feel that Putin has the
power and the chance to enforce things.''
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the guarded hopes investors have, Rutherford said,
is the return of some Russian money to the stock market, which last
week lifted the main Russian Trading System index to its highest
levels since May 1998. ``Foreigners understand that the Russians
understand this place better than they do,'' she said, ``so if they
feel comfortable bringing some of their money back, that's a good
signal.''
</P>
<P>
   But after an initial surge, the market ended 1.7 percent lower
Monday, as investors reassessed how much Putin would be able to do
quickly. Many Westerners still feel they have not heard enough
detail to judge how he plans to revitalize the economy. To them, he
remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever initiatives Putin envisions will have to wait until he
is inaugurated in early May. Still, people are carefully watching
whom he picks for his inner circle and the names that surface for
the prime minister's post. So far, Putin has chosen as close
advisers former comrades from the KGB, but if respected economists
are brought into the Cabinet and other posts and afforded real
authority, business confidence could rise.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming the corruption endemic to Russia will require a
tremendous effort from Putin. He may have to dismiss many ministers
and bureaucrats, and when commercial conflicts arise, he will have
to stop the state from intervening on behalf of its favorite
business people.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Putin has the desire and wherewithal to establish the
rule of law in Russia, the work may consume much more time than
investors have patience for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's most likely that things will move ahead gradually,
without radical change, because this is a man who has never taken
any revolutionary steps,'' said Charles Blitzer, chief
international economist for the brokerage firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``So if one has diminished hopes for the Putin
presidency, one will be satisfied, but anyone with great hopes is
sure to be disappointed.''

CLINTON CONGRATULATES PUTIN ON ELECTION VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-POLITICS, RUSSIA-BUSINESS) 
(lb) 
 By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton congratulated President-elect
Vladimir Putin on Monday on his victory in the Russian election,
but also reiterated in a brief telephone conversation the White
House's concerns about Russia's continuing conflict in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton placed the call Monday morning after it became clear
that Putin had received enough votes in the balloting on Sunday to
avoid a runoff next month against Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist
leader, who finished a distant second.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks reflected the administration's optimism about
Putin but also its wait-and-see attitude to the former intelligence
officer who had spoken of being a reformer and integrating Russia
into the world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``President-elect Putin has an opportunity to translate his
electoral mandate into concrete steps to advance economic reform,
to strengthen the rule of law, to intensify the fight against crime
and corruption, and to join with us on a broad common agenda of
international security including arms control, nonproliferation and
regional peace and stability,'' Clinton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   He added that during his 15-minute conversation he ``emphasized
the importance to Russia and the world of strengthening the
foundations of Russia's democracy and deepening its international
integration.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen, according to administration officials,
is whether Putin follows through on his plans to reform the Russian
tax system and judiciary, introduce land reform and fight
corruption, and whether he institutes law and order without
cracking down on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's conversation did not delve into the key issues between
the two nations, like the administration's effort to persuade the
Russians to modify the Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty. But on the
subject of Chechnya, where the brutal fighting continues, Clinton
said he did raise his concerns about Russian aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stressed to President-elect Putin the importance of
launching impartial and transparent investigations of reported
human rights violations and providing prompt and full access for
international organizations and the press,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin, whose tough handling of Chechnya was considered an
asset in the campaign, gave no signs of altering Russia's military
policy, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders last spoke on New Year's Day after President
Boris Yeltsin announced that he was stepping down and that he was
appointing Putin, then prime minister, as acting president. Clinton
and Putin met face to face last year in Oslo, Norway, and New
Zealand.

<P>
   SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK _ At the new Wuksachi Lodge in Sequoia
National Park, a musty book is tucked in among the reading
selections in the lobby: Hammonds' Illustrated Nature Guide. It
doesn't appear to get much attention from guests, probably because
of its age _ it was published in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Look up the tree species for which this park is famed and you'll
read this entry: ``For how many centuries or millennia our present
sequoias will go on living nobody knows; their chances seem
excellent as they are almost indestructible.''
</P>
<P>
   Irony fairly spills off the page.
</P>
<P>
   Indestructible? Exactly five years before this book was
released, park rangers determined that a sequoia in nearby Giant
Forest Village, leaning ominously, was in danger of flattening some
cabins if it were to topple over. So they lifted the cabins with
jacks, rolled them out of the way, and felled the tree. Cut it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Then they counted rings in the trunk. The tree was more than
2,200 years old. It first poked through the ground and shed its
seed coat in 261 B.C., about the time Roman legions were tangling
with Carthage in the first of the three Punic Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bill Tweed, Sequoia's chief naturalist, can only shake
his head. ``There was a symbol there,'' he said. ``We were cutting
down sequoia trees to make it safe for visitors to come to see
sequoia trees. In the long run, that just didn't add up right.''
</P>
<P>
   The stewardship of the park now conforms to a much different
philosophy, and visitors will notice it the instant they wheel in
among these towering trees _the largest living things on Earth _ in
California's western Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, nearly all the development has been
removed from the Giant Forest Village. Cabins, parking areas, side
roads. Tourist lodging and services were relocated to an area a bit
farther along the road, just past the Lodgepole region, in an area
of pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Wuksachi Lodge, which opened there last spring, accommodates
visitors with 102 rooms, a main lodge building, a restaurant and
bar, a small gift shop. Its most impressive feature: It is safely
removed from any of the sequoia groves that dot these western
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   These are truly magnificent trees. They're not as tall as
redwoods or as old as bristlecone pines, but no organism on the
planet can match its volume. The General Sherman tree here, which
is 275 feet tall and 103 feet around, is estimated to contain
52,500 cubic feet of wood, enough to build 40 houses.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive immune systems enable these trees to grow so tall,
gain such bulk and last so long. Their bark is virtually devoid of
pitch, which creates the equivalent of an asbestos suit, impervious
to fire. Their bark and heart wood is also laced with a bitter
tannin, such that insects attempting to bore in become afflicted
with acute indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these giants have feet of clay _ quite literally. The
sequoia spreads its roots outward in shallow soil, and it has no
tap root. Thus, if its root system is damaged or if its surrounding
soil is eroded, it simply topples over.
</P>
<P>
   The tree can usually hold its own under natural circumstances.
But it faces the fight of its life when trenches for water pipes
are dug nearby, when road beds alter normal drainage, when
pollutants work their way into the surface water. This was the
sequoias' plight after a village was built in their midst in the
early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Most of it was removed over the last three years. A couple of
structures deemed historic remain, notably the market that served
Giant Forest. They're to be converted to a museum and a learning
center, due to open next spring.
</P>
<P>
   In one year's time, the forest has already made a remarkable
recovery. Most of the development in the area had been small cabins
dotted among the trees, not sprawling lodge complexes that would
have required extensive bulldozing. Once the cabins were plucked
out, the ground was smoothed over, covered with mulch, planted with
seedlings and interlaced with irrigation tubing. It regained the
look of natural forest floor rather quickly.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to know if irreversible damage was done by man's
100-year handprint (a tent camp went up in 1899, the last cabins
were removed in 1999). ``Did we do damage that will take a while to
show?'' said Tweed. ``Quite likely, yes. But you have to change
your thinking from human time to sequoia time.''
</P>
<P>
   A given tree might topple prematurely, but that could happen in
100 years, 500 years, he said _ only a fraction of a life that can
span 30 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Tweed does not impose a harsh judgment on his
forebears in the park. ``It's not that people were in any way evil
or shortsighted,'' he said. ``Sometimes it just takes time to see
the impact of what you're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the development was in the `20s and `30s. We've later
seen that it was located in sensitive areas. When most of the
national parks were in development _ Yosemite, the Old Faithful
area of Yellowstone _ visitation was a fraction of what it is
today. No one knew how mobile the society would become.''
</P>
<P>
   If you visit today, and you venture out on your own in the
sequoia zone, you'll be a member of a distinct minority. Most
tourists, it seems, are content to observe the trees from behind
their windshields on a drive along the Generals Highway, making
only an obligatory stop at the General Sherman tree.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman tree, the largest living thing on Earth, is only
steps from the main road, and has its own parking lot. Visitors who
stop here quickly learn that they can't backpedal far enough to
capture its 275-foot height in their camera viewfinders.
</P>
<P>
   From the edge of the parking area, you can embark on the
Congress Trail, a relatively easy, 2.1-mile loop that is kind of a
sequoia civics lesson _ trees or clusters of trees are named for
such institutions as the presidency, the Senate and the House, and
the individuals honored include William McKinley and Robert E. Lee.
(The Sherman tree honors the Union general who put the torch to the
South because James Wolverton, the cattleman who named it in 1879,
had served under William Tecumseh Sherman in the Civil War.)
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing route that branches off the Congress Trail is
the Trail of the Sequoias. It is a 5.1-mile loop that wends its way
around, under and even through fallen giants, skirts three meadows
and takes in Tharps Log, a cabin built into a hollow fallen sequoia
by an eccentric cattle rancher in the 1800s. (In this literal log
cabin, there are a table, benches, stone fireplace _ and enough
head room for an NBA forward.)
</P>
<P>
   This trail is impeccably maintained and very well marked. You'd
have to work pretty hard to get lost while navigating it. It was
also utterly deserted on a Saturday afternoon in January, just
before the season's snows arrived. Visitors don't seem inclined to
stray far from their cars or the paved roads.
</P>
<P>
   At least the makeover of Sequoia National Park has forced them
to get out of the Giant Forest before they lie down to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   A cross section of the tree sacrificed to tourist comfort in
1950, by the way, is on display today. It is turned on its edge
near the General Sherman tree. Black marks in the rings signify
fires it survived during its lifetime, and a sign chronicles them _
one roughly coinciding with William the Conqueror's arrival in
England, another with Columbus' landfall in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beginning to lean,'' said Tweed. ``The primary cause of
death for sequoia trees is that they eventually fall over. They're
resistant to fire and disease, but they develop balance problems.
Maybe the next year, maybe the next 100 years or 200 years, it was
going to fall over.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the distant future, naturalists will examine the
trunk of a stately giant sequoia that toppled over from natural
causes. Imagine them assessing the rings in the trunk and drawing
these conclusions: Survived fires of 699 and 980, made it through
drought of 1258, recovered from sewer-line trench of 1961 ...
flourished for another three centuries. &QL; 
________ &QL; 
IF YOU GO: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE: Sequoia National Park, which lies south of
Yosemite and due east of Fresno in the western Sierra Nevada, is a
233-mile drive from Los Angeles. After proceeding north via I-5 and
Highways 99 and 65 to Lindsay, the route jogs and twists a bit
before picking up Highway 198 into the mountains and the park;
simply follow the signs for ``Sequoia'' or ``National Park.'' It's
a good idea to allow between four and five hours for this drive,
particularly if there is snow on the sharply curving roadway above
Three Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   COSTS: Admission to the national park is $10 per vehicle, good
for seven days. It is $5 per person for cyclists and visitors on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: The new Wuksachi Lodge has three room categories,
graduated according to view and space. Rates are $75, $90 and $105
until June 1, at which time they'll rise to $110, $125 and $155 for
the summer peak. Rooms are simply furnished but comfortable, and do
not have TVs. Reservations: (888) 252-5757. Front desk: (559)
565-4070. Web: www.VisitSequoia.com.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: The Wuksachi serves breakfast, lunch and dinner in a
vaulted-ceiling dining room with impressive views through picture
windows. The fare is both tasty and reasonably priced _ dinner
items in the $10 to $20 range. Nearby, the Lodgepole market, closed
for renovations through most of the winter, is scheduled to reopen
Saturday. Never leave picnic items locked in your car unattended _
the bear-proof car door or window has yet to be invented.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Lodgepole Visitors Center, which lies between
the Giant Forest and the Wuksachi Lodge, can be reached at (559)
565-3782. The National Park Service maintains an office in Three
Rivers. Phone: (559) 565-3341. Web: www.nps.gov/seki.

COMMENTARY: AFRICA: AID OR HARM? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wrote recently in support of the African Growth and
Opportunity Act, a bill designed to provide sub-Saharan African
countries with duty-free access to the United States for their
textile and apparel exports. The act, now being debated by
Congress, is embarrassing for U.S. unions, such as the AFL-CIO and
Unite, because they are opposing any duty-free access for Africa
even though studies show it would create jobs in Africa and
scarcely affect employment here.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward I was bombarded with letters from union officials, who
didn't like having their opposition to African imports exposed. The
letters from Unite and the AFL-CIO, though, really stood out. Both
asserted that the U.S. unions were against this bill because it
harmed African workers _ who were also against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' I thought, ``am I urging passage of a bill to help
create investment and jobs in Africa that Africans don't want?''
</P>
<P>
   To find out, I first called Roble Olhaye, the ambassador to the
United States from Djibouti and the dean of the African ambassador
corps. He said: ``There are people (in the United States) who have
vested interests in not letting anything from Africa be imported,
but they don't want to say that, so they say that Africans don't
want it. Let me tell you, there is not a single leader in Africa
who is not supporting this bill _ without reservations.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I phoned Ebrahim Patel in Cape Town, South Africa, who
heads the Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union, the
biggest textile union in southern Africa. Patel respects the
AFL-CIO and Unite. They supported South African workers in the
struggle against apartheid. He said he would never want to do
anything harmful to them. But he also made clear that his union
favored duty-free access for African textiles and apparel to the
U.S. market, as part of a broad strategy for promoting development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support the concept of duty-free access for Africa in
textiles and apparel,'' he said. ``As with all the poorest
economies of the world, one way to raise our development quickly is
for you to give us preferential access to your markets.``
</P>
<P>
   While Patel endorsed duty-free access for African textiles and
apparel, he expressed reservations with three clauses in the Growth
Act. First is the condition (written in by the U.S. textile lobby)
stipulating that if African countries want duty-free access to
America they must first buy all the cloth and yarn in America, then
ship it to Africa to be sewn, then ship it back. Patel said
Africans need to be able to use their own cloth too, otherwise
there would be little economic benefit for them.
</P>
<P>
   Second, said Patel, African unions are concerned about demands
in the bill for African states to adopt more corporate-friendly,
free-market policies in return for duty-free access. ``Some of
these demands infringe on our sovereignty,'' said Patel.
</P>
<P>
   Third, he said, African trade unions want to ensure that any
African factories given duty-free access to the United States be
required to meet the core labor standards of the International
Labor Organization, with union involvement in monitoring and
verification. (The act already meets the ILO standard, but does not
yet include provision for monitoring by unions.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Unite and the AFL-CIO are committed to a fair global
trading system,'' said Patel. ``(But) as regards any duty-free
arrangement for Africa, I think that if we were to interact with
them, in a warm way, we could structure adequate worker rights
conditions, in such a duty-free arrangement, that would improve the
number of jobs in Africa, and the standards in the workplace, in a
way consistent with the AFL-CIO's global mission.''
</P>
<P>
   That is good advice. Africa's workers desperately need duty-free
access to our markets to create jobs. The African unions have
concerns about some side issues that should be addressed. The U.S.
unions, though, oppose any duty-free access for Africa under any
conditions _ but they don't want to say that. So they take these
African side concerns, highlight them, and then say that even
Africans don't want this duty-free bill. That is simply untrue.
</P>
<P>
   There is a way for Africa to gain duty-free access in textiles
to the U.S. market, without harming U.S. workers or worker
standards in Africa, but it takes a will to find it. Africa's
unions have that will. How about ours?

OPEC MINISTERS STILL UNDECIDED ON AMOUNT OF OIL PRODUCTION
INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for complete writethru of early version; restructures and
adds details and background.) 
(See also OIL-INFLATION) 
(js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries adjourned its ministerial meeting here Monday night
without an agreement on modest production increases, and delegates
agreed to reconvene Tuesday. But as they grappled with how to reach
an accord, one question loomed behind almost all their talks: is
anybody really in control of oil prices?
</P>
<P>
   Though U.S. consumers have been shocked to see gasoline surge
from an average of $1.27 a gallon six months ago to $1.59, oil
producers in and out of OPEC have been on a roller-coaster, moving
output both up and down in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the mystique of private meetings between
Middle-Eastern sheiks and technocrats from the likes of Mexico and
Venezuela, the 11 nations of OPEC produce only 40 percent of the
world's oil and have been repeatedly blind-sided by market forces.
</P>
<P>
   The obstacles to price ``stability,'' a buzzword embraced as
warmly by the United States as by Saudi Arabia, have been numerous:
chronic cheating within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries on its self-imposed output restrictions; inaccurate
estimates of demand and inventories; poor forecasting; and the
inevitable surprises induced by weather, war and other calamities.
</P>
<P>
   In fall 1997, Saudi Arabia convinced OPEC to increase production
by 1 million barrels a day. Prices then sank to the low teens in
1998 and hit $11 a barrel one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Panic-driven production cuts of 4.3 million barrels a day in
1998 and 1999 helped prices climb back. They surged to $34 in early
March.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they have slipped back to about $28.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, fear of causing another steep price plunge prevented
OPEC members from completing a deal to increase their daily
production quota by 1.5 to 1.7 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   After several informal and then formal meetings, oil ministers
adjourned with plans to meet again Tuesday morning. Officials on
all sides of the debate publicly predicted that they would agree on
a plan to raise production, but Iran continued to push for less
than the 1.7 million barrels that Saudi Arabia and other Persian
Gulf states want to add.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not opposed to an increase,'' said Iran's oil minister,
Bijan Namdar Zangeneh, shortly before oil ministers met at OPEC
offices here Monday evening. ``I won't talk on numbers, but we
don't want a market shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   Many OPEC leaders now say their target price is $25 a barrel,
and U.S. officials have implied they can accept that.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger question remains unanswered: Does OPEC, or any
other group, have enough influence to keep oil prices within a
tight range?
</P>
<P>
   ``Total world production is 75 million to 78 million barrels a
day, but sometimes all you have to do is be off by a million
barrels,'' said Joseph A. Stanislaw, president of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ``That's
how much they increased production in 1997, but they increased
right when demand was about to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The memories of that miscalculation are still vivid for many oil
ministers here, especially those who felt themselves dragged into
the increase by Saudi Arabia's power as the world's largest
producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk about these questions with the Saudis, I ask them
if they think their forecasts are better this time than back in
Jakarta,'' said Sheik Saud Nasser Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister,
referring to the 1997 OPEC meeting in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi officials admit they miscalculated, principally because
they failed to anticipate that the Asian financial crisis would
reduce world oil demand as sharply as it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to avoid volatility, but this is something that
you cannot guarantee,'' said a senior Saudi official here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the unpredictability of the world economy, data about the
oil market and even something as simple as OPEC production itself
is often inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC members chronically overshoot their official quotas, though
the price collapses of 1998 and 1999 prompted them to adhere to
discipline more closely than they had done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Cheating on quotas is so persistent and so important to oil
prices that numerous organizations make monthly estimates by
monitoring oil tankers and pipeline activities.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC itself does not even have its own statistics on its
production, partly because members don't trust each other to
provide reliable data. As a result, OPEC officials rely on research
provided by outside companies and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely watched estimates are those of the International
Energy Agency, a research organization in Paris funded primarily by
the United States and other western countries.The agency estimates
that OPEC countries are cheating by about 1 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   But estimating cheating is still a nebulous art, prone to
errors. Even more difficult is the job of estimating oil
inventories, which are held by oil producers around the world as
well as petroleum refiners, traders and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The International Energy Agency, as well as private researchers,
admit they seriously overestimated the reduction of inventories in
January.

HIGHER OIL PRICES WILL NOT SPUR U.S. INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article does not have a byline)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said
Monday that higher oil prices are not generating inflation in the
United States, and that the country is better able to absorb rising
energy costs than it was two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not, as yet _ I emphasize as yet _ see any significant
indication that crude oil price increases are in the process of
embedding themselves in other areas of the economy and inflating
the general price structure,'' Greenspan said in response to a
question at a hearing before a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said that as long as average oil prices remain roughly
where they are now, he doubted that they would be sufficient to set
off a surge in inflation. But he warned that a big, sustained jump
in prices could still be harmful to the U.S. economy, as well as,
in the long run, to the oil-producing nations.

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Energy Department said Monday it was abandoning a
plan to build the country's first nuclear-waste incinerator in
southern Idaho, a decision that was hailed by environmental groups
that used considerable political and financial might to fight the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was part of the settlement of a lawsuit the groups
had filed against the department seeking to stop construction of
the incinerator, or failing that, to collect $1 billion in damages
if it began operating. The plaintiffs were largely concerned that
wind currents might have blown radioactive and toxic dust across
western Wyoming, an area that includes Yellowstone National Park
and the upscale resort community of Jackson, Wyo., where the main
opposition group, Keep Yellowstone Nuclear Free, is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of this victory cannot be overstated,'' said Tom
Patricelli, executive director of the Yellowstone group. ``I know
it sounds like a cliche, but the people came together and spoke. We
made a lot of noise, and we were right. So we got on their radar
screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to stopping construction plans for the incinerator
at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory,
which is 90 miles west of Jackson, the settlement calls on Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson to appoint a panel of experts to explore
alternatives to incineration as a method of nuclear waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Richardson said halting the construction
``eliminates a potentially festering problem in the future.'' But
in a broader context, he added, ``I also want a careful examination
of new technology as an alternative to incineration. I'm not
satisfied that that has been fully explored. There may not be a
better way, but we need to examine all alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which named Richardson among others as a defendant,
was one of many tools the environmental groups used to persuade the
federal government to reconsider plans for the incinerator. They
mounted intensive lobbying and direct-mail efforts, paid for in
part with $500,000 raised in donations, 20 percent of which came
from two notable Jackson home owners _ Harrison Ford, the actor,
and James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, who each
donated $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marvelous example of how people gathered together to
bring Goliath to his knees,'' said Gerry L. Spence, a well-known
trial lawyer who worked at no cost for the environmental groups.
He, too, lives in the target area, just outside of Jackson in the
small town of Wilson, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, which was completed Sunday night, the
Energy Department will proceed with plans to build a facility at
the laboratory that compacts waste for shipment to the department's
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico. Currently, 65,000 cubic
meters of waste is awaiting treatment, although most of it is
neither radioactive nor hazardous. By agreement, up to 97 percent
of the toxic waste will also be compacted, with the remainder
stored underground.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the waste must be disposed of by 2018.
</P>
<P>
   One element of the lawsuit settlement did not please the
environmental groups. British Nuclear Fuels Ltd., an agency of the
British government that would have built the incinerator, was
allowed to remain as a partner in the design and construction of
the compacting operation. The agency, which has worked on other
nuclear projects in the United States, has drawn criticism in
recent years for questionable business practices and for dumping
radioactive waste into the Irish Sea. The Yellowstone group
petitioned Richardson last week to have the agency barred from
contracting with the American government.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson promised the groups that his department would keep a
watchful eye on the British agency, and as part of the settlement,
the groups retained the right to ask Richardson later to reconsider
British Nuclear Fuels as a department contractor.

BIG MICROSOFT DECLINE HELPS PULL MARKETS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ Major stock market averages moved lower Monday,
dragged down by declines in financial service and bank stocks and
by a big decline in Microsoft, which slumped on reports that the
software company remains far from an agreement that would settle
the government's antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq composite index, fell 7
5/8, to 104 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Its decline was responsible for 37.9 points of the 86.87 decline
in the Dow. The blue chip index closed at 11,025.85, down 0.8
percent from the close on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.60, or 0.2 percent,
to 1,523.86. The decline in Microsoft shares was offset in part by
gains in a number of other large technology issues, including
America Online and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index closed at 4,958.56, down 4.47 points,
or 0.1 percent. Gains in stocks like Qualcomm, Yahoo and Nextel
tempered losses in JDS Uniphase and CMGI, as well as Microsoft. And
the Russell 2000 small stock index dipped 3.6, or 0.1 percent, to
573.66.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and analysts said there was no real trend to Monday's
action. Activity was light, the end of the first quarter is fast
approaching and there is little in the way of economic news to be
reported this week that seems likely to move financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one theme, it is that the larger capitalization
stocks are dominant again,'' said William Meehan, chief market
analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the bond market really falls apart, the stock market is
likely to do all right until first-quarter earnings reports start
to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond market was fairly quiet Monday, with little or no
change in interest rates. But that did not prevent stock traders
from pounding bank and brokerage stocks.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, a Dow component, fell 5 11/16, to 131 1/8.
Citigroup, which is also in the Dow, lost 1/2, to 60 1/16. Chase
Manhattan dropped 1 1/2, to 94 11/16. And Mellon Financial declined
7/8, to 30 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said that troubles at Finova Group may have offered
encouragement to sell bank stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the lender to midsize companies warned that it will miss
first-quarter profit goals because of a bad loan. The company also
said its chief executive is retiring for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Finova's stock price slid sharply, closing at 19 7/8, down 12
1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage stocks, which have been red hot lately, slumped.
</P>
<P>
   The group was led lower by Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, which fell
9 9/16, to 57 3/4, after the stock was downgraded by a Morgan
Stanley analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley was one of the biggest losers of the S&AMP;P 500. The
stock closed at 90, down 5 13/16. Charles Schwab slumped 5 3/16, to
59 13/16. And Paine Webber Group fell 3 1/2, to 43 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   A number of big technology companies were immune from the
problems that plagued Microsoft, and moved higher.
</P>
<P>
   IBM closed at 126 9/16, up 5 9/16. Hewlett-Packard gained 3
15/16, to 146 5/16. And Intel rose 3 43/64, to 142 47/64.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Canelo, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and a longtime optimist about the direction of stock prices,
issued an even brighter assessment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the market opened Canelo raised his estimates for both
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think oil prices have clearly peaked, and will fall to the
mid-$20-a- barrel range,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, bond yields have fallen to the level where they are not
competitive with stock market earnings. And I am positive about
earnings. We have raised our earnings estimates for the S&AMP;P 500 to
15 percent from 12 percent for the current calendar year.''
</P>
<P>
   Canelo said the market was likely to broaden beyond technology
stocks into energy, financial services, capital goods and cyclical
stocks that will benefit from an improving global economy.
</P>
<P>
   By midsummer, he projects that the S&AMP;P 500 index will be
comfortably above 1600. And he added that the Nasdaq composite has
the potential to rise another 10 percent from current levels.

 &HT;    Hewitt's doubts in her dream role echo Hepburn's own
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's face it: Jennifer Love Hewitt's
breasts are as famous as she is.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder some Hollywood insiders snickered when Hewitt
wanted to play the glamorous, stick-thin Audrey Hepburn in a TV
movie. After all, Hepburn was flat-chested. Hewitt is, well... we
all know what Hewitt is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's been something since I did those `I Know What You
Did Last Summer' movies where I wore those tiny tops, and stuff,''
Hewitt says, giggling.
</P>
<P>
   While filming ``The Audrey Hepburn Story,'' ABC's three-hour
biography debuting Monday, Hewitt wore a sports bra and an ace
bandage in several scenes to keep her assets hidden. ``Costume
designers have all the technology the aerospace industry has,''
jokes director Steve Robman. ``They did a wonderful job.''
</P>
<P>
   But will viewers think the former ``Party of Five'' star is
wonderful as the legendary actress?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about turning on a new generation to Audrey
Hepburn,'' says Kimberly Rubin, the film's executive producer. ``We
think people will take (Hewitt) seriously and not just as a teen
queen.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not an easy job. Hepburn, who starred in such classics as
``Roman Holiday,'' ``Sabrina,'' ``Love in the Afternoon,'' ``Two
for the Road,'' ``Funny Face'' and ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' was
one of film's most beloved icons. With her eye-catching Givenchy
flair, she practically created the chic gamine. Her incredibly
influential look also helped set the style for the reedlike fashion
models so popular today.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the one woman who had every single thing a woman should
be,'' the 21-year-old Hewitt says. ``She was goofy, funny,
beautiful, smart, elegant, graceful, sexy. Any word you could think
of, she was it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hewitt wasn't sure if she could play Hepburn. She read the
criticism. And it stung. A lot. ``Two weeks before the movie
started, I was bawling and crying because all these stories were
coming out saying I couldn't pull it off, I wasn't talented enough,
I wasn't pretty enough, how dare I play Audrey Hepburn and there
was the whole chest thing,'' she remembers. ``I have thick skin,
but not that thick. It was hurtful to me and I told my mom, `I
don't think I'm pretty enough and I'm afraid of what people are
going to say.' That's when she took out the script and pointed out
a line with me as Audrey saying, `I don't think I'm talented
enough, pretty enough and I'm afraid of what people are going to
say.' She said, `For Audrey's sake, you have to do this movie and
you'll be great in it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who is co-executive producer of the film, has idolized
Hepburn ever since her mom showed her ``Breakfast at Tiffany's''
when she was 7. ```This is who you should grow up to be,''' Hewitt
recalls her mom saying about Hepburn's character, the ever-charming
Holly Golightly. ``I was absolutely captivated. I didn't understand
the story, but I could tell you every word she said and every move
she made. I was hooked ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, starring in ``The Audrey Hepburn Story'' has been
Hewitt's dream project for years. Fortunately for Hewitt, Kimberly
Rubin, a veteran TV movie producer, had the same dream. Rubin
pitched the idea to several networks for eight years, but all of
them passed.
</P>
<P>
   But when Rubin met Hewitt to talk about a different project, she
was delighted to learn both were fascinated with Hepburn's
Cinderella life story. Once Hewitt signed on, ABC gave the $7
million film (most of which was spent on Hewitt's salary and the
enormous costume budget) the green light. ``Had we not had Love
Hewitt, I don't know if this movie was going to be made,'' Rubin
says.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, ABC chose to only focus on the first 32 years of
Hepburn's life. The network didn't seek cooperation from Hepburn's
family, however. ``There are Byzantine legal complications when you
do that,'' director Robman explains. ABC did show the final version
to Sean Ferrer, Hepburn's oldest son. ``He said it respected and
celebrated his mother's memory,'' Robman says.
</P>
<P>
   The film starts with Hepburn shooting ``Breakfast at Tiffany's''
famous opening scene in which she's munching on a sweet roll in
front of New York's famed jewelry store. But Hepburn gags the
moment she bites into it. Truman Capote (Michael J. Burg), who
wrote the novella on which ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' was based, is
visibly upset with Hepburn's performance, saying he would rather
see Marilyn Monroe star in the film because she knows how to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The film movingly deals with the Belgian-born Hepburn's
traumatic childhood during the Nazi occupation of Holland during
World War II (she worked as a courier for the Dutch resistance);
her rise to international film stardom; her torrid on-screen
romance with William Holden; her marriage to Mel Ferrer (a miscast
Eric McCormack of ``Will &AMP; Grace''); and her never-ending search
for the love of her father, a Nazi sympathizer who abandoned the
family.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge in making the film, says Robman, was
upholding Hepburn's much-earned legacy, not only as an actress but
as a humanitarian. ``This woman is a cherished figure,'' says
Robman, who directed Hewitt often on ``Party of Five.'' ``We wanted
to respect that. We weren't interested in finding a dark, terrible,
awful secret. And there are none. People needed to believe Jennifer
was filled with grace and dignity like Audrey.''
</P>
<P>
   They also needed to believe Hewitt, who lost 11 pounds for the
film, imitating Hepburn's distinctive, yet unidentifiable accent.
Her mother was Dutch. Her father English. Hepburn grew up in
Holland and England. To help Hewitt, ABC hired a dialect coach.
``It took her about a half-day to get it right,'' Robman marvels.
``She's a singer and has an unbelievable ear. She approached it
like memorizing a melody.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Hewitt does nail the accent to near perfection. But
as she notes, it wasn't easy. ``It was the hardest thing to do,''
she says. ``A lot of times, the performance was right, but you
couldn't move on to another shot because part of the accent wasn't
there. Every day I was scared to death in that accent. There was
even talk of not doing the accent, but it wouldn't have been the
same movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt hopes she won't be viewed as the same actress after ``The
Audrey Hepburn Story'' airs. Instead of being cute and perky, she
wants to be serious ... and sexy. ``I've always been the cute
Gidget vs. Marilyn Monroe,'' she says, sighing. ``There are times I
wish people would say, `Jennifer is sexy and so hot,' not just
perky and cute all the time. But I'm much more the Gidget type and
you just have to live with it and face it. But I would like to
prove there's more depth to me than just laughing and a smile.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Microsoft Corp. and the U.S. Justice
Department continued negotiations Monday on a possible settlement
to the government's landmark anti-trust lawsuit, but government
officials expressed skepticism that a deal could be made before
Tuesday's expected ruling in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, U.S. officials rejected a last-minute proposal
by the software giant, saying it didn't meet enough of the
government's demands.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson warned both
sides last week that he would issue his ruling Tuesday unless he
saw progress on the settlement talks, giving rise to speculation
that he might postpone the Tuesday deadline as long as both sides
were still negotiating. The judge's ruling would be on the question
of whether Microsoft's business practices were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision by Jackson to postpone his ruling would be
influenced by the views of Judge Richard Posner, chief judge of the
7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, who has been mediating the
case since last November when Jackson asked him to help both sides
reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Microsoft nor representatives of the Justice Department
and the 19 states that brought the suit in 1998 had any official
comment on where things stood Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If he issues his ruling, Jackson is expected to deal harshly
with the Redmond, Wash.-based company.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 5, Jackson issued his ``findings of fact'' that said
Microsoft had used its monopoly power to stifle innovation, reduce
competition and hurt consumers by bundling its Internet Explorer
browser with its Windows operating system. A computer's operating
system is the core program that allows other programs, such as word
processing applications, to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Because Windows runs 95 percent of all computers, Jackson said,
Microsoft's bundling, or tying together, of its operating system
and its browser means that browser competitors _ such as Netscape _
would be at a severe disadvantage when it comes to selling their
own browsers. This led to less competition and less innovation,
which hurt consumers, he said. Microsoft contends that the browser,
which allows users access to the World Wide Web, is not a separate
product but an ``integrated feature'' of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The November findings represent Jackson's conclusions about
which side presented the most compelling and believable case during
the year-long hearing that opened in his court on Oct. 19, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson will use those findings to determine whether Microsoft's
actions actually broke the law. But since Jackson's finding of
facts were against the company, many antitrust experts say they
expected he will conclude that Microsoft's actions added up to
violations of antitrust law. Assuming Jackson's ruling goes against
Microsoft, the case would then move to its final phase: the penalty
stage. During the penalty stage, Jackson would determine what to do
to Microsoft to ensure the company doesn't break anti-trust law
again.
</P>
<P>
   The most drastic remedy being considered is breaking up the
company into separate parts to end its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's latest proposal to settle the case reportedly would
allow manufacturers of computers or software to modify the Windows
source code to attach rival products, such as Internet browsers, to
the operating system. The company also would offer a version of
Windows that wouldn't feature Microsoft's own Internet Explorer
browser.
</P>
<P>
   In the proposal, Microsoft also reportedly offered equal pricing
and shipping terms to all computer makers who use its Windows
operating system software. Such a move would end Microsoft's
ability to offer pricing breaks to computer retailers that favor
other types of Microsoft software, such as Microsoft Word, over
competing products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea here would be to preclude Microsoft from punishing
companies that are cooperating with their competitors,'' said
William Kovacic, an anti-trust expert at George Washington
University who has followed the case.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing uniform pricing on Microsoft has one huge advantage:
It's a legal remedy that's easy to enforce and would require
minimal policing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Justice doesn't want is a decree that requires constant
supervision and regulation, which is difficult for both the
government and the company,'' said Ronald Cass, anti-trust expert
at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers reviewed Microsoft's proposal over the
weekend but decided it lacked enough assurances that the company
would not bundle future software products to Windows, government
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   While backing away from proposals to break up the company, the
Justice Department was expected to demand that Microsoft limit the
number of software products that the firm can add to Windows.
Justice officials believe that Microsoft uses this strategy to take
away market share of rival products, leading eventually to their
demise.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic said Microsoft has tremendous incentive to stop the
lawsuit before Jackson issues his verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings of fact showed that he found the government's
case against the company credible and that he rejected as
``specious,'' as he stated in one part, virtually all of
Microsoft's arguments. As a result, the company can reasonably fear
that Jackson's final verdict would find Microsoft guilty of
maintaining its monopoly by unlawful means.
</P>
<P>
   With a half-dozen private antitrust suits now filed against
Microsoft, Gates has strong incentives to strike a deal. Otherwise,
plaintiffs' lawyers would be able to use any negative ruling by
Jackson as a potent weapon in their civil suits against the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft doesn't want to give all these other lawsuits that
kind of ammunition,'' Kovacic said.

 &HT;    Cox merger with Seagram a `market rumor'
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Communications and its parent firm spent about $12
billion on acquisitions last year to solidify their position in the
media and telecommunications industries, but adding Canada's
Seagram Co. to the mix isn't part of the plan, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not afraid to be aggressive and to be acquisitive,''
said Brian Farley, spokesman for Cox Enterprises Inc., which owns
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and holds a majority stake in Cox
Communications Inc., the No. 5 U.S. cable television company.
</P>
<P>
   But Farley said a report in London's Sunday Telegraph that Cox
Communications was planning to join with Vivendi SA in a merger
with the Montreal-based Seagram was ``total news to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications denied that it had been approached by either
company about a possible three-way merger, alliance, or any other
business ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had no discussions in any way, shape or form,'' said
Ellen East, spokeswoman for Atlanta-based Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Paris-based Vivendi, which owns stakes in European pay-TV
operators, also denied that it was in merger talks to create a new
media company akin to the planned merger of Time Warner and America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   The pending Time Warner-AOL merger will create one of the
world's most powerful media companies, uniting communications and
media firms ranging from AOL's online service to Time Warner's
Fortune, Time and People magazines and CNN news channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of been prevalent thinking in the cable
industry,'' to unite communications channels with so-called
``content'' producers, said East.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram's shares have risen more than 40 percent on speculation
that it would be sold after news reports that it was involved in
talks with a number of companies, including Comcast Corp., News
Corp., Walt Disney Co., and Bertelsmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday Telegraph reported that Vivendi planned to pay up to
$32 billion for Seagram and an undisclosed amount for Cox
Communications, whose Class A shares had a market value Monday of
$27.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think quite literally Seagram has talked to everybody out
there'' following the Time Warner-AOL deal, said Michael Palmer,
beverage analyst for First Associates Investments in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   But he said any potential merger could snag on Seagram's $11
billion acquisition of PolyGram at a time when the growing volume
of free music on the Internet is creating an uncertain future for
the music business.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pet theory is there's going to be a lot of (merger) smoke
and no fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Any potential merger plans with Cox Communications would
certainly fizzle without the backing of Cox Enterprises, said East.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Enterprises owns almost 66 percent of Cox Communication's
Class A shares and all of its Class C shares, giving it control of
more than 76 percent of the company's shareholder votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cox Enterprises has said they're very happy with us,'' said
East. ``We did $10.2 billion worth of acquisitions last year
alone,'' she said, adding four cable television companies with
networks in seven states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very comfortable with our size,'' she added. ``We feel
like we're the size we need to be to be a player in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Including Cox Communication's acquisitions, privately-held Cox
Enterprises added about $12 billion worth of new businesses last
year, and it has another $1 billion worth pending, said Farley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's more acquisitions than we've seen in a year's
time, ever,'' he said, adding that ``we're always interested in
looking at businesses where we think there's a strategic fit.''
</P>
<P>
   But a deal with Vivendi and Seagram is not one of them, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rumor, a market rumor,'' he said.

that could determine whether some of the biotechnology industry's
most lucrative drugs will be vulnerable to lower-priced

PARTYING ALL NIGHT LONG

<TEXT>
<P>
   So what do you serve up after an endless Oscar show? Right, an
endless Oscar party. Or at least a party that doesn't need to end
until the last guest has found his or her limo.
</P>
<P>
   A late evening is precisely what the hosts of the Governors Ball
_ the on-site post-Oscar fest thrown by the academy _ were aiming
for. Better to keep their guests chowing, dancing and schmoozing
into the wee hours rather than settling for a token appearance
before the stars head out to studio-thrown bashes in Hollywood and
Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The show's late ending certainly meant that Oscar winners and
their family members arrived a little later. Celebrities spotted
well past 10 p.m. included Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, Kevin
Spacey, Michael Clarke Duncan, Lucy Liu, Queen Latifah, Clint
Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Eric Clapton, Faith Hill and ``The Sixth
Sense'' director M. Night Shyamalan.
</P>
<P>
   Show producers Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck were congratulated
by practically every person they encountered. After spending the
telecast in a truck with the telecast director, Lili Zanuck seemed
ready to party.
</P>
<P>
   For the occasion, the Shrine's Exhibition Hall was decked out
with white parachuting that lit up with colorful, rotating
projected images, courtesy of David Smith and Show Pro. Now it's
blue, now it's red, now it's yellow. The largely dark tones even
encouraged the use of a sparkling party favor: a flashing red ring
that looked like something out of a comic book or a cereal box.
Even best actress nominee Julianne Moore wore one as she posed for
pictures before heading for the exit on the arm of director beau
Bart Freundlich.
</P>
<P>
   The main course of Wolfgang Puck's menu was a roasted chicken
breast with a wild mushroom risotto and black truffles. But the
repast's most souvenir-worthy item came from the desert tray: a
chocolate scroll bearing a detailed rendering of the five best
picture nominees. Folks not looking to preserve the treasure sank
their teeth into Tom Hanks' face (from ``The Green Mile'' poster)
or into the bare midriff from the ``American Beauty'' image.
</P>
<P>
   Newly won Oscars took their place on tables to be fondled and
admired by family and colleagues. One slightly irreverent winner
joked that she hoped to win a second statue in the near future so
she could simultaneously do bicep curls with both arms.
</P>
<P>
   Others won't even keep the statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it back to my mother and father (in Capetown),''
said Trefor Proud, co-winner with Christine Blundell of the best
makeup Oscar for ``Topsy-Turvy.'' ``They'll look after it for
me.'' &QL;

MIRAMAX'S MEDIOCRE MASH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Harvey Weinstein
was overheard summing up Miramax's inability to snatch the Best
Picture Oscar from DreamWorks two years running: Miramax trumped
``Saving Private Ryan'' with ``Shakespeare in Love'' last year, but
SKG's ``American Beauty'' stomped ``The Cider House Rules'' this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Harvey, fresh from his semi-secretive hospitalization,
shruggingly philosophized: ``We're (expletive) mortal.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Miramax's runners-up ball 2000 was nothing near the
depressing dirge last year's DreamWorks party was, even though the
mini-major only copped a couple of trophies, one for ``Cider House
Rules''
</P>
<P>
   Best Supporting Actor Michael Caine and another for its
screenwriter-author, John Irving. True, the no-shows (Meryl Streep,
GwynethPaltrow, Jude Law, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Sheri Lansing)
were far more celebrated than many of the attendees (Don Rickles,
Malcolm McDowell, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen). The odd pockets
of glamour (Ashley Judd, Roberto Benigni, briefly; Anthony
Minghella, even more briefly; a reported but unseen Jane Fonda)
were difficult to suss out amid the heavy wannabe and
fashion-victim contingent.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with John Irving, who said the number of drafts in
his novel version of ``Cider House'' approximated the number of
drafts in his screenplay, both years in the making; the only
difference was, with the screenplay: ``I was getting notes from a
number of other people, so I had some idea what I was doing.'' His
next project: Adapting his book ``A Son of the Circus'' (he's
allowing another book, ``A Widow for a Year,'' to be adapted
without his input, he'll finish but the first draft of his next
novel within a month, then subject it to his usual rounds of
revisions until his wife-agent tells him to surrender it to an
editor).
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Tarantino, the long-mute Oscar-winning tyro (``Pulp
Fiction''), promised, more or less, that the final draft of his
next script _ a World War II flick _ would be forthcoming within
the next few months; his hand fluttered spastically, indicating his
approximate level of pleasure with the progress of his writing.
Which was worse _ working on the script or fielding endless
questions about his next film's ETA? Tarantino laughed: ``That's
not been so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarantino at one point loudly insisted to honcho Weinstein that
attendee Tobe Hooper (``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'') represented
the pinnacle of `70s independent filmmaking. He was also part of
one of the evening's most unique tableaux: trading loud insults
with Keitel, Madsen, Rickles and McDowell, while no more than a
yard away stood venerable TV newsman Walter Cronkite. Tarantino et
al. were a challenge to approach; Cronkite, the man America trusted
with its life for a couple of decades, was readily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   He was invited, he showed up, the erstwhile anchor pragmatically
explained. Did he think Miramax's offering represented the best of
Oscar's offerings? Walter, frankly: ``Not really.''
</P>
<P>
   Things were winding down; though Weinstein invited winner Caine
to spend the night at the party, staffers were rolling the booze
away a quarter till two. We caught up with ``South Park: Bigger,
Longer and Uncut'' mastermind Trey Parker, who was !ital!robbed in
the Best Song category (``Blame Canada'' lost to whatever lame bit
of kiddy self-empowerment Phil Collins slapped together).
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who attended the awards in a parody of the Jennifer
Lopez Grammy dress (which was not seen at any point during the
ceremony), laughed that he was pretty sure that whoever was in
charge had strict orders not to get him on camera. He added he was
pleased with Robin Williams' performance, and glad that viewers saw
```80s Robin Williams, not `Patch Adams' Robin Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker was so friendly and accommodating, we decided to try to
irk him. ``Phil Collins !ital!deserved to win,'' we declared.
</P>
<P>
   Parker replied: ``(Really filthy expletive) Phil Collins up the
(anatomical region) five times,'' he said, not really betraying any
true malice. &QL;

WITH OPENER IN TOKYO, BASEBALL TAKES THE SHAPE OF THE GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mets and the Chicago Cubs open the baseball season
Wednesday, earlier on the calendar than ever before, as well as
earlier in the morning. The season opener is set to begin at 5:08
a.m. Eastern time, and most fans of both teams will be able to see
the game only on television _ because it will be played in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The game, the first in the regular season to be played outside
North America, represents a significant escalation of Major League
Baseball's international aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Globalization is the next big step for baseball,'' said David
Cone, the Yankees' veteran pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials hope to advance a number of goals by having
the Mets and the Cubs fly halfway around the world for a two-game
series. They want to increase the sport's visibility worldwide,
enhance revenue through marketing and retailing and develop new
sources of talent.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility, though, is definitely not on baseball's agenda:
creating new major league franchises in Asia, Europe or other
international settings. Instead, some players and league executives
are hoping that starting the season in Tokyo will be a
steppingstone to a different kind of global event, a baseball World
Cup that might be played at the end of the major league season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a segue to a World Cup series,'' said Cone, who
is a member of the baseball union hierarchy. ``You'd have players
playing for their own country in the World Cup-type of format. I
think it's a wonderful idea. Everybody I talk to gets excited about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In attempting to go global, baseball is playing catchup with the
other major professional sports. Even Commissioner Bud Selig has
acknowledged that football, basketball and hockey have been more
aggressive with international plans.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball has been rapidly expanding its horizons. The San
Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies opened last season in Monterrey,
Mexico. A half-dozen teams played spring-training exhibition games
in Latin America earlier this month. And in taking two National
League teams to Japan for the season-opener, which sold out in a
matter of hours, baseball is trying to emphasize its international
vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a statement in that marketplace about how important we
think it is,'' said Tim Brosnan, Major League Baseball's executive
vice president for business. ``We think so much of them that we
deliver our opening day game to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Major league players have been traveling to Japan for off-season
games since 1908, playing there a total of 33 times. The most
recent visit of a major league all-star team came after the 1998
season. Most of those trips were designed to promote international
goodwill and interest in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The current initiative is more focused and more mercenary. By
exposing its glamorous players on a global scale, Major League
Baseball wants to generate greater interest in its game and greater
revenue in its pockets. Baseball sells rights to televise games to
various countries and licenses merchandise that is sold all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring the game to the fans,'' Brosnan said. ``Let
them see it, smell it, taste it. In a market like Japan, where we
have both an avid fan base and an ever increasing curiosity, we're
on more people's radar screens every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if by taking the game to other countries, baseball
can entice youngsters to play and they become good enough to play
professionally, well, the more sources of talent, wherever it is
found, the better for baseball's future. For the past eight years
Major League Baseball has sent instructors all over the world for
clinics in countries where the game is in the developmental stage.
</P>
<P>
   What baseball does not plan to do through the extension of its
global reach is to undertake expansion to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it happening in the short term; it's not on the
front burner,'' said Paul Beeston, Major League Baseball's
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has added enough new franchises in recent years,
officials have decided. And if it were to add teams, they would not
be placed in Asia or Europe, because the travel would be too
punishing for players.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the World Series outside the United States and Canada is
also unlikely, at least in the short run. But expanding baseball's
global horizons does have an ancillary benefit: It is one major
matter on which the owners and the players agree and on which they
can work harmoniously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don can almost speak for ownership when we talk international
because we're on the same page in the same book,'' Beeston said,
referring to Donald Fehr, the head of the Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Fehr and the union, in fact, were ahead of the owners in pushing
for the development of a global strategy. The 1985 collective
bargaining agreement called for a study committee on international
play. But Fehr said it was not until Beeston became baseball's
second-most powerful executive that the owners became interested in
global strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a particular interest that I had not seen before,''
Fehr said.
</P>
<P>
   Beeston, a Canadian, came to baseball's executive offices from
Toronto, where he had served as a Blue Jays executive since the
team's inception in 1977, becoming president in 1989. As a member
of one of the major leagues' two teams outside the United States,
Beeston tended to have a broader outlook on baseball's
international possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for commerce, good from a marketing point of view,''
he said. ``We sell television and merchandise in all those areas.
We also have a social responsibility to go to countries that
provide players to Major League Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   That responsibility resulted in a series of exhibition games
played earlier this month in the Dominican Republic (Boston and
Houston), Venezuela (Atlanta and Tampa Bay) and Mexico (Arizona and
Anaheim).
</P>
<P>
   ``The ovation in Venezuela may still be going on,'' Beeston
said. ``The excitement in that stadium was almost tangible. The
cheer that Chipper Jones got was equivalent to anything here. Jose
Canseco didn't play the second game, and they chanted `Canseco,
Canseco, Canseco.' It was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Brosnan said, 90,000 tickets were sold for the two
games in four and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan said the trip to Japan would increase corporate and fan
interest in baseball. ``We would expect to see a spike in some
television ratings and in our merchandising business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Business has boomed internationally during the past five years,
Brosnan said: television revenues have increased about 300 percent
and sponsorship revenues have expanded between 700 and 800 percent.
He did not provide specific figures.
</P>
<P>
   Players, too, can benefit individually. Sammy Sosa, the Cubs'
prolific home-run hitter, became an instant hero there in 1998
when, as a touring all-star, he hit a home run in his first at-bat,
then bowed to the four corners of the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that visit, Sosa has earned $2 million to $3
million in Japanese endorsements and is expected to make much more
in the next few years. Not all players will benefit so abundantly,
but most endorse the idea of international play.
</P>
<P>
   ``All world-class athletes want to have some sort of an
opportunity to demonstrate they're world class and not just stars
at home,'' Fehr said. ``Why does the World Cup in soccer attract
people? The players want to participate in these things, not
everybody, but a large majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire is a notable exception. The home run record-holder
convinced his St. Louis teammates last year to reject the chance to
be in Japan this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Major League Baseball wants to do more internationally,
but there's no purpose in it,'' McGwire said last week. ``I don't
agree with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since players seem to get most of the new revenue generated by
the international initiative, they have a vested interest in
pursuing trips like the one to Japan. ``Once a lot of players
realize the goal and the payoff down the line for future players,''
Cone said, ``everyone would agree it's important and needs to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office and the Players Association are
splitting the profits from the Japan trip. They are assured of $2
million each, with management's share going into the clubs' central
fund and the union giving its share to the players on the Mets and
Cubs. Each player will receive $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball World Cup could reap rich rewards far beyond a
two-game visit to a foreign country. Talk of a world event began
about eight years ago, Fehr said, when players became interested in
playing in the Olympics. The problem with the Olympics, though, is
that they are held during the baseball season, and neither players
nor owners want to interrupt the season.
</P>
<P>
   The United States team for the Summer Olympics in Sydney next
September will have professional players, but they will be
primarily minor leaguers. If a World Cup were to be held after the
World Series, major leaguers would be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're trying to develop baseball, a World Cup format would
make sense,'' Fehr said. ``Over time it could attract large
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in a true world tournament would be teams from the
United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the
Dominican Republic and Venezuela. Teams from South Korea, Taiwan,
Australia, Italy and elsewhere might also compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball players playing for their flags will blow people's
minds,'' Brosnan said. ``We're talking about when it's going to
happen, not if.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, the Yankees' 37-year-old pitcher, laments that it probably
will not happen during his career. Negotiations for a new
collective bargaining agreement will have to be held in the next
two years, and that arduous exercise will most likely have to be
completed before such a significant new venture is undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll get a labor agreement out of the way and
people will focus on the World Cup,'' Cone said. ``That would do
more to grow the game globally than just about anything else.'' &QL;

 &HT;    newsweek says boomers aren't slowing down now that they've hit
big 5-0

<P>
   More and more baby boomers who have been racing along the fast
track for years are beginning to hit the big 5-O speed bump. Rather
than slowing down, says Newsweek ($3.50) in a special report, they
are simply taking detours that their security-conscious parents
never would have dared to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going quietly into their senior years, boomers are
switching careers and spouses, starting their own companies, and
cashing in on huge inheritances and 401K plans. Many are reordering
their priorities, Newsweek says, and attempting to recapture
deferred dreams. ``Your realize that life is very short,'' says
Terry Patten, a 49-year-old California entrepreneur who divorced
his wife, sold his company, and is doing yoga and lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting sidelight is an excerpt from David Brooks' new
book, ``Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got
There.'' Brooks contends that the bohemians of the '60s have become
the bourgeoisie. Now, he says, ``you can't tell an espresso-sipping
potter from a cappuccino-drinking banker.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nothing but blue skies: Who would have thought television
viewers would want to watch 24 hours of weather reports? New Yorker
($3) correspondent John Seabrook talks to executives at the
Atlanta-based Weather Channel about how they turned what seemed
like a bad idea at the time into a multimillion-dollar business.
``People watch weather on TV because it seems real,'' Seabrook
says, ``in a way that political scandals and stock-market gyrations
sometimes do not.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Political views: George ($2.95) is not only surviving after
the death of its founder John F. Kennedy Jr., it's getting more
interesting. This month's issue features a cover story on
celebrities and their causes, an excerpt from Peggy Noonan's book
on Hillary Rodham Clinton, an essay by Pulitzer Prize-winning
author Jane Smiley on why she will miss Bill Clinton, and David
Halberstam's assessment on the legacy of the Vietnam War.

 &HT;    Symposium to match money with minority-run start-ups
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Brian Ransom needed additional working capital
for his downtown eatery, he bypassed the banks and sought the help
of an angel.
</P>
<P>
   Not the heavenly kind, but a wealthy private investor he met
through a networking forum that matches entrepreneurs with
deep-pocketed investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It afforded us the opportunity to continue developing the
concept of the restaurant,'' said Ransom, an Atlanta sports agent
who prefers to talk about the culinary side instead of the cash
side of the restaurant, 201 Courtland.
</P>
<P>
   Noted for its chili-crusted salmon and crawfish pie, the
restaurant is also owned by the Washington Redskins' Marco Coleman,
a former Georgia Tech football player, and Carlos Rogers, a
basketball player with the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   While Ransom regularly comes in contact with wealthy sports
figures, chances are slim that most aspiring entrepreneurs will
ever come in contact with a wealthy investor willing to back their
ideas. It's virtually unheard of for most minorities, who don't
travel in the same circles as many of the venture capitalists
they're trying to find.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of minority athletes, entertainers and entrepreneurs
is trying to change that by matching private investors with
minorities who want to start or expand businesses. The national
networking session will be in Atlanta the second weekend in April.
The Access to Capital Symposium and Millionaires Ball will be held
April 7 and 8 at the Ritz-Carlton Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing what the television show `Star Search' did for
entertainers,'' said Michael Chatman, a Miami businessman involved
with the conference. ``We're launching the promising careers of
start-up companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a chance to rub elbows with the rich, the symposium
will feature discussions on setting up a business plan, raising
money for business ideas regardless of personal credit history,
finding private investors to back your plan and learning more about
the multimillion-dollar venture capital industry.
</P>
<P>
   Access to Capital conducts seminars at the symposium in
association with Angel Investors Networking Forum for U.S. Emerging
Markets, a Dallas-based group of minority angel investors. Angel
investors are usually private individuals who prefer to remain out
of the public eye. They generally get a stake and say-so in the
company in exchange for their investment.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, venture capitalists continue to pour money into new
ventures, mostly high-tech start-ups. Much of that money is making
its way to Georgia. In the last three months of 1999, Georgia firms
attracted more than $372 million of venture capital, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers' national MoneyTree survey. That number is
up more than 660 percent over the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few of the dollars reach the hands of minorities who need
the money to start or grow businesses, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, minorities and women are awarded lucrative
contracts to do work, but often what happens is they don't have the
capital to fill the order. So they wind up losing the business,''
said Chatman, vice president of the Access to Capital Group.
</P>
<P>
   The group does not provide the money to businesses. Instead, it
acts as a matchmaker between would-be business owners and angel
investors. It also screens potential business ventures before they
are presented to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Many would-be minority entrepreneurs, Chatman added, have
``tended to congregate among ourselves and not attended the events
where the big boys and big girls are. We have not found those seed
and early-stage investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Another stumbling block is the wall of silence many
entrepreneurs invoke when asked to talk about their business and
how it's financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a source of frustration,'' Chatman concedes. ``Many
African-American businesses don't want to give the perception that
it is a black business. They feel like they'll lose business.
They're quick to say they don't want to be pigeonholed. But my
argument is that if you're competent enough to run the business,
color shouldn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Often for many venture capitalists such as Alan Taetle, the only
color that matters is green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing some minorities, (but) we'd love to see more,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Chatman, Taetle noted, ``The paths (of minorities and
potential investors) don't cross that often.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the absence is particularly evident at the university
level, where many of the ideas for start-up businesses are born. At
an Atlanta presentation on venture capitalism aimed at colleges and
universities last fall, the representation of the predominantly
black colleges was small in comparison to others. Taetle's firm,
Noro-Moseley Partners, sees about 200 companies a year and backs
about 20. When deciding whether to invest in a company, Taetle said
his firm looks at four criteria:
</P>
<P>
   _ The company needs to target big markets, which can yield
revenue of $1 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Management should really know the industry it wants to serve.
</P>
<P>
   _ The prospect should show proof that customers want what the
company is selling.
</P>
<P>
   _ The management team doesn't have to be experienced, but it
should have lots of energy and enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   The Access to Capital symposium is interested in linking
investors with people who have a broad range of businesses or
ideas. In the past three years, angel investors with the symposium
have invested from $50,000 to $5 million in various businesses,
Chatman said. Those businesses have included restaurants, real
estate firms, hair care products companies, Internet start-ups and
video distribution companies.
</P>
<P>
   Access to Capital has identified angels who want to provide seed
money in the earliest stages of the business development. ``This is
somewhat riskier than other venture capitalists, who wait for a
solid track record before investing,'' Chatman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Access to Capital symposium was started in 1998 by former
Seattle Seahawks linebacker Darrin Smith as a way to help minority
start-up companies find capital. The symposiums were
invitation-only in the past. But this year's event, along with the
Millionaires Ball, is being opened to investors and those seeking
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since our founding, we've attracted some of the most prominent
names in America,'' Smith said. ``The event is considered to be one
of the best events for African-American, Hispanic, Asian and women
entrepreneurs and investors looking to invest in start-up
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some past symposium participants have included television
producer and actor Tim Reid; actor Blair Underwood; Hollywood
director Kevin Hooks; singer Howard Hewitt; and Atlanta
entrepreneur Bernard Bronner of Bronner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   Chatman is quick to point out that while the symposium draws
many of black America's elite, some of the celebrities and athletes
are there seeking capital themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gain knowledge, expertise and networking information _
things you don't normally get in our community,'' Ransom noted.
``It's relationship development. It's (about) helping people
understand the business needs of acquiring money.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the symposium's investors are what Chatman calls
``cashed-out entrepreneurs'' who have sold their companies or
people who have inherited wealth and are looking to invest.
</P>
<P>
   This year's event has attracted the interest of more than 300
investors and entrepreneurs, 65 percent of whom are seeking
financial backers, from across the country. Atlanta is the only
city so far where the symposium has been held, Chatman said, but
one of the concerns symposium organizers have had is the relatively
low representation of metro Atlanta companies.
</P>
<P>
   Chatman said he doesn't know exactly how many people have
received angel financing through the symposium, but he noted, ``We
normally have 15 businesses that make presentations each year at
the symposium. The majority are start-ups.''
</P>

TRIAL JUDGE'S VERDICT SEEMS LIKELY IN MICROSOFT ANTITRUST CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An appointed mediator continued working feverishly
Monday evening to work out an 11th-hour settlement in the antitrust
case against Microsoft. But opinions among some of the government
officials who filed the suit appeared to be hardening, setting up
the likelihood that the trial judge will issue a verdict as soon as
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Monday, some officials said they thought
Microsoft's settlement proposal, offered last Friday, was simply
inadequate on its face. Others said they did not trust Microsoft to
live up to its promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't too long ago that Microsoft's president was saying
`to heck with Janet Reno,''' one official noted. ``I think
Microsoft is now paying for their prior credibility problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Another said simply: ``This proposal simply falls short of what
the public interest demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven by reports last week that Microsoft might settle the
case, the company's stock gained more than 7 percent on Thursday.
But Monday it closed at $104.0625, down $7.625, or 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, called
the litigants into his office and told them they had another week
to settle the case. If they failed, he said he would issue his
verdict a week later, on Tuesday _ though several officials said
Monday they believed he might hold off a few days because of the
continuing talks.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Jackson's strongly worded findings of fact in
November, the expectation has been that the verdict, when it comes,
would find that Microsoft violated the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Microsoft delivered a settlement offer with more than
a dozen proposals. Among them, the company said it would provide
computer makers a version of Windows that did not include access to
the company's Web browser, Internet Explorer _ although how that
would be accomplished remains unclear. Microsoft has argued since
1997 that Windows and Internet Explorer are one, inseparable
product.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also agreed to charge common prices for Windows so the
company could not use pricing to penalize or reward computer makers
for their level of cooperation. Trial evidence showed that
Microsoft penalized IBM with higher prices for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The company also promised to make the program interfaces that
allow software writers to link their programs to Windows freely
available. Microsoft has been charged with holding those interfaces
back from companies that do not cooperate on other matters.
</P>
<P>
   While these proposals and others directly address some of the
conclusions in Jackson's findings of fact, most government
officials concluded that they were insufficient. But even those who
did not hold that view said the offers included so many technical
qualifiers, codicils and addendums that no one could tell whether
the proposals could actually be carried out effectively. What is
more, several officials said, the proposal offered no real detail
on how the offers could be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very serious enforcement concerns,'' one official
said. Microsoft declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement issue is of particular concern because
government officials do not want to find themselves required to
monitor Microsoft's day-to-day business behavior _ or left to wait
until someone complains of a violation so that they have to file
another lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, among the justice department officials and the 19
state attorneys general who are behind the suit, some still favor
breaking up Microsoft so that, once that is accomplished,
government involvement would end. Others consider that idea
draconian and unlikley to withstand judicial appeal.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the varied concerns about Microsoft's proposal,
by Saturday the leading officials behind the lawsuit had decided it
was inadequate. Despite the negative reaction, through the weekend
and into the evening Monday, the mediator, Richard A. Posner, chief
judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, continued sending
e-mail messages to both sides, trying to bridge the divide.
</P>
<P>
   If he had made significant progress, the parties would have
convened in Chicago on Monday for further negotiations. But the
state and federal officials were in their offices Monday. Still,
several officials said the talks were still alive, if barely;
Microsoft was said to be clarifying some of its offers. Some
officials said they would not be surprised if Posner asked Jackson
to delay issuing his verdict by a few days, to give the talks every
possible chance to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Microsoft did expand or clarify its proposal enough to
satisfy some of the government officials, winning agreement from
the federal government and all 19 state attorneys general would be
a difficult and time consuming process. The states are sharply
divided on the best approach, and some of them have not followed
the case closely enough to make a quick decision.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the talks stall, and Jackson issues his verdict, the two
sides could continue to negotiate. But at that point, the
motivations for Microsoft will have changed. By settling now, it
can forestall a legal ruling that the company holds a monopoly in
the personal computer operating-system business. That ruling would
empower lawyers to file even more private antitrust suits against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson concluded in his findings of fact that Microsoft holds a
legal monopoly. But that finding holds little if any legal force
until the judge issues his final verdict.

ANOTHER 80 BODIES FOUND AS INVESTIGATION INTO UGANDAN CULT GROWS

<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda _ Another 80 bodies were exhumed Monday from a
mass grave discovered over the weekend on a rural plot of land once
owned by a leader of a doomsday cult, which now appears to be
linked to the deaths of at least 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the people found Monday, like the 159
unearthed last week from other mass graves, had been slain, said a
police spokesman, Eric Naigambi. ``There is no other reason why 80
people would end up in a mass grave,'' Naigambi said late Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's unearthing of corpses, in the village of Rugazi, was
the third such discovery since March 17, when at least 330
followers of the cult, the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten
Commandments of God, died in a fire set by some members in a chapel
on the cult's isolated compound in Kanungu, about 200 miles south
of Kampala, the capital. The cult believed the end of the world was
to come on Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Rugazi is simply the latest site to be searched by police as
they try to piece together what happened on March 17 and determine
who was responsible. So far their searches have only added more
questions.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the fire, investigators pulled six bodies from
a pit latrine on the cult's compound in Kanungu, just steps away
from the charred wreckage of the chapel. The six people, who could
not be identified, had been slain.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Friday, in Rutoma, a village about 30 miles from
Kanungu, the police unearthed the bodies of 153 people buried in
mass graves on a plot of land used by the cult. The people had been
slashed to death or strangled during the past several weeks, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators arrived in Rugazi, which is also about 30 miles
from Kanungu, during the weekend, and on Sunday discovered the
remains of a human being buried in a grave, police said. Digging
was halted immediately, and a team of senior investigators was
summoned from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the police department's head of criminal investigations,
the team, which includes a government chemist and a government
pathologist, was expected to arrive in the village late Monday, a
police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The search of the site was not supposed to resume until
Wednesday when the experts arrived from the capital, Naigambi said.
But inexplicably the local officials resumed the search Monday
afternoon and soon discovered that the lone body found on Sunday
was far from the only one.
</P>
<P>
   A local doctor examining the bodies said at the scene that the
victims appeared to have been dead about a month, according to The
Associated Press, which reported that some of the bodies appeared
to have stab wounds while others had pieces of cloth tied around
their necks.
</P>
<P>
   Why the digging began before the team from the capital arrived
and why the bodies were re-buried before being examined by that
team are just the latest questions in what has been a troubled
investigation from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently overwhelmed by the number of bodies, the authorities
here have conducted only cursory autopsies before reburying the
dead in mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   The order to halt digging and wait for the experts to arrive was
supposed to have been a step toward straightening out the
investigation. ``We don't know what happened,'' Naigambi, the
police spokesman, said when asked why the search had proceeded
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The property where the bodies were found Monday was owned until
recently by Dominic Kataribaabo, a disgraced former priest who was
one of the cult's leaders and is believed to have perished in the
fire at Kanungu, another police spokesman, Assuman Mugenyi, said.
The house was apparently used by the cult for seminars and meetings
until about a month ago when Kataribaabo sold it to his brother,
Mugenyi said.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the sale, only weeks before the deadly inferno at
Kanungu, is another piece of circumstantial evidence suggesting
that many of the cult's followers knew something momentous was
about to happen. Only hours before the fire in Kanungu, cult
members set fire to all five buildings in the compound in Rutoma
before leaving for Kanungu, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The mounting evidence that the events of March 17 were carefully
planned, plus the discovery of more bodies, has forced the police
to pursue the case as a murder investigation. The cult's two most
prominent leaders, Joseph Kibwetere and Credonia Mwerinde, are
among the prime suspects, the police said. No one knows whether
either of them is alive, but the police here are operating on the
assumption that they are and are on the run.

VENERABLE NEW ENGLAND RESTAURANT CHAIN TO REORGANIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When America watched The Mickey Mouse Club on TV and Buicks were
heavy with tailfins and chrome, New England families often visited
a Friendly's Ice Cream Shoppe for the comfort foods of summer.
</P>
<P>
   But times _ and diets _ have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Amid intense competition from everyone from large national
rivals to the diner down the street, Friendly's has spent the last
15 years mostly shrinking and struggling to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bad news for a one-time regional icon came Monday
when Friendly Ice Cream Corp., based in Wilbraham, Mass., said it
had just closed 80 of its 683 restaurants, with plans to close 70
more over the next two years. Among those that were closed are 11
in Massachusetts. By way of comparison, about 850 Friendly's dotted
the Northeast in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's reorganization didn't just close restaurants; it also
is expected to result in the elimination of 110 management and
administrative jobs, Friendly's said. Waiters and waitresses will
be transferred to other restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in a retrenchment mode,'' said Andrew Ebersole, a bond
analyst with KDP Investment Advisors in Montpelier, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago when many baby boomers were still children and
few adults had ever heard of cholesterol, tofu, or celebrity chefs
on TV, many New England families had two options when it came to
eating out: Friendly's or Howard Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, the measure of a restaurant was its dessert menu.
If a chain didn't offer at least a dozen varieties of ice cream and
frozen desserts, many consumers weren't interested.
</P>
<P>
   But today's consumer is far more health conscious. And consumers
have far more restaurant choices than 30 years ago. When Friendly's
is only one choice among many restaurant options, it can compare
poorly to rivals, said John Macht of the Macht Group, a Boston
consulting firm that includes restaurants among its clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be wonderful,'' he said. ``It just lost its way.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Friendly's thinks otherwise. Its small, older
shops are outdated, the company readily concedes, but a new larger
version of Friendly's shows much promise.
</P>
<P>
   With about 165 seats, these new restaurants are about 2 1/2
times larger than the old ice cream shoppes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides burgers, tuna melts, and Oreo sundaes, the bigger
kitchens at these new Friendly's also can serve up quesadillas,
salads, and veggie wraps.
</P>
<P>
   By closing underperforming older restaurants so it can focus on
larger, newer ones, the company said it looks to pursue a
``brilliant-at-the-basics'' strategy that emphasizes quality,
service, and value to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This move is a crucial step toward strengthening the company's
core restaurant business,'' said Friendly's chairman and chief
executive Donald N. Smith, whose company bought Friendly's in a
1988 leveraged buyout from Hershey Food Corp. and took the chain
public in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Average sales at the Friendly's stores that just closed lagged
far below the company's chainwide 1999 annual average of $958,000,
noted Friendly's spokeswoman Vivian H. Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, nearly all stores were company owned. Now 100
stores are owned by franchisees, and franchising is a big part of
Friendly's growth strategy moving forward, she added.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the restaurant closings, Friendly's plans to take
a pretax asset writedown of about $18 million and a pretax
restructuring charge of about $12 million.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, Friendly's seems to be a great idea _ a place where
families and seniors can enjoy reasonably priced meals at a
full-service restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's restaurant landscape, Friendly's may be occupying
a niche that's getting squeezed from both above and below, some
industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   On the low side, there are fast-food chains where consumers can
eat for about $4. Just above Friendly's are chains such as Chili's
Grill &AMP; Bar, where consumers can pay between $10 and $15 for a
meal.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it would seem that there might be room for a
restaurant where customers can pay about $6 for a meal, the amount
Friendly's said is the size of its average tab.
</P>
<P>
   But restaurant chains in this price range sometimes have had a
tough time in the 1990s, according to Technomic Inc., a Chicago
consulting firm that tracks the restaurant industry.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to picking a family restaurant, many consumers
seem to be opting for either a cheap and cheerful outing at
McDonald's or a minisplurge at Chili's.
</P>
<P>
   That's one theory. But it's hard to pin down any one reason why
Friendly's long-promised comeback story has been delayed once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't point to one single thing,'' said analyst Ebersole,
who cited competition from many rivals and rising labor costs as
two factors hurting Friendly's at a time when a booming economy has
many consumers dining out more often.
</P>
<P>
   After a disastrous 1995, when Friendly's lost $58.7 million on
revenue of $649.2 million, there has been progress. For the fiscal
year that just ended, Friendly's finally made its way back into the
black, earning $400,000 on sales of $709 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company seems to have stalled once again, possibly
hurt by its heavy debt load. Investors also seem to have lost
patience. Monday Friendly's shares dipped 12.5 cents to close at
$3.875 on Nasdaq, near a 52-week low of $3.0625.
</P>
<P>
   With so many changes in the way consumers eat, restaurants must
innovate constantly to survive, consultant Macht said. Having a
proud local history may not be a good enough reason for today's
consumer to choose Friendly's over the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Said Macht, ``There may not be a need for a place like this to
exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Brooks strongly disagreed. ``We have a strong
concept, with ice cream as our point of difference,'' she said.
``This brand still has tremendous potential.''

JUNIPER NETWORKS PLANS TO UNVEIL FASTEST INTERNET ROUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing its march into the data networking market, Juniper
Networks Inc. intends to announce Tuesday that it is shipping what
appears to be the fastest electronic switch for Internet
information.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major communications carriers that have agreed to
purchase Juniper's new system are MCI WorldCom Inc.'s Uunet unit,
the world's No. 1 Internet carrier; Cable &AMP; Wireless PLC of
Britain, which controls the former MCI's United States Internet
operation; and the European joint venture between Qwest
Communications International Inc.; and KPN, the Dutch
communications company.
</P>
<P>
   Uunet in particular seems so enamored of Juniper's new creation
that it intends to announce Tuesday that it will use the product to
upgrade much of its network to higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Systems like Juniper's, which direct Internet information from
one point to another, are known as routers. As demand for Internet
service grows, communications carriers are continually on the
lookout for faster routers. Juniper's new router appears to be the
first that can reliably and consistently manage Internet flows of
10 billion digital bits a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only box we've been able to qualify for use in the
backbone'' at this rate,'' Michael D. O'Dell, Uunet's chief
scientist, said Monday in an interview. ``Without naming names, let
me just say that most people trying to sell into this space make us
aware of their product offerings and the Juniper box is the only
one we've been able to qualify.''
</P>
<P>
   Juniper, based in Mountain View, Calif., has skyrocketed to
prominence among investors and communications professionals as it
has successfully challenged the dominance of Cisco Systems Inc. in
the market for ultra high-performance Internet routers. With barely
$100 million in revenue last year, Juniper now has a market value
of about $43 billion. After first offering stock to the public last
summer for $34 a share, the company's shares closed at $276.4375
Monday, up $7.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic cards within Juniper's new system that are similar in
concept to those inside a personal computer can each handle two
traffic streams of 10 billion bits a second, forming one circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Eight such cards fit into the new router's chassis, which is
about the size of a small refrigerator that might be found in a
dormitory room. So the new product, called the M160, can route a
total of 160 billion bits of digital information each second.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's most powerful router occupies about twice the space of
the M160 and has a total capacity of 80 billion bits a second.
Juniper currently has the lead over Cisco largely because Juniper's
electronic cards can handle individual flows of 10 billion bits a
second, while Cisco's are now limited to 2.5 billion bits a second.
</P>
<P>
   Building on its acquisition of the privately held Nexabit
Networks last summer, Lucent Technologies Inc. is now working with
communications carriers in trials of an Internet router that can
manage traffic flows of 10 billion bits a second. But that system
has not yet become generally available.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is largest, fastest device ever created for the
Internet,'' Scott Kriens, Juniper's chairman, said Monday in an
interview. ``It's the next generation of Internet performance and
it delivers a backbone which allows the entire network to scale
from today's capacity, which supports about 250 million users, to
tomorrow's demand, which is for 1 billion users.''
</P>
<P>
   But its sheer capacity was not the only reason the new Juniper
system was selected by Uunet.
</P>
<P>
   One of the drawbacks of traditional Internet technology is that
it does not differentiate between digital flows that require
first-class treatment, like phone calls, and those that can travel
bulk freight, like Web surfing. Along with other companies
including Cisco and Lucent, Juniper is using new technology that
can allow Internet routers to transmit different digital bits with
different levels of priority.
</P>
<P>
   That can allow communications carriers to simplify their
networks, eliminating other technologies that were needed just to
assure that certain bits were treated better than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we can keep scaling the network,'' said O'Dell. ``We
have to keep making more capacity, and I mean lots more.''

JUSTICES RULE BENEFITS CAN BE DENIED TO FOREIGN-BORN U.S.
RESIDENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government's refusal to pay welfare
benefits to permanent residents who are not U.S. citizens survived
a Supreme Court challenge Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the justices let stand a lower court ruling
that Congress acted constitutionally when it changed federal
welfare laws in 1996 to deny benefits to foreign-born U.S.
residents until they have lived in the United States for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago and legal U.S. residents in the city had unsuccessfully
challenged the 1996 amendment as violating the Constitution's
guarantee of equal protection. They said the amendment denied to
indigent legal permanent residents the same benefits, such as food
stamps and Medicaid, the federal government provides to poor U.S.
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's failed appeal was the first major Supreme Court
challenge to the constitutionality of the 1996 Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, popularly
referred to as the welfare-reform law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the statute, the federal government must withhold welfare
benefits to new permanent residents for five years. States and
cities, however, may still provide benefits but without financial
help from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Permanent residents, as defined by the federal government, fall
in the legal gap between immigrants authorized to be in the United
States for temporary assignments, such as students, and U.S.
citizens, who enjoy all the rights, benefits and duties of American
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law, aimed at encouraging welfare recipients to find
work, had the backing of congressional Republicans and President
Clinton but was roundly criticized by members of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats regarded the act's restrictions on welfare
payments as an abandonment of the Democratic principle of helping
the needy. Three senior members of the Department of Health and
Human Services, which administers the federal welfare program,
resigned in protest shortly after Clinton signed the reform measure
into law in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the act, including the Children's Defense Fund,
note that 570,000 permanent residents who were otherwise eligible
for federal food stamps last year did not receive the benefit
because they were not U.S. citizens, according to the Agriculture
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's refusal to hear Chicago's appeal of the 7th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision sets no national legal
precedent. But the justices action is binding in the three states
governed by the 7th Circuit, Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th Circuit ruled last year that the Constitution permits
the federal government to extend greater benefits to U.S. citizens
than it does to legal residents provided the government has a
``rational basis'' for doing so. In its decision, the 7th Circuit
accepted the federal government's argument that the denial of
benefits was a rational method for keeping public expenditures down
and discouraging immigration to the United States by people
primarily interested in exploiting the country's welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The National League of Cities, in its brief to the justices,
said Congress' decision to stop paying welfare benefits to legal
residents has left local governments with the high cost of
supporting poor people without any federal help. The National Law
Center on Homelessness and Poverty added that these costs will rise
as the number of indigent permanent residents increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration, in successfully urging the
justices to reject the appeal, argued that the federal government
has wide constitutional authority to deny benefits to legal U.S.
residents that it extends to U.S. citizens.

 &HT;    Cross purposes: Why was symbol burned on woman's front yard?
 &HT;    By Jingle Davis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Ga. _ Lawanda Holmes was so eager to see her new
dinette table that she hurried past the smoldering cross in her
front yard without a glance.
</P>
<P>
   But her boyfriend, Travis Gammage, smelled gasoline and realized
that the small cross had been burned a few feet from Holmes' front
door. Earlier that evening, helping deliver the table, he'd found a
note with a racial slur on the door.
</P>
<P>
   When Holmes saw the charred cross, she burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking it was the KKK,'' the 20-year-old black woman
said. ``I was terrified. I thought of all kinds of stuff: churches
being burned, bottles being thrown through windows, houses being
set on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes was stunned when authorities charged three of her closest
neighbors, including Richland City Council member Roy ``Pete''
Cobb, with the Feb. 16 cross burning.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, 46, lives a few doors from the house Holmes rented a few
months ago; their families have known each other for generations in
tiny Richland, 35 miles south of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mama used to nurse Pete Cobb and his brothers,'' said
Holmes' grandfather, Richard Rhine, 64. ``He really fooled me. I
really know him.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, slowly shaking his head. ``Or I thought I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb denied involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got me guilty and I haven't done anything,'' he said.
``This is something that's got blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Charged along with Cobb with criminal trespass and making
terroristic threats are Frank Anderson, a 41-year-old sawmill
worker, and Cobb's brother's stepson, Kenneth Royal, 26, a welder.
The three men are white.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson could not be reached for comment. Royal declined to
answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney John Parks, whose circuit includes Stewart
County, said it will be September at the earliest before he can
present the cases to a grand jury because the rural county holds
court only twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   The three suspects also could be prosecuted under the federal
hate crimes statute, although no federal charges have been filed to
date, said Pam Lightsey, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office
in Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Lightsey said she could neither confirm nor deny a federal
investigation into the incident. Several Richland residents said
they have been questioned by an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-collar neighborhood where the cross burning occurred is
just off a busy highway. The pale blue concrete block house Holmes
rented is directly across a narrow street from small houses that
Anderson and Royal rent.
</P>
<P>
   The short street seems safe enough. Children's colorful toys are
scattered in yards; laundry flaps from clothes lines.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb's son, Roy Jr., his wife, Sandi _ both ministers in the
Pentecostal Evangelical Church _ and their three pre-schoolers live
next door to Holmes. Sandi Cobb said she and Holmes were friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd invited her to come to Bible study at my house, and we'd
prayed together,'' she said. ``I was shocked when this happened. My
husband was, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the cross burning, Holmes has been staying with her
mother, Ingrid Jose; she is fearful, she said, of returning to the
mostly white neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-burning episode shocked everybody, black and white, in
rural Stewart County, said Sheriff Larry Jones, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like this has ever happened here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said he does not believe the Klan or other hate
groups were involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three arrested appeared to be drunk that night,'' Jones
said. ``If they hadn't been drinking, it probably never would have
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities found the remains of a rocking chair from which the
cross was made in Anderson's yard, the sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Stories conflict about a possible motive. The sheriff said he
was told the cross was burned to frighten Holmes away because
someone else wanted to rent her house. Others said Holmes had
late-night visitors who may have disturbed one of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Cross burnings are not rare, according to Mark Potok of the
Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., which counted more
than 200 cross-burning episodes nationwide between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the first cross was burned atop Stone Mountain, Ga., in
1915, the technique has become the best-known of the Klan's many
tactics of intimidation,'' Potok wrote in a recent article for the
center's Intelligence Report. ``Today, a cross is burned nearly
every week, most typically at the homes of interracial or black
families.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP will keep a close eye on the Stewart County case, said
Edward Dubose, district coordinator and Columbus branch president
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue we will follow all the way,'' he said. ``In
my opinion, this is about more than being drunk. This was a hate
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred in a part of Georgia plagued by poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart County ranks among the poorest in the state. Its
population, in steady decline since 1930, has dwindled to about
5,300 residents, more than two-thirds of whom are black. The
county's infant mortality and high school dropout rates are among
Georgia's highest.
</P>
<P>
   Area attractions include the Chattahoochee River, which forms
the county's western border before emptying into the giant Walter

   The senior Cobb said he has been ``humiliated'' by the charges
against him. He opened his checkbook and pointed out a $25 donation
he made to the NAACP on March 16, a month after the cross burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I do that if it's racial?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   That's a question many Richland residents are asking. Cobb, who
began his first term in January, owes his election and his
livelihood to blacks, said Holmes's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet you he didn't get 20 white votes,'' Rhine said. ``Most
of his customers are black.''
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks also considered Cobb a friend, Jose said. Before the
cross burning, she often stopped by his store just to sit and talk
to him, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Cobb is a highly respected businessman that black people
just loved,'' Jose said.``Just to think that he had something like
this in him is shocking. It is really shocking.''

 &HT;    Rocker reports `not true,' Expos say
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The trade rumor mill was in high gear Monday,
but judging by the reaction at spring camp, that's all it was.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports Monday that the Expos and Braves were on the
verge of a trade that would send closer John Rocker to Montreal for
closer Ugueth Urbina, who led the National League with 41 saves
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true, absolutely not true,'' Expos owner Jeffrey
Loria said. ``I've heard for weeks now about Rocker, Urbina. ...
There's nothing on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz also dismissed it,
saying, ``That's an old story. It's not even part of our camp.
We're concerned with how John's pitching and how our pitching staff
is coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 1, the day arbitrator Shyam Das reduced Rocker's
suspension and sent him to camp, Schuerholz acknowledged listening
to offers, but he wanted to give Rocker some time to prove he could
fit in well with the team following his angry slurs in Sports
Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz said Monday that he's satisfied, and pitcher Tom
Glavine said he is, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been fine,'' Glavine said. ``If it comes down to making
us a better team, that's one thing, but if you're doing it to
alleviate a problem ... I don't think that problem exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal players anonymously let their objections to a potential
Rocker trade be known when they photocopied an article on the
subject with a mug shot of Rocker from the Palm Beach Post, drew a
circle with a slash through it in red ink and posted copies around
their clubhouse. The Braves plan to keep him in extended spring
training for the first two weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if this spring had been normal, Rocker said:
``Absolutely. I see no difference except the difference that the
media has tried to make. If some outside person could walk into
this clubhouse, they would not know anything had happened ...''

`BLOODY SUNDAY' INVESTIGATION OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland _ An ambitious if belated attempt
to review one of the worst chapters in recent Irish history began
here Monday with the opening of a public inquiry into the killing
of 14 civil rights demonstrators by British paratroopers on what
became known as Bloody Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Coming 28 years after the event, the public tribunal opened as
the power-sharing government that brought Catholics and Protestants
into a new Northern Ireland administration remains suspended and
the political process lies stalled. Dissident paramilitary groups
are spoiling for a return to violence.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the tribunal began sitting in the city hall
Monday showed that part of the peace process is independent of
politics, and that it continues to forge ahead even as the
politicians bicker.
</P>
<P>
   If the refusal of the British government to acknowledge what its
soldiers did here on the streets of the Bogside neighborhood helped
fuel the Troubles that convulsed Northern Ireland for much of the
last 30 years, many hope that the attempt to right that wrong will
go a long way toward ending the conflict once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   The process will not be quick, however. The probe, which already
cost some $25 million, will last at least two more years.
</P>
<P>
   The original British investigation into what happened on Jan.
30, 1972, concluded that soldiers panicked and, believing they were
being shot at by militants of the Irish Republican Army, opened
fire on the demonstrators in the confusion. The soldiers were
officially exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   But most people here, and many international observers, have
maintained that the initial investigation was a whitewash, that
what happened on Bloody Sunday was cold-blooded murder by soldiers
who were whipped into a frenzy by their superiors and who carefully
targeted and shot unarmed Catholic nationalists. In all, 27 people
were shot that day, five of them in the back.
</P>
<P>
   The killings, the IRA's and the British government's response to
them, and the attempts by the British to portray the victims as
terrorists, rather than unarmed demonstrators, was a major turning
point in the Troubles. It polarized the two communities, escalated
the violence, and ended any chance that the dispute in Northern
Ireland would be addressed principally by a nonviolent campaign
modeled on the American civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA was flooded with recruits and stepped up its violent
campaign. The British tightened their grip, alienating many
innocent Catholics harassed in the crackdown. More than half of the
people killed during the Troubles died in the five years following
Bloody Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the annals of atrocities committed by the state against its
own people, Bloody Sunday takes its place alongside India's
Amritsa, South Africa's Sharpeville, Mexico's Tlateloco and
America's Kent State,'' British journalists Peter Pringle and
Philip Jacobson argue In their new book, ``Those Are Real Bullets,
Aren't They?.''
</P>
<P>
   The dry, lawyer-like language delivered in the sterile
surroundings of the Guildhall (city hall) did not capture how
viscerally the events of Bloody Sunday shaped this city and the
whole island.
</P>
<P>
   In a place where memories are long, and history is often wielded
as a weapon, the tribunal must do its work in the yawning gap
between two communities, one Protestant and loyal to the union with
Britain, the other Catholic and Irish nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, which began Monday and is expected to
last up to four weeks, the tribunal's chief counsel, Christopher
Clark, said the inquiry's job is to divine the truth from the two
diametrically opposed views of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeking the truth, not the truth as people see it, not
the truth as people would like it to be, but the truth pure and
simple. Those who have campaigned for so long to establish this
inquiry seek no more. Parliament, which set up this inquiry, seeks
no less. Without it, the many concerns which led to this inquiry
cannot be laid to rest,'' said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   On the 20th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, then Prime Minister
John Major of Britain acknowledged the victims were innocent. But
Major stopped short of an apology and rejected calls for a new
inquiry. But his successor, Tony Blair, ordered a fresh look, the
first time a British government ever reopened a public inquiry,
saying it was an essential part of the peace process. Blair
acknowledged the original Widgery Tribunal was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was established two years ago, the tribunal headed by
Lord Mark Saville, a senior British judge, has been gathering
evidence in private, interviewing nearly 1,500 witnesses. Clark
said investigators have traced witnesses down on every continent
except Antartica, ``from as far west as Nevada and as far east as
Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   By spending whatever time and money it takes to establish what
happened on Bloody Sunday, the British government seems willing to
compensate for its previous failings. And as Clark showed Monday,
the tribunal will try to put what happened in historical context.
The next two years will be part justice, part history lesson, all
of it hopefully cathartic.
</P>
<P>
   Potential witnesses include the famous and the powerful, such as
former Prime Minister Edward Heath and General Michael Jackson, who
led NATO troops into Kosovo last year and who was on the streets
with the paratroopers in Bogside 28 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the witnesses will be ordinary people like Kay
Duddy, whose 17-year-old brother Jackie was gunned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have ever wanted was the truth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Duddy and about 80 other relatives of the victims sat
in an area specially cordoned off for the families. They watched
stoically, many with their arms crossed, their body language
suggesting they will reserve judgment on the money and attention
being lavished on a review they fought 28 years for.
</P>
<P>
   The Guildhall has been transformed into a huge courtroom. The
proceedings are being broadcast on the screen of a nearby theater
that seats 900 people. Joining Lord Saville are two other judges,
William Hoyt of Canada and Sir Edward Somers of New Zealand, whose
international background is aimed at ensuring impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   There remain lingering disputes. The relatives are angry that
the soldiers who testify will enjoy anonymity and limited immunity.
The army maintains this is necessary for their safety, but the
relatives say this shows the preferential treatment still afforded
the army.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike South Africa, where the secrets of a brutal conflict
between the government and apartheid foes were catalogued by a
truth commission, there is no consensus here about the cathartic
value of exposing human rights abuses by paramilitary groups and
state forces.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland is still a divided society in which each side
tends to view the suffering of the other with a sense of
ambivalence, detachment, and even resentment. Gregory Campbell, a
leading hardline unionist here, says there should be inquiries into
slaughters of Protestants by the IRA.

   ACKLEY, Iowa _ Rising before dawn for Sunday chores, Darwin
Hoffmeister fed the pigs, checked the cows and mended a trampled
fence. But he could not tie his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmeister, a 50-year-old Iowa farmer, lost four fingers and
the use of his left arm in a combine accident five years ago, the
kind of injury that makes farming one of the nation's most
dangerous professions.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, being a farmer always meant being independent, able to
do whatever needs to be done,'' said Hoffmeister, a lanky,
soft-spoken man with a square jaw, as he looked down at the kitchen
floor and shook his head. ``Now I can't even handle a shovel or a
pitchfork.''
</P>
<P>
   But while such a disability would once have driven a farmer out
of business, Hoffmeister has been able to keep farming by modifying
his machinery and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of thousands of farmers in America with disabilities
who have triumphed over physical adversities, an achievement made
possible by technological advances and the changed nature of
farming, which today relies more on brain power and computer skills
than strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the accident, plenty of people offered to take over the
farm,'' said Hoffmeister, whose crops were harvested after the
accident by more than 50 neighbors who showed up at the farm,
offering their help. ``But farming is all I've ever done. And I
wanted to prove to myself that I could still do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has proved it. Hoffmeister still does about 90 percent of the
work on the farm, raising pigs, cows, corn and soy beans on a
400-acre spread of rolling land along a gravel road here in deepest
Iowa, about 40 miles west of Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   Terrible accidents have always been a familiar sorrow of farm
life. In a radius of no more than 20 miles from here, Hoffmeister
knows farmers who have lost an arm, broken a neck, seen both legs
severed below the knee. He now spends time talking on the telephone
to Iowa farmers who have recently suffered such injuries, just as
other farmers called to counsel him after the metal fan in the
combine forever changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Easter Seals, which runs a project intended to
help disabled farmers stay on the land, Hoffmeister changed the
ladders on his combine, put guard rails atop his grain bin and
adapted to a special hammer with a magnetic plate that holds a
nail. The charity also bought him a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the accident in October 1994, Hoffmeister had
noticed that the fan in the combine was clogged. He climbed down
from the cab in the darkness and stretched a hand into the
mechanical innards of the powerful machine, trying to sweep away
the excess grain. He was in too much of a hurry to shut off the
machine. The spinning metal fan caught his hand, crushed his
fingers, and then wildly rotated his arm like a windmill, before
knocking him backward 20 feet into a corn field, where he lay
covered in blood.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Darin, a junior in high school at the time, who was
driving a tractor behind him, ran to help his father. The teen-ager
fastened pliers around his father's bleeding arm for a makeshift
tourniquet, and then helped him to the kitchen of the farm house.
</P>
<P>
   An ambulance with sirens wailing soon rushed Hoffmeister to
Ellsworth Municipal Hospital in Iowa Falls, 13 miles away. Doctors
there fashioned a genuine tourniquet, but could do no more to help,
and sent him in an ambulance to Mercy Medical Center in Mason City,
another 45 miles down the highway.
</P>
<P>
   After being examined at Mercy, Hoffmeister was quickly
transported by helicopter to St. Mary's Hospital in Rochester,
Minn., part of the Mayo medical complex.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two weeks in St. Mary's, Hoffmeister went through
three operations, which included taking flesh and blood vessels
from other parts of his body to save the arm. In the end,
Hoffmeister's arm was saved, although it was virtually useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me I was going to get angry at God for letting
this happen to me,'' said Hoffmeister, a fifth-generation farmer.
``I never did. I just got mad at myself for being so stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, about 1,300 farmers a year are injured badly enough to
require a doctor's attention.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, special wheelchair lifts have been installed to
raise a farmer to the cab of a tractor or combine. Foot controls
are made workable by hands with special poles. Ladders with guard
rails are installed on grain bins. There are special hand tools for
people who are missing fingers or a hand, and even elastic
shoelaces, like the kind Hoffmeister uses, which tighten as they
are pulled and do not need to be tied in a knot.
</P>
<P>
   But the costs can be considerable. A wheelchair lift, for
example, costs $4,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   In Hoffmeister's case, difficulties on the farm after the
accident were worsened by a steep drop in hog prices. And he could
not qualify for disability payments as long as he held a
controlling interest in the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a purely financial standpoint,'' he said, ``we would have
been better off to sell the farm four or five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Now facing financial pressures, quite apart from his physical
disability, Hoffmeister has been forced to consider taking a second
job, off the farm. For a man who has never done anything but farm,
except for two years as a student at Ellsworth College 30 years
ago, it is a bitter pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down to take the aptitude test, and there are plenty of
things I'm able to do,'' Hoffmeister said, his voice breaking with
emotion. ``But in a rural area like this, you can't get more than
$6 or $7 an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone r who has watched the agriculture business steadily
move into the hands of big corporations, Hoffmeister has written
editorials for farm journals expressing frustration over the plight
of the farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our small towns, churches and schools are quickly
disappearing,'' he wrote in a recent issue of Iowa Farmer Today.
``Have we stood by too long? Am I beating a dead horse? Does anyone
really care?''
</P>
<P>
   Darin Hoffmeister, 22, who had intended to join his father on
the farm, has decided instead to become a high school math teacher.
The young man said he knew he could never make a decent living on a
modest farm.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffmeister wonders how much the terrible accident, and the
anguish of seeing his father battered by the combine, had to do
with turning his son away from farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, Darin had a hard time going near the
combine,'' Hoffmeister said. ``He said it smelled like blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury has left Hoffmeister a changed man in many everyday
ways. He can wheel a car around the farm, but whenever he goes to a
city, his wife, Rhonda, 47, must drive.

<P>
   Sitting on the passenger side, Hoffmeister said, is ``not a very
macho thing'' for a farmer who always felt in control.
</P>
<P>
   When he goes out in public, Hoffmeister says he feels
self-conscious about people staring at his withered arm, which
hangs rigidly from the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He has severe bouts of phantom pain, feeling his deadened arm
being crushed and burned, a sensation so overpowering that he paces
in circles around the kitchen table until it passes.
</P>
<P>
   A confident and easygoing man at one time, Hoffmeister said he
now has terrible cases of nerves. He quit teaching Sunday school at
the old country church outside Ackley, he said, because standing in
front of a group of people, even children, made him too
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   But he still gets up early every morning and goes out to the
barns and fields. He pulls four white tube socks over his left hand
to guard against frostbite and scratches, since his arm and hand
cannot feel anything, even when he has scraped against barbed wire
and blood is trickling down.
</P>
<P>
   He tries to remain stoic, reminds himself that plenty of people
have it worse, and keeps the faith that maybe, someday soon, corn
and bean prices will finally rise to profitable levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You accept what you are given in life,'' he said, ``and hope
that it somehow makes you stronger in the end.''  &QL;

<P>
   As the oil ministers met in Vienna, Austria, there was great
concern about whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries would give the rest of the world a break and do something
to restrain high oil prices. Reporters were hanging on every word
from the ministers, some of whom had felt intense American
diplomatic pressure. Iran took a militant position, while Saudi
Arabia was more accommodative, and the meeting was extended as
agreement proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
   So it was nearly 20 years ago, when OPEC met in the fall of
1980. And so it was Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But there are important differences between then and now. Then,
inflation was widely feared in the developed world, and it was
believed that oil prices were sure to continue rising for years to
come. Then, widespread efforts at energy conservation were having
an effect, and oil companies were intensifying their search for new
oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   Now all those factors have changed. Complacency has replaced
urgency on Main Street, on Capitol Hill and in the executive suites
of major oil companies. All expect prices to fall, and therefore
see little need for action.
</P>
<P>
   In part those changes reflect the way the world economy has
changed in the intervening years. Oil is less important to economic
growth in the Information Age than it once was, and inflation has
declined dramatically. We have seen that cartels are very hard to
hold together, and that widespread cheating on oil production
quotas has often made it very hard for oil exporters to keep prices
up.
</P>
<P>
   But while many things have changed, the fact is that relatively
high oil prices have persisted many months longer than the experts
forecast, and they could continue to do so _ particularly if there
continues to be little indication of a determination to act to
fight high prices.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, four things helped to end the era of high oil
prices. Recessions and sluggish growth in the developed world
helped to reduce demand. So did energy conservation efforts,
including government-mandated fuel economy standards. The world's
energy companies spent heavily to find new oil supplies and to seek
alternative sources of energy. And oil producers cheated on their
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, only one is still around. There is reported to be
cheating on the OPEC quotas, of around 1 million to 1.5 million
barrels a day. So far efforts to agree on a quota increase have
failed, although some agreement is expected Tuesday. Whether or not
cheating will increase in coming months, assuming there is a deal,
will be a subject of widespread speculation.
</P>
<P>
   But the other factors are all gone. In 1980, oil companies were
earning profits that one politician called obscene and their share
prices reflected wild enthusiasm. Drilling for oil was going on at
a formidable rate, with 3,099 oil rigs operating in this country,
according to figures from Baker Hughes. Now oil profits are also
good, but share prices have shown little strength, in large part
because it is generally believed that the profits will fade as oil
prices inevitably fall.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the lesson that the oil companies have learned from
recent history is that they would be foolish to ramp up their
exploration efforts. They did that in 1997, when oil prices were
above $20 a barrel, only to suffer when prices plunged. Exploration
budgets are being held down across most of the industry. Budgets
are up a bit from 1999, but ``we're well below the 1998 level of
spending,'' said Frederick P. Leuffer, an oil analyst at Bear,
Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. rig count, at 768, is less than it was in the summer of
1998, when oil prices were half what they are today. But the
companies are announcing large repurchases of their own shares, and
some are expected to raise shareholder dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the atmospheric difference greater than in
Washington. In 1980, there was debate about raising gasoline taxes
and taking other steps to limit demand for gasoline. In fact, by
then the rising price of gasoline had prompted Americans to search
for vehicles with better fuel economy. Now, Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., the majority leader, is suggesting that federal gasoline
taxes be temporarily removed, the better to ease the pain for
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   That pain is real, but so far it has not done much to affect
consumer behavior. In a booming economy, most motorists are willing
to spend more rather than move to more fuel-efficient vehicles.
Sport utility vehicles, which are far from fuel efficient, now make
up 17 percent of total sales of cars and light trucks, up from
under 2 percent in 1980. The average fuel economy of cars and light
trucks sold in the 1981 model year was 24.1 miles a gallon. In the
1999 model year, the latest for which figures are available, it was
23.8.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices now are about 25 cents a gallon higher than they
were in September 1980. But those figures are not adjusted for
inflation, and in real terms the price of gasoline is far lower.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, when oil climbed above $24 a barrel, there was
virtual unanimity that the price could not hold. The futures market
forecast that oil prices would fall 13 percent within six months.
Instead, they rose, peaking above $34 earlier this month before
coming down to $27.79 Monday, on expectations that the OPEC meeting
would raise production. But one thing has not changed much. Prices
are now expected to fall 11 percent over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices went up for a variety of reasons. Weather was part of
the story, as was economic strength. So too was a widespread belief
that prices would come down due to OPEC cheating. That left the
entire industry, from international companies down to neighborhood
fuel oil dealers, hesitant to maintain high inventories that were
likely to decline in value. When things did not go as expected,
those low inventories accelerated the price rise.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, it is in the interests of Saudi Arabia in
particular to avoid letting oil get so expensive that it stimulates
the search for alternative fuels and leads consuming countries to
slash their demand. But for now, there is no sign that either is
about to happen. As a result, oil prices could stay relatively high
far longer than most experts anticipate.

WITH THE POPE GONE, ISRAEL RETURNS TO POLITICS-AS-USUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change `karma' to `aura' in lead; to delete last two
words, in peacemaking, from 5th graf; to delete all of 23rd graf,
`Barak issued ... mutual respect.')  
(HLW) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ And so Pope John Paul II flew away and took his
positive aura with him. This is how the morning after looked in
Israel: diminished prospects for peace with Syria, the opening of a
politically explosive criminal investigation into a leading rabbi,
and five separate parliament votes of no confidence in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's visit did produce a salutary ripple, though, buoying
the Israeli government's image internationally, the Israeli
public's state of mind and Prime Minister Ehud Barak's political
stature, at least temporarily. This afforded something of a cushion
when they fell back to earth from their pope-inspired contemplation
of the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   The first blow came on Sunday night, hours after the pope
boarded an El Al plane to return to the Vatican. Despite high
expectations, President Clinton failed to revive the Israeli-Syrian
peace talks in a Geneva summit meeting with Hafez Assad, the
president of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction here on Monday ranged from dire pessimism, which
included anxieties about another flare-up in the war zone in
southern Lebanon, to a kind of forced hopefulness that this was
just another disappointment that could be overcome. The
middle-of-the-road position was the glum assessment by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's security adviser, Danny Yatom, that it was
hard to imagine junior-level diplomats bridging gaps after the two
presidents failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel and Syria traded blame for who was at fault,
Israelis, including the left, believe that Barak had made it clear
that he wanted to make a deal and was willing to make significant
concessions. Some here said that in contrast to the past, Israeli
intransigence could not be blamed this time for derailing a peace
effort. Israelis, from right to left, increasingly believe that
Assad is so reluctant as to be an untrustworthy partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you make a peace agreement, each side has to climb inside
the skin of the other side and try to understand him,'' said Matan
Vilnai, a Cabinet minister and a dovish former general. ``President
Assad still does not do this. In the end, because our interest
remains strong, we will get to this,'' to peace. ``But maybe it
won't be with President Assad.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barak has pledged to withdraw Israeli troops from
southern Lebanon by July, and he hoped to do so as part of a peace
agreement with Syria. So the highest-ranking military official on
Monday urged the government not to abandon efforts to find a way
back to the negotiating table. The fear is that Syria, the power
broker in Lebanon, will sabotage an Israeli withdrawal by fostering
violent attacks in southern Lebanon or into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to seal the issue and say it's over,'' said Lt.
Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the army chief-of-staff, uncharacteristically
venturing an assessment about a diplomatic issue. ``It's possible
it will still change. Everyone in Israel and especially in the army
would prefer leaving Lebanon within the context of an agreement.
And from Israel's point of view, the door is still open'' to Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Although the possibility of violent confrontation is unpleasant,
Barak might draw temporary political advantage from the failed
summit meeting. It is now difficult for him to be portrayed by the
opposition as willing to sell out Israel for a deal; while
flexible, he clearly was making some demands that Syria was
unwilling to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky, the interior minister, who has said his Russian
immigrant party will leave the government if Barak returns the
Golan Heights to Syria, on Monday complimented the prime minister
for not ``giving in'' to Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Barak now has some breathing room, diplomatically and
politically, to focus on the Palestinian peace track, and to tackle
intense political disharmony within his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, his most balky coalition partner,
loses a lot of its potential power if a deal with Syria and a
national referendum on a deal is not imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs Shas as his ally going into a national vote on his
peace efforts. Shas' value, relative to the trouble it causes,
momentarily decreases if such a vote is not on the immediate
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   That might explain why political chaos did not immediately
follow Monday morning's decision by the attorney general to open a
criminal investigation into Shas' spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef. The Torah sages who guide Shas' 17-member delegation in
Parliament, Israel's third largest, decided Monday night not to
bolt the government _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of Shas supporters gathered outside Yosef's home
in Jerusalem. The rabbi addressed them from behind bars covering a
window, leading them in singing, ``Please oh Lord redeem us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yosef, who is seen as a political kingmaker in Israel, is being
investigated because of a recent sermon in which he issued a
blistering attack _ including a curse _ on the leftist education
minister, Yossi Sarid. In the sermon, which was broadcast to his
followers, he described Sarid as Satan, said his name and memory
should be obliterated, and said that just as God ``extirpated
Amalek,'' the biblical tribe that attacked the Israelites after
their exodus from Egypt, ``so may he extirpate'' Sarid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance will be visited upon him,'' the rabbi said, ``just
like vengeance was visited upon Haman,'' the ancient Persian enemy
of the Jews whose death by hanging is celebrated in the festival of
Purim.
</P>
<P>
   Yosef will be investigated on charges of ``praising or
encouraging violence that could lead to death or injury,''
insulting a public employee and slander.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining his decision to open the investigation, the
attorney general, Elyakim Rubenstein, noted that he had declined to
do that last year after the rabbi insulted Supreme Court judges.
Among other things, Yosef had said that the judges ``fornicated
with impure'' or menstruating, women, which is proscribed in a
strict interpretation of Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sensitive issue,'' the attorney general said,
``primarily because we exhibit self-restraint in using a criminal
tool in a case of expression because of the special status of the
freedom of speech. Naturally, the status of Ovadia as a leading
Torah scholar and as the spiritual leader and political
decision-maker of a large political party, also did not make the
decision any easier, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rubenstein said the rabbi's statements could be heard by his
followers as an incitement to violence against Sarid, whether he
intended them that way or not. ``What is the meaning of the
vengeance that is to be visited upon Sarid, heaven forbid?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Given the political sensitivity, the police asked Rubenstein to
delay announcing his decision until after the pope left. They have
increased security around the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the right decision,'' said Sarid, who has been feuding
with Shas over the reorganization of their large, indebted
religious school system.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Yishai, Shas' leader, decried the investigation as
``racist'' and ``anti-religious,'' since it singled out the leader
of a movement representing ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Jews of Middle
Eastern origin. He noted that the rabbi had clarified his sermon,
and specifically instructed his followers not to resort to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the parliament, there is a tendency to use extreme measures,
like votes of no confidence in the government, to make political
points. Among Monday's five motions, the most serious one attacked
Barak's presumed intent to give away neighborhoods abutting
Jerusalem to the Palestinians and his policy on Jerusalem in
general. All five motions failed.

PUTIN, DECLARED VICTOR, HINTS AT NEW MANDATE 
</HEADLINE>
 ELECTION-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Newly elected President Vladimir V. Putin has decided
that the best model for Russia is Korea, went the joke making the
rounds Monday in Moscow: ``He just hasn't decided which Korea _
north or south.''
</P>
<P>
   That joke, as Russian political humor tends to do, got to the
heart of the question that hung in the air as Putin's election
victory was declared official.
</P>
<P>
   Putin wants to strengthen the Russian state _ this is one clear
message that has come out of the former KGB agent's deliberately
vague campaign. But will it be the kind of strong state that
establishes an orderly economic and political system and clamps
down on corruption, or will it be the kind of strong state that
uses police power and repression to shut down dissent and control
every aspect of life?
</P>
<P>
   Neither, Russian and US analysts said. If anything, Putin's
Russia looks in many ways like that of his predecessor, Boris N.
Yeltsin, but with teeth. They suggested that Putin's main focus in
the coming weeks would be using his new mandate to consolidate his
control over Russia's power structures. They predicted a power
struggle between Putin on the one hand, and financial and regional
elites on the other, for control of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts doubted that Putin's plans were so far-reaching as to
include streamlining Russia's bloated bureaucracy, combatting
rampant bribe-taking, and encouraging an independent court system.
Instead, they predicted an anticorruption campaign whose true goal
is to reduce the influence of Putin's rivals for power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin's in-house definition of a strong state is a state where
all the other players are weaker than his administration,'' said
Boris Makarenko, an analyst at the Center for Political
Technologies, an independent Moscow think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Putin on Monday gave few overt clues about his plans, saying
only that ``a lot of things that will lead to many controversiesneed to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's body language spoke volumes. The president-elect's
first public appearance was at an annual celebration of Russia's
Interior Ministry army, the same troops who are fighting Putin's
campaign against separatists in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In familiar surroundings, Putin repeated the theme that got him
elected: The military could, and would, defeat the rebels who had
humiliated Russia in 1996 by driving federal troops out of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the campaign in Chechnya is beginning to look
like a quagmire. On Monday, Russian jets were again bombing parts
of the republic thought to be cleared of rebels for good. For most
Russians, Chechnya is a success that demonstrates Putin's resolve
and decisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble, analysts say, is that as the only clear
accomplishment of Putin's six months in power, first as prime
minister and since New Year's as acting president, Chechnya does
not provide a good example of a revitalized state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin managed to produce success in Chechnya by using military
force and police methods to suppress a rebellion, by giving
commands and having the people to carry out his orders,'' said
Timothy J. Colton, director of Harvard University's Davis Center
for Russian studies. ``The problem is these methods are not going
to reform the economy. He cannot conduct reform by giving commands.
He's not going to solve problems by the same methods he used to
crush'' the Chechen rebels, Colton said.
</P>
<P>
   Does Putin understand that? One of his first moves Monday may
provide a glimpse. Putin ordered his interim government to pay back
wages to state workers by April 15. This is a popular move that
looks decisive, like bombing Chechnya. But it does not get at the
heart of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Wage arrears in Russia are caused by large, fundamentally
ineffective factories that cannot keep up with their payments
because they themselves are owed money. Usually, the biggest debtor
is the state, which is unable to pay its bills because of
widespread tax evasion and misallocation of state funds. Yeltsin
got into the habit of periodically ordering the state to pay off
these back wages, essentially earning political capital by bailing
out factory directors. This gave the directors an incentive to
avoid paying wages since they knew the state would bail them out
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's order indicates he is choosing, in the short run,
Yeltsin's tactic, rather than the difficult steps _ closing
factories, cutting out waste, retraining workers _ that would
relieve the underlying crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It was Yeltsin who once said that the Russian state is ``too
weak where it should be strong and too strong where it should be
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Meddlesome bureaucrats have too much power over small
businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and independent media.
Instead of providing essential services and public order, ``the
people who make up the state see their positions as means for
personal agrandizement,'' said Fritz Ermarth, a former analyst on
Russia for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has promised to clean up this system, but he himself is a
product of it. His career as a bureaucrat in St. Petersburg's local
government in the early 1990s was blackened by questionable
financial deals. More recently, as head of the FSB, the KGB's
domestic successor, Putin pressed treason charges against
environmentalists who have reported on the ecological dangers posed
by nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   Russian journalists who have reported on Putin's alleged links
to corruption, or criticized the campaign in Chechnya, say they
have been subjected to harassment. The evidence is not damning
enough to predict outright that Putin will embark on a campaign to
crack down on dissent, but the signs are not encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of whether Putin has any motivation
to change the system. The main issue is the role of the so-called
``oligarchs,'' business moguls who have exerted heavy influence on
government policy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia right now, the state is the oligarchs,'' said Boris
Nemtsov, a former Cabinet minister and a leader of Russia's small
liberal movement. ``For me, a strong state means the rule of law,
less bureaucacy, and independent courts. If Putin wants to create a
strong state in the terms that I understand it, he needs to
separate (the state from the oligarchs), but I don't know if he has
the strength to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's advisers had suggested that a big victory would give him
the mandate to rout the oligarchs. But with 95.5 percent of the
vote counted, Putin had won 52.6 percent. This was more than the
simple majority needed for an outright victory, but a disappointing
tally for a candidate whose favorability rating topped 70 percent
in January. It may affect his ability to push for change, if that's
what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big setback for Putin,'' said Michael McFaul, a
Stanford University professor and Russia expert. ``It emboldens the
oligarchs and the regional elites.
</P>
<P>
   McFaul said if Putin's popularity should suffer, he may soon
find himself forced to compromise on policy and personnel, as
Yeltsin often did.

 &HT;    Education tops candidates' agendas
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush will be in Virginia today to talk
about education. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, Bush was at Little Rock's historic Central High
School, where he called education ``the next frontier of civil
rights.'' Al Gore, meanwhile, was at a Michigan middle school,
where he participated in drama exercises, wolfed down pizza in the
school cafeteria and proclaimed that there is ``no higher
priority'' than education.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in recent memory, education is at the top of
the agenda in a presidential campaign. Both Bush and Gore seem to
care passionately about the issue, and each has offered a detailed
plan for improving the nation's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the candidates' interest also is rooted in political
reality: Polls consistently show that education ranks near the top
of voters' concerns. It particularly resonates with married women,
the so-called ``soccer moms'' who were critical to Clinton's
victories. If Bush can win over the soccer moms, he might be able
to close the ``gender gap'' that the Democrats have enjoyed in
recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   But he is banking on an issue that is inherently problematic for
a Republican running for president. The federal government has a
limited role in education, and the GOP in particular has resisted
efforts to centralize a system that is based largely on state and
local control. As recently as 1995, Republicans in Congress were
calling for the elimination of the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who have been less squeamish about federal
involvement and more apt to spend federal money on education
programs, have long viewed the issue as a political strength. Polls
have consistently shown that people trust Democrats more than
Republicans on education.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Bush was evident last Friday at Central High
School. Bush repeated his calls for higher standards and greater
accountability, but the Central High principal was looking for
something more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government can be more than a cheerleader,'' said
Rudolph Howard. ``I want something very tangible in place that
would be encouraging for those of us who have to carry the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   At various points along the campaign trail, Bush himself has
highlighted the limits of presidential influence on education. At a
South Carolina town meeting, he advised a high school student to
``write your governor'' when she asked what could be done about the
state's low scores on college entrance exams. More than once, Bush
has said that he's ``not running for national superintendent of
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Bill Clinton was able to neutralize welfare and
crime as Republican strengths, Bush clearly believes he can seize
education for the GOP. He may be making some headway: A recent Pew
Research Center survey found that on education, voters had slightly
more confidence in Bush than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Education also is a big part of Bush's efforts to portray
himself as a ``compassionate conservative'' who is closer to the
center than some of the firebrand Republicans in Congress. At
Central High, where in 1957 President Dwight Eisenhower deployed
federal troops to integrate the school, Bush tied education
improvements to the civil rights struggles of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access is universal, but excellence is not. All can enter our
schools, but not all are learning,'' Bush said. ``There is a
tremendous gap of achievement between rich and poor, white and
minority. This, too, leaves a divided society. And whatever the
cause, the effect is discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   In emphasizing education, Bush is playing to a strength: He has
a solid record to run on. During his five years as governor, the
state's schoolchildren _ and especially minority students _ have
made significant gains on national tests.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush must share the credit for Texas' successes.
Some of the state's most critical education reforms, such as
smaller class sizes and a revamped school finance system, predated
Bush. He didn't initiate standardized testing or the state's
vaunted accountability system, either, though he has supported and
toughened both.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did push for legislation that stiffened academic standards;
helped pass a $32 million reading initiative; and followed through
on his promise to end social promotion, the practice of passing
failing students to keep them with their peers. Armed with his
Texas record, Bush is better prepared for an education fight with
the Democrats than other recent GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bush's plan, schools that get money from the federal Title
I program, which targets schools with high numbers of low-income
students, would have to annually test those students on basic
academic skills. If the low scores persisted after three years, the
Title I money _ about $1,500 per student _ would be given to
parents for tutoring or transfer to other schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also would combine dozens of federal aid programs into
block grants and give states more flexibility on how to use the
money. He would push for national standards at certain grade
levels, allowing states to devise their own tests to determine
whether they are met. Bush also promises to make reading readiness
a bigger part of Head Start, and offer federal loan guarantees for
the building of charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   In total, his education plan would cost about $1.1 billion over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Gore's education plan would cost roughly $115
billion over 10 years. He promises to attract better teachers by
raising salaries and offering scholarships and grants. New teachers
would have to prove their qualifications to teach their subjects,
and the renewal of their licenses would be subject to periodic peer
review.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce class sizes and refurbish rundown schools, Gore would
cover the interest on $25 billion in bonds issued by local
communities for school construction. He also promises to make Head
Start universally available.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Wilkins of the Education Trust, an education reform group in
Washington, said Bush and Gore each are about half right.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``really does talk a very good game about accountability.
We're glad he's talking about ratcheting it up and bringing it to
the federal level,'' she said. Wilkins used to work for the
Democratic National Committee, so the Bush campaign hasn't been
bashful about publicizing her praise of his plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But (Bush) is not talking about putting the resources in,''
she continued. ``They've both got half the loaf: Bush (proposing)
more money would get him into trouble with his right wing. Gore
saying more accountability would get him in trouble with his left
wing. And kids are getting lost in the sauce.''

GORE DEFENDS HIS ROLE IN FUND-RAISING EXCESSES
</HEADLINE>
   (See also GORE-REACT) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE, Wis. _ Even as he outlined a plan to revamp the
campaign finance system, Vice President Al Gore on Monday
strenuously defended his role in the fund-raising excesses of the
1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted that he and other Democrats had to ``push the system
to the breaking point'' to defend core Democratic programs and
values against a Republican assault.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the offensive on an issue that many Republicans consider
his greatest weakness, Gore used a 40-minute speech at Marquette
University to introduce his proposed endowment fund to finance
congressional campaigns, to appeal to independent voters and to
slash at what he called the phony reforms of his Republican rival,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Gore tried to shore up his credentials as a
reformer. Besides explaining his actions in 1996, he invoked the
efforts of his father to overhaul campaign finance when he was a
senator from Tennessee in the 1950s and noted the campaign finance
legislation he himself had sponsored in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore argued that in 1996 he was faced with a choice of
``unilaterally'' disarming by not aggressively raising money _
thereby ceding the election to Republicans _ or playing the
fund-raising game with equal ferocity in order to protect
Democratic policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are millions of people out there who depend on those who
care about the public interests to fight for them, and not to
abandon the field of battle,'' Gore said. ``Millions who would be
the ones hurt most if advocates for the public interest
unilaterally disarmed and left the field of battle to those who
oppose both the public interest and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the choice I felt I faced in 1996,'' he continued.
``It was a battle to defend Medicare from deep cuts, to preserve
our national commitment to education, to prevent our environmental
laws from being rewritten by the big polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush expressed skepticism on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any promise to reform our campaign finance system will ring
hollow unless it is grounded in credibility, credibility based on
consistency, integrity and disclosure,'' Bush said in a statement.
``We need an attorney general, a president and a vice president who
will live by and enforce the laws we currently have on the books.
Unless the vice president stops withholding information about his
own fund-raising excesses, the American people will question his
commitment to reforming the fund-raising practices of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, whose calls for campaign finance
reform fueled his run against Bush, said on Monday that both
candidates have flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Gore, McCain said, ``He does have a credibility
problem that's very large, but so does Governor Bush.'' Bush ``has
not proposed a credible plan, of course not, everyone knows that,''
McCain added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did not directly refer to the actions that have sparked so
much criticism against him: his appearance at a 1996 fund-raiser at
a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles and his phone calls from the White
House soliciting campaign contributions. The Justice Department
reviewed those incidents, and Attorney General Janet Reno had
determined that there was not enough evidence to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Maria Hsia, a friend of Gore, was convicted of
violating federal laws relating to her role in organizing the
Buddhist temple event.
</P>
<P>
   Those actions have also come under scrutiny by congressional
Republicans and have drawn criticism from advocates for campaign
finance reform, including some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Though the vice president defended his 1996 actions largely on
partisan grounds, he repeatedly appealed on Monday to independent
voters who, polls have shown, favor campaign finance reform and who
fueled the insurgent campaigns of Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota;
former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival in the Democratic primaries,
and, particularly McCain. Gore warmly praised each of those men at
least once on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He called Bradley a friend, a word Bradley had refrained from
using in describing Gore, and in one breath praised both Bradley
and McCain for helping ``to put this issue at the forefront of this
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said his first act as president would be to
send to Congress legislation co-sponsored by McCain to ban
so-called soft money, the unlimited contributions to political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who has co-sponsored
the soft money bill with McCain, went further in trying to wrap the
vice president in McCain's reform mantle.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, John McCain's success was a public referendum on
political reform,'' Feingold said on Monday in introducing Gore.
``John has made it clear to me that he is returning to the Senate
and renewing the fight for true campaign finance reform. But he
does so with the strong support of only one of the two remaining
presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore repeatedly attacked Bush's campaign finance proposals, and
ridiculed the governor's claim to be a ``reformer with results.''
``Governor Bush talks a lot about being an outsider,'' Gore said.
``But being an outsider is about more than where you live; it's
about who you're fighting for. Believe it or not, Governor Bush
wants to open the floodgates even wider to special interest donors
and big money. That's not just defending the status quo, it's
setting it in stone.''

 &HT;    Lewis still Ravens' pick
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Baltimore Ravens coach Brian Billick said
Monday that the uncertainty over All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis won't
affect the team's strategy in next month's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who led the league in tackles last season, is scheduled
to stand trial in May for the Jan. 31 murders of two men outside an
Atlanta nightclub. He is free on $1 million bail and participating
in the team's voluntary conditioning program in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens have two first-round picks in the April 15-16 draft,
including the fifth choice, which they acquired from the Falcons in
a trade last year. Billick said the team probably will address
concerns at running back and receiver with the two, Nos. 5 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take a linebacker at any position, and if anybody
construes that as us not having faith in Ray Lewis being with us
this fall, it would be a mistake,'' Billick said at the NFL owners
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to move along and take the best player
available,'' he said. ``We'll let this process play itself out with
Ray, and we'll have faith that he'll be with us this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Billick, the former Minnesota Vikings offensive coordinator, is
one of three head coaches scheduled to participate in a Wednesday
discussion about off-field violence. Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy and
Seattle's Mike Holmgren also will participate in the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a stage where we need to be careful,'' Dungy said.
``We don't need to turn people off. Not everybody gets to do what
we do. I think it's a privilege to work and play in the NFL. We
can't jeopardize our integrity and popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens could draft a middle linebacker after the first
round. Brigham Young's Rob Morris could be the only player drafted
at the position during the first round, but Arizona's Marcus Bell
and Penn State's Brandon Short could be chosen in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Billick said the Ravens are close to finishing a new contract
for receiver Qadry Ismail, an unrestricted free agent who rejected
the team's last offer of a four-year, $8 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   If Ismail re-signs, the Ravens might be inclined to draft a
running back with the fifth pick, possibly Virginia's Thomas Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running back and wide receiver positions have a lot of
potential (in the draft),'' Billick said. ``That's the good thing
about where we're at. If we say we're going to take a receiver at
fifth, then there will probably be a good running back available at
No. 15.''

TROUBLE AT THE PUMP

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of a new series of TV ads made by Epinion.com _ which allows
consumers to check out the opinions of other consumers on 100,000
products _ featured a woman using a breast pump. She is wearing a
blouse; unlike the parade of actresses whose assets were displayed
during the Oscar ceremonies on Sunday, March 26, nothing of her
breast shows.
</P>
<P>
   KGO-TV in San Francisco, the same station that broadcast the
Oscars, was one of several stations around the country that have
refused to run it. Epinion co-founder  &UR; Mike Speiser  &LR; told Personals
that the station told him that the image was ``offensive'' and
``disrespectful.'' KGO didn't return calls asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The La Leche League, which promotes and advocates
breast-feeding, jumped into the fray. ``Our society needs to change
how it looks at nursing women. The breast was made to feed a
nursing baby, not to sell beer or other products, as is often the
case with advertising,'' said  &UR; Kim Cavaliero &LR;  of the league.
</P>
<P>
   The company must have known the ads would be controversial,
however, when that particular product _ one among 100,000 _ was
chosen to be featured.
</P>

reveals that fluids can go in (got milk?) but can't go out, with
the exception of tears and sweat in ads for athletic equipment.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the last 40,000 years, as anatomically modern but primitive
hunters spread around the world, species after species of big
animal vanished from the earth in their wake. ``Blitzkrieg'' has
long been scientists' favorite image for these spasms of biological
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere, perhaps, was the extinction more striking than in New
Zealand, where an entire class of large flightless birds called
moas, 11 species and an estimated 160,000 individuals in all, once
lived. New evidence now suggests that it may have been the most
rapid extinction ever brought about by primitive people.
</P>
<P>
   Some moas were about as big as turkeys, but others were awesome
ostrichlike creatures, the largest weighing more than 500 pounds
and standing 10 feet tall. Skeletons show that they were built
remarkably like some dinosaurs. They had never encountered anything
like the stone-age Polynesians who colonized their islands in the
late 13th century, and the big birds presumably had no fear of
them; a hunter probably could have just walked up and killed one at
will.
</P>
<P>
   So by the time the ship of British explorer James Cook first
brought Europeans to New Zealand in 1769, every last one was gone.
The conventional view has been that the Polynesians, ancestors of
today's Maori people, hunted and otherwise drove the moas to
extinction in a thousand years or so.
</P>
<P>
   But now scientists say evidence from the early Polynesian
settlements, plus new calculations based largely on the birds'
reproduction profile, indicate that on the scale of geological
time, the extinction was lightninglike, requiring 160 years at most
and, probably, considerably less. The scientists say the
destruction of the moas, by club and snare, was the fastest
extinction of big animals _ what scientists call megafauna _ so
far.
</P>
<P>
   It was apparently even more rapid than the swift rate at which
some scientists believe large creatures like mammoths, mastodons,
camels, ground sloths and giant beavers were exterminated by
prehistoric hunters in a North American blitzkrieg about 13,000
years ago. The cause of those extinctions has been hotly debated
and remains unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   The extermination of the moas ``is probably the clearest
instance of the extinction of a whole fauna of large animals'' in a
short time by hunter-gatherers, said Dr. Richard N. Holdaway, the
chief author of the new study, which appears in the current issue
of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   A paleobiologist specializing in the biology of extinctions,
Holdaway runs a private research company called Palaeocol Research
in Christchurch, New Zealand. His co-researcher was Chris Jacomb,
curator of archaeology at the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch.
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions, experts say, large-scale extinction of big
animals generally coincided with the arrival of early modern humans
in places where they had never been. This did not happen in Africa,
they theorize, because people and other animals evolved there
together, and African animals were therefore not so naive about
humans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most rapid extinctions was in North America, where
not just big plant-eaters but also the predators that depended on
them _ including saber-toothed cats, short-faced bears, cheetahs,
maned lions and bigger versions of today's wolves _ are believed to
have vanished in perhaps 400 years.
</P>
<P>
   Three possible causes have been advanced for this extinction
episode. Two are related to the blitzkrieg hypothesis: that humans
swept across the continent from Siberia in a ``killing front'' that
moved perhaps 100 miles in a decade, and that the animals were
killed by diseases carried by people and their dogs from Siberia.
The third hypothesis says that rapid climate change played the
critical role.
</P>
<P>
   For New Zealand, Madagascar and many Pacific islands, few would
deny that the first arriving humans caused mass extinction, said
Dr. Jared Diamond, an ecologist at the University of California at
Los Angeles, who wrote a commentary on the new study in Science.
The only questions, he said, are how fast the extinctions were and
whether hunting was the only cause. For New Zealand, he said, the
new study ``shows that moa extinctions were very fast and were
mainly by hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several lines of evidence have led to this conclusion. First,
based on revised radiocarbon dating of charcoal and other materials
in campsites of the Maori ancestors, the earliest arrival of
Polynesians in New Zealand has now been placed in the 13th century
rather than 1,000 years ago, as previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Second, archaeological analysis of the dismembered remains of
moas in the campsites indicate that none were killed after the 14th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Now Holdaway and Jacomb have calculated the likely rate at which
the moas disappeared. The moas' reproductive profile was a key to
the analysis: They were long-lived and slow to mature and breed.
They laid only one or two eggs at a time and raised perhaps one
chick a year. If they were killed at even a low rate, they would
not be able to reproduce fast enough to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   In their calculations, Holdaway and Jacomb assumed
conservatively that the first Polynesian colonists numbered only
100 people, that their population grew at only 1 percent a year,
that they did not eat moa eggs or destroy moa habitat and that they
killed only one female per week per 20 people. Even so, the time to
extinction was no more than 160 years. Less conservative
assumptions _ and more likely ones, in Diamond's view _ yielded
even shorter times to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``no way of interpreting this record other than that it
had to happen virtually overnight,'' said Dr. Ross MacPhee, a
mammalogist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York,
who has extensively studied ancient extinctions. Further, he said,
the evidence makes a ``really very impressive'' case for hunting as
the prime cause. If that is true, he said, ``this is easily the
best instance of overkill, of blitzkrieg, on the record.''
</P>
<P>
   But MacPhee has long found it hard to believe that in general, a
few hunters with primitive weapons could wipe out entire species,
and he is the leading proponent of the idea that disease was mainly
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed skepticism that New Zealand's early hunters could
have tracked down every member of every moa species, especially the
smaller ones and those that might have lived in hard-to-get-at
places in the islands' rugged mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he suggested, it would have been harder and more
time-consuming to find moas as their numbers diminished; and as the
more favored bigger birds disappeared, the hunters would have
abandoned the chase as not worth the effort. ``At the end of the
moas' tenure in New Zealand, people would have been doing virtually
nothing else'' than hunting them, he said. It is more likely, he
said, that the people turned to other food sources, like seals and
seafood, before all the moas were gone.
</P>
<P>
   The point is illustrated by a smaller, well-known survivor of
the New Zealand blitzkrieg, a small flightless bird that has a low
reproduction rate but is hard to find: the kiwi.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, Holdaway and Jacomb wrote, ``even minimal
levels of human hunting pressure caused an irreversible decline in
the moa population.'' The results of their study, Holdaway said,
``reinforce the view that people with even the most basic
technologies _ fire, clubs, snares _ can have major environmental
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The moas are in any case long gone. ``Yes, this was a
blitzkrieg,'' Diamond wrote in Science. ``Yes, a few people could
and did kill every moa.''

TROUBLE AT THE PUMP

 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of a new series of TV ads made by Epinion.com _ which allows
consumers to check out the opinions of other consumers on 100,000
products _ featured a woman using a breast pump. She is wearing a
blouse; unlike the parade of actresses whose assets were displayed
during the Oscar ceremonies on Sunday, March 26, nothing of her
breast shows.
</P>
<P>
   KGO-TV in San Francisco, the same station that broadcast the
Oscars, was one of several stations around the country that have
refused to run it. Epinion co-founder  &UR; Mike Speiser  &LR; told Personals
that the station told him that the image was ``offensive'' and
``disrespectful.'' KGO didn't return calls asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The La Leche League, which promotes and advocates
breast-feeding, jumped into the fray. ``Our society needs to change
how it looks at nursing women. The breast was made to feed a
nursing baby, not to sell beer or other products, as is often the
case with advertising,'' said  &UR; Kim Cavaliero &LR;  of the league.
</P>
<P>
   The company must have known the ads would be controversial,
however, when that particular product _ one among 100,000 _ was
chosen to be featured.
</P>

reveals that fluids can go in (got milk?) but can't go out, with
the exception of tears and sweat in ads for athletic equipment.

 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ On the day after his decisive victory in a field of 11
candidates in Sunday's presidential election, Vladimir Putin told
his cabinet Monday that it was time to put ``all our work'' on a
new economic program into one ``weighty document'' by the time he
is sworn in and appoints his new government in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's reference to an economic blueprint that he steadfastly
refused to discuss during the campaign was a pointed reminder that
planning was well under way for his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Putin met with former President Boris Yeltsin and
received warm praise from the patron who plucked Putin from
political obscurity last fall as the head of the country's
intelligence agency, appointed him prime minister, and then
announced that the 47-year-old ex-KGB officer would make a good
successor. Yeltsin resigned on Dec. 31, appointing Putin acting
president.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 95 percent of the vote counted, Putin had polled
nearly 53 percent of the ballots. The Communist Party candidate,
Gennadi Zyuganov, was a strong second in the crowded field with
almost 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A number of world leaders, including President Clinton,
President Jiang Zemin of China and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, spoke with Putin by telephone Monday, extending
congratulations and expressing their hopes for Russia's future.
Clinton urged the new Russian leader to strengthen democracy and
its international ties, while Jiang urged him to deepen the
``strategic partnership'' between Russia and China. The New China
News Agency said Putin had agreed to visit China this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also expressed the hope that Putin would carry out
``impartial and transparent investigations of reported human rights
violations'' during the military campaign Russia has waged in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin met with his security advisers for an update on the war in
Chechnya. He also sent greetings to the Interior Ministry troops
who, along with the Russian army, have been fighting in Chechnya:
``Your bravery and dignity are a safe guarantee that this region
will be freed of the bandits and that peaceful life will be
restored there.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong showing by the Communist candidate, Zyuganov, drew
considerable notice here. A number of commentators saw it as
evidence of the enduring strength of the Communist opposition,
which has consistently garnered close to a third of the national
vote, and suggested that Putin might seek a collaborative
relationship with it.
</P>
<P>
   Putin will need to avoid political conflicts that would hamper
efforts to move forward with difficult reforms of the banking
system, taxation and land ownership. The Communists, for their
part, are interested in sharing power and attracting new partners
after losing the coalition through which they dominated Parliament
in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Leonid Dobrokhotov, an adviser to Zyuganov, said Monday night
that the Communist Party would consider working with Putin's allies
in parliament if the president accepted the party's demands on
``raising the living standards'' and strengthening industry,
agriculture, and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popularity of the Communist Party is the result of the
suffering of the people,'' Dobrokhotov said. ``We don't want to
fight with the party in power. We want to solve the social problems
of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Boris Makarenko, deputy director of the Center for Political
Technology, a consulting firm, said Monday the new government would
be more centrist, with the Communists as a ``junior partner,''
adding, ``This is a new role for the Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the poor showing of Grigory Yavlinsky, the
Yabloko Party leader, who polled less than 6 percent of the vote,
reflected the disarray of Russia's liberal politicians. It
suggested that Yavlinsky's personal base of support was shrinking,
and reflected the fact that many liberal voters fell in behind
either Putin or one of several liberals who ran as independents,
including Konstantin Titov, the progressive governor of the Samara
region, or Ella Pamfilova, the Women's Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strongest new liberal forces is the Union of Right
Forces, which made a surprisingly strong showing in parliamentary
elections in December. But its leaders, who include prominent
reformers from Yeltsin's governments, decided not to field a
presidential candidate, and then quarreled publicly over whether to
endorse Putin, as most eventually did.
</P>
<P>
   In general, most Russian political organizations other than the
Communist Party have usually been groupings around specific
leaders, and not national parties. Putin has not identified himself
with any of those, though last fall the Kremlin helped form the
Unity Party, an amalgam of mayors, governors and other regional
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the only party with longevity, ideology and a national
following remains the Communist Party. Michael McFaul, senior
associate of the Moscow Carnegie Center, called this circumstance
``sad progress for democracy and its legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   By any normal standard, Putin's victory with nearly 53 percent
of the vote, compared with just under 30 percent for Zyuganov,
would be considered a landslide. But the fact that Putin's
popularity, which had hovered around 60 percent this winter, sagged
in the final weeks of the campaign while the Communists rallied
left a haze of uncertainty over the Kremlin, where Putin and his
advisers were trying to figure out what kind of mandate they had
received.
</P>
<P>
   But it also appeared that Putin's victory was broad-based. Where
Yeltsin in 1996 managed to carry only 57 of Russia's 89
administrative regions, Putin won majorities in all but six,
including Zyuganov's home district.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is victory,'' said Aleksandr Voloshin, the
presidential chief-of-staff, putting the best face on the results
in an interview with the newspaper Izvestia to be published on
Tuesday.

THOUSANDS LEAVE FOSTER CARE WITHOUT COPING SKILLS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of young adults in New York City's
foster-care system, many of them neglected or abandoned during the
height of the city's crack epidemic a decade ago, have been pushed
out of the system in recent years, forced when they are as young as
18 to fend for themselves, often with little education or financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
   The city's child-welfare system, whose legal obligation to
foster children ends when they are not much beyond adolescence,
does not, by its own admission, give the departing youngsters much
to work with: a handful of classes in things like cooking and
resume writing, a check for $750 and up to three years of modest
stipends for rent.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while the growing exodus of children from foster care _
roughly 1,200 in 1998 _ has helped relieve the strain on a system
that had in the early 1990s been forced to deal with a
near-doubling of its population, it has created another kind of
crisis, according to child-welfare experts and the foster children
themselves, as a wave of poorly prepared teen-agers, many with
children of their own, venture out by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is a crisis that, at minimum, reflects the fact that the
city's foster-care system too often fails to adequately address and
surmount the myriad problems afflicting children who have been
removed from harmful homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the research suggests that this is a group at high risk of
incarceration, homelessness, public-assistance dependency,
out-of-wedlock childbearing, and victimization _ being sexually and
physically victimized,'' said Mark E. Courtney, a professor of
social work at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, whose study
of children in Wisconsin last year is regarded as one of the most
comprehensive studies of children leaving foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, when Sherrell F. turns 18 on Aug. 5, her passage into
adulthood will be unlike that of most girls her age. By then, she
will have two children to care for _ Tamara, 2, and a baby due in
June _ and a 10th-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Sherrell's outlook is a mix of bravado and grim,
practical reckoning. She lives in a foster group home in the Bronx,
and is scouring the city for ``For Rent'' signs. She says she can
support her family on $685 a month in government disability
benefits, plus food stamps and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But if that does not work out, she said, she can always turn to
the city's homeless shelters. ``They have to take you,
regardless,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Homelessness is a common fate. At the Covenant House teen
shelter in Manhattan, 80 percent of the roughly 400 teenagers who
stay there nightly are former foster children. Many come directly
from the jails at Rikers Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the closest to the best thing _ it got me an
apartment,'' Shanetta C., 18, declared of her decision to enter the
city's homeless-shelter system. Applying for public housing
otherwise would mean a long wait. ``You go to a shelter, you get in
much quicker,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the share of adolescents in care has grown in
recent years: In 1998, youngsters between 12 and 21 made up a third
of the city's caseload, compared with less than 25 percent in 1990,
according to city figures.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to those leaving the system, the city's
foster-care caseload has shrunk, to 35,000 last fall from 49,000 in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The city's legal obligation to youths leaving the system because
of age is limited. At 18, foster children are on their own, unless
they are enrolled in school or a vocational program. In those
instances, the city continues to provide care until age 21.
</P>
<P>
   For those set to leave the system, whether at 18 or 21, the city
is required to provide 16 hours of classes a year on topics such as
career counseling, apartment hunting and budgeting. Under a plan
known as the independent living program, the young adults are also
entitled to a one-time $750 check and housing subsidies of a
maximum of $300 a month for up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   But foster-care agencies and the youngsters and their advocates
say many of them get neither the instruction nor the financial
support. Many do not know about the help. Others ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney's study of former foster children in Wisconsin found
that within 12 to 18 months after leaving care, a quarter of the
boys ended up incarcerated, and one in 10 girls reported being
raped. A third of the youths had not finished high school. Fewer
than a fifth reported receiving any job training or help in signing
up for medical benefits before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we presume to do better than their parents and do in fact
replace their parents for a considerable time, sometimes many
years,'' Courtney said, ``then we have to look critically at what
we as parents are responsible for.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are exceptions, typically those who have had a
stable foster parent in their lives. Quantwilla Johnson, 20, and in
college, is one of the fortunate ones: she has lived with her
foster mother in Brooklyn since she was 3. ``She's not a foster
parent, she's a parent,'' Johnson said. ``She's concerned about my
education. She wanted to make sure I did what I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Johnson, a sophomore studying communications, is not
unlike her peers at State University of New York in New Paltz. She
lives in the dormitories and goes home for Christmas. Her foster
mother scolds her when her grades slip. She has a part-time job.
``I'm starting to learn all of the things my mother was telling
me,'' she said.

COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO WITHHOLDING WELFARE FROM LEGAL
IMMIGRANTS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a
challenge to portions of the 1996 welfare law that made legal
immigrants ineligible for various kinds of federal welfare
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The justices turned down an appeal by the city of Chicago, which
was supported by New York and other cities, of a federal appeals
court's ruling that the disqualification did not violate the
immigrants' constitutional right to equal protection because it was
not ``wholly irrational.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the overhaul of the welfare system, the provisions
aimed specifically at immigrants received relatively little
attention, but greatly angered officials of the cities where,
because of sizeable populations of impoverished or elderly
foreign-born residents, the elimination of food stamps,
Supplemental Security Income and other benefits would be most
sharply felt.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Chicago told the justices that Congress had engaged
in a ``repulsive'' type of discrimination against noncitizens. The
city said the denial of benefits had the effect of an ``unfunded
mandate'' because state and local governments would have to
shoulder a financial burden they previously shared with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of the 1996 law will be delayed because, after
initially eliminating supplemental security income and food stamps
for noncitizens, Congress the next year restored benefits for some
immigrants who were in the country when the law took effect on Aug.
22, 1996. That shifted the impact to those who arrived after that
date.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law also imposed a 5 year waiting period before
noncitizens could receive Medicaid benefits or Temporary Assistance
for Needy Families, the new program that replaced the cash grants
of the old welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   The law, and the case challenging it, had nothing to do with the
debate over illegal immigration. All the provisions at issue apply
to lawful permanent residents, admitted into the country with the
right to remain and to work.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, Chicago said the federal government ``is solely
responsible for the presence of lawful noncitizens in the country''
and ``should not be allowed to shirk all responsibility for their
welfare.'' New York City, in its brief supporting Chicago's appeal,
said the 1996 law ``is really about shifting the financial and
social burdens of immigration to state and local governments.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's suit, filed in 1997, was joined by two groups of
lawful permanent residents. The plaintiffs based their challenge on
the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Both the federal
District Court and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago
said the law's distinction between citizens and noncitizens should
be upheld as long as it was ``rational.''
</P>
<P>
   Both lower courts found a rational connection between the
benefit restrictions and the government's interest in ``fostering
self-reliance and easing the burden on the welfare system,'' as the
district court phrased it.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, under Supreme Court precedents, distinctions on the
basis of citizenship are subject to more exacting judicial
scrutiny, but the lower courts found that those precedents did not
apply when the policy at issue involved Congress' power over
immigration. In its appeal, City of Chicago vs. Shalala, No.
99-898, the city argued that because the welfare provisions
``affect no one's immigration status,'' the immigration exception
should not apply.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration, defending the law, told the
justices that ``Congress' restrictions on aliens' eligibility for
federal public benefits are properly viewed as a regulation of
aliens' conduct in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's brief added: ``Congress declared that the
national policy of immigration favors self-sufficiency on the part
of aliens, which is obviously an aspect of the aliens' conduct
while in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is likely to take up a challenge to the
welfare law only if the government loses one of the similar
lawsuits pending in the lower courts. So far, no conflict among the
appeals courts has developed. In January, the federal District
Court in Brooklyn invalidated the denial of Medicaid coverage for
prenatal medical care for noncitizens on the ground that the child
born to such a mother will be a citizen.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were also these other developments at the Supreme Court on
Monday:
</P>
<P>
   Detention
</P>
<P>
   In another case relating to immigration, the court refused to
hear an appeal filed by a 33-year-old Haitian, a lawful resident of
the United States since the age of 2, who has been held without
bond at the Krome Detention Center in Miami since October 1997,
when he returned to Miami from a two-day visit to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Because the man, Ralph Richardson, had a previous conviction for
cocaine trafficking, immigration officials treated him not as a
returning lawful resident, but as an ``arriving alien,'' subject to
incarceration and automatic ``removal'' proceedings under the 1996
immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   His request for a bond hearing was denied. The federal appeals
court in Atlanta denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,
which challenged his continued detention without a hearing, on the
ground that the 1996 law had abolished habeas corpus in the context
of detention of aliens in his category.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Clinton administration, which urged the
justices to deny the appeal, Richardson vs. Reno, No. 99-887, it is
sufficient that Richardson will eventually be able to challenge
various aspects of his treatment in an appeal from a final order of
removal, if that is the eventual disposition of his case.
</P>
<P>
   Zoning
</P>
<P>
   Despite a prolonged and evidently vigorous effort, Justice
Antonin Scalia failed to persuade enough of his colleagues to hear
a constitutional challenge to an action by the San Francisco
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission denied an application to convert 24 residential
units in a small hotel to tourist units after the hotel's owner
offered to pay only $100,000 toward replacing the lost residential
units instead of the $600,000 the city requested. The owner then
brought an unsuccessful lawsuit to challenge the permit denial as
an unconstitutional ``taking'' of private property.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia dissented from the court's refusal to hear the owner's
appeal, Lambert vs. San Francisco, No. 99-697. Joined by Justices
Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, he wrote that the California
courts appeared to be evading recent Supreme Court decisions that
gave property owners more tools for challenging zoning decisions.
But despite having kept the case under consideration at the
justices' private weekly conferences since the first week in
January _ an unusual situation that was the source of considerable
interest around the court _ Scalia was unable to pick up the
necessary fourth vote to hear the case.

SOME QUESTION CLINTON'S APPROACH ON ISRAEL-SYRIA PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton met Syrian President Hafez
Assad on Sunday at a lakefront hotel in Geneva, the Syrian leader
expected that Clinton would be relaying an Israeli plan to give
back the entire Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had no such deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have anything _ except the president's prestige, his
stature and the hope that at this time in his career he could have
a little more leverage,'' said a US official, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in many senses, a replay of the Israeli-Syrian peace
talks in January in Shepherdstown, W.Va., when analysts widely
assumed that the two sides wouldn't meet until they had nearly
wrapped up an agreement in secret talks beforehand. The assumptions
then and on Sunday proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now some are questioning Clinton's strategy of hoping to achieve
breakthroughs in Middle East peace by sheer force of his will and
the power of his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have done more harm than good by going there without
something in hand,'' said Richard W. Murphy, a former US ambassador
to Syria and Saudi Arabia and now a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day before the event there was a lot of talk that this was
the last chance for the Clinton administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who has been strongly supportive of Clinton's tireless
efforts for Middle East peace, said the president may have ``given
it the good college try, but if this isn't the last chance, it's
getting damn near the last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In a not-so-discrete public criticism of Clinton's strategy,
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa said in comments published
Monday that Clinton offered nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised that the US president was not carrying
anything new from the Israeli side, but was asking from Syria what
might help Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in his difficult
position, which we think is of his own making,'' Sharaa told
Lebanon's As-Safir newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will meet Tuesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
to discuss ways to rekindle Israel-Syria talks as well as moving
ahead with the Israel-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Mubarak, who early on Sunday expressed optimism that for an
Israeli-Syrian deal, didn't hide his disappointment Monday about
the lack of a breakthrough in Geneva. ``For the time being, there's
nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said in an interview
Monday that it wasn't time yet to lose hope on the Israel-Syria
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope what happened in Geneva was one of those stoppages,
setbacks, but it doesn't mean at all that the Syrian track should
be abandoned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Let's see what will come out in the next few days,
by way of continuing the American role on the Syrian track.''
</P>
<P>
   The US official predicted that the ``primary focus'' in Middle
East peacemaking will shift toward the Israeli-Palestinian track.
``Now, there's a chance for moving ahead. Besides, what else is
there?'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are expected to end eight
days of talks Wednesday at Bolling Air Force Base in Washington,
D.C., and return for new meetings in a few weeks, said State
Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are talking about the third and final Israeli
troop withdrawal from the West Bank, scheduled in June, as well as
setting up a framework by May on how to talk about the most
important and difficult issues separating them _ Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees, water rights, Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our assessment of the talks is that they have been serious,
intensive and, indeed, productive,'' Foley said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lack of a breakthrough Sunday remain uppermost on the
minds of Middle East experts, who had been thinking not just about
peace between Israel and Syria, but also about Israel making deals
with Lebanon and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, rosy scenarios were replaced by grim ones, especially
if Israel withdraws its troops from southern Lebanon by July
without any Syrian deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the possibilities is that there could be a flare-up of
violence,'' said Lewis Roth, assistant executive director of
Americans for Peace Now, a pro-peace lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that with an absence of a peace agreement, we
wouldn't see a freeze, but a bit of a deterioriation.''

<P>
   PODGORICA, Montenegro _ The leader of Montenegro on Monday
accused the president of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milosevic, of using
the national army to try to force him from power.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegran president, Milo Djukanovic, said in an interview
that relations with Yugoslavia were deteriorating. He accused
Milosevic of recruiting a special army battalion that would be used
to overthrow Montenegro's government.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro is the smaller of the two republics remaining in
Yugoslavia, which is dominated by the other republic, Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's government has been cautiously drawing away from
the Yugoslav government in Belgrade and is now feeling the pressure
as Milosevic moves to counter that drift.
</P>
<P>
   Under a tightened trade and economic blockade imposed by
Milosevic's government, Montenegro, a small mountainous territory
of only 650,000 people, is facing increased economic difficulties
and shortages, officials there say.
</P>
<P>
   It is also feeling the weight of the military. During the
weekend, under pressure from Belgrade, Djukanovic said, his
government agreed to allow the Yugoslav army to join Montenegro's
police at border posts with the separatist Serbian province of
Kosovo and with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by the West, Djukanovic is quietly trying to draw his
republic out of the international isolation it suffers as part of
Yugoslavia while avoiding open confrontation. But it has no
security or economic guarantees from the West.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic broke with Belgrade two years ago and has opted for
democratic reforms and openness to the West. His refusal to
denounce the NATO bombing over Kosovo and his willingness to
provide refuge to Serbian opposition figures defined his break with
Milosevic permanently.
</P>
<P>
   At home he faces opposition from the pro-Milosevic Socialist
People's Party. The parties will test their strength in local
elections in two regions of Montenegro, including the capital, in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic described the agreement over border controls as a
``gesture of good will.'' But it was greeted with skepticism by
Montenegro's leading daily Vijesti, which said the agreement
underlines how little say Djukanovic has in how the military
conducts itself in his republic.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic said he opposes the creation of a special military
police unit within the 2nd Army, based in Podgorica, numbering
about 1,000 men, Montenegrans led by Serbs loyal to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in fact a paramilitary unit and their party
association is unanimous,'' he said. ``They are devoted to Mr.
Milosevic. Over 50 percent of them have criminal records. They are
not being retained to protect the country but to overthrow the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic said Milosevic is using the army in Montenegro to
reassert control over the republic, as he did during the NATO air
campaign last year when the Yugoslav army attempted to seal
Montenegro's borders and impose controls equivalent to martial law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resisted that, and we managed,'' Djukanovic said. ``Now it
is happening a second time, but we are not in a state of war _ this
is peacetime. The situation is rather tense but we are not taking
any risks to lay ourselves open to Milosevic, because if we did we
would give him an alibi for a fifth war in the Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic's political opponents dismiss his accusations. ``He
is attacking the army and provoking it,'' said Pedrag Bulatovic of
the Socialist People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   Jabbing his finger scathingly at a newspaper carrying
Djukanovic's photo, Bulatovic contended that Djukanovic had built
up his own police force to confront the army. ``This man has 20,000
police, 10,000 more than he should have,'' he said. ``The danger is
that this guy uses these people to create a conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the agitation in Montenegro may be just talk, but
numerous little incidents are nudging the republic toward
confrontation. A disagreement between police and the military in
December over the Montenegran police's plan to build a helicopter
hangar at the Podgorica airport led the army to close the airport,
making the police abandon the plan.
</P>
<P>
   In November the Montenegran government made the German mark
legal tender, saying it wanted to protect its population against
inflation as the Yugoslav dinar plunged. Belgrade reacted by
stopping all transfers of money and stepping up enforcement of its
trade blockade of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   The blockade is already hurting two of Montenegro's key
manufacturers, Djukanovic said, and is causing shortages of
medicine and food.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Montenegro lived largely off its tourist industry
thanks to the beauty of its Adriatic coastline, but that income has
plummeted during 10 years of war in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic said he will keep trying to forge a workable
relationship with Serbia, but that he may have to lead his country
to independence if Milosevic stays in power.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls indicate mixed feelings about independence. In one
recent poll, 45 percent of those polled favored independence, 37
percent were opposed, and the rest undecided.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the government has indefinitely postponed a
referendum on the issue and is ducking around the provocative
swipes from Belgrade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A recent report by the International Crisis Group, an
independent research institute, advocates stronger action from the
West to provide more financial support to Montenegro, more evident
political support, and a commitment from NATO that it will meet any
attempt to overthrow the government in Montenegro with a forceful
military response.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro has received some economic support from the United
States, but the republic's prime minister, Filip Vujanovic, said he
recognizes that security guarantees from NATO or the West have not
been forthcoming and that Montenegro would have to defend itself.
Hence the large police force, he said.

FEDERAL JUDGE RULES CHOATE SHOULD HEAD REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clearing up one feud within the Reform Party but leaving it with
plenty of festering troubles, a federal judge ruled Monday that Pat
Choate, an ally of Ross Perot's and Pat Buchanan's, was the party's
legitimate chairman, not Jack Gargan, an ally of Gov. Jesse
Ventura's, who was ousted at a raucous party meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Norman K. Moon of District Court in Lynchburg, Va.,
found that Choate and his supporters had violated no party rules in
seizing control of the party from Gargan at the meeting, in
Nashville, Tenn., on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan testified at a two-day court hearing last week that the
Choate coup succeeded only because numerous rules governing the
scheduling and conduct of party meetings had been violated. He said
the actions of the Choate forces had threatened to weaken or even
destroy the party just as it was gearing up for this year's
presidential election, an election in which the Reform nominee will
receive $14 million in federal campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was Gargan who seized control of the party, in a
coup masterminded in part by Ventura of Minnesota. The governor was
then the party's highest-ranking elected official, but he has since
abandoned the party, labeling it ``dysfunctional.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Choate-Gargan feud, a number of lesser feuds between
party factions in various states have riven the party lately.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, for example, some Reform leaders are
threatening to take Buchanan supporters to court on grounds that
they are wrongfully using the party's name in their mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, the current favorite to win the Reform nomination, is
threatening to go to court should the Commission on Presidential
Debates exclude him from its events if he does not score at least
15 percent in public opinion polls _ more than double what he is
currently drawing.
</P>
<P>
   And in still another sign of trouble for the party, the Federal
Election Commission says party leaders must do a better job of
keeping the government informed of how they are managing the
party's money.
</P>
<P>
   Choate, Perot's running mate in the presidential race in 1996
and a close ally of Buchanan's, agreed with Gargan in last week's
court hearing that feuding was hurting the party. But he blamed
Gargan for the turmoil and insisted that no party rules or
procedures had been violated at the Nashville meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Moon concluded that while the Tennessee
gathering could ``euphemistically be described as `boisterous,'''
there nevertheless was no credible evidence that any party rules
had been violated by the Choate forces.
</P>
<P>
   He then ordered Gargan to ``immediately cease and desist from
any and all activities on behalf of the Reform Party'' and
instructed him to turn over all party papers and money to Choate.
</P>
<P>
   The case was tried in Virginia because some of the party's money
is in a Virginia bank.
</P>
<P>
   Choate hailed Moon's decision as one that would enable the party
to ``go forth and mount a competitive race.'' But Gargan expressed
deep dismay.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would abandon the party and concentrate his energies
on ``something more constructive,'' though he did not elaborate. He
also predicted that there would be a ``huge exodus'' by other party
members.
</P>
<P>
   Perot said he would have no immediate comment on Moon's
decision.

GORE UNVEILS CAMPAIGN-FINANCE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is sweeping and comprehensive. The problem is
his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the two conflicting reactions to Vice President Al
Gore's new plan for driving special interest money out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Striving to inoculate himself against an issue that has become
his Achilles' heel, Gore on Monday officially unveiled his
extensive plan to overhaul the way presidential and congressional
campaigns are financed.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal would create a $7.1 billion endowment fund to pay
for House and Senate races, require lobbyists to disclose to whom
they give money and what meetings they attend, and force television
broadcasters to give five minutes of free airtime a night to
candidates for federal office during in the last 30 days of the
general election, as well as free and equal airtime for those
candidates to respond to issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates who agree with Gore about changing the system wondered
aloud Monday whether Gore can establish his ``credibility'' on the
issue, especially since he once defended improper fund-raising
calls he made from the White House by saying there was ``no
controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for him is to show how he's different from Bill
Clinton, for example, who said the right things and articulated the
right policies, but then did not spend any political capital on it
as president,'' said Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause,
a campaign finance reform group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility thing is not a small issue,'' said the Center
for Public Integrity's Charles Lewis, who called Gore a ``Jekyll
and Hyde character'' on campaign finance. ``He would go a long way
toward being more persuasive if he was more forthcoming about his
own conduct'' in raising money to reelect himself and President
Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his plan, Gore said individuals and corporations
who contribute to the nonpartisan ``Democracy Endowment'' would get
a 100 percent tax deduction until the endowment is fully funded,
which they expect to happen within seven years. Candidates could
not take money from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   He also promised that if elected president, the first bill he
would introduce would be the McCain-Feingold bill, named for
Senators John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and Russell Feingold,
the Wisconsin Democrat, to ban unlimited and unregulated ``soft
money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I may be an imperfect messenger for this cause, but the
real wounds will be to our democracy itself unless and until we
address this problem,'' Gore said at Marquette University in
Milwaukee, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had learned firsthand the perils of the current
system and cared that his own integrity had been damaged by making
improper fund-raising calls from the White House and appearing at a
fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple in California, where the
participants had taken a vow of poverty. He said his commitment to
changing campaign finance laws was both ``personal and profound.''
He added, ``I've got the scars to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans quickly pounced on Gore's proposal, labeling it an
``election-year conversion'' and ``a taxpayer-financed government
takeover'' of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's rival, Texas Governor George W. Bush, said, ``Any promise
to reform our campaign finance system will ring hollow unless it is
grounded in credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
said the plan was a ``subterfuge'' by Gore to cover up fund-raising
excesses by the Clinton-Gore ticket four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Miller, the political director of the US Chamber of
Commerce, which represents 190,000 American businesses, also threw
cold water on the plan, suggesting in an interview that Gore's idea
to provide the 100 percent deduction was no substitute for the
current system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax-deductible hook, I don't believe, is sufficient to
offset the importance of making contributions to those
representatives who reflect your priorities,'' Miller said, adding
that businesses might prefer giving to charitable organizations
over political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who along with former Democratic Senator Bill Bradley
thrust campaign finance reform into the spotlight in this year's
presidential primaries, also expressed skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``While parts of his proposal merit serious consideration, to
convince a skeptical public that his efforts are sincere and not an
election-year conversion, the Vice President needs to back his
words with meaningful, bipartisan action, as well as call for a
complete and open investigation of 1996 campaign finance
irregularities,'' McCain said in a statement.

METS AND CUBS PREPARE FOR BASEBALL BEFORE BREAKFAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related BBO-BASEBALL-ABROAD) 
(ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ While the Mets and the Cubs try to shrug off jet lag,
the American population gets to share their pain Wednesday morning.
Anybody who wants to catch that grand old tradition of opening day
will have to get up bright and early.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Cubs will open the regular season in the Tokyo
Dome, but the game will be broadcast live in New York, where it is
14 hours earlier. To be specific, the first pitch will take place
at 5:05 a.m. Wednesday in New York and one hour earlier in Chicago,
not exactly normal viewing hours for most people.
</P>
<P>
   This is a time when sleepwalkers are ostensibly being
entertained by old Barbara Stanwyck movies, or perhaps, yet another
showing of the classic, ``The Day of the Triffids.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the national pastime doing in the wee small hours of the
morning? For the record, baseball is also the national pastime of
Japan _ probably even more so _ and they were the fans who counted
in this equation.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, claimed he
had been surprised when he heard of the rather early starting time
for loyal fans back in the Eastern and Central time zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make the decision, but it was done for the Japanese
people,'' Selig said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Getting up very early (or, staying up very, very late) to see
Mike Piazza and Sammy Sosa open the season could put New Yorkers
and Chicagoans out of whack for a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   But this odd hour will allow American fans to relate to the Mets
and Cubs, who have flown halfway around the world to play two
exhibitions against top Japanese teams and then two games that will
_ as the saying goes _ count in the standings come October.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got their feet on the ground Monday afternoon with an
8-1 victory over the Seibu Lions in an open-sided dome in the
distant suburb of Tokorozawa, two hours by bus from downtown.
Monday evening, the Cubs were shut down by the Yomiuri Giants, 6-0,
in the Tokyo Dome. The two American teams would switch opponents
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The players are insisting they do not feel uncomfortable playing
14 or 15 hours ahead of their internal clocks. They are athletes,
after all, and most at home when they don a uniform and work up a
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan may not be the problem. Teams from the National Hockey
League opened the season with two games in Tokyo, and some players
said they were still feeling it two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, they're wimps,'' Mike Piazza declared with a disarming
smile, but then he added: ``I really don't think it's going to be a
problem. We know it's not going to be easy, but we've all been
through it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the players have less disdain for this part of the
schedule than for the regular-season schedule, which seems to have
been designed by the Marquis de Sade.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of flying,'' muttered John Franco, in one of the more
printable responses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights in May are back-to-back night games in San
Francisco and Florida, and later the basic San Diego-St. Louis-Los
Angeles road trip.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the Mets may wish they were back in Japan. After
Mark McGwire blasted the concept of international games, the
players have been virtually diplomatic, playing down the impact of
jet lag, which has been known to leave normal civilians blithering
and staggering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day was a little strange,'' said Bill Pulsipher, who
was scheduled to pitch Tuesday against the Giants. ``I slept a lot
on the plane so I stayed up late at the hotel. But last night, I
slept from 7:30 p.m. until 6 a.m. and had a regular breakfast, and
then I threw on the side and I felt fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton, who will pitch the Wednesday opener, said: ``It's
baseball, whether we play in the U.S. or Japan. The field is the
same. We'll be playing a talented Cubs team. I'm looking forward to
the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The first exhibition began on a bizarre note. Rickey Henderson,
who has been grousing that he did not want to fly all this way to
play ball, stood in the batter's box for a mock ``first pitch,''
thrown by Kyotaka Nambara, a comedian who normally operates with a
sidekick, like the old Martin and Lewis routines. Nambara
low-bridged Henderson, and the two of them staged a wrestling match
near home plate, before hugging to show the fans that it was all in
good fun.
</P>
<P>
   The game was surprisingly low-key, with fans occupying no more
than a third of the 50,000 seats in the Seibu Dome. There was no
evidence of the cheering sections that accompany Japanese league
games. Apparently, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, the team owner and one of the
scions of the huge Seibu empire of hotels, railroads and
departments stores, chose to have his employees work a full day at
their jobs rather than cheer during an exhibition. Tsutsumi has
done his bit to encourage the use of his railroad by cleverly
placing the Seibu Dome so far in the countryside that it takes
several hours to return to downtown Tokyo by car or bus. It is not
the jets that will wear down the Mets and Cubs, it is the trip to
the Seibu Dome. The fans in New York and Chicago will never have to
undergo this torture, but by joining the dawn patrol, they will be
able to commiserate with the logy ballplayers.

SENATE DEBATES LEGISLATION TO PROTECT FLAG 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate opened debate Monday for the third time
in 10 years on a constitutional amendment that would prohibit
desecrating the U.S. flag.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure aimed at protecting the nation's most treasured
symbol from burning or other acts of desecration was expected to
narrowly fall short in a scheduled vote Tuesday. Sixty-seven votes
are needed in the Senate to adopt it as an amendment to the
Constitution. The House passed a similar measure in June.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., would add
a one-sentence addition to the Constitution that would give
Congress ``power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators opposed to the measure said its
passage would represent a violation of the First Amendment right of
free speech and would require the creation of a ``flag police'' to
help determine what constitutes flag desecration.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the senators offered their
own ``flag protection'' bill that would impose jail sentences and
fines for flag burning designed ``to incite violence,'' but only if
the inciteful act involved the use of flags stolen from the
government or taken from somewhere else and burned on federal
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no sympathy for those who desecrate the flag,''
McConnell said, calling them ``malcontents.'' But he added that
``the best treatment for someone who desecrates the flag might be a
punch in the nose rather than a visitation on the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the amendment also got help from retired Gen. Colin
Powell, the former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, who wrote a
letter to senators urging that they reject the effort to add a
flag-protection amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or desecrates
our flag,'' Powell wrote. But he described it as the destruction of
``a piece of cloth'' rather than the destruction of ``our system of
freedom which tolerates such desecration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a
few miscreants,'' he added. ``The flag will still be flying proudly
long after they have slunk away.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate on the flag amendment marked the third time since
1990 that the Senate has taken up the issue. It failed to muster
the necessary two-thirds support in 1990 and again in 1995, when it
was narrowly defeated by three votes. The measure is expected to
fail again Tuesday by a margin of two or three votes.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome in the House, however, has been different. A similar
amendment was approved by more than a two-thirds vote in 1995, 1997
and 1999. But an amendment requires passage by both houses of
Congress before it can be sent on for ratification by the states.
At least 40 states would have to give it their stamp of approval
before it could become part of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Smith noted that every state with the exception
of Vermont has already signaled its intention to ratify the
amendment if Congress approves it. He suggested that lawmakers who
insist on ``splitting hairs'' over free speech issues are
contributing to what he called ``the moral decay in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our duty to protect the one treasured symbol of America.
That flag is the essence of America and we ought to pass a
constitutional amendment that it not be desecrated,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He called flag burning ``just one symbol of what's wrong with
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're falling apart at the seams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But where Smith saw a threat to the nation's ability to survive,
other Republicans saw ``a non-existent problem,'' as Utah Sen.
Robert Bennett put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is burning the flag today in any discernible numbers,''
Bennett said, adding that the Smith amendment would have been more
timely in the 1960s when flag burning was a ``more serious issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me ... this is 30 years behind the times,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents of a flag-burning amendment sought to kill it by
adding a provision authored by Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., that would give Congress the power to
establish reasonable limits on campaign fund-raising. The
Hollings-Specter measure has already been rejected twice by the
Senate, and it is likely to fail again Tuesday by a wide margin.

PUNITIVE DAMAGES ADDED IN SMOKING-CASE VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A San Francisco jury on Monday ordered two cigarette makers to
pay a total of $20 million in punitive damages in the first case
decided in favor of a person who started smoking after the federal
government required the tobacco industry to put warning labels on
cigarette packages.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-person state-court jury ordered Philip Morris Cos. and
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings to each pay $10 million in punitive
damages to Leslie Whiteley, a California woman who developed lung
cancer. Last week the same jury ordered the companies to pay a
total of $1.7 million in compensatory damages to Whiteley and her
family.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes at a critical time for the tobacco industry,
and arguments in the case may foreshadow those in a Miami court
where a jury is hearing a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of
all smokers in Florida. Punitive damages in that case, if awarded,
are expected to reach tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds said the companies
would appeal both decisions in the California case. But legal
experts said the verdict was significant because Whiteley began
smoking after the government ordered that warnings appear on
cigarette packages.
</P>
<P>
   Those labels, which first appeared in 1965, were strengthened by
Congress in 1969. The U.S. Supreme Court held in 1992 that the 1969
labeling requirements pre-empted state juries from awarding damages
to smokers on the grounds that they had not been adequately warned
about tobacco dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies have long used that ruling as part of their
defense against smokers' claims. But Madelyn Chaber, a lawyer in
San Francisco who represented Whiteley, surmounted that hurdle by
arguing that producers had engaged in fraud by conspiring to
misrepresent the hazards of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are able to show these higher levels of wrongdoing,
then the warning issues don't make that much of a difference,''
said Stephen Sugarman, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second major victory against tobacco producers by
Chaber, who has based her cases in part on industry documents
uncovered during the recent round of lawsuits brought by states
against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year another San Francisco jury awarded one of her clients
$51.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages against Philip
Morris, which is the United States' largest cigarette maker. That
award, which the company is appealing, has been cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   Chaber had asked the San Francisco jury to award Whiteley and
her family $115 million in punitive damages, meant to punish a
company for wrongdoing and deter such conduct in the future. A
lawyer for Philip Morris had argued that punitive damages should be
$5 million or less because cigarette producers had changed their
practices as a result of recent legal settlements between the
industry and the states.
</P>
<P>
   Under those settlements, the industry agreed to pay $246 billion
over the next two decades to the states that had sued to recover
costs incurred in treatment of smoking-related ills. The companies
have also agreed to change some marketing and advertising
practices. The settlements did not bar class-action lawsuits or
claims by individual smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry analysts like Martin Feldman of Salomon Smith
Barney Inc. have said that they expected that punitive damages, if
awarded, in the Florida class action could reach ten of billions of
dollars. And on Monday, Feldman said that he expected the industry
to also argue in that case, if needed, that it had changed its ways
as a result of its settlements with states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits to a T the argument they will make in Florida,''
Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Miami jury began hearing closing arguments in the
cases of three people chosen to represent the entire class of
Florida smokers. Last year that same jury found that producers had
conspired to conceal tobacco's hazards.
</P>
<P>
   If the jurors find that cigarettes caused any one of the three
representative smokers to become ill, they will next decide whether
to award punitive damages to all the participants in the suit. The
precise size of that group is not known but it is estimated at
300,000 people or more.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco company officials are barred by court order from
discussing the Miami case, but William S. Ohlemeyer, a lawyer for
Philip Morris, said that, generally speaking, the punitive-damage
arguments made to the California jury were ``a small piece of what
could occur in a larger and a more difficult case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday in her office, Chaber displayed four photographs of
Whiteley who started smoking in 1972 when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1975 photograph, Whiteley wore a red bandanna in her long
blond hair. In another photograph taken last September, her head is
shaved bald and a scar is visible where an incision was made to
insert metal pins for use in a surgical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteley, whose cancer has spread to her liver and brain, only
briefly attended the trial. The bulk of her testimony was given in
a taped deposition. She had brain surgery two week ago, but Chaber
described her client, who is married and has four children, as
happy with the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's thrilled obviously, but it's a mixed joy,'' Chaber said.
``She's happy her children are going to be taken care of, but she's
not going to be around for their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was a sharp one for Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds,
because they had worked hard to shore up the industry's defenses
after the early loss to Chaber in California and a victory last
year by an individual smoker in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oregon case, a state jury ordered Philip Morris to pay
$81 million to the family of a man who smoked cigarettes for four
decades before he died. That award has since been reduced by about
one-half.
</P>
<P>
   Sugarman, the law professor, said he believed the string of
defeats showed that cigarette companies had failed thus far to come
up with a way to fight off the damaging documents that had emerged
during the state lawsuits, and to combat jury sentiment against
them. Feldman, the analyst, agreed with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially these cases are being lost because the plaintiffs
are making better use out of the industry's own documents than the
industry is,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles A. Blixt, general counsel of R.J. Reynolds, said he
believed that the company had presented a strong defense. Also he
said he did not feel that juror sentiment was against producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one jury in one court,'' said Blixt. ``I don't expect
that this is an indication of any change in fundamental
sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlemeyer, the Philip Morris lawyer, said that the company's
appeal would be based in part on the fact that while the jury may
have found that the cigarette makers had made fraudulent
statements, there had been no evidence put forward that Whiteley
had relied on such statements in making decisions about smoking.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani agreed Monday to abandon his
months-long campaign to evict the Brooklyn Museum of Art and cut
its city financing for having mounted an exhibition last year that
he deemed offensive and sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Giuliani promised to restore the city's
monthly payments to the museum and to drop, once and for all, his
suit to evict it from a city building and remove its board of
trustees because of last fall's ``Sensation'' exhibition, which
included a painting of the Virgin Mary adorned with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, in turn, dropped its First Amendment lawsuit against
the mayor, who was scheduled for a deposition in the case as early
as this week. The deal also resolved a lingering budget dispute
that had been put on hold during the months of squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials immediately welcomed the settlement, saying
that they were particularly pleased that the city had ended the
budget standoff by agreeing to pay $5.8 million over the next two
years to help repair the museum's entry hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of the past six months have only made our
institution stronger and more dedicated to our mission,'' said
Robert S. Rubin, chairman of the board of trustees. Officials at
the museum, he said, ``are proud of what we have done, happy with
this resolution, and are now eagerly looking forward to the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The city also said that it was happy with the agreement, though
Giuliani administration officials took pains at a news conference
Monday afternoon to stand by the mayor's original objection to the
exhibition. In a series of indignant public statements, Giuliani
had said that he found the exhibition to be pornographic and
anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very gratified with the settlement,'' said Michael D.
Hess, the city's corporation counsel. ``The exhibit is closed, and
at this point it was time to end the hostilities on both sides in
terms of court proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hess said, ``part of that exhibit was obviously
religion-bashing, and the mayor took exception to that, and rightly
so.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement Monday made permanent a temporary court order
issued in November by Judge Nina Gershon of U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn. When the order was first handed down, Giuliani ridiculed
it and promised to appeal, accusing Gershon of `'the usual
knee-jerk reaction of some judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's decision to drop his appeal followed several months
in which he seemed to have dug in his heels against the museum and
its lawyers, including Floyd B. Abrams, the First Amendment expert.
``Mayor Giuliani has done the right thing today,'' Abrams said
Monday. ``I think he should have done it earlier, but he was faced
with an insupportable legal position and a policy which is directly
at war with well-established First Amendment principles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hess adamantly denied that the mayor had capitulated. ``I am
not saying it is a victory for anybody,'' he said. ``It is happy
that it is over, at this point. It is not a question of anybody
backing down. It is not backing down at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess said that the $5.8 million that the city had agreed to pay
for capital improvements was far less than the $11 million that the
museum had sought. He also noted that both sides would pay their
own legal expenses. The museum had sought to have the city pay its
$1 million in fees, Hess said, adding that the city's expenses were
nowhere near that much.
</P>
<P>
   The city, which provides about a third of the museum's annual
$24 million operating budget, began withholding the museum's
monthly subsidy of about $500,000 in October. All of the $3.5
million withheld during previous months has been paid back, and the
city _ as well as Giuliani personally _ could face contempt of
court charges should the money be kept from the museum again.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement seeks to ensure that the museum will be treated
fairly in the years to come by forbidding Giuliani from reducing
its public financing by any amount ``disproportionately greater''
than that of seven other museums, including the Metropolitan Museum
of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, that receive
city money. The agreement is binding on him until he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began when Giuliani announced his distaste for the
Virgin Mary portrait by Chris Ofili, a Roman Catholic of Nigerian
descent, and other works in the exhibition. ``Sensation,'' which
opened Oct. 2 and closed Jan. 9, originated in Britain and was
drawn from the collection of Charles Saatchi, the advertising
magnate.
</P>
<P>
   The case had legal implications for publicly financed art
institutions across the country, Abrams said, making them less
vulnerable to censorship by public officials. ``This sends a
message that the museum community is willing to fight back,'' he
said.

MEETING AND A BROADWAY PLAY REVISIT MOTIVES OF A-BOMB PHYSICIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ghost of Werner Heisenberg, the Nobel Prize
winner who led the Nazi atomic bomb program, walked again Monday as
historians and scientists met to determine whether his failure to
build a bomb during World War II was deliberate or a simple product
of his own incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, at the Graduate Center of the City University of
New York, was stimulated by a play, ``Copenhagen,'' that explores
the same lingering question and is soon to open on Broadway. And
like the characters in the play, the experts at the meeting came to
a seemingly unbridgeable disagreement on Heisenberg's intentions as
he led a program that could have given an atomic bomb to Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   Historians at the meeting suggested there was little evidence
that Heisenberg ever expressed moral scruples about building the
bomb until the German Reich was smashed and he attempted to patch
up his relations with the Allies. But scientists _ some of whom
knew Heisenberg and worked on the Allied bomb effort _ suggested
that even under intense pressure from the Nazis, he never tried
hard even to understand how an atomic bomb would work.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Cassidy, a historian at Hofstra University who has
written a biography of Heisenberg, said there was no evidence
``that moral issues regarding nuclear fission research were of
particular concern for Heisenberg.'' He said the central question
of the play, involving the reasons for a mysterious wartime voyage
that Heisenberg made to meet his former mentor, the Danish
physicist and Nobel laureate Neils Bohr, probably did not have a
comfortable answer for Heisenberg supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The record suggests he did not seek out Bohr to confer on the
moral issues raised by atomic bomb research, as Heisenberg later
contended. Rather, Cassidy said, the historical setting and the
weight of evidence ``strongly suggest that he wanted first to
convince Bohr that the seemingly inevitable German victory would
not be so bad for Europe after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Heisenberg might also have hoped that Bohr would use his
influence with Allied scientists to prevent them from building
their own bomb, Cassidy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Hans Bethe, 93, a Cornell physicist and Nobel Prize
winner who worked on the Manhattan Project, said he was certain
that Heisenberg, whom Bethe knew, never had any intention of
building a bomb for Hitler. Bethe's evidence came largely from
secret recordings made of Heisenberg and his colleagues after
Germany collapsed in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Those recordings, which registered the scientists' shock when
they learned that the Allies had dropped an atomic bomb on
Hiroshima, largely demonstrate how ignorant Heisenberg was of how
such a bomb would have to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beautiful justification of Heisenberg when he said
he never worked on a bomb,'' Bethe said. ``He never did.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Wheeler, a professor emeritus at Princeton University
who also worked on the Manhattan Project, largely agreed that
Heisenberg should not be remembered as a malevolent genius who was
stopped by his own miscalculations. But Wheeler did recall the
difficulties that Heisenberg faced in regaining the friendship of
other physicists after the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by how some people would not see him at all,''
Wheeler said. ``And only a few people would treat him as a normal
human being.''
</P>
<P>
   After an emotional presentation at the meeting, which was
sponsored by the Ensemble Studio Theater and the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, Wheeler summed up his thoughts on both Heisenberg and
Bohr, both of whom he knew, in this way: ``Happy memories of two
great men.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience at a preview of the play at the Royale Theater on
Sunday was also sprinkled with physicists and Manhattan Project
veterans. And they, like those who debated on Monday, had their
opinions about Heisenberg's role. Standing in the balcony at
intermission, Dr. Benjamin Bederson, a physicist at New York
University, noted that the play was inspired by a book,
``Heisenberg's War,'' by Thomas Powers, whose thesis was that
Heisenberg deliberately killed the German bomb project.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conclusion, I thought, was wrong,'' said Bederson,
speaking of Powers. Bederson worked on the Manhattan Project as a
GI in Los Alamos, and remembers hearing Bohr being paged over the
public address system by his code name, Nicholas Baker.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond his view of the play's historical underpinnings,
Bederson had quite a different reaction to the unaccustomed
spectacle of seeing physics performed on Broadway. ``The play is
wonderful,'' he said, during intermission. ``I'm amazed how many
people are here, and how physics has really gotten into the
culture. Physics has made it.''

ACTOR REEVE ENCOURAGES SCIENTISTS ON GENE RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Before a ballroom packed with geneticists and
biotechnology executives, the most famous paralyzed man in America
took the stage Monday night with the message he has urged for five
years: That he must walk again, and they must help him.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Reeve, frozen in the public mind as Superman before
a 1995 accident left him a quadriplegic, got an emotional standing
ovation from the audience at the Bio2000 conference as he hailed
recent breakthroughs in stem cell research and genetic coding that
could someday lead to spinal cord regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   Make a profit, he told the audience. Conduct business. But as
legions of patients struggle with diabetes, Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's disease, to say nothing of spinal cord injuries, don't
forget to tell the patients what you're doing so they can be
encouraged by the progress of their own cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many people still can't get past the psychological
barrier that their life has been ruined,'' said Reeve, speaking at
the world's largest gathering of biotechnology industry officials.
``It's important to give them hope _ not to give them false hope,
but to go back to what really is the American mantra, and it is a
realistic mantra, that nothing is impossible. Let them know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his accident, Reeve has become one of the nation's
highest-paid and most sought-after speakers. He also has thrown
himself into the role of a professional spur to science, raising
unprecedented amounts of money for spinal cord injury research and
repeating his hope to walk again before his 50th birthday in 2003.
Meeting with a wheelchair-bound teenaged victim of the Columbine
shootings this spring, he promised her, ``You're going to be
walking. I'm serious, you're going to be walking,'' according to
the Rocky Mountain News in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of promise that has made him a favorite figure
among researchers _ and a more ambiguous one among people with
similar disabilities, who complain that Reeve could just as easily
encourage people with paralysis to accept their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tightrope walk along a sword,'' said John Fioritti, a
program director at the Greater Boston chapter of the National
Spinal Cord Injury Association. ``On one hand, you want to have
hope for the future, and on the other hand, you don't want false
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the crowd at the Hynes Convention Center, who are more
inclined to think along a scientific timeline, Reeve's vision did
not seem as suspect. Within the last six months, two teams of
scientists have made breakthroughs: In November, a team of Canadian
scientists announced that they had regenerated spinal cord tissue
in mice using stem cells extracted from the brain or bone marrow.
In January, from Switzerland came news that a lab had discovered
the gene that inhibits regeneration of the brain and spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the physical presence of a patient such as Reeve
awaiting a cure is exactly what scientists ``working at the lab
bench doing gritty research work'' need to inspire them, said Carl
B. Feldbaum, who as president of the Biotech Industry Organization
helped select Reeve as a speaker. Feldbaum added that, if he was in
Reeve's position, he would hope to be equally passionate about
curing his condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may feel more comfortable with the goal of accommodation,
and others need to go for broke. That's what Chris Reeve is
doing,'' Feldbaum said. ``He can't do all things for all people.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were many in the community of people with similar
injuries who didn't make an effort to see Reeve speak _ and who
have, over the years, angrily tuned him out. John Kelly, a Brandeis
University graduate student who is quadriplegic, was busy writing a
want ad for a home care assistant whose $9.50 an hour wage would be
paid by the government. He complained that the problem besetting
most people with disabilities is ``poverty and oppression,'' not
the wait for a cure.
</P>
<P>
   And Pam Burkely of Hyannis, Mass., who has been a paraplegic
since 1973, said she had expected Reeve to temper his message to
include more emphasis on accommodation and services as the years
went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd give Christopher two years to work through that
I-will-walk-again thing and then see him come back into reality
with more of an emphasis on resources,'' said Burkely, who works at
the Cape Organization for Rights of the Disabled. ``The message he
gives out is dangerous. What he's doing isn't bringing attention to
my reality. For every two steps forward, we take a step back. I
don't think he's forcing us backward, but he slows down the second
step.''
</P>
<P>
   But all that complexity meant little to 4-year-old Devin Keppel,
who was hit by a car when he was 2 and is one of about a dozen
children in the country who have the same injury as Reeve. Around
lunchtime Monday, his mother piled him into the car and drove in
from Manchester, Mass., so Devin could see the real hero of the
movie he has watched _ by his own account _ upwards of 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devin knew Superman before the accident,'' said Sian Keppel,
his mother. ``So we can tell him, `Superman had a (tracheotomy
tube) and a vent. And Superman's off the vent. And so is Devin.'''

SPORTS COLUMN: FEW MARCH STARS, BUT PLENTY OF PARITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It doesn't take much to make an old Tar Heel bleed
Carolina blue. North Carolina will be in Indianapolis this weekend,
and though Matt Doherty has his own Final Four business to conduct
in New York, he couldn't resist the opportunity to defend an old
mentor and friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to give Bill Guthridge a hard time, but he's
coached three years and now he's gotten to two Final Fours,''
Doherty said Monday before heading off to Madison Square Garden to
prepare Notre Dame for its National Invitation Tournament semifinal
Tuesday night against Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge, who slid into the Chapel Hill hot seat when Dean
Smith retired, was recently under siege, when the North Carolina
faithful had to bow their heads on selection Sunday and say their
prayers. Thirteen-game losers, the Tar Heels were fortunate to make
the big tournament, and their name value for the sake of a network
ratings point didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Wisconsin doesn't exactly inspire dynastic memories
of UCLA, while a young Florida team dangled on the edge of
first-round oblivion against Butler. Even Michigan State, the
favorite going into Indianapolis, has trailed during the second
half in three of its four games.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, once-upon-a-time teammate of Michael Jordan, James
Worthy and Sam Perkins on the 1982 national champions, knows that
the era of superstar-laden college basketball teams is expiring,
slowly yet surely, like one of those tournament games dragged on by
timeouts and fouls. The exodus of young stars to the National
Basketball Association is clearly turning March into a much more
democratic method of madness. ``It's all about execution, making
shots, biorhythms, the stars and the moon,'' Doherty said. He added
that he truly does believe in astrological explanations, at least
more than in Dick Vitale's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty cited the side jumper that his star sophomore, Troy
Murphy of Morristown, N.J., missed that would have won a Big East
Tournament game against Miami. ``That's his shot, and in the first
round of the NIT against Michigan, he was in the exact same spot
and he made it,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Murphy made the shot against Miami _ who knows? Maybe Notre
Dame is Wisconsin, or North Carolina. Instead of Doherty, maybe
Bill Guthridge would have been sampling the chicken Monday at the
NIT luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, 38, out of Holy Trinity High School in Hicksville,
N.Y., got the Notre Dame job after spending seven years next to Roy
Williams at the University of Kansas. Williams, of course, studied
under Smith, one seat to the left of the longtime first lieutenant,
Guthridge. From Williams to Doherty, George Karl to Larry Brown,
all of the head-coaching Heels will be burning up the phone and fax
wires over Guthridge's reversal of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I faxed him before the tournament and I will again before the
weekend,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   From as far away as South Bend, Ind., he knew enough about North
Carolina's season to recount the injuries that put Guthridge's team
on the tournament bubble. He hated the idea that one of the game's
true gentlemen was hung out by knee-jerk critics and spoiled fans.
</P>
<P>
   The old-time college powerhouses had better realize that the
days of taking anything for granted are ending. There is no turning
backing the clock, and even more of those diaper dandies will
toddle off to the pros when the NBA gets its developmental league
going.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Odom, the Wake Forest coach who plays North Carolina State
in Tuesday night's other NIT semifinal, pointed out that his team
waxed Wisconsin by 20 this season and beat North Carolina twice.
Excepting Michigan State, Odom contended that you could flip-flop
the two Final Fours and see little or no qualitative difference. He
guessed that more No. 8 seeded teams like North Carolina and
Wisconsin will in the coming years find the March stars properly
aligned, if they have a few heady seniors like the Tar Heels'
Brooklyn point guard, Ed Cota.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons I became so excited about this
job,'' Doherty said of Notre Dame. ``I looked at the success of
Stanford. With so many kids leaving early, they've been able to
play juniors and seniors against young kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience didn't help Stanford in its ``upset'' loss to North
Carolina, but Doherty likely made a wise career move. Notre Dame
could be a player in the changing world of college basketball,
which, contrary to doomsayers like Billy Packer, isn't going to die
without the majority of future sneaker pitchman. The tournament
works because of its formula, more than who is playing in it. Fame
is not a necessary requirement for television drama, as Regis now
reminds us several nights a week.

GORE'S CAMPAIGN FINANCE PLAN DRAWS LUKEWARM REACTION FROM
FUND-RAISERS
</HEADLINE>
   (With GORE-FUNDRAISING) 
(sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Political donors and fund-raisers approached Vice
President Al Gore's latest campaign finance proposal warily,
concerned that it would diminish their influence with candidates
and create an unwieldy new government bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Calling big-money contributions to politics a ``cancer on our
democracy,'' Gore on Monday proposed the elimination of the
unlimited donations known as soft money and creation of a $7
billion endowment to finance all general election campaigns for
Congress. The fund would be financed with tax-deductible
contributions from the corporations, unions and individuals that
now underwrite most political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would radically reshape the financing of federal
elections and curtail the money chase that now consumes candidates'
time and energy and which landed Gore in political and legal
distress after the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan would obliterate the direct tie between private
contributors and federal officeholders and the two political
parties. ``The views of the donor will have absolutely no influence
on their views of the recipient,'' Gore said in a speech in
Milwaukee. ``In this way, we will break the connection between the
giving of money and the gaining of influence in these election
contests.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president used his speech to defend his role in the
fund-raising excesses of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign, saying
that he had to ``push the system'' to defend core Democratic
programs.
</P>
<P>
   And he took the opportunity to attack his Republican foe, Gov.
George W. Bush, as an enemy of campaign finance reform who has
treated the issue as a ``political shell game.''
</P>
<P>
   One question that remains unanswered about his plan is what
incentive donors would have to contribute to a large bipartisan
endowment that would serve as the vehicle for public financing of
campaigns. Many big donors now contribute to a particular lawmaker
or political party because they want access, have a specific
legislative problem, or a partisan or ideological agenda. The plan
also does not address the need to raise money to run a primary
election campaign, presumably from the same sources that now fuel
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican fund-raisers alike suggested that
donors would be reluctant to contribute to a fund from which
candidates of both parties could draw.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Eudy, the top fund-raiser for the presidential campaign of
Sen. John McCain, called the Gore plan ``disastrous.'' She said
that current Republican donors would be loath to give $1,000 or
$100,000 to a fund that would help finance the campaigns of
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I want to contribute to a fund that could be giving
money to help elect Ted Kennedy?'' she asked. ``Al Gore is only
proposing this because he wants to be John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley Barbour, one of the Republican Party's most prominent
money men and a key fund-raiser for Bush said, ``I don't believe
small business, big business, agriculture or much of anyone else
wants a government-run election system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't want to pay for politicians' campaigns,''
added Barbour, who contributed more than $21,000 in his own name to
40 Republican candidates last year. ``This is going to be paid for
with taxpayer dollars and no matter how much lipstick you put on it
this pig ain't going to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Gore's backers expressed skepticism. A top
Democratic donor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Gore's
plan violates the competitive spirit of politics. ``It will be hard
to get people to give if they are giving to a fund that both
Democrats and Republicans will benefit from,'' the donor said.
``People give to elect one party and defeat the other party.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Grossman, a top Democratic contributor and former
party finance chairman, welcomed the proposal as a tonic for a
democracy in distress. He said that the public had become cynical
and indifferent to politics, in part because of a popular view that
moneyed interests had hijacked the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I be willing to take all the dollars I contribute and
reallocate them to a democracy endowment fund? In a heartbeat,''
Grossman said. ``As a former state and national party chair, a
major donor, a fund-raiser and first and foremost a citizen, I
would do so to engender a sense among citizens that they can take
back their political system.''
</P>
<P>
   One major fund-raiser for Gore, who insisted that his name not
be used, said that many political contributors would be happy to
consolidate their donations in one check to a national bipartisan
fund. But he also said that the plan was unlikely to win passage by
members of Congress who owe their seats to the contributions of
thousands of individuals and political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the reason Gore is proposing it,'' this fund-raiser
said, ``I'm skeptical it's the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also questioned the proposals, particularly given Gore's
direct involvement in the 1996 fund-raising excesses. ``Any promise
to reform our campaign finance system will ring hollow unless it is
grounded in credibility, credibility based on consistency,
integrity and disclosure,'' Bush said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We need an attorney general, a president and a vice president
who will live by and enforce the laws we currently have on the
books. Unless the vice president stops withholding information
about his own fund-raising excesses, the American people will
question his commitment to reforming the fund-raising practices of
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats and Republicans expressed doubts about the
practicality and political appeal of the Gore proposal. Several
noted that only one in eight Americans now checks the box on their
annual tax returns to devote $3 to paying for presidential
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The fund covers only a fraction of the money that the candidates
receive _ $67 million for the major party nominees for the general
election this fall, and more than $30 million in primary matching
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of a number of corporations that make large political
donations either declined comment on the Gore proposal or did not
respond phone calls seeking reaction to the Gore proposal. A
Microsoft official said the company would not comment. Several
others, including United Parcel Service, SBC Communications, AT&AMP;T
and the American Financial Group, did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's proposal drew a warmer response from some of the
Democratic party's largest labor contributors. Several unions
endorsed the plan as a means to balance the Republican party's
historic fund-raising advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International
Union, one of the largest sources of Democratic soft money
contributions, called Gore's finance plan innovative and
comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we believe that elections and government should be about
the right of individual citizens to participate and not have their
voices drowned out by corporations and wealthy individuals, our
first instinct is to be enthusiastically in favor,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald H. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State
County &AMP; Municipal Employees, the Democratic party's largest single
donor last year, also praised the Gore plan. ``When the business
community outspends us 16 to 1,'' he said, ``it's a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his union, which gave $1.4 million in soft money to
the Democratic National Committee in 1999 alone, would in all
likelihood contribute to a non-partisan fund like that proposed by
the vice president. But in an illustration of the plan's
incompleteness, he said the union would also continue its spending
on political activity outside the system as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore proposal would not affect the independent spending on
political advocacy and organizing by unions, corporations,
individuals or interest groups. But the plan would require more
complete disclosure of the sources of funding of issue advertising
60 days before an election and provide equal time for candidates
who are the targets of such independent expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Gore consulted with a number of advocates of revisions in
current campaign finance law, including members of Congress and
leaders of independent groups.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the plan he announced on Monday was borrowed, but the
centerpiece of the plan, the so-called Democracy Endowment, was the
vice president's own idea although it bears some similarities to a
plan proposed some years ago by Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin,
according to aides and others whose advice he sought.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, candidates for the House and Senate would
receive funding from the endowment for their general election
campaigns if they agree not to accept any other sources of money.
Candidates competing against each other would receive equal
amounts, which would vary by state or district, depending on
population and cost of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who made overhauling the campaign finance system the
rallying point of his now-suspended presidential campaign, said
Gore's proposal _ and its author _ were flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very workable,'' McCain said in a telephone
interview. ``You can't even get Americans to check off a dollar any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations have no motivation to contribute to a fund that
dilutes their influence, he added, and the public is skeptical of
Gore, whose enthusiasm for campaign finance revisions appears to
many to be an electoral ploy. McCain said that troubling questions
still remain about possibly illegal fund raising by the
Clinton-Gore campaign of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not condemning it,'' McCain said of Gore's plan. ``I
appreciate very much that he's taken up this issue, but in order to
prove his credibility, he'd have to call for a complete
investigation and renounce soft money now.''

   TREASURY SECRETARY URGES A FOCUS ON LATIN POVERTY
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers called for sweeping changes
in the way international aid agencies combat poverty in Latin
America, amid signs that robust growth there has left more people
behind than many economists expected.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank, Summers

toehold in Asia it had long wanted. ``We have closed the circle,''
Juergen E. Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman, said at a news

new garbage trucks. The company lost $114.7 million, or 19 cents a

IN NEW JERSEY, A SENATE CANDIDATE RUNS AGAINST THE BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Running against motherhood or apple pie you
could understand. But running against the boom?
</P>
<P>
   With the nation's economic expansion entering its 109th
consecutive month and much of New Jersey awash in prosperity, it
seems like an odd strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But in New Jersey's U.S. Senate contest, unlike any other major
political race in the country, a convergence of unusual
circumstances has transformed the Democratic primary into a race
that has put the economic boom on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jon S. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,
has swathed himself in the flag of prosperity, asserting that his
work on Wall Street helped New Jersey companies create and retain
hundreds of thousands of jobs. If elected to the Senate, Corzine
says, he will use his business acumen to spread that wealth to the
poor by offering a banquet of expansive social programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments have prompted his opponent, former Gov. Jim
Florio, to warn voters that a dark cloud has been obscured by the
economic silver lining. On issues ranging from Social Security and
pension financing to corporate mergers, trade policy and government
borrowing, Florio has hammered his opponent with the kind of
class-based attacks Democrats usually aim at Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He has accused Wall Street titans of raking in billions of
dollars in profits at the expense of poor and working-class
Americans, and has blamed Goldman, Sachs for underwriting corporate
mergers that cost more than 75,000 Americans their jobs under
Corzine's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has also cautioned voters not to let Wall Street's
blazing performance in recent years lure them into accepting the
Clinton administration's proposal to invest some Social Security
money in the stock market, an initiative Corzine supports.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan would result in billions of dollars in investment
fees for Wall Street firms, Florio argues, but leave low-income
retirees at the mercy of volatile market fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week, you hear stories about economic disparities in
this boom period, with more and more people in the top end doing
better and people in the lower end doing worse in terms of
purchasing power,'' Florio said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the exchanges are two starkly different visions
of the economy and of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine (pronounced kore-ZYNE) is convinced that the economic
expansion has brought benefits to enough people that his Wall
Street resume will inspire confidence in working-class voters.
Florio believes that the Democratic Party's traditional base in New
Jersey _ factory workers, union stewards, minimum-wage employees
and retirees _ is inherently wary of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of
Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said the race was
a test case of how prosperity may have shifted the political
landscape within the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a question of new economy vs. old economy,''
Hughes said. ``What proportion of new economy workers, information
economy workers, financial services employees, the people
benefiting from the boom are going to vote in a Democratic
primary?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the national Democratic and Republican Parties have
debated whether Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton deserves credit for
the soaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates like Hillary Rodham Clinton have occasionally
suggested that some pockets of the country, like upstate New York,
have not shared equally in the boom.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has critiqued the economy's performance as directly,
or as harshly, as Florio, said Larry Sabato, a political science
professor at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robert H. Frank, a Cornell professor who has written extensively
about the inequities and excesses of the 1990s, said Florio's
argument may be a tough sell to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any other candidate out there arguing against
the boom,'' Frank said. ``The Republicans aren't going to come out
against an economy that has benefited their supporters, the rich.
For Democrats, there is a case that Florio is making. But why make
that case when you can just say we're responsible for greatest
economic expansion of all time?''
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat surprising that such an appeal is being attempted
in a place as prosperous as New Jersey. The state's per capita
income is the second-highest in the nation. Nearly 60 percent of
New Jersey households have an interest in the stock market, either
directly or through 401k plans or mutual funds. The state's
high-tech and pharmaceutical industries have expanded rapidly in
recent years, helping drive the unemployment rate down to just 4.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state Department of Labor, the fastest growing
segment of the work force is now financial services, and the number
of commodities traders increased to 44,000 from 40,000 in the last
year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some recent polls suggest that the boom has not
completely erased New Jersey voters' suspicion of powerful
establishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are distrustful of big institutions, like big
business, even if people are doing well financially,'' said
Clifford Zukin, a Rutgers political science professor who heads the
university's polling institute. ``So in a Democratic primary, it
makes some sense to rail against big money.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the economic platform embraced by each candidate
has been shaped by strategic necessity. Corzine, a political
neophyte, has little choice but to maintain that his business
triumphs are a harbinger of success in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Florio left office in 1994, a year before most New Jerseyans
began to fully feel the end of the recession, so it would be
difficult for him to claim credit for the state's resurgence.
Florio's campaign resources are also dwarfed by Corzine's $300
million fortune (and his pledge to spend as much as necessary to
win). So the former governor has blasted Corzine's costly
advertising appeals in the hope that ``free media,'' newspapers and
television, will convey his message to voters.
</P>
<P>
   What has emerged is a series of increasingly heated
disagreements about economic disparity and the corrosive power of
wealth that at times seem more at home in the Dust Bowl era than
the Microsoft era. On the day Corzine released new television
commercials this month, campaign officials for Florio held a news
conference in which a prominent supporter ominously suggested that
Corzine's fortune might actually be worth more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 450 billionaires in the U.S.,'' warned the
supporter, Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. ``And if they fan out across the
country, they can consume all of the congressional districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has tried to counter Florio's appeals to class
resentment by pointing out his working-class roots. He also
contends that the campaign is not about Wall Street, but about the
ability to understand and shape a rapidly changing economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jim Florio is just out of touch with where the economy
of the U.S. is in this day and age,'' Corzine said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a recent advertising campaign, Corzine claimed some credit
for job growth in recent years, stating that during his stewardship
of Goldman, Sachs, the company's investments helped New Jersey
companies create or retain 700,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Florio ridiculed that assertion, saying it was absurd for an
investment banker to take credit for jobs created by his borrowers.
Many political analysts also characterized Corzine's ads as
exaggerations.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine maintains that the ads are technically accurate and
that their message is that he learned to direct capital to areas
where it can spur economic development. He said he would use that
expertise in the Senate by pushing for an urban redevelopment bank
to encourage business growth in inner cities and by proposing
bountiful government subsidies for health care, preschool,
long-term care and college education.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also blames Florio for New Jersey's economic stagnation
during the early 1990s, saying that the governor's decision to push
a $2.8 billion tax increase through the Legislature in 1990 scared
off businesses, fueled unemployment and contributed to his being
voted out of office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't argue that it was going to be a generator of
business to New Jersey,'' Corzine said. ``It had a deleterious
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio, who pushed for the tax increase to pay for court-ordered
increases in school financing, dismisses those criticisms as the
naive quibbling of someone who has never had to make a tough
political decision.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Florio also contends that his long career in state politics has
made him singularly attuned to the worries of New Jersey families.
Florio cited several recent studies that show the gap between New
Jersey's rich and poor widening.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As he makes campaign appearances at countless senior citizens
centers, union halls and kaffeeklatsches, Florio says he is often
surprised at the deep concern many New Jerseyans have about their
long-term financial security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks understand something is going on; the earth is moving,''
Florio said. ``The old defined benefit pension system is being
replaced, and it is the working families that will be squeezed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Florio is scheduled to release his own economic position paper
early next month. Drafts of the document call for targeted tax
cuts, funding for worker retraining and trade sanctions against
countries that do not uphold environmental and labor standards. But
thus far, most of the economic debate in the campaign has been a
critique of Corzine's ideas and his Wall Street resume.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Shure, whose liberal research organization, New Jersey
Policy Perspective, has released several studies about economic
disparity in the state, said it was heartening to hear a political
candidate call for economic justice, as Florio is doing. But Shure,
who was Florio's communications director as governor but is not
involved in his Senate campaign, warned that those left behind by
the boom also constitute the segment of the population least likely
to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Florio says he is undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever accused me of taking the easy way,'' he said.
``But that's what leadership is about. Talking about important
things that many people aren't yet ready to address.''

A BOSTON UNIVERSITY-ST. LAWRENCE CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was when the overtimes began that the game picked up its
pace. No TV timeouts to disrupt the flow and the edge increasing as
one overtime dissolved into another _ a first, second, third, and,
incredibly, a fourth, before Robin Carruthers finally gave St.
Lawrence a 3-2 victory over Boston University on Sunday in the
longest NCAA hockey tournament game ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey was being played in its purest form, sudden death, no
artificial pauses, just players from both teams jumping over the
boards after shifts of a mere 20 and 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lawrence's Jason Windle blasted from the right point at
14:30 of the first overtime; save by Boston University goalie Rick
DiPietro. BU's John Sabo hauled down at the mouth of the crease
with 2:00 left in the first OT, Sabo seemingly set to score the
winning goal off a pass from Carl Corazzini, but Sabo never could
collect the pass as he was pushed into St. Lawrence goalie Derek
Gustafson. And BU could not take advantage of the penalty against
St. Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the alley-ways of the Pepsi Arena in Albany, and
watching, were impatient players from two other teams, Maine and
Michigan, waiting to begin their game in the NCAA East Regional.
The Black Bears and Wolverines were in full pads for the first OT
of the BU and St. Lawrence game; by the second overtime, they were
were watching BU and St. Lawrence go up and down the ice in their
sweaters _ their team sweaters and not their hockey sweaters _ and
by the third OT, some were in shorts.
</P>
<P>
   But still watching.
</P>
<P>
   The game was now a classic. The Terriers and Saints somehow were
manufacturing scoring chances despite legs that were heavy and
cramped. And the scoring chances were rich and ripe _ incredibly
once again, 27 shots on net by the two teams in the third OT _ but
BU's DiPietro and St. Lawrence's Gustafson were stopping one and
all. NCAA tournament records were falling with every shot and save.
</P>
<P>
   Breakaways meant nothing to these two freshman goalies, and
neither did two-on-ones and three-on-ones, nor one-timers from the
point or screen shots from the top of the slot. The goalies just
would not let a puck behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give back all (77) saves if we had won the game,''
DiPietro said. ``To tell you the truth, I'd rather have had 10
shots and won than 77 saves and lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Boston, the classic scratched in overtime from TV
because of a meaningless Celtics team playing a near-meaningless
game against Milwaukee, BU alumni were out in their cars, listening
to the game on the radio. But, in Albany, the game just went on . .
. and on . . . and on.
</P>
<P>
   By the fourth overtime, only a penalty shot _ it seemed _ might
end this game that began at noon and still was being played as
twilight descended upon Albany. Each goalie seemed that confident,
that sure, that focused.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Venis, the BU trainer, was handing out dehydration pills
to players, and even to the referee. ``Guys were getting bad muscle
cramps, and they couldn't even stand up at times,'' said Venis.
``(BU player Dan) Cavanaugh was so cramped up that he got knocked
down once but he couldn't even pick himself up.''
</P>
<P>
   Venis, a trainer for other BU teams, ``had never seen anything
like this in ice hockey.'' Football, yes, football on a scorching
day, but this was hockey in the North on a March day. Still, ``this
was a pretty hot building,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Venis was also concerned about DiPietro, ``because Ricky
cramps a lot. We pretty much gave him a lot of water all the time
and we actually started him off early in the day, hydrating him and
making sure he had extra water from breakfast on. Actually, because
it was such an early game, we started him (Saturday) night, making
sure he was hydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   For BU coach Jack Parker, ``it was a case of which guys were
going to survive this next shift. We had so many guys leaving
because of cramps and stuff. Cavanaugh left halfway through the
second overtime and he missed all of the third overtime and then
all of a sudden, he's putting his skates back on (for the fourth
overtime). The trainer had told me he wasn't going to be back at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   BU had played strongly in the third period and also came out
aggressively in the first OT, ``and I think, in retrospect, we had
that great third period and that great first overtime, and we had
our chances then,'' said Parker.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lawrence coach Joe Marsh said, ``I'm almost speechless'' _ a
rare occurrence _ after the classic ended after 123 minutes 53
seconds of hockey. As one intermission folded into the next, Marsh
said he had less and less to say to his players. ``Just let 'em
play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It ended after a combined 154 shots, after 149 saves by DiPietro
and Gustafson, Marsh saying the trite words so often said in sports
but so true this time, that neither team should have lost.
</P>
<P>
   And the Boston University hockey players boarded the bus for the
long ride along the New York Thruway and the Massachusetts Turnpike
back to Boston. ``A lot of the players still had cramps on the
bus,'' said Parker, ``but by the time we got back to Boston,'' the
players were in better physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The cramps diminsh, ``Once you stop sweating,'' said the coach.
</P>
<P>
   But the emotional cramp from the loss will take longer to
dissipate. Parker said his memories from the game are bittersweet,
sweet because the Terriers' effort against a rested and favored St.
Lawrence team exemplified the way ``the team has played all
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-sweet taste is obvious. This game that wouldn't end,
said Parker, ``is one game I'll always remember, that's for sure.''
But the memory ``would have been much sweeter if we had won.''

GORE PROPOSES SERIES OF CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to inoculate himself against attacks over
his own fund-raising record, Vice President Al Gore on Monday
acknowledged his mistakes and embraced a series of campaign finance
reforms intended to curb special-interest money coursing through
the political system.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of those changes, which the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee unveiled in Wisconsin, would be the
creation of a $7.1 billion endowment fund that would be tapped to
pay for congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also proposed ending unregulated soft money, prodding
television stations to offer free time for candidates, forcing
outside groups who run political ads to disclose their funding
sources, and mandating that lobbyists file monthly reports
detailing their legislative activity.
</P>
<P>
   In an address at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Gore sought
to turn a political liability into an advantage by confessing his
past errors, linking himself to John McCain and other reformers,
and characterizing Republican opponent George W. Bush as a defender
of the flawed current system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I may be an imperfect messenger for this cause,'' Gore
said.``But the real wounds will be to our democracy itself unless
we address this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his proposals were intended to reverse the growing
amount of money pumped into campaigns to influence legislation.
</P>
<P>
   With Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., standing by his side, Gore
said his first act as president would be to submit the campaign
reform legislation sponsored by Feingold and McCain. That
legislation includes the elimination of soft money, the unlimited
contributions given to political parties, which is intended for
party building but which has been increasingly used to help elect
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would veto the McCain-Feingold measure.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans dismissed the proposals as more big government and
repeated their contention that Gore has no credibility on the issue
as long as he refuses to explain his past and current fund-raising
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's pitch comes even as he crisscrosses the nation helping
the Democratic National Committee raise millions of dollars and as
Republicans ratchet up their criticism of his past actions,
including his 1996 attendance at a fund-raiser at a Buddhist
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Bush said that ``any promise to reform
our campaign finance system will ring hollow unless it is grounded
in credibility.'' He also characterized the Gore blueprint as ``a
taxpayer-financed government takeover of campaigns that replaces
individual spending decisions with decisions made by an unelected
government committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore are competing for independent voters who were
drawn to the campaign finance message of Republican McCain and
Democratic Bill Bradley in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lewis, who heads the Center for Public Integrity, called
Gore's proposals, ``one of the most elaborate and extensive plans
for cleaning up politics that we've seen in recent years by anyone,
including McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis said because of the vice president's past questionable
behavior he was unsure whether Gore was sincerely interested in
making changes or looking for short-term political cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is there are two Al Gores,'' said Lewis.`` There
is a good Al Gore and a bad Al Gore. There is the Boy Scout and
intense competitive pragmatic who would step over his grandmother.
Today we got the Boy Scout.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis and others said that Bush does not have the record to
credibly challenge Gore on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has never been enthusiastic about campaign finance
reform, Bush was pressured during the primaries to roll out a
modest series of changes, including the elimination of soft money
contributions from corporations and unions but not from
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor also recommended more than tripling the
amount individuals can give to candidates in order to keep up with
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Gore slammed his rival's proposals, saying, ``Believe it or not
Governor Bush wants to open the floodgates even wider to special
interests donors and big money.'' .
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Gore has gone further than Bush in embracing
McCain's ideas, and praised the Arizona senator several times in
his Milwaukee speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, McCain said he welcomed ``any good-faith
proposal to reform our broken campaign finance system.'' But he
added, ``the vice president needs to back his action with
meaningful bipartisan action, as well as call for a complete and
open investigation of 1996 campaign finance irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   The most innovative piece of Gore's plan is his proposal to
supplant the current system of private fund-raising with public-
private financing for congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   The general election for presidents is already financed by
taxpayers, with the revenue raised through the voluntary check-offs
on the income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for general elections for House and Senate seats, Gore
proposed the establishment over seven years of a $7 billion
endowment fund, financed by voluntary and tax deductible
contributions from corporations, unions, individuals and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates would then be able to draw on the interest income
from the fund to wage their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The allocation would be based on a formula that takes into
account factors such as the cost of past races, population and
media markets in each district.
</P>
<P>
   A board, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate,
would allocate the funds.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign finance analyst questioned whether it was realistic
to expect that most individuals and groups would contribute to a
fund that parcelled out money on a bipartisan basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the motivation or the incentive for these groups to
participate if they cannot designate where the money goes to?''
said Sheila Krumholtz, the research director for the Center for
Responsive Politics.

MISCALCULATIONS BY BOTH SIDES SEEN IN FAILED CLINTON-ASSAD TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Syrian leader, Hafez Assad, was ``immovable''
during his meeting with President Clinton in Geneva, and appeared
to have come with the misconception that Clinton was in a position
to give him what he wanted from Israel, a senior administration
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The administration knew the meeting was a gamble, but believed
it had a better chance of success than proved to be the case, one
diplomat familiar with the lead-up to the meeting and its aftermath
said.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting, Assad gave what amounted to a lecture to
Clinton on the history of the border between Israel and Syria, the
main sticking point between the two sides, the senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had hoped that the encounter on Sunday between
the two leaders, the first in more than five years and a rare
foreign trip for the ailing Syrian, would produce enough common
ground for talks to renew between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Assad was obstinate in his long-held view that there
must be full Israeli withdrawal to the June 4, 1967, Israeli-Syrian
frontier that existed before the Six-Day War. In recent talks with
Israel, Syria insisted on the return of land before holding any
other negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Israelis have suggested a willingness to
return the Golan Heights, but stop short of having Syria back at
the water's edge at the lake of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's meeting, officials here and in the region assert
that the Syrian track of the Middle East process appears all but
dead, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the focus in Israel has switched to the unilateral
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the security zone in southern
Lebanon, and to getting the Palestinian talks into higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, moves toward
taking Israeli soldiers out of Lebanon without an agreement with
Syria, instability in Lebanon is likely to mount, draining any
momentum out of the peace process, diplomats in the region said.
</P>
<P>
   After the three hours of talks in Geneva, administration
officials insisted that the meeting had still been useful gamble,
because it was impossible to know whether the Israeli-Syrian track
could become unstuck without a face-to-face meeting of Clinton and
Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president was able to move him in the past, to get this
whole process started,'' said the senior administration official,
referring to the talks that opened in January in West Virginia but
then broke off.
</P>
<P>
   But from the opening moments of Sunday's session, it appeared
clear to the Americans that Assad was not going to bend.
</P>
<P>
   Assad was described as the most implacable person in his
delegation, which also consisted of Abdul Raouf Al-Qasem, his
national security adviser; Riad Daoudi, his legal adviser; and
Farouk Al Shaara, the Syrian foreign minister, who led the talks in
Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   The administration knew it was playing a high-stakes poker game
with Assad: that with momentum for a peace agreement stalling, and
Clinton's lame-duck stature looming, the gains could be high, but
the losses could be enormous, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But there appeared to be a miscalculation in Washington, a
diplomat familiar with the process with the Syrians said. ``They
thought the chances of winning were greater,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House seems to have believed that Assad would show
some flexibility on the all important June 4, 1967, line: Assad is
demanding that Israel fully withdraw from the land it seized from
Syria in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a flawed notion that Assad would be flexible. ``He
would rather die than not get full withdrawal,'' an Arab official
said Monday of Assad. ``He hasn't changed his mind in 30 years, and
he is not going to change his mind in a couple of hours in
Geneva.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the meeting, the national security adviser,
Samuel R. Berger, said there was no certainty of a positive
outcome. But he portrayed a situation in which Clinton would
explain to Assad ``why he believes that negotiations can resume in
a serious fashion,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely result, Berger predicted, was that Assad would
return to Damascus, that Clinton would confer with Barak and on the
basis of those conversations a ``serious round'' of talks would
begin.

EDITORIAL: PRESSURING THE POWER PLANTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, March 28:
</P>
<P>
   Each new day seems to bring further proof that something must be
done to limit the pollutants that originate in the coal-fired power
plants of the Midwest and are carried by air currents into the
Northeastern United States, where they contribute mightily to urban
smog and acid rain. The latest evidence is a survey conducted by
the General Accounting Office. It found a big reduction in one of
the pollutants, sulfur dioxide, but a dramatic rise in another
pollutant, nitrogen oxide, which is accelerating the decline of
many Northeastern lakes and streams, particularly in New York
state's Adirondacks region.
</P>
<P>
   The report is one more reason for state and federal officials to
keep pressing their legal and regulatory efforts to force the
Midwestern polluters to clean up their plants. It also sends an
important signal to Congress, which has two opportunities to
address the problem. One is a bill sponsored by three New Yorkers _
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, and Reps. Sherwood
Boehlert and John Sweeney, Republicans _ that would require a 50
percent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions below those required
by the 1990 Clean Air Act. The other is a broader effort by
Boehlert and like-minded Democrats to require stiff new controls on
dirty power plants as part of any bill deregulating the utility
industry. Such a bill would be aimed not only at reducing pollution
but at leveling the playing field in an industry where dirty power
tends to be cheaper than clean power.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' responsibility here arises from the fact that the 1990
act did not fully address the complex sources of acid rain, which
has been killing off fish in Adirondack waterways for many years.
At the time, sulfur dioxide was believed to be the overwhelming
cause of acid rain, so the act not only mandated sharp sulfur
dioxide reductions nationwide but set up an innovative emissions
trading scheme that great reduced industry's costs of compliance.
By contrast, the act gave industry a more leisurely timetable for
reducing nitrogen oxides, and also spared hundreds of the oldest,
dirtiest power plants from tough new controls in the false
expectation that they would soon be retired.
</P>
<P>
   Power industry officials contend that because the nitrogen oxide
requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act did not kick in until 1996,
more time is needed to study their effects before imposing tighter
standards. But the 1990 requirements still need strengthening, if
only because they do not address the older, ``grandfathered''
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also asserts that reducing emissions from
coal-burning utilities will not solve the problem because one-third
of the nation's nitrogen oxide comes from cars and trucks. But even
if such vehicle emissions made a big difference in the Adirondacks,
for which there is little evidence, that is no reason not to
tighten controls on the utilities. It is past time for these
companies to start cleaning up. If they will not, Congress should
make them.

CORDOVA ENDS UP WITH THE BLUE JAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNEDIN, Fla. _ It was the shortest goodbye of the spring. Marty
Cordova packed his bags Sunday morning, wished the Red Sox luck,
and then said he was off to sign with either the Yankees or Blue
Jays. Twenty-four hours later, he was in uniform, greeting the team
he had just left.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox played the Blue Jays Monday at Dunedin Stadium. When
they got here, they saw Cordova in Jays garb, wearing No. 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised to see him,'' Sox manager Jimy Williams said.
``I didn't know he was coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordova signed a one-year deal with the Jays. If he makes the
team, he will be a fourth or fifth outfielder. Toronto is committed
to a starting outfield of Junior Cruz, Shannon Stewart, and Raul
Mondesi. Cordova thought he would have a similar role with Boston,
but the team did not put the 30-year-old outfielder on its 40-man
roster. As a result, Cordova's two-year contract was not triggered
and, eventually, the Sox gave him his release and $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Cordova to distinguish himself during
Toronto's 8-6 win. In the first inning, Cordova _ who started in
left field _ made a diving catch of a Carl Everett liner. He also
had an error in the third. He was hitless in two at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Offerman's off fast
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman had three hits Monday (single, double, home run),
boosting his spring average to .449. Offerman led off in a Sox
lineup that did not include Nomar Garciaparra, John Valentin, Trot
Nixon, Troy O'Leary, and Mike Stanley. The reconfigured lineup
featured Gary Gaetti batting cleanup and Donnie Sadler (who also
homered) playing short and batting ninth . . . The team didn't have
much to report on the status of Rod Beck. The reliever has a stiff
neck and may have to begin the season on the disabled list . . .
New Blue Jay Mondesi hit two home runs to left field. On both of
them, Sox left fielder Israel Alcantara never left his crouch as
the ball headed well over the fence toward a cluster of trees . . .
Garciaparra is one of the coverboys on the latest issue of GQ
Magazine. He is joined by shortstops Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter
. . . This was a homecoming for Williams. He has lived in this
small city since 1984 . . . There were eight home runs hit Monday.
Williams was asked if the number of long shots surprised him. ``Did
you see the hawk out there?'' he said. ``That hawk was pretty
good.'' Translation: There was a strong wind blowing out. Hawk or
no hawk, Carlos Delgado hit a tremendous homer to center that was
estimated at 450 feet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Liquid diet kept 'em fit
</P>
<P>
   Protein shakes are the current fad among young and fit players.
Gaetti, who is 41, was asked about the fad when he was breaking
into the big leagues in the early 1980s. ``Hamms on tap,'' he said
with a laugh, describing himself and some of his beer-drinking
teammates . . . You could say that Everett had an interactive day
with the fans. Following batting practice, he was one of the few
Sox who stopped and signed autographs. A good cook, Everett used
the session to counsel some fans about food preparation. ``You've
got to know that mom isn't always going to cook for you,'' he said.
During the game, Everett lost control of his bat, and it went
flying over the first-base dugout and into the stands. The damage:
one spilled beer and one facial cut, which was treated with an ice
pack . . . Brian Daubach and Sadler hit their first home runs of
the spring. Jeff Frye made his second start in the outfield, went 2
for 5 and scored 2 runs . . . Williams stopped short of endorsing
lefty Sang Hoon Lee. ``The last two lefthanders he's faced with the
bases loaded, he's walked them both,'' the manager said. ``Just
being honest.''

OPEC MINISTERS FAIL TO AGREE ON OUTPUT IN FIRST DAY OF TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ OPEC oil ministers stumbled Monday in their
bid to reach a quick agreement on how much more oil to pump out to
world markets.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson's office aggravated an
already tense situation by calling the Qatari oil minister in the
middle of a sensitive negotiating session, which rankled an Iranian
delegation already annoyed by a heavy lobbying campaign from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
remained divided late Monday, with Iran leading the opposition to
accept a Saudi Arabian proposal to raise the group's output ceiling
by 1.7 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Iran in opposition to the Saudi proposal was Algerian
Oil Minister Chakib Khelil, who had arrived in Vienna preaching
``consensus'' and ``solidarity.'' He left the official opening
round of the talks, however, saying his country wanted to limit any
production increase to 1.5 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices fell on the news Monday, with crude futures for
delivery in May dropping 23 cents to close at $27.79 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   April heating oil was 1.14 cents lower to 73.73 cents a gallon;
April unleaded gasoline fell 0.20 cent to 94.69 cents a gallon;
April natural gas was up 7.8 cents to $2.914 per thousand cubic
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Oil ministers will resume negotiations Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, OPEC's second-largest producer, has little incentive to
accept a sizable increase in the OPEC production. Iran has little
spare capacity, meaning it would share in little of the benefits of
expanding production but would suffer from the resulting drop in
prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the specter of the cartel's disastrous
November 1997 meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia _ the last time the
OPEC producers agreed to increase their production ceiling _ hangs
heavy over the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   That decision to boost production, at a time when the Asian
economies were in turmoil and demand for oil in the Far East had
softened, helped send oil prices crashing below $11 a barrel to
record lows when adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC producers then were forced to cut back their production
in three stages. Last year, the 10 key OPEC members _ Iraq is still
answerable to the U.N. Nations Security Council and was not party
to that accord _ reduced their output by 1.7 million barrels a day
and then adhered to the deal far more closely than most observers
had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   That sent prices swinging upward again, hitting nine-year highs
just three weeks ago and prompting the current calls for another
sizable increase.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been putting intense pressure on OPEC in
recent weeks in the hopes of getting the cartel to raise production
substantially. Richardson has made numerous visits to the producing
nations, trying to prod them into increasing their output.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled House last week passed a bill
authorizing the Clinton administration to cut off military and
economic aid to any producing nation trying to force up the price
of oil.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC officials in Vienna have complained that high-profile
pressure has made it more difficult for them at home to sell the
idea of a production increase.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the 11 OPEC ministers, chased by hordes of news
reporters, gathered at the Hilton Hotel for an informal negotiating
session that many hoped would lead to the signing of an accord.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in the middle of the meeting, Richardson's office
telephoned the Qatari delegation, led by Abdullah al-Attiayah, the
president of the OPEC conference, two OPEC delegates said. The
session ended with no agreement in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh said later, ``We
don't like to make an agreement under political pressure from the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the call and the subsequent fallout, an Energy
Department spokesperson said, ``We don't take this report
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Raad Alkadiri, a country analyst with the Washington-based
Petroleum Finance Co., described the telephone call as ``parochial
and shortsighted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly complicating OPEC's decision-making,'' Alkadiri
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, will try to relieve
some of motorists' pain at the pump by temporarily repealing the
federal 18.4-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC watchers, however, argue such a move would encourage the
organization not to increase production as much as it otherwise
might, since the pressure from angry U.S. motorists, and hence
Washington, would be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do that, the Senate is playing into OPEC's hands; it's
as simple as that,'' said Medhi Varzi, director of research for
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in London. The OPEC producers have long
called on the producing nations to reduce taxes on petroleum
products, and thus, help encourage demand for crude. ``This is
manna from heaven to OPEC.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1.7 million-barrel-a-day proposal being floated would
effectively reverse the cutbacks orchestrated a year ago. But that
proposal would not add as many barrels as the number would suggest,
and certainly not as much as the Clinton administration would like.
</P>
<P>
   The cartel members now are widely flouting their production
ceilings, with the estimates of the quota cheating ranging from 1.2
million to 1.5 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, meanwhile, has vowed to kick up its production by 700,000
barrels a day within a few weeks. While few analysts believe
Baghdad could make good on such a pledge, they do believe the
Iraqis could soon be exporting another 300,000 barrels a day or so.
</P>
<P>
   To help keep oil prices out of the $30 range, a price most OPEC
countries think is too high, the cartel is looking for help from
some nonaligned producers.
</P>
<P>
   Four non-OPEC countries _ Mexico, Russia, Oman and Angola _ are
also attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Energy Minister Luis Tellez was quoted in a Mexican
publication as indicating his country planned to increase
production by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day. But Deputy Mexican
Energy Minister Jorge Chavez said Monday in Vienna that the report
was incorrect and that his country would make no specific
production pledge.

SUTTON LETS HIS CLUBS DO THE TALKING IN WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ He has visited ``hell on earth
before,'' so Hal Sutton wasn't about to back down from a few holes
of golf with anyone. Not even Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the greatest player in the game,'' said Sutton, ``but
you know what? I am not praying to him, so he is not God, for
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton had used different sets of words to make that point
earlier in the week, and he was forced to do so again and again and
again as he stayed in the lead of The Players Championship at TPC
Sawgrass. Finally, after completing just the fourth wire-to-wire
victory in this prestigous championship by holding off Woods in the
rain-delayed final round Monday, Sutton had delivered his message
in a way that cannot possibly be misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got nervous as heck, knowing the big deal that had been made
(of going head-to-head with Woods),'' said Sutton, 41, after
finishing at 10-under 278 to beat Woods by a stroke and become the
oldest winner of this championship. ``But I am proud to have beaten
him. What else can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't need to, because a bogey-free final round of 1-under
71 in which he hit 17 greens spoke volumes. The fact that it took
two days to complete and threw him into the trenches with arguably
the most dynamic sports personality in the world _ a player who has
been on a roll the likes of which golf has rarely seen _ made the
assignment that much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there Sutton was at 9 in the morning, holding a three-shot
lead over Woods and standing over a sand wedge from 82 yards to the
12th green. Sutton caught the shot heavy and settled for par, but
picked up a shot when Woods, whose day ended Sunday with his ball
on the green some 40 feet from the hole, three-putted.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had spent extra time making long putts before the round
resumed and approached his first shot of the day with confidence.
``I was sure of the speed and knew how important that putt was for
pace. It had the perfect pace.''
</P>
<P>
   But not the perfect line, for it rode too far left on a ridge,
missed the right break it needed to take, and fell hard left. He
pulled the 4-footer coming back and was now four back.
</P>
<P>
   That's a minor obstacle for a player who rallied from seven
shots down with seven holes to play (AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am in February), a fact that Woods quickly reminded us of. He
stuck his shot within 5 feet on the par-3 13th to set up birdie and
cut the deficit to three. Then, after matching Sutton's pars at 14
and 15, Woods attacked the par-5 16th.
</P>
<P>
   He had not birdied any of the previous three par 5s in the final
round _ and wasn't thinking birdie here, either. Water runs down
the entire right side of the 507-yard hole and with the pin cut
back right, the safe play was the middle of the green and let the
slope funnel the ball toward the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Woods, however. He opted to ``slide a 5-iron in there''
from 195 yards and slide it did _ coming to rest 15 feet from the
pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was planning on him making that eagle putt,'' said Sutton,
to whom the 16th was a three-shot hole in soft conditions resulting
from Sunday night's heavy rain. ``I hope me planning on it didn't
force it in the hole for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful. That can be credited to a ``Tiger moment,'' which it
most certainly was. Knowing Sutton would make no better than par
(which he did), Woods understood the gravity of the situation, so
he opted to let the players on the nearby 17th tee hit. Then he
rolled the eagle dead-center to cut Sutton's lead to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made Hal work for it,'' said Woods, who shot 71 and has now
finished first or second in 10 of the last 11 PGA Tour events in
which he has played.
</P>
<P>
   At the island green 17th, Woods grabbed pitching wedge and took
aim 145 yards away at a flagstick cut front right over water that
had drenched many a player's dreams. ``The wind kept switching. I
felt a gust come up straight downwind so I shortened my golf swing
and played for the wind,'' said Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Only the gust, he said, died quickly and his shot landed on the
front of the green and spun back and sat down in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton was next to hit on a hole that is hated by many, though
no one denies its capacity for drama. ``There was no way I was
going to fire at that pin,'' he said, knowing he hade splashed one
in Round 3 to make triple-bogey and watch his four-shot lead shrink
to one. He negotiated his shot to the middle of the green, got down
in two to match Woods's par, and took his one-shot lead to the 18th
tee.
</P>
<P>
   It is the toughest closing hole these PGA Tour players
encounter, and for Sutton the task got tougher when Woods did the
unthinkable _ slam a 2-iron off the tee at a 447-yard hole. ``I was
really shocked when he pulled out his iron,'' said Sutton. ``I
thought to myself, `Maybe I ought to back off and hit 3-wood.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Sutton remembered who he is _ arguably the best
ball-striker around _ and from how far he had come _ a personal
life in turmoil and a professional game that had disintegrated so
badly he was embarrassed to be on the same range with his
colleagues. So he grabbed driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `I think I am one of the best drivers in the
game, so I am going to play to my strength,''' said Sutton, who
busted one down the right side and turned it beautifully in the
middle of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   It set up a 6-iron from 179 yards, which Sutton deposited some
12 feet below the pin, an easy two-putt to nail down the victory.
Woods had gone long with his approach and failed to chip in,
proving, as Sutton said, the kid was beatable.
</P>
<P>
   There was a $1,080,000 first-place prize, though the true source
of Sutton's happiness does not wear a price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of courage to play this golf course in
itself,'' said Sutton. ``Then, when you have got Tiger running
rampant out there, that makes it that much more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But not so difficult that he was going to back down.

BANK ONE CORP. NAMES DIMON CHAIRMAN AND CEO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bank One Corp., rocked by a series of management blunders and
earnings shortfalls following one of the biggest mergers in banking
history, on Monday named James Dimon as its chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon, 44, one of the most well-regarded executives on Wall
Street, is himself a casualty of the recent merger boom in banking.
He was forced out of the presidency of financial-services giant
Citigroup in 1998 after an acrimonious and highly publicized
falling out with that company's co-chief executive, Sanford I.
Weill.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon faces an enormous challenge in turning around Bank One,
which is based in Chicago and has seen its profitability shredded
by, among other things, serious problems at its enormous credit
card operation, First USA. Bank One, which has $269.4 billion in
assets and is the fourth-largest bank in the country, has been the
subject of rampant takeover speculation ever since it began
announcing earnings shortfalls last August.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon said in a conference call Monday that the bank was not for
sale and that the company's board shared his desire to keep Bank
One independent. Dimon said the board had not given him a deadline
for restoring Bank One's profitability and reviving employee
morale.
</P>
<P>
   While Dimon, who goes by the nickname Jamie, is considered
extremely capable, his experience has largely been limited to the
corridors of Wall Street investment banks, not the hallways of Main
Street retail banks like Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie's young, he's inspiring, he's charismatic, and he's got
proven leadership abilities,'' said David Berry, a banking analyst
with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``On the other hand, he's never run a
bank before _ he's a brokerage guy and I would have thought he
would have stayed on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimon, however, took issue with that viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we had a big retail brokerage
operation,'' said Dimon, referring to his tenure overseeing
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney investment banking unit. ``I think
that's fundamentally inaccurate because I understand retail
financial services.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Dimon's new job leaked out before the close of stock
market trading Monday, and Bank One's share price rose smartly on
an otherwise lackluster day for bank stocks. In trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, the shares rose $2.75, to $31.125, on
extremely heavy volume. Just last May, Bank One's shares were
trading at a 52-week high of $63.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon, who is moving his family to Chicago from New York, said
he plans to spend $2 million of his own money snapping up Bank One
shares. He declined to say how much Bank One was paying him to come
aboard, but his days on Wall Street and as Weill's right-hand man
had already left him a very wealthy man. His departure from
Citigroup alone netted him a severance package valued at about $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the musical-chairs-like quality of Monday's
announcement, Verne G. Istock, who has been Bank One's acting chief
executive since December, will leave that post but remain as
president. Istock replaced the bank's former chief executive, John
B. McCoy, who was forced to resign by the board because of the
managerial snafus and financial mishaps at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One was created by the 1998 merger of McCoy's bank, Bank
One of Columbus, Ohio, and Istock's bank, First Chicago NBD. At the
time of the merger, it was heralded as yet another example of the
advantages of size and consolidation in the banking industry. Yet
Bank One's problems have shown that size, untethered to realistic
business strategies or sound management, can quickly overwhelm
corporate managers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other banks, including First Union and Bank of America, have
been plagued with post-merger problems, while still others, like
Wells Fargo and Citigroup, have fared relatively well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is how do you run a big regional bank?'' said
Keefe Bruyette's Berry. ``Some have done it well in recent years
and some have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said, however, that Dimon had a good chance of
reversing Bank One's downward spiral. His biggest challenge will be
reviving the credit card operation _ the second-largest in the
country after Citigroup _ which in good times contributed as much
as a third of Bank One's total profits. Bank One also recently put
its online banking operation, Wingspan, up for sale in yet another
blow to the bank's credibility. Bankers with direct knowledge of
Wingspan's financial statements said that Bank One lost about $150
million in pretax dollars on the venture last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that I don't think the problems at Bank
One are intractable, despite how badly things have gone at First
USA,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``I
don't think it's something that a dynamic, creative executive can't
address.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank One began searching for a new chief executive in
mid-January. It initially contacted 32 candidates for the job,
winnowing that list down to 10 executives who were interviewed. Of
that group, five executives were interviewed in depth. By late last
week, the survivors of the search were Dimon and Lewis W. Coleman,
the chairman of Bank of America's investment banking arm, Bank of
America Securities. Coleman was unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When Citicorp and Travelers Group merged in 1998 to form
Citigroup, Dimon was widely considered to be the person most likely
to run what is now the largest financial services concern in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon had spent years assisting Weill as he built Travelers from
the ground up into a major player in the insurance industry and on
Wall Street. The two men were very close, and many around them
considered them to be almost like a father and a son.
</P>
<P>
   But, following the departure of Weill's daughter from Travelers,
and in other twists worthy of Shakespeare, Weill eventually
maneuvered to have Dimon forced out of Citigroup just a few months
after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been periodic speculation about Dimon's
next move, speculation that ended Monday. Dimon joked freely Monday
about his ouster from Citigroup, saying he hoped it was the last
time in his career he would lose his job that way.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Citigroup has been pegged as one of the companies
that might attempt to buy Bank One some day _ a deal that, if it
were to occur, would return Dimon to his former employer.

officially dates back to 1965, when Congress dropped the hated

quotas that favored family ties. In some ways the act was a
surrender to the status quo. Today, most immigrants fall into one

belief in the American Dream. Look around the United States _ not
only at the affluent Indian programmers in Silicon Valley and the
newly self-confident Latino middle class in Los Angeles, but at the
undernourished Uzbek children in Queens or the wretched Tejanos on
the Texas/Mexico border _ and you will find the drive is still
there. The rest of the country must not waste it...By John

   Thanks to immigration, America has once again assembled a team
of people who have shown their willingness to compete and their
belief in the American Dream. Look around the United States _ not
only at the affluent Indian programmers in Silicon Valley and the
newly self-confident Latino middle class in Los Angeles, but at the
undernourished Uzbek children in Queens or the wretched Tejanos on
the Texas/Mexico border _ and you will find the drive is still
there. The rest of the country must not waste it...By John

 &HT;    Al-Amin indictment possible today
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fulton County authorities are expected to seek a
murder indictment today against Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin and begin
the process of bringing him back to Atlanta to face trial for the
slaying of Deputy Ricky Kinchen.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes has indicated he won't begin extradition
proceedings until Al-Amin is indicted. The Fulton County grand jury
did not produce an indictment Friday but meets again today, its
other regular meeting day.
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, law enforcement officials say tests have shown
that the .223 caliber Ruger Mini-14 and the Browning Hi-Power 9 mm
pistol recovered when Al-Amin was arrested in Alabama are the
weapons that fired the shell casings found at the murder scene in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This gives prosecutors much stronger evidence to present to the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the tests, the only known evidence linkng Al-Amin to
the killing was an identification made by deputy Aldranon English,
who was severely wounded in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County, Ala., District Court Judge Lynn Bright set
April 12 for a probable cause hearing on the federal fugitive
charges on which Al-Amin is being held. In the meantime, she ruled,
Al-Amin will have to continue spending 23 hours a day in solitary
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will have conditions more to his liking when he is
returned to Georgia is uncertain, because it has not been
determined where he will be held. Sgt. Clarence Huber, a spokesman
for the Fulton County sheriff's department, said it is unlikely he
will be kept in the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he is charged with killing a Fulton County deputy, this
would not be the best place to keep him,'' Huber said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's lawyers have vowed to fight the extradition, and how
long it takes to return the suspect to Georgia depends largely on
how much time the Alabama court gives them to prepare their
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   After Barnes signs the order and sends it with accompanying
documents to the Alabama governor, he will pass it on to the
district attorney in Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney must then formally notify Al-Amin of the
charges against him in Georgia, and the fact that Georgia wants him
returned to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Assistant Attorney General Daryl A. Robinson
said, the suspect's attorney can begin his fight by filing a formal
challenge to the extradition papers.
</P>
<P>
   Only two issues can be challenged, according to the federal
Uniform Extradition Act: the validity of the extradition papers and
whether the man in jail in Montgomery is the one named in the
warrant or indictment.
</P>
<P>
   A judge will set a date that gives both parties time to prepare
their case, and that can be the single most time-consuming step in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, Robinson said, the judge will rule at the conclusion
of the hearing.

   What could be more basic to life than a drink of water? Yet more
than a billion people have no access to safe water. Three times as
many lack adequate sanitation. World demand for fresh water is
expected to grow sharply, by 70 percent (for household use) by
2025. Shortages seem inevitable _ and even war. This dismal

   Taiwan's election, which ended 50 years of Nationalist rule and
chose as the island's next president Chen Shui-bian, the candidate
of a hitherto pro-independence party, is a clear rebuff to China's
Communists, who claim Taiwan as their own. What will China do now?
The only solution remains for the two sides to decide together,
through negotiation, whether they are to be one China or two. But
as Taiwan changes and China grows ever more inflexible, that
becomes more difficult. Even if a crisis is averted this time, be
prepared for the next one. &QL;

   Pour boiling water on a frog and it will jump away; heat it up
slowly in a pot of cold water, and it will die. America's Federal
Reserve, which raised short-term interest rates by another
quarter-point to 6 percent on March 21, may need reminding of this
tale. The Fed's strategy of slowing an overheating economy by
raising rates gradually might prove just as risky for America _ and
so for the world economy, as well. &QL;

   In ``American Beauty,'' the movie favored to sweep the Oscars
Sunday night, Lester and Carolyn Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey
and Annette Bening) live in a picture-perfect house in the suburbs,
with a manicured lawn and a white picket fence. Although ``American
Beauty'' is somewhat redeemed by fine acting, the film overall
recycles a tired cliche of suburbia _ that they are vortexes of
tedium and alienation _ which has been a staple of artistic

getting less accurate by the day, as the suburbs mutate in all

   Oil has become a volatile substance. The world is producing
about 75 million barrels a day (b/d) of the stuff; it is consuming
about 77 million b/d. Nobody likes it that way. Producers and
consumers alike speak of their desire for stable oil prices. Yet
only in times of war or revolution has the price been wilder. Which
is one reason why, as OPEC gathers for its annual meeting in Vienna
on March 27, the hardest question is what will happen next? &QL;

INTERIOR SECRETARY OUTLINES NEW PLAN FOR YOSEMITE PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES with MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Long a victim of its own success, Yosemite
National Park would be returned to a wilder condition with major
reductions in parking spaces, roads and bridges and the elimination
of buildings and other structures in the park under a plan outlined
here on Monday by Bruce Babbitt, the secretary of the interior
</P>
<P>
   In the second attempt in two years to reduce the blight of
pollution and overcrowding that sometimes makes the roads in
Yosemite National Park feel like the Los Angeles Freeway, Babbitt
described a blueprint that would make major changes in the ways
visitors enjoy the park.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier plan led to major public opposition by proposing a
ban on most private cars in Yosemite Valley. The new plan is a
scaled-back version that calls for tearing out many parking lots
and roads in the eastern, most scenic parts of the valley, as well
as three bridges and the Cascades Dam, which interrupt the flow of
the Merced River.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would replace the parking lots with three new lots at
the edges of the park from which visitors would take shuttle buses
into the valley. Areas of the park that were destroyed by a New
Year's Day flood in 1997 would be part of the roughly 180 acres
restored to natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yosemite Valley is one of nature's most awesome creations,''
Babbitt said in a luncheon speech here at the Commonwealth Club.
``Over the years, roads and bridges and structures have been
constructed which, in some cases, have contributed to the sprawl
and crowding that visitors to Yosemite are trying to avoid. In
Yosemite, we're using the lessons and impetus from the New Year's
Day flood in 1997 to help adapt visitors to the needs and forces of
nature in the valley, rather than the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   With its 3,000-foot granite walls and world-famous falls and
views, Yosemite Valley drew nearly 4 million visitors last year.
</P>
<P>
   Love of nature and love of the automobile have collided head-on;
on peak days, rangers have lowered the gates of the park to prevent
more cars from entering. Air in the valley is on the edge of
violating Environmental Protection Agency standards, said Dave
Mihalic, the park superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, called the Yosemite Valley Plan, will undergo a series
of public hearings from Washington state to Chicago as well as
throughout California.
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of what seems an oxymoronic task for the National
Park Service to keep Yosemite fully accessible yet return it to its
pristine natural beauty, the plan drew mixed reviews from
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Watson, the western regional director of the Wilderness
Society, hailed what he called ``a significant reduction in cars,''
which he said would help restore the valley.
</P>
<P>
   But Friends of Yosemite Valley, which has sued the National Park
Service over the expansion of the Yosemite Lodge and the widening
of the major access road to the valley, said the plan did more to
retain Yosemite's profits than its nature. The group denounced the
plan's 1,600 new parking spaces, additional restaurant space, road
expansion and a diesel bus system.
</P>
<P>
   David Brower, a conservation movement leader who attended the
announcement, said, ``This plan has smoke, mirrors and hesitation
in it, and as we all know he who hesitates is lost, and is ready to
make a down payment on the liquidation of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Sierra Club, based in San Francisco, were not
happy either. They said the Interior Department should have
postponed the plan until after a separate study of the Merced River
was completed. Last year, a federal court judge in Fresno ordered
the study of the river, which runs through the heart of Yosemite
Valley, after the Sierra Club sued the Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no decision of record on the river,'' said Joyce Eden
of the Sierra Club, adding that the river plan should have driven
the valley plan.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen L. Hayes, a spokesman for the Mariposa County Visitors
Bureau, spoke favorably of the plan. ``I think some people can have
a really good experience by leaving the car behind and riding the
bus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said the plan was based on the broad goals outlined for
the park 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Those goals _ reducing traffic congestion, reclaiming natural
beauty, allowing natural processes to prevail, promoting visitor
understanding and enjoyment and reducing overcrowding _ could be
reached with considerable public help, Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will be available for public comment and review from
April 7 to July 5. The plan is available on the National Park
Service's Web site, www.nps.gov/yose/planning.htm.

U.S. TAKES STEPS TO SEND BOY BACK TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Updates, adds quotes) 
(jt) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday
to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to
take custody of the 6-year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as
early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a federal appeals court in Atlanta said it
would hear arguments in the case during the week of May 8, an
action that may make it more difficult for the Justice Department
to put its plan into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials laid the groundwork for taking
control of Elian by asserting that the boy's Miami relatives had
failed to comply with a government request to say explicitly that
they would not block his return to his father Cuba if they lost
their court fight.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the officials said, they were considering revoking
an earlier decision allowing Elian to live with the relatives in
Miami who have cared for him since he was rescued at sea in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Officials scheduled a meeting early Tuesday morning at the
regional offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
Miami with the lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives to try to
resolve the situation. But Justice Department officials warned that
they would insist on an unambiguous statement from the relatives
that if they lost the legal appeals they would not obstruct efforts
to return Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the relatives and their lawyers have said repeatedly
that they would not violate any laws in their efforts to keep Elian
in the United States. But they have declined to be more specific
and to comply with the Justice Department's demand.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, said in an
interview, ``We have said and we continue to affirm that the family
will obey the law.'' But asked if that means that the family agrees
to accept sending Elian back if the courts rule against them,
Coffey said that he was ``reluctant to speak to that because we are
far from that moment.'' He said that he thought the general
statement that the family would comply with the law was ``more than
sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers disagree, regarding the careful
statements by the family lawyers as holding on to their options to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, David J. Kline, a lawyer in the Justice Department's
immigration office, said that the government had the authority to
terminate permission for Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzales to
have temporary custody of the boy. But Kline said the agency would
agree to that only if the relatives said clearly they would send
Elian back three days after they lost in the appeals court unless
they obtained an injunction from a court allowing them to file an
expedited appeal with the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Kline also demanded that Elian's family in Miami agree to an
expedited schedule of arguments before the appeals court that would
have the case argued and ready for a decision by April 4. But the
appeals court Monday may have made the department's case more
difficult by agreeing to a slower schedule
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have grown increasingly impatient
with the tactics of the family. Some officials said that they might
well move to take control of Elian and send him back to Cuba while
the appeals are not yet completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been more than generous,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have mounted a legal campaign to keep Elian
in the United States as supporters in Congress and many in Miami's
large Cuban-American community have rallied to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to a rubber tube last Nov. 25 after the
boat he, his mother, and several others used in their attempt to
come to the United States capsized. Elian's mother and most of the
other passengers drowned.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of the Miami relatives to keep Elian in the United
States suffered a setback last week when a federal judge dismissed
a lawsuit requesting a political asylum hearing for the boy,
concluding that a long, bitter legal battle was not in Elian's best
interest.

BIOTECHNOLOGY DISPUTE OVER PATENT FOR DRUG THERAPY GOES TO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A legal showdown began here Monday that could determine
whether some of the biotechnology industry's most lucrative drugs
will be vulnerable to lower-priced competition.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is Transkaryotic Therapies Inc., a tiny company with
technology that could allow it to circumvent patents on drugs
produced by genetic engineering. In partnership with Aventis, the
big European drug company, it wants to sell its version of Amgen
Inc.'s Epogen, the biotechnology industry's best-selling drug with
worldwide sales of $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen, which has become the biotechnology industry's superstar
largely on the strength of Epogen, has filed a patent infringement
lawsuit to protect its product.
</P>
<P>
   The trial at the United States District Court comes at a time of
growing controversy over biotechnology patents. The issues in this
case are different from the recent furor over whether human genome
data should be patented. Still, the case could touch on one of the
fundamental questions of the biotechnology age _ just how far
patents can extend to cover a substance found in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the immediate stakes involved with Epogen, which is used
to prevent anemia in kidney dialysis patients, a validation of
Transkaryotic's technology could lead to cheaper versions of some
other biotechnology drugs. These include such wonder drugs as human
growth hormone; alpha or beta interferon, drugs used for treating
hepatitis C and multiple sclerosis, respectively; or Amgen's other
billion-dollar product, Neupogen, which counters the adverse
effects of chemotherapy. Indeed, TKT, as Transkaryotic is usually
called, says it has six other drugs, which it will not identify,
under development using its technology that could eventually
challenge products from other companies that are now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does raise the specter and concern that there could be a
generic biotech product,'' said Elise Wang, biotechnology analyst
at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   But if that might be bad news for investors in some of the
established biotechnology companies, it could be good news for
consumers and health insurers, because bio-engineered drugs are
some of the most expensive in the world, in part because they face
little competition.
</P>
<P>
   Epogen costs about $8,000 a year for kidney dialysis patients.
Cerezyme, which produces sales of about $500 million a year for the
Genzyme Corp. and is used to treat a rare hereditary disease, costs
about $170,000 a year for each patient.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Genzyme agreed last year to acquire Cell Genesys Inc., a
company with technology similar to Transkaryotic's, in part to
obtain patents it thought it could use to block competition from
TKT. The acquisition fell apart, however, for unrelated reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to other drugs besides Epogen will not materialize
for years because Transkaryotic, which is based in Cambridge,
Mass., has not started clinical trials on any of the other six
products it is developing. And even Amgen might be less vulnerable
than first appears.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the stakes so high, investors are watching the case
closely. At its health care industry investment conference in
January, Chase H&AMP;Q invited 40 of its top institutional investor
clients to an exclusive dinner at which two law firms presented a
tutorial on the case. PaineWebber hired a lawyer to conduct
conference calls analyzing the results of preliminary hearings that
began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people, including some Wall Street analysts and
investors in the companies involved, attended Monday's hearing, in
which Judge William Young began to interpret some of Amgen's patent
claims. The actual trial is scheduled to begin sometime next month.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's stock, which fell sharply last week on jitters about the
case, rose $5.8125, or 10.7 percent Monday, closing at $60.375, as
Young sided with Amgen on the first term in dispute.
Transkaryotic's stock fell $7.875 to $70.25.
</P>
<P>
   At risk for Amgen is a chunk of its $1.8 billion in annual sales
of Epogen, which is also used to treat anemia in patients
undergoing chemotherapy. Equally threatened is Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
which has an estimated $2 billion or more in sales of the drug,
which it calls Procrit, under license from Amgen. But with many
other products in their arsenal, neither company's fate rests on
the outcome of the patent dispute.
</P>
<P>
   If Transkaryotic loses, on the other hand, it would deal a
severe, though probably not fatal, blow to the company, which as
yet has no products or profits. ``If TKT loses, it's a $30 stock,''
said Anders Hove, a representative of BB Biotech, a Swiss investor
that owns about 12 percent of Transkaryotic. ``If they win it is a
$150 to $200 stock in three weeks.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Epogen, generically known as erythropoietin, or EPO, is a
protein produced in the kidney that stimulates the production of
red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen produces it using recombinant DNA, or gene-splicing,
technology. It clones the human gene governing the production of
EPO and implants the gene into hamster ovary cells, which then make
the protein.
</P>
<P>
   Transkaryotic uses what it calls gene-activation technology. It
relies on the fact that all human cells have a complete set of
genes, even though the gene for producing EPO is not active except
in kidney cells. So Transkaryotic inserts an ``on switch'' into
human cells grown in culture, activating the gene for EPO. The
switch is surrounded by genetic sequences that match those found
upstream of the EPO gene on chromosome. That guides the switch to
the spot where it will turn on the EPO gene and not any other gene.
</P>
<P>
   Transkaryotic argues that its process is distinct from gene
splicing and was not even envisioned when Amgen got its first
patents in the 1980's, and therefore does not infringe on Amgen's
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that we're doing something fundamentally different,''
said Dr. Richard F. Selden, Transkaryotic's founder and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen, however, has five patents related to EPO that together
claim to cover all versions of EPO made in cells of vertebrates.
``Amgen's claim for EPO are not limited to recombinant products,''
Rusty Day, an attorney representing Amgen, told the court Monday.
``They are much broader than recombinant products.''
</P>
<P>
   A key issue in the case, which was filed in 1997, is whether
Amgen's patents will be interpreted that broadly.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's hearing, for instance, the attorney for
Transkaryotic and Aventis argued that the term ``vertebrate'' cells
should not include human cells. But Young said he would take the
term at its face value, to include human cells.
</P>
<P>
   Transkaryotic argues the patents should not include all EPO
because Amgen did not invent the substance. Other scientists had
isolated EPO from human urine well before Amgen even existed and
one doctor even tried treating three anemic patients with it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Transkaryotic is hoping to get all of Amgen's patents
invalidated by claiming that Amgen defrauded the Patent and
Trademark Office by withholding information about this prior work
and about the chemical composition of its EPO. Amgen says the
Patent Office was fully informed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is how strong is the U.S. patent system,''
Gordon M. Binder, chief executive of Amgen, said after Monay's
hearing. ``TKT can do the same thing to many other biotech products
that they did to EPO.''
</P>
<P>
   While some important rulings could come in the next few days, an
ultimate decision probably will not be issued for months. Whatever
the outcome, it is all but certain to be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts think that Amgen, which has received some
new patents on EPO in the last few years, is in a strong position
because it is making 18 claims of infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant must win on all the claims,'' said Edmund R.
Pitcher, the attorney retained by PaineWebber to analyze the case.
``It's as if you are standing in a position and 18 bullets are
coming at you. It doesn't do you much good to dodge 17 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eric Schmidt, an analyst at SG Cowen, said he thinks
Transkaryotic will win. ``We don't believe the erythropoietin
protein is patentable,'' he said. ``There's just too much prior
art.'' Some of Amgen's more recently issued patents, he said, had
claims that had been broadened because Amgen knew of
Transkaryotic's work.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts say Amgen will not be hurt too much if it loses
the case because it has already filed with the Food and Drug
Administration for approval to sell a second-generation version of
Epogen that can be given less frequently. The new version, called
NESP, is likely to be approved early next year, even before
Transkaryotic's version of first generation EPO is released. TKT
and Aventis, which was formed by the merger of Germany's Hoechst AG
and France's Rhone-Poulenc SA, do not expect to apply to the FDA
for marketing approval until later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, NESP will open up big new markets for Amgen. Under its
agreement with Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Amgen sells Epogen only for
kidney dialysis in the United States while Johnson &AMP; Johnson sells
it for other uses domestically and for all uses in Europe and some
other countries. But Amgen will be allowed to sell NESP for all
uses in both the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a victory for Transkaryotic would not necessarily
mean smooth legal sailing for its other drugs. Each one is likely
to face a patent challenge and each patent has different wording,
attorneys say.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Amgen's own EPO patents are weaker in Europe than in the
United States, raising the possibility that Transkaryotic might
lose here but be able to sell in Europe, where a similar trial is
scheduled to start in September.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say TKT's threat is likely to be limited to the first
generation of biotech products like EPO, Neupogen, the interferons,
insulin and growth hormone. These proteins were known before gene
splicing was developed. But now biotechnology companies often
discover new proteins, making it easier to get a patent on the
substance itself, no matter how it is made.
</P>
<P>
   If Transkaryotic wins, royalties from the sale of EPO would also
go to Cell Genesys, the company with similar gene-activation
technology. That is because Aventis licensed Cell Genesys' patents
to prevent Cell Genesys from blocking TKT. The license also extends
to the second drug Transkaryotic and Aventis plan to produce
together. That drug, which is about to enter clinical trials, is
speculated to be Amgen's Neupogen.

JACKSON: GIVE HONOR ELSEWHERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Disjointed and underachieving last year, on pace
for 68 wins this season, the Lakers are among the most improved
teams in the NBA. That's made an instant Coach of the Year
candidate out of Phil Jackson, even if he disagrees with the
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil Jackson will probably get it because of the tremendous
job he's doing with the Lakers,'' said Orlando Magic coach Doc
Rivers, himself a strong candidate for the honor. ``(Jackson) has
gotten them to buy into the fact that you win with defense. That's
why the Lakers are a better team this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson said several others are more deserving, pointing to
Rivers, Seattle's Paul Westphal, Philadelphia's Larry Brown and
Utah's Jerry Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are working with diminishing numbers and less
talent and probably driving their teams harder,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers and Jackson are most often mentioned as leading
candidates Jackson for obvious reasons and Rivers for taking a team
stripped of all its stars and putting it in position to make the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give it to Doc Rivers,'' said Lakers forward Robert Horry,
``because we've got three high-profile athletes on our team, we
should win. They (the Magic) have a lot of no-name guys who are
stepping up, playing great for them. I think it's the way (Rivers)
has them playing.''
</P>
<P>
   As for making a dominant team out of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe
Bryant, Glen Rice and Co., Jackson said it's ``the job you're
supposed to do'' and recalled the words of his former boss, Bulls
general manager Jerry Krause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Krause used to tell me a coach that gets a team that
should win 60 games and he wins 60 games, does his job. And that
was his way of telling me that I did the job that was expected of
me,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   MILESTONES: With a big surge in the final 11 games, O'Neal could
become the first player in 34 years to win both the scoring and
rebounding titles.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain, then with Philadelphia, accomplished the feat
in the 1965-66 season, averaging 33.5 points and 24.6 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is tied for first in scoring with Philadelphia's Allen
Iverson and trails only Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo in rebounding.
But Jackson wants to scale back O'Neal's minutes, which might deny
him the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be cutting more than anything else with
Shaquille, and even the rest of our players,'' he said. ``This is a
hard time (of the season). ... Everybody, I'm sure, was alerted
this week when Jason Kidd went down and (Arvydas) Sabonis had a
minor injury. ... Those are the kind of things that take a team
from playoff hopes to possible playoff eliminations.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Gore's reform strategy faces test
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore's proposal Monday for public
financing of elections drew ridicule from Republicans and
skepticism from some analysts. But the real test may be how it is
received by independent voters who are crucial to Gore's bid for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in Milwaukee, Gore proposed tax breaks for
individual and corporate donors to a new ``Democracy Endowment.''
Funds from the trust would be used to finance Senate and House
candidates in general elections.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also proposed new regulations requiring
television stations to provide free air time to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged he was an ``imperfect messenger'' for campaign
finance reform, a reference to his own actions during the 1996
race. Gore telephoned contributors from his White House office _
becoming the subject of two Justice Department inquiries _ and
attended a controversial fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in
California.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said Monday that Gore's record, or lack of it, in
promoting campaign finance reform while he has been vice president
raised fundamental questions about his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Brookings Institution scholar Thomas Mann noted President
Clinton and Gore pledged to enact campaign finance reform when they
were first elected and had two years of a Democratic Congress to
accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a con,'' Mann said. ``They were never serious about
this. They moved reform forward in both houses while promising one
another that it would never become law. They don't have much of a
record on acting on this when they were in a position to do
something about it. There is a credibility issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has determined the most effective way to rebut the doubters
is to address the issue of campaign finance reform head-on,
pledging as he did Monday to make a ban on ``soft money,'' the
first piece of domestic legislation he would submit to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the doubts about whether I personally am serious
on campaign finance reform,'' Gore told students at Marquette
University. ``Although you will have to take my word for this next
point, I promise you that, if you entrust me with the presidency, I
will do more than try. I will lead. I will fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals would also facerough sledding among Republicans
in Congress, who have successfully rebuffed all major campaign
finance reform proposals during the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping a broken glass collection in the shower is a better
idea than Al Gore's ridiculous and contrived campaign finance
scheme,'' said Jonathan Baron, spokesman for Rep. Tom DeLay
(R-Texas), the majority whip. ``The idea that we are going to
create a new multibillion (dollar) bureaucracy, empowered by its
own investment fund, to underwrite, monitor and fund political
speech is simply ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has more immediate political motivations: namely,
inoculating himself against the allegations of fund-raising abuse
in 1996. He is also trying to woo the millions of independents who
voted in primaries for Republican and Arizona Sen. John McCain and
former Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, both of whom
promoted campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Gore's proposal serves to draw a sharper contrast
between himself and Gov. George Bush of Texas. While Bush also
favors banning unregulated soft money donations to political
parties, he opposes public financing for congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called Gore's proposal ``a taxpayer-financed government
takeover of campaigns that replaces individual spending decisions
with decisions made by an unelected government committee.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain issued a statement Monday that he welcomed ``any good
faith proposal to reform our broken campaign finance system.'' But
McCain also focused on Gore's credibility problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``To convince a skeptical public that his efforts are sincere
and not an election year conversion, the vice president needs to
back his words with meaningful, bipartisan action, as well as call
for a complete and open investigation of the 1996 campaign finance
irregularities,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Wertheimer, president of the campaign finance watchdog
group Democracy 21, said it remained to be seen whether Gore could
galvanize voters around campaign finance reform in the same way
McCain and, to a lesser extent, Bradley did. But Wertheimer said
the opening was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the vice president is prepared to ... make the kind of
ongoing, clear commitment by which he would lock himself into
(reform) if elected, then I think he has the opportunity to regain
credibility,'' Wertheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   In crafting his proposal, Gore sought to create a public funding
mechanism that would overcome one of the central objections to
taxpayer-financed campaigns: that no taxpayer should be required to
contribute to a candidate whose views he or she does not agree
with. Gore's proposed ``Democracy Endowment'' would rely on
voluntary contributions from individuals and corporations, who
would then be able to claim a tax deduction for the donation. Gore
estimated the tax break could generate $7.1 billion in seven years,
enough to make the fund self-sustaining. After that, the tax break
would disappear. The fund would be administered by trustees
appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring lobbyists to submit monthly, detailed reports that
would include the names of officials being lobbied and the dates
and locations of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encouraging broadcasters to provide candidates five minutes of
air time each night in the 30 days before an election.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring broadcasters to provide equal air time to any
candidate who was mentioned in an issue ad aired on the station.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring organizations running issue advertisements 60 days
before an election to disclose their funding sources.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, who co-authored a book on campaign finance issues, said
the endowment was a creative idea but raised a fundamental
question: Why would anybody want to contribute to it?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to sort of lay out a rationale for people to
contribute,'' Mann said. ``In general, people are inclined to
contribute to candidates or parties, not some endowment that
provides money to candidates they find utterly abhorrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokeswoman Kathleen Begala said the endowment would
attract donations from individuals and companies motivated by
public and self-interest.

NEW JERSEY BILL AIMS TO IDENTIFY SEX OFFENDERS ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Frustrated that New Jersey courts have prevented
Megan's Law from reaching into cyberspace, Gov. Christie Whitman
introduced legislation Monday that would amend the state
constitution to allow officials to post convicted sex offenders'
names on an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey began a national movement in 1995, when legislators
reacted to the outrage surrounding the murder of 7-year-old Megan
Kanka by enacting the nation's first law allowing the police to
notify residents when a paroled sex offender moves into their
community.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states now have similar statutes, and 16 states list the
names and addresses of paroled sexual predators on Web sites. But
New Jersey's Supreme Court, which has a history of judicial
activism, has demanded sharp limits on who can be notified, citing
concerns about vigilantism and parolees' privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey General Assembly passed a bill Monday to post
sexual predators' names and addresses on the Internet, but Whitman
said she believed that law would be struck down by the courts, so
she proposed the bold step of circumventing the courts by changing
the state constitution. ``We're always sensitive to the privacy
rights of individuals,'' Whitman said. ``But we are more sensitive
to the rights of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's constitution has been amended more than 150 times
since it was adopted in 1947, usually for bond initiatives and
other minor matters. The last time an amendment was used to
challenge a State Supreme Court ruling was in 1992, when voters and
legislators reaffirmed that the death penalty was constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional amendment would need the approval of two-thirds
of lawmakers in both houses of the legislature, and would then be
put on the ballot for voters in November. Even if the measure wins
approval, however, it could face a challenge in federal court,
because several recent rulings have raised concerns that Internet
sex-offender registries may go too far.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Jacobs, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said her organization was likely to challenge the
proposed amendment because it would subject convicted sex offenders
to punishment even after their prison terms ended. Under the
state's current policy, which notifies only those people who live
near a sex offender, there have been some incidents of housing
discrimination and physical threats, Jacobs said, including one
1998 case in which five gunshots were fired into a parolee's home.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said the new measure could also deter sexual assault
victims from reporting abuse by relatives, for fear that their
families might be subjected to public humiliation. ``One reason
attacks are not reported is the shame,'' she said. ``These laws
will do more to discourage people from reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Whitman and many other New Jersey officials said they
believed that the benefits of publicizing sex offenders'
whereabouts far outweighed any drawbacks. The governor said the
state police had taken aggressive steps to prevent any vigilante
attacks and would intensify their efforts if the information was
made more widely available.
</P>
<P>
   The senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said he supported
the governor's initiative because it would allow New Jersey voters
to decide whether widespread notification was appropriate. The
Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, whose support would be necessary
for any constitutional amendment to win approval, said he was open
to the proposal, but stopped short of endorsing it.
</P>
<P>
   Since states began posting sex offenders identities' on the
Internet, there have been some problems, but no reports of
vigilante attacks related to the Web sites, said Scott Matson, a
research associate at the Center for Sex Offender Management. The
most serious complaints in other states have involved incorrect
addresses being posted or juvenile offenders' names being included
with those of adults, Matson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been cases where people whose house was incorrectly
listed on the Web site end up getting harassed when they have no
criminal record at all,'' Matson said. ``It's mostly labeling and
verbal abuse, where they get called names.''
</P>
<P>
   In those states that have set up Internet registries, many
criminal justice experts have warned residents not to be lulled
into the false belief that they are fully apprised of the danger
around them. ``Up to 80 percent of sex offenders have never been
caught, so these Web sites have to be careful not to create a false
sense of security,'' Matson said. ``We try to remind people that
they still have to teach their children how to protect themselves
and watch for the warning signs.''

FORMER FIRST LADY ROSALYNN CARTER URGES STRONGER EFFORTS IN
TREATING MENTAL ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS Knight Ridder Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mental-health treatment has come a long way,
but more needs to be done to ensure that people who suffer mental
illness _ and their loved ones _ get the help they need, former
first lady Rosalynn Carter said here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked in the mental-health field since 1971,'' Carter
said at a news conference before speaking at the Hyatt Regency
Crown Center hotel. ``At that time nobody would talk about mental
illness.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Carter said, knowledge of mental health and how
to treat mental illness has grown.
</P>
<P>
   But, Carter said, ``that stigma still exists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It all goes back to when we didn't understand mental
illness,'' Carter said. ``To the time when we shut them away and
didn't want anyone to know about it. That kind of lingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, honorary chairwoman of the President's Commission on
Mental Health in her husband's administration, these days tries to
educate the public about mental illness through the Carter Center
in Atlanta. Her Kansas City visit was a fund-raiser for Truman
Medical Center's Behavioral Health Network.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is a proponent of national legislation to require health
insurance companies to cover mental illness on a par with physical
illness. Many insurance companies allow fewer doctor visits and
less time in the hospital, and require higher co-payments, for
people seeking treatment for mental illness, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no distinction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Increased access to treatment would mean fewer incidents of
violence among the mentally ill, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have those problems if we had the right kind of
services,'' Carter said. ``It all goes back to the lack of help.''
</P>
<P>
   That help should start early, Carter said. She suggested schools
should have mental-health professionals available for students.
</P>
<P>
   And that help should be available for the families of the
mentally ill, Cater said. Support groups, she added, are key in
helping people understand and help their mentally ill relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, chairman of the event, said it was
significant that someone as high-profile as a former first lady was
willing to speak out about mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give it attention that we would not otherwise get,''
Cleaver said.

NEW YORK TO HONG KONG VIA THE NORTH POLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lopping hours off flights between North America and Asia,
regular commercial jet service over the North Pole is to start July
1, the fruit of a growing partnership between Canadian and Russian
air traffic controllers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the ice curtain separating Russia and North
America started to thaw, regular transpolar flights are now on the
verge of becoming a reality as new long-range jets enter airline
fleets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have acted like a cheerleader on this,'' said Michael
Skrobica, a vice president of the Air Transportation Association of
Canada, an airline industry group in Ottawa. ``There is a huge cost
saving for airlines, much more convenience for passengers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is also the prospect of a bonanza in overflight fees for
Canada and Russia. If routed over the Arctic, a New York to Hong
Kong flight would save five hours and $33,000 in fuel and labor
costs over conventional routes, according to estimates by Nav
Canada, the nation's private, nonprofit air traffic control
authority. A Vancouver-New Delhi flight would save about four and a
half hours, and a Toronto-New Delhi flight would save almost two
hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Siberian shortcut would allow major savings in fuel and
passenger time for flights between the United States and Bangkok,
Beijing, the United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as an experiment, Russia allowed Northwest to operate
a Detroit-Beijing polar flight and United Airlines to operate a
Chicago-Hong Kong polar flight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In February, we flew 24 days of 29 in the polar region,'' said
Gene Cameron, United's international dispatch manager. ``Between
United and Northwest, we are proving to the Russians that this is a
viable operation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Polar routes have become possible because of a new generation of
Boeing and Airbus long-range jets that entered airline fleets in
the second half of the 1990s. In a new boost for polar routes, the
competing aircraft manufacturers have announced that in 2003 they
will come out with jets capable of flying fully loaded for 18 hours
_ the Boeing 777X and the Airbus A340-500. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With these new, longer-range planes transpolar travel is going
to become common,'' said Michael J. Boyd, president of an aviation
consulting company in Colorado. ``The biggest growth market is
going to be in and out of China.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians, who see a gold mine in air-space charges, are
working closely with the Russians to upgrade Russian air traffic
control. Air space charges are based on weight at takeoff and
distance traveled over a country. For a New York to Hong Kong
flight by the regular east-west route through Canada, for example,
they are $1,825. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The first step is to staff enough of their facilities with
English-speaking controllers,'' said Sid Koslow, Nav Canada's vice
president for engineering. ``By the end of 2001, we hope they will
have the communications system in place to increase traffic.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Technical cooperation and aid in finding financing are part of
Canada's collaboration with Russia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Russian north, civilian traffic controllers are to be
concentrated at four sites that previously were largely dedicated
to military air defense. In Canada, air traffic control authorities
have started talking to Norad, the North American Aerospace Defense
Command, about adding commercial uses to existing air defense sites
in the Arctic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to turn a sword into a plowshare,''
said Skrobica, of the Canadian airline industry group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With or without use of Norad sites, commercial jets will fly
over polar regions much the way they do over ocean stretches,
without radar coverage. In an international handoff system, planes
are tracked by reports of their timing, speed and direction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once North Pole routes are up and running, Canadian authorities
are confident that usage will steadily grow. Cathay Pacific has
already tested a transpolar New York-Hong Kong route. United would
like to try a Chicago-Shanghai transpolar route, and Air Canada,
Canada's largest airline, would like to test two transpolar routes
later this year, Toronto-Hong Kong and Toronto-Tokyo. &QL;

 &UR; BROKERS &LR;  _ Don Bibeault has a tale of woe that has become all too
common for online investors. When the San Rafael resident had
trouble logging onto Charles Schwab Corp.'s Web site several weeks
ago, he picked up the phone to place his trades. It took 25 minutes
before he got through to a representative, too late in the day to

 Recording Industry Goes to Court to Battle Napster  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista

 &QL; 
The recording industry went to court in San Francisco yesterday to
lay the legal groundwork to unplug Napster Inc., the controversial
San Mateo startup that makes software that finds and downloads free
music off the Internet.
<P>
   However, attorneys for the Recording Industry Association of
America, who called Napster a copyright ``infringement machine,''
conceded the earliest they could obtain a federal court injunction
to halt the firm's operations would be early June.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, Napster has gained millions of fans, particularly
college students with high-speed Internet access to download the
free program.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the RIAA filed suit against Napster on behalf of
A&AMP;M Records and several other top records labels that are members
of the Washington, D.C., trade organization, saying Napster
encourages rampant violation of copyright laws.
</P>
<P>
   Napster denies the claim, saying the actual act of sharing songs
is done by customers. The firm insists its relationship with its
customers comes under the protection of the 1998 Digital Millennium
Copyright Act.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, in the first hearing since the filing of the suit,
the RIAA took steps to seek a preliminary injunction from U.S.
District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel to halt Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the RIAA asked Patel to speed up the normal
process to obtain internal documents and information from Napster
to support the injunction request.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Patel, who will rule on the case, said she
has downloaded a copy of Napster to see what the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   Patel, who did not issue a ruling and gave no clear indication
which way she was leaning, said she couldn't find the jazz and
classical songs she sought.
</P>
<P>
   She asked RIAA attorney Russell Frackman of Los Angeles if the
issues were similar to the motion picture industry's concerns about
video-tape machines in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this as much ado about not as much as you think it is?''
Patel asked.
</P>
<P>
   Patel grilled attorney Lawrence Pulgram for nearly an hour about
how Napster works. At one point, she questioned Pulgram's assertion
that Napster was trying to help new unknown artists get exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see much of anything that didn't seem recognizable,''
Patel said. ``These are not new artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Patel said she would hold a conference call with attorneys for
both sides sometime before the next court date on April 10.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. copyright laws, it is legal to copy compact
disc music for personal use, but not to give it to others. Napster,
however, denied that it was encouraging piracy, arguing instead
that the program only has created an online community of music
lovers who are free to share songs.
</P>
<P>
   The Napster program, written by a 19-year-old college student
who was frustrated looking for MP3 formatted songs on the Internet,
can search and download a specific song from the hard drives of any
of the thousands of computers that are also logged into the same
Napster server.
</P>
<P>
   The program has become so popular among college students that
about 100 universities around North America had to ban or restrict
use of Napster to keep their Internet access lines from becoming
clogged by music swappers.

 Be Inc. Playing `Open Source' Card With Its Latest
Operating  System 
 &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Be Inc. hasn't had much luck in winning over Windows users to its
alternative, multimedia-oriented PC operating system, but the
quixotic Menlo Park company isn't giving up just yet.
<P>
   Today, Be plans to release a new version of its system, BeOS 5,
in both a free, downloadable Personal Edition and a more advanced
Professional Edition, which will sell for $64.95. In addition, the
company will make the programming instructions that create its
system's look and feel available to other programmers on an ``open
source'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100,000 users have registered for the downloadable
version since it was unveiled in January, according to the company.
The system has gained a small but enthusiastic following, mainly
among ``content creators'' who value its ability to handle digital
audio and video far more smoothly and efficiently than Windows
does.
</P>
<P>
   Be, founded in 1990 by former Apple President Jean-Louis Gassee,
originally developed its operating system to run its own hardware,
which it first released in 1996. The company quickly abandoned the
hardware business, though, and ported its operating system first to
the Apple Macintosh, then _ with funding from Intel _ to standard
PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous versions, BeOS 5 won't require PC users to
partition their hard drives between Windows and the Be environment
or to restart their machines to switch from Windows to BeOS. The
new version can be installed under Windows, in one large file that
looks like just another Windows application.
</P>
<P>
   When you want to use it, you'll simply have to double-click the
BeOS icon. At that point, Windows will be unloaded from memory and
Be will take over. It will still be necessary to restart to return
to Windows, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Professional Edition will include several new features
designed to attract fans of MP3 digital music, including programs
for encoding cuts from standard audio CDs into MP3 format and for
burning MP3 tunes onto writable CDs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Professional Edition will be available through retail
channels, it won't be distributed or marketed by Be itself. In the
United States, those chores will be handled by Gobe Software, a
Portland, Ore., company that developed the leading
productivity-software suite for BeOS. Hitachi will distribute the
system in Asia; several European distributors will be named soon,
according to Be.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, Be has turned its attention to what it calls
BeIA, a version of its system designed for the stripped-down
Internet terminals known as ``information appliances.'' So far,
however, none of the many companies developing such devices has
publicly committed to using the Be software.
</P>
<P>
   Be hopes that the new release of its PC operating system, both
versions of which include programming tools, will attract
developers to BeIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, we look at the Personal Edition in
particular as a promotional tool for what we're doing in
appliances,'' said Frank Boosman, Be's vice president of marketing
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Catching developers' eyes is also the goal behind Be's plan to
release the source code for Tracker, its equivalent of the Windows
desktop or Mac Finder, and the Deskbar, its answer to the Windows
Taskbar. The license under which Be will offer the code will allow
developers not only to create enhancements, but also to incorporate
Be's code into their own commercial products. In contrast to the
licensing terms most commonly used in the Linux world, Be's terms
won't oblige developers to return their enhanced code to the
community or to Be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem they've got is that there isn't a lot of room for
a another alternative-to-Microsoft OS, now that Linux has taken off
and the Mac is doing better,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst with
Giga Information Group. ``BeOS gets lost in the noise. They
desperately need a big win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Kusnetzky, vice president of system software research at
International Data Corp., said Be's reorientation toward
information appliances could open new opportunities for it, even
though it faces formidable competition from Linux, various Windows
offshoots (including ``the OS formerly known as Windows CE'') and a
variety of lesser-known alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the person in the street, or businesspeople, about
BeOS, they have no idea,'' Kusnetzky said. ``But the embedded OS
market offers at least some hope, because you can't yet point to a
clear winner there.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Andronico's the Latest to Target Those Too Busy to Cook  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Andronico's Market is throwing down the gauntlet in the highly
competitive world of gourmet-to-go.
<P>
   The supermarket operator, headquartered in Albany, has developed
a hybrid grocery/prepared-food outlet that opens next month in
Emeryville.
</P>
<P>
   Called Andronico's Central Market, the store is the retail
world's latest stab at the fast-growing category of ``home meal
replacement,'' which is distinct from fast food in that it
generally includes a warm entree and home-style side dishes rather
than a sandwich and french fries.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant take-out sales topped eat-in sales for the first time
in the mid-1990s, according to NPD Group, a research firm. So there
is a good deal of money to be made catering to folks who want a
nice meal at home, but don't want to cook.
</P>
<P>
   Meals-to-go are commonly sold by supermarkets or quick-serve
restaurants such as Boston Market, which specializes in rotisserie
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But few food purveyors have found a formula that profitably
combines the quality of sit-down restaurant fare with convenience,
an appealing selection, and reasonable prices. In the Bay Area,
labor costs can push prices so close to restaurant levels that
customers won't pay them, said T.J. Callahan, a senior consultant
with Technomic Inc. in Chicago, a restaurant consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have had a tough time resolving the logistical
difficulties of home meal replacement,'' Callahan said. Meals-to-go
misses include:
</P>
<P>
   _Boston Market's parent, Boston Chicken, the pioneer of home
meal replacement. Boston Chicken was recently bought by McDonald's
after filing for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   _An ill-fated attempt by Chevron Corp. to open Foodini's cafes
adjacent to gas stations failed quickly after four stores opened
last year.
</P>
<P>
   _Eatzi's, a closely watched gourmet-to-go chain owned by Brinker
International, recently closed two of its six locations and took a
$4.5 million charge to earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets, meanwhile, have had trouble offering the quality
and variety people want, said Callahan.
</P>
<P>
   Andronico's ``are food people, and they probably have as good of
a chance as anyone of putting together the magic formula,'' said
Callahan. ``If they can manage the logistics of food quality and
price and labor, then they have a winning combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Andronico, the 71-year-old company's chief executive, noted
that Andronico's has been profitably serving up prepared meals for
almost 20 years in its supermarkets. The company installed a
central kitchen in each of its grocery stores in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Central Market, at 9,000 square feet, is about one-quarter the
size of a conventional supermarket. The interior is chicly designed
with stainless steel countertops, wooden shelving and high ceilings
supported by timber beams.
</P>
<P>
   A patio out front, decked with a water fountain and displays of
fresh produce and flowers, will seat about 100 people in fair
weather.
</P>
<P>
   At food stations lining the store, staff will serve up &LR; 
 &LR; made-to-order meals such as lemon grilled chicken breast or udon
noodle soup with a choice of meats and broths.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers will also be able to find grab-and-go containers of
everything from sushi to potato salad to moussaka. Most of the
edibles will be prepared in a central kitchen and bakery located
just behind the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Heading to checkout, shoppers will pass refrigerated cases of
imported cheeses, fresh seasonal fish and semiprepared meats like
kebabs. Other major grocery categories will include wine, organic
produce and bulk foods, as well as necessities like toothpaste and
toilet paper.
</P>
<P>
   Andronico expects one-third of sales to come from
nonperishables, one-quarter from prepared foods, 17 percent from
produce, 16 percent from meat and fish, and the remainder mostly
from bakery and floral.
</P>
<P>
   Andronico declined to provide financial details about his
family-owned company. But he said sales are well above high-end
rivals like Whole Foods Inc., which racked up annual sales per
square foot of $661 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Central Market is expected to generate 25 percent higher sales
per square foot than Andronico's supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the potential to be a really good second format for
us,'' said Andronico. Central Market ``could fit into several dozen
areas (in the Bay Area), not that we would want to operate that
many stores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Emeryville Central Market is located on busy Hollis Street,
one block from Ashby Avenue, a major thoroughfare between
Interstate Highway  &LR; 80 and Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollis Street area is in the midst of a takeover by dot-com
companies and loft-dwelling professionals, who will be the primary
customers at Central Market, Andronico predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really an urban-type concept'' designed for densely
populated areas, Andronico said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two years, Andronico's will move its headquarters
into the 220,000-square-foot former manufacturing plant fronted by
the Central Market.
</P>
<P>
   Andronico's is also building a distribution center in the space,
along with the bakery and kitchen. Future Central Markets and some
supermarkets will be supplied by those facilities, Andronico said.
</P>
<P>
   On the supermarket front, Andronico's plans is planning  &LR; a new
location in Walnut Creek, one in Cupertino and one elsewhere on the
Peninsula, Andronico said. The company also continues to fill
orders for troubled e-grocer Peapod Inc.

PARENT: FROM CROUCHING TO COACHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ Mark Parent had stubble on his chin and sweat
under his cap as he walked off a Seattle Mariners practice field,
having bagged the last batting-practice ball and dragged away the
last protective screen at the end of a morning with the club's
youngest prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a difference, somebody suggested to Parent, between last
spring, when he was a player in the San Diego Padres' major-league
camp on the other side of the lavish Peoria Sports Complex near
Phoenix, and this spring, when he's a manager in the Mariners'
minor-league camp. Then, big-league luxury. Now, bush-league grunt
work.
</P>
<P>
   Parent shrugged as he click-clacked up a concrete path toward
the minor-league clubhouse. ``You know,'' he said, giving no
indication he was trying to be funny, ``as a backup catcher, you
feel like you're doing grunt work anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   At 38, preparing for his rookie season as manager of the
Lancaster JetHawks of the Single-A California League, Parent looks
back on a big-league career that rarely resembled luxury.
</P>
<P>
   He spent parts of 13 major-league seasons with seven clubs, not
including repeat engagements with the Padres and the Baltimore
Orioles, and never got into a World Series. He never held down a
starting job for a full year. Twice he was traded in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   He failed to hit his weight seven times.
</P>
<P>
   Which tells you two things about Parent.
</P>
<P>
   First, he's a big guy, 225 pounds on a 6-foot-5 frame the last
time he was measured for a big-league uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Second, his talent, which produced a .214 career average with 53
home runs in 474 games, will never get him confused with old
teammates Tony Gwynn, Juan Gonzalez, Cal Ripken Jr. and Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't bother Benny Looper, the Mariners' director of
player development, who hired Parent in November to manage the
JetHawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, guys make better instructors who weren't all that
great at it themselves,'' Looper said. ``The real good ones don't
have to study it.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact Parent stretched his big-league career from 1986 to the
spring of 1999 after seven full seasons in the minors
</P>
<P>
   told Looper something.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other parts of his game must have been pretty good,'' the
executive said. ``He must have been good in the clubhouse and a
good defensive player. From my perspective, he's got an excellent
background to be a manager. He's been a catcher, which is a
position that requires you to be knowledgeable about hitters and
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that giving him this job was somewhat of a gamble,
because he's never coached or managed. But the more I talked to him
and the more I heard about him from other people, the more I
thought he's got a chance to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Parent replaced Darrin Garner, reassigned in the Mariners
organization after the JetHawks finished 55-85 in 1999, embarrassed
at one stage to find themselves with the worst won-lost record in
professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He had turned down managing possibilities on the East Coast, and
said no when the Dodgers called about a roving instructor's job so
he could be within day-off driving distance of his home in Las
Vegas. He and his wife, Wendy, have two sons, Nicholas and Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite his concern about what the strain of managing will
do to his family life, Parent said he plans to throw himself into
the job of improving the JetHawks. The grounds crew at the Hangar,
the team's wind-swept ballpark, already knows it will have to get
the field ready for some late practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a job like this saying, `Well, let's see if I like
it ...' you're cheating yourself and you're cheating the guys,''
said Parent, who will make his managerial debut April 6 when the
JetHawks play at Bakersfield. ``I feel I have a bigger
responsibility as a manager or coach even than I did as a catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, because I have experience and I'm not that far
removed from playing, they'll listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Parent, who retired shortly before the 1999 season, said the
lessons he picked up from seven organizations during 20 years in
pro ball are his most valuable assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of respect for the coaches and instructors I had.
I tried to take little bits from most of those guys,'' said the
Ashland, Ore., native, who broke in as a pro by batting .190 for
Walla Walla of the Northwest League in 1979. ``It helped me to have
a pretty good career. But that's over. For me it's time to give
something back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously you don't get rich doing this job. The reward is
seeing guys get better. What percentage of these guys are going to
get to the big leagues? A small number. So if you can help them
achieve to the best of their ability, then it's up to someone else
to say, `You know, you're just not going to make it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I can help them through my experience, with how I went
through it. If I was a young player, I'd want me to be my coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Parent admits he has a temper, and hopes to control it as young
JetHawks, inevitably, make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, by the same token, it's good to have it,'' he said. ``If
I had a manager who never snapped, I didn't think he gave a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Parent admits, too, that when he hung up the phone accepting the
job, he thought, ``Ah, s---, what did I do?''
</P>
<P>
   But now he's prepared to take his managing career as far as it
goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want Lou's job,'' he said of Lou Piniella, the
Mariners' major-league manager. ``I don't want the Double-A job. I
want to do my job. But any job you take, if you don't think about
the ultimate, if you don't have goals, then you settle for things
too easily, you don't push yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do this one year and go home and start playing golf
again, fine. But as long as I'm doing this I want to get to the
highest level. I want my (players) to do the same.'' &QL;

PERUVIAN LEADER CALLS ELECTORAL PROCESS FAIR DESPITE WAVE OF
CRITICISM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Amid fierce criticism from opposition politicians
and independent monitors that he is trying to rig the country's
upcoming election, President Alberto Fujimori insists that Peru's
electoral process has been free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the emergence of a strong challenger in the April 9
election is proof of a level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori remains the favorite to win a third consecutive
five-year term. But last week, new polls indicated that economist
Alejandro Toledo, a former shoeshine boy who has wide appeal among
the poor, surged into second place and could force Fujimori into a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is proof that we have an electoral process in which
everyone has equal opportunities,'' Fujimori said at the government
palace in Lima. ``What we want are clean, transparent and
legitimate elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori also described opposition candidates as woefully
unprepared, and dismissed Toledo as an irresponsible populist. He
also warned that hyperinflation and guerrilla terrorism _ twin
plagues that his government largely stamped out over the past
decade _ could return if he is forced to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure that there is no backsliding on the
progress that we have made,'' Fujimori said Saturday night as he
sipped tea to soothe his throat following a series of campaign
rallies around Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Fujimori appeared on his way to an easy
victory, but his momentum may have stalled. A poll by the private
firm Apoyo put Fujimori's support at 37 percent, compared to 27
percent for Toledo. Seven other opposition candidates are also on
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote, a
runoff between the two top finishers will be held in June. The
Apoyo poll showed that in a runoff between the two men, Toledo
would attract 44 percent of the vote compared to 43 percent for
Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   For months, election observers have suggested that the process
is heavily weighted in Fujimori's favor because an array of state
resources have been used to promote his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   They also have accused the Fujimori government of harassing
opposition candidates and of denying them meaningful access to the
media by threatening TV stations with tax audits and with pulling
state advertising if they provide as much coverage of opposition
candidates as the president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an investigation by the Lima daily El Comercio
indicated that Fujimori's campaign workers had forged more than 1
million signatures to get him on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has expressed concern about pre-election
conditions in Peru. And last week, a report by the Atlanta-based
Carter Center said that ``irreparable damage to the integrity of
the election process has already been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Rospigliosi, a columnist for the Lima magazine Caretas,
said ``the level of confidence in the electoral process is less
than zero.``
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori argued that ``errors and excesses'' are being
corrected. He added that allegations of forged signatures would be
investigated but said that the practice is common among political
parties in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about pro-government tabloids that have printed lurid
accounts about his challengers, Fujimori called it a sign of a
vigorous free press.
</P>
<P>
   As for TV stations refusing to broadcast commercials by his
rivals, Fujimori said that there was little interest in the
campaign until recently and that station owners preferred to run
higher-rated programming instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been in the past two weeks that the election has
started to heat up,'' Fujimori said. ``A soap opera gets much
better ratings. But little by little, the stations are opening up''
to political spots.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail Saturday, Fujimori wore faded jeans and an
orange shirt. His 19-year-old son Kenyi, who is spending his spring
break from Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kan., to help his
father campaign, was dressed in sneakers and sweat pants.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to allegations of the misuse of state resources,
Fujimori traveled in a rented Kia four-wheel-drive, and he was the
only one in an eight-vehicle entourage that paid fares at highway
tollbooths in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from Fujimori's first campaign in 1990. Back
then, he was a little-known university rector who raised campaign
funds at chicken barbecues and barnstormed on a brightly painted
tractor to gain attention.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed to poor and indigenous Peruvians who viewed him as
an outsider, and they helped him defeat Peruvian novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa in a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to lead a country terrorized by Shining Path
guerrillas and ravaged by inflation running at 7,500 percent
annually. But the capture of Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman in
1992 crippled the rebel organization, and a free-market economic
program cut inflation and brought billions of dollars in foreign
investment to Peru.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Fujimori was re-elected by a landslide over former U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. But his second term was
marred by an economic slowdown and charges that his government
trampled on democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Fujimori maneuvered to run for a third-straight
term despite a provision in the 1993 Constitution that permits
sitting presidents to stand for re-election just once.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about his authoritarian style, Fujimori replied
that when Peru had a more conventional democracy, nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think that democracy is simply holding elections
and voting. Our concept is that there must be equality of
opportunities,'' he said. ``My government has been called
authoritarian, but in what sense? Past governments that called
themselves democratic couldn't get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 61 and divorced, Fujimori spends most of his time at the
government palace or touring rural areas. He is often described as
a workaholic and as addicted to the power of the presidency. But
Fujimori said that running Peru is an enormous task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do anything else besides this,'' he said. ``I like to
go fishing, but this is a full-time job.''

 _ SF CHRON   Not All Funds Stagnate 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I've heard that a mutual fund's performance can lag when it
becomes too large. Does that apply to index funds like Vanguard's
S&AMP;P 500 fund?
<P>
   &QL; 
A: As mutual funds grow larger, they often are forced to increase
the number of securities in their portfolios. That's mainly because
there are limitations on the percentage of any one company's shares
that may be owned by a single fund.
</P>
<P>
   The more that funds diversify, the closer to average their
performances are likely to become because their holdings will
increasingly resemble the overall market. That's a good thing for
investors only if the fund's performance was previously below
average.
</P>
<P>
   However, index funds such as the Vanguard S&AMP;P 500 are an
exception to the rule. Their purpose is to track a particular
index, and they only buy securities that let them emulate the
performance of that index. They are not trying to beat the index,
nor will they invest in a way that causes them to significantly
underperform it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, size will not noticeably affect their performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanguard S&AMP;P 500 is an excellent case in point. With a tad
less than $100 billion in assets at last report, it is a close
second in size to Fidelity Magellan, the largest mutual fund of
all. Yet it continues to mimic the performance of the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index almost exactly.
</P>
<P>
   And that, by the way, is better than the great majority of
mutual funds have performed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh  &LR; Welcome Changes for IRAs
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: It is my understanding that in a traditional individual
retirement account, where untaxed contributions are allowed to grow
untaxed until distributed, the distributions are taxed as ordinary
income even if much or most of the increase in value results from
capital gains, rather than dividends.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that this takes some of the luster off the IRA. Why
can't the dividends and capital gains be separated out so you can
take advantage of the tax break on long-term capital gains? It
seems to me that the present system tends to favor investors who
own high-dividend securities.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: You understand the law correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Your suggestion for changing it would be welcomed by most IRA
account holders, but because it would reduce government revenues,
it might meet resistance in Congress. You ought to at least pass it
along to your congressman.
</P>
<P>
   I don't follow your argument that the present system necessarily
favors investments in high-dividend securities.
</P>
<P>
   Because dividends and capital gains are on an equal tax footing
in a traditional IRA _ that is, they are taxed at the same rate _
one is as good as another. So, you have to analyze each investment
on the basis of its potential total return _ price gain and
dividends combined.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if a stock pays no dividends but is likely to
increase in price by 15 percent a year, it would seem to be a
better choice than one that pays a dividend of 8 percent but with
prospects for only a 4 percent annual price increase.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A Good Value Line
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in finding an investment that matches the
performance of the Value Line index. Can you suggest any?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: There are various stocks and mutual funds that track the Dow
Jones industrial average, the S&AMP;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, among
other prominent indexes. But the folks at Value Line in New York
say they don't know of any that track the Value Line index. Value
Line itself sponsors numerous mutual funds, but none of them is a
Value Line index fund.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the only way you can invest in the Value Line
index _ apart from buying shares in the 1,650 companies that make
up the index _ is through the futures market.
</P>
<P>
   A futures contract on the Value Line index trades sporadically _
it is by no means a popular issue _ on the Kansas City Board of
Trade. Each contract is worth 100 times the index value, or
somewhat more than $100,000 at recent price levels.
</P>
<P>
   If you are hot to own the Value Line index, you can buy one
contract by depositing at least $7,490 on margin with a futures
broker. However, bear in mind that futures trading is extremely
risky. If the value of the index moves against you by 75 points, or
roughly 7 percent, that will wipe out your margin deposit.
</P>
<P>
   For those readers who are unfamiliar with it, the Value Line
index consists of a broad mix of blue-chip, mid-cap and
small-company stocks. Unlike the S&AMP;P 500 or the Nasdaq, it is not
weighted according to each company's total market value. Instead,
each company gets equal weighting.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Value Line index has performed somewhat better
than the Dow and S&AMP;P.

CHANGES NEEDED TO BETTER COMBAT POVERTY IN LATIN AMERICA, U.S.
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Recasts lede, adds more from Summers interview throughout,
protests at today's meeting, quote from Mexico's finance minister;
no pickup.) 
(js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers called Monday
for sweeping changes in the way international aid agencies try to
combat poverty in Latin America, amid signs that robust economic
growth there has left more people behind than many economists
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, speaking to Latin American finance ministers and
development experts at the annual meeting of the Inter-American
Development Bank, said the United States wanted the bank to conduct
a full review of its lending programs, to raise the interest rates
it charges its wealthiest borrowers and to adopt more effective
ways of raising education levels and fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based bank, financed by leading industrial
nations, makes about $7 billion in development loans to Latin
America each year. Along with lending by the World Bank, it is the
main vehicle for the United States and other wealthy nations to
help alleviate poverty in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and other major Latin American
countries have all grown faster in the last year than most
economists had anticipated. They recovered swiftly from financial
crisis, and bank officials estimated Monday that the region would
grow at a pace of 3 percent to 4 percent in 2000, compared with an
estimated 0.3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the recession erased some progress in fighting poverty from
the boom years of the early and mid-'90s, and inequality has
remained stubbornly high _ increasing by some measures. The
situation has frustrated international financial officials, who
expected that Latin America would follow the pattern of the Asian
recovery and that rapid economic growth would lift all boats and
ease social tensions more than it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America's economic success in recent years has not been
associated with a reduction in inequality,'' Summers said in an
interview. ``The pressing economic problem for Latin America is to
create an environment in which all people have a chance to benefit
from growth.''
</P>
<P>
   A study by the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America found
that 15 percent of the region's people live in extreme poverty, a
level it said had barely budged in two decades. And the
Inter-American Development Bank released a report saying that 150
million people in the region live on $2 a day or less, and that the
gap between rich and poor widened in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This persistent income gap, some fear, may threaten the
consensus that has brought Latin American economies closer to world
levels in the last decade, especially at a time when globalization
is under attack by some labor unions and nongovernment
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the pressure against global integration comes
from interest groups in industrial nations, protesters in third
world countries argue that free trade and international financial
agencies benefit the rich at the expense of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Low-key demonstrations against the Inter-American Development
Bank occurred Monday. Three protesters slipped into the opening
ceremony for delegates, unfurling a banner that read ``Shut Down
the Bank,'' before they were evicted.
</P>
<P>
   Summers and many of the other finance ministers maintained that
high and sustained economic growth still constituted the best
antidote to poverty and had already improved living standards for
millions throughout the region. But they acknowledged that growth
alone had fallen short of achieving Latin American social goals,
and there appeared to be broad agreement that the development bank
should shift its priorities accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our countries are changing, our markets our changing and our
social needs are changing, so the IDB must also change,'' Jose
Angel Gurria, Mexico's finance minister, said in an interview. ``At
a time when most countries in the region have better access to
private capital, this should free up resources at the bank that can
be used for poverty programs.''
</P>
<P>
   While Summers noted that the Inter-American Development Bank had
already begun redirecting resources away from big projects, like
power plants, to support poverty reduction, he said that more could
be done. He declined to pass judgment on individual lending
projects, but suggested that some of the largest loans the bank was
considering, including one to finance a Brazilian dam, could
deplete capital that was better devoted to smaller, more specific
poverty-fighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is pushing the bank to establish performance
benchmarks that measure the effectiveness of its poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   Summers also urged the bank to conserve its resources in good
times to be better prepared to increase spending when times are
tough and the poor need help most.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are part of an overhaul Summers has proposed for all
the major lending institutions, including the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and regional development banks.
Summers has sought to blunt an attack on the IMF and the banks by
some members of Congress, who argue that they have outlived their
usefulness and may do more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he said the World Bank should refocus its efforts
toward reducing poverty in the poorest nations and leave most
commercial projects to private business, particularly in countries
with good credit ratings.

 &HT;    Chasing the sun for historic opener
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Can you say ``Play ball!'' in Japanese?
</P>
<P>
   The major-league season won't open in Cincinnati or Baltimore,
as it has traditionally. Instead, the baseball regular season will
begin Wednesday in Tokyo, with the New York Mets and Chicago Cubs
opening a two-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantans who want to see the first pitch on television will
have to get up early. The games begin at 5 a.m. EST and will be
carried by Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pureey boru!''
</P>
<P>
   Regular-season games have been played in Mexico, with the San
Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies opening last season in Monterrey.
But this is the first time regular-season games have been played
outside North America.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs and Mets players aren't all that happy about it, not even
after being promised $25,000 bonuses for making the long trip.
</P>
<P>
   Mets third baseman Robin Ventura tried to put as positive a spin
on the trip as he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense in sitting around and complaining about it,''
Ventura said. ``There's nothing you can do about it, so you might
as well enjoy it. They treat you great over here, but it's still a
long way to go to play a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets broke camp in Florida on Friday, took a flight to
Chicago and then boarded one for Toyko. The Cubs, who train in
Arizona, took a flight to Japan by way of San Francisco. The teams
traveled a total of 13,000 miles, with the flights lasting from 16
to 18 hours as the teams chased the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine managed one season in Japan. ``On
the flight, you look out and see the sun, then you sleep and wake
up and look out and see the sun,'' Valentine said. ``Then you eat
and look out and see the sun. It just follows you all the way
across. It's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Valentine, the Mets were a logical choice to be
picked for the games. Sammy Sosa, who has hit 129 home runs the
past two seasons, and the Cubs make it a popular matchup. But the
Mets were supposed to be matched against the St. Louis Cardinals
and slugger Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire didn't want any part of the trip, however, and he and
his temmates voted unanimously not to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game is too international as it is,'' McGwire said last
week. ``It comes down to how much money they can make. Someone in
Japan paid Major League Baseball a lot of money. I know Major
League Baseball wants to do more internationally, but there's no
purpose in it. I don't agree with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig said, ``Mark McGwire and I have talked
about this. I look at this much differently. We hope this is only
the first of many such ventures. It is our hope and dream that the
World Series will be what the word connotes _ a true world
series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yomiuri Giants beat the Cubs 6-0 in an exhibition game
Monday, while the Mets defeated the Seibu Lions 8-1. The teams
switch exhibition opponents today, then open the regular season
before a capacity crowd at the Toyko Dome on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton, who was 22-4 last season for Houston, will throw
the first pitch for the Mets, designated as the home team for the
opener. Jon Leiber will pitch for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton brough his wife, mother, sister and brother along on the
trip. ``My dad's not too keen on that flying stuff,'' Hampton said.
``If he could drive, he said he'd come.''
</P>
<P>
   After the teams play again Thursday, it's back on a plane for
the long trip to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs play at St. Louis on Monday, while the Mets play their
home opener the same day against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest adjustment will be when you get back,'' said Cubs
first baseman Mark Grace, who played on an all-star tour of Japan.
``But it won't be so bad if we get a couple of wins. You're going
to see one (angry) human being if we come back on a 17-hour flight
with an 0-2 record.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Busy Signals Plague Online Investing  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Don Bibeault has a tale of woe that has become all too common for
online investors.
<P>
   When the San Rafael resident had trouble logging onto Charles
Schwab Corp.'s Web site several weeks ago, he picked up the phone
to place his trades. It took 25 minutes before he got through to a
representative, too late in the day to carry out most of the mutual
fund transactions he had planned.
</P>
<P>
   Bibeault's wait would be considered routine these days, except
for one thing. He has more than $1 million in his account,
qualifying him as a Platinum-level customer, Schwab's highest level
of service. Platinum customers have a special number to call, which
is supposed to be answered in less than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are absolutely buckling,'' said Bibeault about his
broker.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not just Schwab's. Telephone hold times of a
half-hour or more have become commonplace in the online brokerage
industry, where a surge in business has stretched customer service
systems beyond their breaking points. The brokers are hiring
employees to answer phones at a rapid clip, but they still can't
keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Most major brokers report long waits to get through to traders
or customer service representatives over the telephone as well as
backlogs of unanswered e-mail queries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are any players out there that are not
struggling with this issue,'' said Frank Petrilli, president of New
York's TD Waterhouse, the No. 3 online broker.
</P>
<P>
   These failures aren't as visible as the high-profile crashes of
Internet sites that plagued the industry a year ago. But those Web
outages usually lasted just a few hours or, at most, days. The
customer service problem has become chronic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw before that the technology was breaking down,'' said
Dan Burke, an analyst with Gomez Advisors, a Massachusetts
electronic-commerce research firm. ``Now the constraint is the
human issue. It's an industrywide issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which tracks complaints
about online brokers, says it is getting fewer protests about
Internet outages these days but is hearing from more customers who
have had hard times getting through to their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC hasn't recorded exactly how many protests it has
received about customer service. Still, noted  &LR; John Gannon, an
official in the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Assistance,
said, ``There has been a noticeable increase in complaints
concerning access to broker phone systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Schwab took the extraordinary step of mailing a
letter of apology to each of its more than 6 million clients.
``Schwab prides itself on delivering great service and we are
afraid that we may be falling short of your expectations,''
co-Chief Executives Charles Schwab and David Pottruck wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry experts warn that poor service could slow the
breakneck growth of online brokerages. ``At what point do people
say, `I can't afford the wait and move to somewhere else?''' asked
Burke.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for investors, Burke said, noted,  &LR; is that ``the
grass isn't necessarily greener'' at rival online firms. He said
full-service firms that assign personal brokers, such as Merrill
Lynch, could be the beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Those mainstream brokerages have recently made big pushes into
the Internet. But their services are generally offered as part of
overall relationships that are still built around contacts with
human brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The poor performance of online brokers hands a great opportunity
to traditional firms if, when ``you call them, they pick up the
phone,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the online brokerage service mess is no mystery.
As more consumers climb aboard the stock market bandwagon, online
brokers are swamped with business. Even the most aggressive
business plans put together last year grossly underestimated how
quickly demand would grow.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the online brokerage industry, trading volume soared
35 percent in the three months ended in December, compared with the
previous three-month period. And the first quarter of 2000 is
turning out to be busier still. Trading volumes are on pace to rise
40 to 50 percent compared with October through December, estimates
Chase H&AMP;Q analyst Greg Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The huge gains in trading activity are being accompanied by a
similar jump in customer service inquiries by phone or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Maurisa Sommerfield, manager of retail client services at San
Francisco's Schwab, the largest online broker, said incoming call
volume has risen 30 percent during the last two months compared
with to  &LR; November and December. As of February, Schwab was getting
about 160,000 calls each day.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is also getting 4,000 e-mail messages a day from its
customers, making it impossible to fulfill Schwab's goal of
responding to each query within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   TD Waterhouse declined to say how many service calls it is
getting. But Petrilli said the number is about 50 to 60 percent
higher than it had planned for when it put together its budget last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are there more calls, but calls are lasting longer,
brokerage representatives noted. While most calls are about routine
account matters, an increasing number are from inexperienced
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are calling to talk about the very basics of online
investing,'' said Connie Dotson, chief service quality officer at
Menlo Park's E-Trade, the second-largest online broker.
</P>
<P>
   As stocks have replaced bank money-market accounts or
certificates of deposit as the basic savings vehicle for the
American consumer, ``that's brought a whole different kind of
customer into the industry in terms of sophistication,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many online brokers, including Schwab, continue to
advertise aggressively even though they can't handle the current
volume of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a growth company,'' said Sommerfield, in defense of the
Schwab's marketing. ``Turning (advertising) on and off has
long-term ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokers are throwing bodies onto the front lines to cope with
the growth of business. Since the beginning of the year, E-Trade
has boosted its customer service staff by 300.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab hired 2,200 phone representatives last year and now has
more than 7,000 customer-contact employees answering calls and
e-mails and working in branches. Currently, the firm is adding
representatives at the rate of 300 per month.
</P>
<P>
   TD Waterhouse is opening new call centers in Chicago and Jersey
City, N.J., that will raise the number of representatives from
3,300 to 4,300 by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy finding qualified representatives in a tight labor
market. And staff members who deal with customers must be licensed
as securities brokers, a process that can delay their start dates
several months. Employees hired in 1999 ``are coming online as we
speak,'' said Schwab's Sommerfield.
</P>
<P>
   Still, brokers are wary of hiring too aggressively when business
volume may be peaking. If the stock market drops _ a real
possibility when the Federal Reserve is pushing up interest rates _
trading volumes could drop significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't staff up to peak volumes or you won't have a viable
business model,'' Petrilli said.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce pressure on employees, brokers are pushing electronic
alternatives to human contact for handling everything from routine
customer service matters to stock trades. ``We are an
all-electronic model and we have a long list of electronic
initiatives,'' said E-Trade's Dotson.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is an online help system, designed by Internet search
engine Ask Jeeves, that answers real-language questions about
investment issues. Customers can type in to ask, say, what the
difference between a market order and limit order is and get an
explanation by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Waterhouse will soon introduce a telephone voice recognition
system that will give customers stock quotes and account balance
information.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Don Bibeault, the Schwab Platinum customer, said he
is not ready to close his accounts despite several instances of
poor service. He praised the quality of the special team of
Platinum representatives assigned to his account, even though he's
had trouble getting through to them lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``My overall relationship has been very good over the years,''
Bibeault explained. Still, he said, complained,  &LR; ``You should have
the capacity to handle your big traders.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 3Com Plans Internet Device for the Home  &HT;     By Todd Wallack 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
3Com Corp., the Santa Clara company that launched the Palm, said it
plans to introduce an Internet appliance this summer that could be
``bigger than Palm.''
<P>
   Unlike the fast-selling handheld computer, which users can slip
into their coat pockets, the new 3Com device will likely be larger
and stationary. But 3Com said the device could give users access to
a wide range of information via the Internet and be simpler to use
than a PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the sort of appliance you might enjoy having on your
kitchen counter,'' Chief Executive Officer Eric Benhamou told
Reuters yesterday during a news conference in Cannes, France.
</P>
<P>
   A 3Com spokeswoman said the device is being developed at a
research facility in Rolling Meadows, Ill., near Chicago, and would
use the Palm's operating system. That means it should be possible
to swap information, such as an electronic Rolodex and calendar
information, between the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou told Reuters that the device should catch on ``much
more quickly than Palm because there is already a base of Palm
users _ 6 (million) or 7 million well-connected people who are
primed for the kind of product we are bringing onto the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Benhamou said it might be perfect for the kitchen, 3Com
spokeswoman Jan Rasmussen said it could really be used in any room
in the home. Rasmussen also said it wouldn't compete with the Palm.
</P>
<P>
   Like the new device, the Palm VII is also designed to access
news and other information on the Web. But unlike the Palm VII,
which uses a relatively slow wireless modem, the new device could
potentially tap into a superfast Internet connection, making it
easier to download graphics, video and other more elaborate
information.
</P>
<P>
   But 3Com was reluctant to share any more details about the
device, such as what it would look like, how much it would cost and
what products it would compete against.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough information to be able to make solid
enough analysis ... and revenue projections,'' said Merrill Lynch
analyst Michael Ching. ``It's just little snippets here and
there.''
</P>
<P>
   3Com also confirmed speculation that it could spin off a unit
that makes ``remote access devices'' to help Internet service
providers answer modem calls. Analysts estimated the unit has
annual revenue of between $800 million and $900 million. 3Com plans
to begin reporting the financial results separately starting with
this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a business that profiles very different from all the
other businesses that we are in,'' said 3Com spokesman Brian
Johnson. He added that spinning it off ``might be the right thing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson also made it clear that the move isn't imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta pick your moment,'' Johnson said. ``Is it ready to
go now? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Ching also said it wouldn't make sense to spin off the unit now.
Just last week, 3Com announced sweeping plans to refocus its
business, sell off some operations and jettison others. If 3Com
were ready to split off the Internet service business, Ching said
it would have made sense to unveil that move as well last week.
</P>
<P>
   3Com shares edged up 19 cents, to $67.19 yesterday.

   THE RACE IN TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore will need a substantial turnout of women
in his home state in November, according to a new poll, because the
gender gap so visible across the country is also a major factor in
Tennessee. The Mason-Dixon poll shows that while women in Tennessee
favor Gore by a margin of 20 points over Gov. George W. Bush, men
prefer Bush by an 8-point margin. Overall, Gore leads Bush, 47
percent to 41 percent, with 10 percent undecided. The poll,
conducted 10 days ago, has a margin of sampling error of 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   BUSH ANGERS GAY GROUP
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Republican Party's most prominent gay rights
organization criticized Bush Monday for refusing to meet with them.
Leaders of the group, the Log Cabin Republicans, have been pressing
for a meeting with Bush since last spring, and at times Bush has
hinted that he might meet with them. But in recent weeks he has
demurred, saying that the group's leadership had supported his
former rival, Sen. John McCain. ``We think that's shortsighted,''
said Richard Tafel, executive director of the Log Cabin
Republicans. ``We are exactly the people he should be meeting with.
A lot of McCain people are watching the Bush campaign wondering if
they want us back, whether we will be welcome in the party.'' A
spokesman for the Bush campaign, Scott McClellen, said Bush would
probably not meet with leaders of the group because they had
continued to ``politicize'' the question of whether there would be
a meeting.

   NELSON LEADS IN NEBRASKA
</P>
<P>
   In the contest to fill the seat of Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
a Democrat who is retiring, former Gov. Ben Nelson, also a
Democrat, leads the six potential Republican nominees, according to
a poll by The Omaha (Neb.) World-Herald. Even though the state is
considered overwhelmingly Republican, Nelson would defeat each of
the Republicans by a margin of more than 2 to 1, the poll found.
The leading Republican in the poll, state Attorney General Don
Stenberg, has been an outspoken opponent of abortion,
characterizing certain procedures as something close to
infanticide. The poll found that Nelson had a favorable rating of
71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   CANDIDATE'S VOTING `MISTAKE'
</P>
<P>
   James Epperson faced no opposition in the March 14 Republican
primary for his county commissioner seat in Edwards County, Texas,
so he crossed over to vote in the Democratic primary. But now,
because he voted in the Democratic race, Epperson cannot run for
his own seat as a Republican in November, according to Texas state
election laws. Republican Party officials can name a new candidate
for the general election, but so far they have declined to comment
on their plans. From his ranch 150 miles west of San Antonio,
Epperson told The San Antonio Express-News: ``I just made a stupid
mistake. That's all it boils down to.''

 &HT;    Sutton convinces himself, and beats Woods by 1
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ It has been a pain-or-pleasure journey
for Hal Sutton, the 41-year-old Louisianan once burdened with the
label of ``the next Jack Nicklaus.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when Sutton's swing vanished and he tumbled
down the PGA Tour money list, he was embarrassed to hit balls on
the practice range next to his fellow professionals. When he missed
a shot badly in competition, either side of the gallery might have
had to scramble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to hell on earth before,'' Sutton said. ``My game
went to the bleakest, blackest spot you can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday in the The Players Championship at Sawgrass, Sutton
defeated Tiger Woods, golf's dominant player, for a
start-to-finish, one-stroke victory in the rain-delayed conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989-93, Sutton's swing was barely worth two cents and his
personal life, with a divorce, came apart proportionally.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton handled the pressure of ``the fifth major,'' a penalizing
target golf course and a head-to-head confrontation with the
world's best player. He closed with a 71 to finish at 10-under-par
278 and earn the richest first prize in golf, $1,080,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``To lead any golf tournament from start to finish is a dream
come true,'' said Sutton, who won the event in 1983, when Woods was
7 years old. ``But to lead The Players Championship from start to
finish and to be able to play in the final round with Tiger Woods
in the last group and to beat him head to head, I can't paint that
dream any prettier.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton had to hold off a classic charge by the 24-year-old
Woods, who was trying for an 11th victory in his past 17 PGA Tour
events. After Woods eagled the par-5, 16th hole to close within one
shot, the two players traded pars at the 17th. But Sutton clinched
the biggest victory of his career with a clutch 6-iron to the 18th
green, while Woods missed the green and then a birdie chip.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton conceded that he had to convince himself during the week
that Woods, whom he feels has been unrealistically deified by the
media, could be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger Woods is not bigger than the game,'' Sutton said, ``and
you all (in the media) do a good job of making him bigger than the
game. ... The other night I thought, `Well, you know what? I'm not
praying to him, so he's not a god, for sure.' ... I mean, that
realization came over me like, `OK, he's just human just like I am,
so we can do this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything away from Tiger,'' Sutton said.
``He is the greatest player in the game, and he's done spectacular
things ... but if I bought into what you were saying (about Woods),
how could I convince myself that I could beat him?''
</P>
<P>
   Woods won $648,000 for second place, pushing his 2000 earnings
to $3,231,731, the third-best single season total in PGA Tour
history. Scott Dunlap earned the largest paycheck of his PGA Tour
career, $270,600, and finished in a tie for third at 4-under 284,
with Nick Price, Jeff Maggert, Colin Montgomerie and Robert Damron.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has finished first or second 10 times in his past 11
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed I didn't win, but at least I made
Hal work for it,'' he said. ``The key is always to keep putting
yourself in position. You put yourself in position enough times,
you're going to win your share.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton led by three shots when he and Woods resumed the final
round at the 12th hole. He expanded the lead to four when Woods
3-putted the hole for bogey. But at the 16th, Woods hit a 195-yard
5-iron to 12 feet and sank the putt for eagle; Sutton parred and
his lead was one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I wasn't going to go without Tiger making his charge,''
Sutton said. ``He lives up to his No. 1 ranking all the time. I
can't say enough good things about Tiger.''

 &HT;    Cleaves tops among Spartans' pluses
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To know this Michigan State team is to love it _
mostly.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans do so many things well that it's easy to overlook
their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Izzo's team leads the nation in rebounding margin, 12.6 per
game over the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   It has two Wooden Award finalists, point guard Mateen Cleaves
and forward Morris Peterson, who has 1,500 points and 600 rebounds
for his career. The Spartans' off-guard, Charlie Bell, has
tendinitis in his knee but is a top player when he's healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Hutson, 6-feet-8 and 240 pounds, is tough inside, and
forward A.J. Granger averaged 18.5 points in victories against
Syracuse and Iowa State. The bench of 6-6 freshman Jason
Richardson, 6-8 Aloysius Anagonye and 6-9 Duke transfer Mike
Chappell helps.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Spartans play ugly at times and sometimes have trouble
scoring. They were embarrassed by Iowa State in rebounding 38-24.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the Spartans will be favored to win it all, starting
with Saturday's game against upstart Wisconsin, is Cleaves. The
senior is a difference-maker who has recorded more than 800 assists
during his time in East Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves and the rugged Spartans defense have won 30 games.
Michigan State allows 58.9 points per game, ninth in the nation,
and opponents shoot only 39.1 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spartans struggled against Utah in the NCAA second
round, trailing by six with 17 minutes to play, Cleaves led a 20-3
surge. He scored 11 of his game-high 21 points and passed out four
assists. In their victory against Syracuse in the Midwest Regional
semifinals, Cleaves finished with seven assists and 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was Cleaves' assist on a rafter-jarring Peterson dunk that
did in Iowa State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, Mateen took over,'' CBS announcer Bill
Raftery said. ``That alley-oop (dunk) after the timeout was
mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Now only two wins stand between the Spartans and what would be
their second national title. They won their first in 1979 when
Magic Johnson outdueled Indiana State's Larry Bird in the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure has been there since the first magazine came out
and we were picked No. 1,'' Izzo said. ``These guys deserve what
they got. There is a relationship with this team. I think the
players really rise to the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting with Wisconsin will be their fourth of the season;
the Spartans won the first three. ``It's never easy to beat a team
twice,'' Izzo said. ``Three times is really tough. Four? Ouch.
They're on a roll and making shots now. (Coach Dick Bennett) has a
lot of players who are hungry to face the Spartans.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State won the three 61-44 on the road, 59-54 at home
and then 55-46 in the Big Ten Tournament. Beginning with a Feb. 5
victory at Minnesota, Wisconsin is 11-3, with the Spartans
responsible for the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State has put together a winning streak, too. The
Spartans have won nine in a row, 14 of their past 15. The loss was
an 81-79 overtime game to Indiana on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   After Michigan State defeated Illinois, 76-61 to win the
conference tournament, the Spartans showed little emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy, but we're not satisfied,'' Cleaves said.
``Winning that tournament was a goal of ours, but we have bigger
and better goals. We want the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 seed seem to be headed there.

SERGEANT CHARGED IN BILLING OF CALLS TO WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Va.)  (lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An Army sergeant working for the White House has been
charged with fraud for telling several people in New York and New
Jersey how they could bill $50,000 worth of long-distance calls to
a White House telephone exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant, David Gilmer, 30, was arrested late Friday in
Virginia and appeared in court there Monday on the charges, which
were filed by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal complaint, Gilmer worked for the White
House Communications Agency, which handles the phone system used by
President Clinton and other top federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint said Gilmer gave access codes to a toll-free
government number to several people in New York and New Jersey, who
placed a total of 9,400 calls through that line late last year and
early this year.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of calls, some from pay phones, aroused suspicion. A
telephone company was able to track many of them to homes and
businesses, including eight in New York City and one in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents do not specify how the people knew Gilmer or
whether he was paid for his help, and federal officials would not
provide more information.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by investigators, one of the people who had used an
access code agreed to secretly tape two conversations with Gilmer.
According to a federal affidavit, Gilmer acknowledged in the
conversations that he had passed on the codes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Gilmer had not yet retained a lawyer and
did not enter a plea during his appearance Monday in federal court
in Alexandria, Va. Gilmer, who was released on bail, could not be
reached for comment.

TRAVEL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

   A Surfing Anniversary
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to surprise my husband, an avid surfer, with a
trip at the end of April for our 10th wedding anniversary. I prefer
upscale accommodations (no surf camps). We have been to Hawaii,
Costa Rica and other popular spots. Do you have any suggestions? _
C.K., Southampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The quick answer is, look south. Now that it's fall in the
Southern Hemisphere, storms and winds there are pushing toward the
Equator and even past it, according to Jeff Warner, a meteorologist
at Pennsylvania State University. So the best waves should be on
south-facing beaches the next few months, especially below the
Equator.
</P>
<P>
   Two specialty travel companies in California can help you take
advantage of waves kicked up by those ``roaring 40's'' winds (for
the latitudes they come from), and in comfortable surroundings. At
Wavehunters Surf Travel, the president, Henry Morales, suggested
resorts in Samoa, the Maldives, Brazil, Mexico and the Canary
Islands. A spokesman for Waterways Surf Adventures suggested Fiji
and Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   Among the places recommended by Wavehunters, 460 Ward Drive,
Santa Barbara, Calif. 93111, (888) 899-8823, fax (805) 681-8568,
and on the Web at www.wavehunters.com, is the Samoana Resort, on
the south shore of Upolu Island in Samoa. It takes only 12 guests
in its bungalows, and has a deck for dining and a lounge with bar,
television, video, pool table and a library. The cost of a week
with air fare from Los Angeles is $1,500 a person, double
occupancy, including three meals a day, and daily surf tours by
powerboat.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the Costa Azul resort, north of Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico, offers 28 air-conditioned suites and villas with Pacific
views. The surf there breaks predominantly to the left and ranges
from three to eight feet at this time of year, Morales said. The
resort has a pool, and arranges eco-tours in the jungle or to
turtle-nesting areas, horseback riding, kayaking and other water
sports. Packages include all meals and wine and beer, and are as
low as $98 a day a person after April.
</P>
<P>
   You can also book a stay at Costa Azul through Waterways, 15145
Califa Street, Van Nuys, Calif. 91411; (800) 928-3757, fax (818)
376-0353; www.waterwaystravel.com, but Waterways also suggested the
Lalati resort on Beqa (pronounced BENG-ah) Island, Fiji. It has
seven 900-square-foot fan-cooled bures, each with a bedroom and
living area, on 10 acres of beach and gardens overlooking Malumu
Bay. You can dive, paddle a kayak or play golf on the Robert Trent
Jones course at Pacific Harbor, 45 minutes away. The price for air
fare from Los Angeles, seven nights at Lalati and all meals is
about $2,600 each.
</P>
<P>
   For brand-name luxury accommodations, there are Four Seasons
resorts near surfing areas at Punta Mita, north of Puerto Vallarta,
where rates start at $495 a night, and in the Maldives, from $295 a
night. Information: (800) 332-3442.
</P>
<P>
   Theater in San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to spend Memorial Day weekend in San Francisco. How
can I find out what theater performances are planned then? _
R.S.G., Tenafly, N.J. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The simplest way to get a list of performances is to go to
the Web site of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau,
www.sfcvb.org. Clicking on ``Calendar of Events'' and asking for
May events brought up 11 plays or theater groups, with schedules,
brief descriptions and telephone numbers for information.
</P>
<P>
   The list for Memorial Day weekend included Marlowe's ``Edward
II'' by the American Conservatory Theater at the Geary Theater, 415
Geary Street, (415) 749-2228 (tickets, $14 to $55); the revue
``Beach Blanket Babylon'' at Club Fugazi, 678 Green Street, (415)
421-4222 ($25 to $60); Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night'' in Stinson
Beach (in Marin County), (415) 868-1115 ($18), and the comedy
``Shear Madness,'' at the Mason Street Theater, 430 Mason Street,
(415) 982-5463 ($34).
</P>
<P>
   You can also request the list by mail from the visitors bureau
at Post Office Box 429097, San Francisco, Calif. 94142, or by
calling (415) 371-2000. The bureau takes e-mail information
requests at vic1(at)sfvcb.org.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Arts and Crafts
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are looking for an escorted 7- to 10-day tour of Mexican
towns known for their arts and crafts. Any suggestions? _ Phil
Pressel, San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. Jean Grimm Art and Culture Tours, 1233 East Baker Dr. Tempe,
Ariz. 85282, (480) 730-1764, fax (480) 730-1771 periodically offers
such tours. Grimm, who is half-Mexican and has a master's degree in
art from New York University, will lead groups in and around Oaxaca
from Aug. 4 to 13 and Oct. 27 to Nov. 5. Activities will include
demonstrations by master wood carvers, rug weavers and ceramists,
meetings with painters, and visits to museums and ruins.
</P>
<P>
   The August trip costs $1,365 each, double occupancy, including
all meals and land transportation only. Accommodations are in the
Casa Panchita inn, and the group is limited to 11. The October
trip, using the larger Hostal La Noria, will cost $100 to $200 more
because it is a fund-raiser for the Scottsdale Museum of
Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Grimm plans tours to Veracruz, Puebla, Cuernavaca and
Mexico City in January, and to Morelia, Guanajuato and San Miguel
de Allende in March. If there is enough demand, she will add trips.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the New York nor the Los Angeles outlets of the Mexican
Government Tourism Office knew of any tours specifically devoted to
arts and crafts. But a number of agencies on the office's large
list of operators said that many of their tours visit cities and
towns with crafts centers.
</P>
<P>
   An example is Picturesque Mexico offered by Marco Polo Tours,
Saturno 90, Mexico City 06300, (52) 5583-5533, fax (52) 5782-3731.
This tour leaves weekly and lasts 14 days (segments available),
starting and ending in Mexico City. Among other places, it visits
San Juan del Rio, known for gemstones and alpaca; Guadalajara's San
Juan de Dios market, noted for ceramics and pottery, and Taxco, a
silver center. The price, $734 to $1,042, depending on hotels,
includes rooms, sightseeing by air-conditioned bus, van or car,
admission fees and English-speaking guide. Like many operators,
Marco Polo can design a custom trip.
</P>
<P>
   For names of agents and general information, contact the tourist
office at 2401 West Sixth St., Los Angeles, Calif. 90057; (800)
446-3942, fax (213) 351-20745.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of young adults in New York City's
foster-care system, many of them neglected or abandoned during the
height of the city's crack epidemic a decade ago, have been pushed
out of the system in recent years, forced when they are as young as
18 to fend for themselves, often with little education or financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
   The city's child-welfare system, whose legal obligation to
foster children ends when they are not much beyond adolescence,
does not, by its own admission, give the departing youngsters much
to work with: a handful of classes in things like cooking and
resume writing, a check for $750 and up to three years of modest
stipends for rent.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while the growing exodus of children from foster care _
roughly 1,200 in 1998, up from 980 in 1994 _ has helped relieve the
strain on a system that had in the early 1990s been forced to deal
with a near-doubling of its population, it has created another kind
of crisis, according to child-welfare experts and the foster
children themselves, as a wave of poorly prepared teen-agers, many
with children of their own, venture out by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It is a crisis that, at minimum, reflects the fact that the
city's foster-care system too often fails to adequately address and
surmount the myriad problems afflicting children who have been
removed from harmful homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the research suggests that this is a group at high risk of
incarceration, homelessness, public-assistance dependency,
out-of-wedlock childbearing, and victimization _ being sexually and
physically victimized,'' said Mark E. Courtney, a professor of
social work at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, whose study
of children in Wisconsin last year is regarded as one of the most
comprehensive studies of children leaving foster care.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, when Sherrell F. turns 18 on Aug. 5, her passage into
adulthood will be unlike that of most girls her age. By then, she
will have two children to care for _ Tamara, 2, and a baby due in
June _ and a 10th-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Sherrell's outlook is a mix of bravado and grim,
practical reckoning. She lives in a foster group home in the Bronx,
and is scouring the city for ``For Rent'' signs. She says she can
support her family on $685 a month in government disability
benefits, plus food stamps and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But if that does not work out, she said, she can always turn to
the city's homeless shelters. ``They have to take you,
regardless,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Homelessness is a common fate. At the Covenant House teen
shelter in Manhattan, 80 percent of the roughly 400 teenagers who
stay there nightly are former foster children. Many come directly
from the jails at Rikers Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the closest to the best thing _ it got me an
apartment,'' Shanetta C., 18, declared of her decision to enter the
city's homeless-shelter system. Applying for public housing
otherwise would mean a long wait. ``You go to a shelter, you get in
much quicker,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the share of adolescents in care has grown in
recent years: In 1998, youngsters between 12 and 21 made up a third
of the city's caseload, compared with less than 25 percent in 1990,
according to city figures.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to those leaving the system, the city's
foster-care caseload has shrunk, to 35,000 last fall from 49,000 in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The city's legal obligation to youths leaving the system because
of age is limited. At 18, foster children are on their own, unless
they are enrolled in school or a vocational program. In those
instances, the city continues to provide care until age 21.
</P>
<P>
   For those set to leave the system, whether at 18 or 21, the city
is required to provide 16 hours of classes a year on topics such as
career counseling, apartment hunting and budgeting. Under a plan
known as the independent living program, the young adults are also
entitled to a one-time $750 check and housing subsidies of a
maximum of $300 a month for up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   But foster-care agencies and the youngsters and their advocates
say many of them get neither the instruction nor the financial
support. Many do not know about the help. Others ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney's study of former foster children in Wisconsin found
that within 12 to 18 months after leaving care, a quarter of the
boys ended up incarcerated, and one in 10 girls reported being
raped. A third of the youths had not finished high school. Fewer
than a fifth reported receiving any job training or help in signing
up for medical benefits before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we presume to do better than their parents and do in fact
replace their parents for a considerable time, sometimes many
years,'' Courtney said, ``then we have to look critically at what
we as parents are responsible for.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are exceptions, typically those who have had a
stable foster parent in their lives. Quantwilla Johnson, 20, and in
college, is one of the fortunate ones: she has lived with her
foster mother in Brooklyn since she was 3. ``She's not a foster
parent, she's a parent,'' Johnson said. ``She's concerned about my
education. She wanted to make sure I did what I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Johnson, a sophomore studying communications, is not
unlike her peers at State University of New York in New Paltz. She
lives in the dormitories and goes home for Christmas. Her foster
mother scolds her when her grades slip. She has a part-time job.
``I'm starting to learn all of the things my mother was telling
me,'' she said.

NFL OWNERS DISCUSS SALARY-CAP TROUBLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At an otherwise routine gathering of National
Football League owners Monday, two issues were percolating with
potential for creating a stir or leading to significant change. One
involved the Denver Broncos and an apparent violation of league
rules regarding deferred payments to John Elway, the former
quarterback, and Terrell Davis, the team's star running back.
</P>
<P>
   Also drawing interest was the Jets and the status of their star
wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who remains on the trading block
despite the team's public stance. Several teams, including the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers, are interested in making a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL became concerned about the Broncos' situation when it
learned that Pat Bowlen, the Broncos' owner, had deferred almost
$30 million in salary payments to Elway and Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Delaying payment allowed Bowlen to use the money for other
needs. The league frowns upon such arrangements, fearing a
franchise can get into deep, long-term debt.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was taken so seriously by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue
that he conducted a hearing on the issue earlier this month.
Tagliabue ordered Bowlen to pay most of the money immediately, and
Bowlen wrote a check for $22 million, which the league then gave to
Elway and Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Bowlen acknowledged the arrangement with Elway and Davis, but
said, ``There was never a salary-cap violation.'' He said he
believed that other teams were attempting to spread such rumors.
Although the Broncos did not cheat the salary-cap rules, they
apparently did violate league guidelines regarding the way players
are paid.
</P>
<P>
   This episode demonstrates how complicated the simple task of
paying players can become. Teams are constantly trying to
manipulate the rules. The San Francisco 49ers have been accused of
major salary-cap violations, which the league is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Johnson situation has turned into a high-stakes
poker game. Jets Coach Al Groh reiterated a statement made last
week, asserting that the team was not going to trade the receiver
at this time. ``That's my story and I'm sticking to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do so at this time, given our salary-cap situation, would
harm our salary cap,'' Groh said while sitting in the lobby of the
Breakers Hotel, headquarters of the meetings. Groh added that the
receiver was ``one of our best players, and he has a contract with
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by the Jets' new owner, Robert Wood
Johnson IV, who said: ``I think when you make an agreement with
somebody who promises to do something, you should be able to take
that for what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a number of officials on NFL teams, however, the
Jets still want to trade the receiver, knowing that his salary
proposals will be too expensive for their payroll. Johnson may want
anywhere from $7 million to $10 million a season, and might propose
a signing bonus as high as $15 million. The Jets are trying to get
their payroll under control and simply don't think they can afford
to keep the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, however, Groh is maintaining a straight face, saying
the team will not trade Johnson, but leaving the door open with
such supplemental phrases as ``at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The stance the team is taking, league executives believe, is
meant to put pressure on the player and determine which teams are
truly serious about making a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Buccaneers are interested in trading their two first-round
picks for the receiver, but the Jets want more, possibly a veteran
player in addition to the picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the Jets are saying they are going to keep
Keyshawn,'' Tampa Bay Coach Tony Dungy said. ``That's how we have
to approach it.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he truly believed that Johnson was not
available, Dungy smiled and said sarcastically: ``I always believe
coaches. Whatever they say.''
</P>
<P>
   Groh said he has spoken to the receiver several times by
telephone and the conversations were pleasant. Groh expects him to
report to the off-season workout program in April, but it is
unlikely that Johnson will, knowing the team is trying to trade
him.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Johnson had told him he was going to hold out,
Groh said: ``Not specifically. But I don't have my head stuck in
the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners also approved the sale of 49 percent of the Baltimore
Ravens to the businessman Stephen Bisciotti for $275 million.
Bisciotti has the option to buy the remaining 51 percent from Art
Modell in 2004. &QL;

CONTRAST OF FINAL FOUR COACHES IN UNLIKELY PAIRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Historians will determine if this year's Final Four is one of
the best in college basketball. The consensus will probably be
``Uh, no.'' But contemporary observers might agree that the
semifinalists heading to Indianapolis this week make up one of the
most interesting, unlikely and eclectic quartets in the modern
history of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.
</P>
<P>
   When Michigan State, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Florida
gather at the RCA Dome, they could produce some more unexpected
plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA tournament is crazy enough that all you have to do is
put together three great weeks,'' said Tulsa Coach Bill Self, who
had that scenario in mind for his own until it lost on Sunday to
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels, like Wisconsin, entered the tournament with 13
defeats and were considered fortunate to make the 64-team field.
But both teams are 4-0 in these brackets. Referring to North
Carolina's last two weeks, Self said, ``There's no reason they
couldn't put together another one.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but the favorite among the four is Michigan State, which
will play the Badgers in Saturday's first semifinal. The Spartans
are the only surviving No. 1-seeded team from the four regions and
are the only team to return from last spring's Final Four. They
have the most victories (30-7) and they have played the toughest
competition, rallying for victories over Syracuse and Iowa State in
the last two games of the Midwest Regional. They have played
Wisconsin three times this season and won all three. And they will
be playing in Big Ten territory, within driving distance of their
large fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been there before,'' said Spartans guard Charlie Bell,
referring to the Final Four. ``We know the kind of media exposure
there's going to be, the hype surrounding it. We're not going to be
overwhelmed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin (22-13) was the No. 8-seeded team in the West after
finishing sixth in the Big Ten. Unlike most elite teams, Wisconsin
lacks professional prospects. The Badgers last made the Final Four
in 1941, when they won the title. Their critics say Wisconsin's
slow, deliberate, defensive style is probably borrowed from the
playbook of that championship season, and even the Badgers make
jokes about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asked guard Mike Kelley about watching Wisconsin
games on videotape, he replied, ``Do we have to?''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley will probably guard Mateen Cleaves, one of three Spartans
stars from Flint, Mich., who are nicknamed the Flintstones. Cleaves
tries to be a vocal leader in the manner of Magic Johnson, who led
Michigan State to its 1979 title.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spartans trailed Syracuse at halftime on Thursday
night, Cleaves spoke with anger to his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind if you miss a shot,'' Cleaves said later. ``But
if you're not playing hard, I'm going to get in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting how well Wisconsin and Michigan State know each other,
Cleaves said that in their last meeting he heard Badgers defenders
calling out Michigan State plays before the Spartans could.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin optimists might note that the Badgers _ who lost the
three games to Michigan State by an average of 10.3 points _ were
one of only two teams to outrebound the Spartans. (Iowa State was
the other). But Dick Bennett, the coach of Wisconsin, said he would
be careful not to put too much emphasis on the previous three
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this coaching business, you learn to live in the present,''
Bennett said. ``You don't dwell on what might be, but you do dream
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida-North Carolina game is, among other things, a
contrast of coaches. Bill Guthridge of North Carolina is 62 and in
his third season after 30 years as Dean Smith's assistant. Although
the Tar Heels were the No. 8-seeded team in the South Regional,
they have reached the Final Four 15 times and three times in the
last four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Forte, their star freshman guard, is averaging 16.7
points a game and is not intimidated by his surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take us to Indy,'' he said. Self calls Forte ``the
best freshman in the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Although their record is only 22-13, the Tar Heels' four-game
winning streak is their longest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge's preparation time will be affected this week because
he went to Kansas for his mother's funeral. And it is not the only
distraction facing the team. Ed Cota and Terrence Newby of the Tar
Heels are due in court next Monday _ the night of the championship
game _ to face assault charges. The trial, delayed three times
already, stems from a street brawl on Halloween. Their lawyers are
requesting another rescheduling.
</P>
<P>
   But they might be free that night anyway if Florida continues
the run that raised its record to 28-7 after it was seeded No. 5 in
the East. The Gators are young, aggressive, cocky and edgy. Under
Billy Donovan, their 34-year-old coach from Rockville Center, N.Y.,
they use 10 players in regular rotation. They press on defense,
they push the ball up on offense, they throw elbows, they strut and
they preen. The coach loves them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys showed tremendous heart and character,'' Donovan
said after Sunday's 77-65 victory over Oklahoma State. ``We have a
class act. I'm proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan talks with volume and at a brisk pace, with as much
confidence as his team runs the floor. Despite his relative
inexperience among his peers, Donovan has sure opinions on all
things about basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, his players obey the coach, although Kenyan
Weaks, the only senior on the Gators, finished Sunday's game with a
gratuitous dunk, even after Donovan told the players not to shoot.
Now, Weaks has bigger things in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't wait to play North Carolina,'' he said. ``You
just don't know how much we want this.'' &QL;

   Van Gogh Portraits Tour the United States &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh lovers, take note: museums in Detroit, Boston and
Philadelphia have found a new theme for exploring the artist's
perennially popular works _ ``Van Gogh: Face to Face,'' the first
exhibition to focus on his portraits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The show, featuring more than 60 paintings and drawings, will be
on view at the Detroit Institute of Arts through June 4. In
slightly different forms, it then travels to the Museum of Fine
Arts in Boston, July 2 to Sept. 24, and ends at the Philadelphia
Museum of Art from Oct. 22 to Jan. 14, 2001. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh revered portraiture. He once wrote that he wanted to
``do portraits that will appear as revelations to people in 100
years' time.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With works drawn from collections in 10 countries, ``Face to
Face'' begins with the portraits van Gogh made of peasants and
pensioners in the Netherlands; follows him to Paris, where he
painted many intense self-portraits and celebratory examinations of
friends like the art dealer Alexander Reid; and ends in Provence,
where he made many penetrating portraits of the Roulin family and
others. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the best known in the show are ``Postman Joseph Roulin,''
``Madame Augustine Roulin Rocking a Cradle'' (aka ``La Berceuse'')
and ``The Zouave.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Institute of Arts, 5200 Woodward Avenue, is open
daily for this exhibition. Timed tickets, which include an audio
tour, are $16 on weekdays and $18 on weekends, with discounts for
students, and are available through Ticketmaster, (248) 433-8444,
or www.ticketmaster.com. Museum information is available on the van
Gogh hot line, (313) 833-8499 or www.dia.org. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hotel packages, which include immediate-access tickets to ``Face
to Face,'' are available at the Hyatt Regency Dearborn, the
Atheneum Suite Hotel and the Ritz-Carlton, Dearborn, and range from
$149 to $469. Information: (248) 584-4001. &QL;

   From Dallas to Dulles And Back for $306 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Legend Airlines, which will offer all first-class seating at
coach prices, was scheduled to begin flying on Friday from Love
Field, near downtown Dallas, to Dulles Airport in Washington, Los
Angeles and Las Vegas. In response, American Airlines, which
dominates traffic at Dallas-Fort Worth airport and which went to
court to block the new carrier, said it plans to offer similar
service from Love Field as quickly as possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has higher air fares than Houston, in many cases twice as
high for advance-purchase tickets. Critics say this is a result of
American's efforts to stifle service from Love Field, which include
backing a federal law that limits long-haul flights from Love Field
to jets with fewer than 57 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Legend has found a way around the law. It leased four DC-9s and
put in 56 leather seats, spacious leg room, power ports for laptops
and live television via satellite and enough overhead, under seat
and closet storage that each passenger can carry on four bags.
</P>
<P>
   The company charges $306 round trip between Dallas and Dulles
with a 21-day advance purchase. Its walkup fare is $765 peak and
$716 off peak, the same as American's coach walkup fare from
Dallas-Fort Worth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American said that its new Love Field service will equip Fokker
100s, which are much narrower and smaller than DC-9s, with 56
first-class seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Legend was started by T. Allan McArtor, onetime head of the
Federal Aviation Administration. The key to Legend's success will
be selling walkup fares to business travelers, he said. The company
plans to add flights from Dallas to Newark, Boston, Philadelphia,
Chicago and other business centers over the next five years. &QL;

   Big Red Boats Expand Their Range &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Premier Cruise Lines, known for Big Red Boat cruises to the
Bahamas from Port Canaveral, Fla., and for its emphasis on
children's programs, has announced plans to add a fourth ship and
sail from three more American ports starting in May. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company will base ships in Houston, New York, Los Angeles,
and in November, in Seattle or Vancouver. It will rename all its
vessels Big Red Boats and will continue to offer year-round three-
and four-night cruises to the Bahamas from Port Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   The company has acquired the Edinburgh Castle, a former gambling
ship, for seven-night spring, summer and fall cruises to New
England and Canada from New York. In winter it will operate out of
Tampa, Fla. Sailings begin from Houston in June, to Cozumel, Playa
del Carmen and Veracruz. In November three- and four-night cruises
begin from Los Angeles to Santa Catalina Island, San Diego, and
Ensenada, Mexico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fares for three- and four-night cruises range from $399 to
$1,249 a person in double occupancy. Seven-night cruises range from
$799 to $1,749. As an introductory offer on the seven-night trips,
children cruise free; if you have no children, there is a $300
discount. Information: (800) 990-7770. &QL;

<P>
   Landmark Status for Stonewall &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stonewall area in New York, a famous setting in the history
of gay and lesbian rights in the United States, was among 18 new
National Historic Landmarks created by the Interior Department last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The Stonewall building, 51-53 Christopher Street in Greenwich
Village, the adjoining park and surrounding blocks entered the
register of 67,000 National Historic Places only a year ago; along
with only 3 percent of that list, it has now been designated a
landmark _ of historical importance to the nation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stonewall is the first federally listed site to recognize the
``national significance and contribution of lesbians and gay men,''
said M. John Berry, an assistant Interior Secretary. On June 28,
1969, after a police raid on the bar called the Stonewall Inn _ now
gone _ gay patrons fought back for the first time. On the following
nights they were joined in the streets by hundreds of protesters.
The movement toward gay and lesbian pride is generally dated from
these clashes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others landmarks on the list include the 1901 Henry M. Flagler
House in Palm Beach _ chosen because of the significance of its
architecture and its builder, the primary developer of Florida _
and Fort James Jackson, built by the United States in 1808-12 to
defend Savannah. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nathan and Polly Johnson Properties in New Bedford, Mass.,
was home to Frederick Douglass and his wife after they escaped from
slavery in 1838; the Johnsons assisted slaves on the Underground
Railroad, which sometimes included a sea voyage. Ferry Farm, George
Washington's boyhood home in Stafford County, Va., was chosen
because new information about the sorts of things the family owned
and used has been uncovered there. The area is also associated with
stories of Washington's youth. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each place will get an Interior Department landmark plaque. The
Stonewall plaque is expected in time for anniversary celebrations
in June, said Kimberly Stahlman Kearns, executive director of the
Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.

   Correction &QL;

   An article on March 12 about the value of thorough vacation

Scotia, which the author learned about after her visit. The town is
known for scallops, not oysters. &QL;

COYOTES COULD USE KINGS' MURRAY AS MOTIVATOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Was Kings coach Andy Murray excessive in
blistering his team Saturday afternoon for a lack of intensity
during a tie with Boston?
</P>
<P>
   After all, the team is on the verge of qualifying for just its
second postseason appearance in the last seven years. How about a
little slack?
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   In January, they were spending their third month atop the
Pacific Division. Despite bowing out in the first round the past
four years, the Coyotes had developed into one of the league's
better teams.
</P>
<P>
   With two weeks left in the regular season, the Coyotes have
dropped seven straight. They are just two points ahead of the
Mighty Ducks for the final playoff spot in the West after losing
4-3 in overtime Sunday night in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Intensity?
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix had a 3-1 lead. But after battering Guy Hebert for 17
shots in the first period, they had seven the rest of the game,
including OT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as low as we can be, no doubt about that,'' said
All-Star defenseman Teppo Numminen. ``It's been tough for
everybody. But you can't get too down and too emotional about it.
We have to keep our focus and concentrate on how we're playing and
the team will take care of itself. We have to fight back, but it's
tough right now. ... We're trying everything and we're getting
frustrated, but we just have to take a step back, relax, get our
confidence back and remember how we played when we were a good
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said after Sunday's 4-1 victory in Atlanta that one of
the things he's most proud of this season is the way he never
wavered on his coaching philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   There were pats on the back when deserved, but Murray said
keeping the players accountable was a better way to shake a history
of losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is kind of an NHL cool that says the season is so long,
you're going to have those nights,'' he said. ``I never bought into
that. There were people this year who thought I should lighten up a
little. To me, that wasn't the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It has hurt Phoenix that captain Keith Tkachuk has missed 16
games with an injured ankle. He is back now, but the Coyotes' power
play (3 for 59) is not. The Kings went through a stretch like that
and then lost top winger Ziggy Palffy to injury.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille went nine games without a goal. He has three in
his last three games.
</P>
<P>
   There also was talk that holdout All-Star goaltender Nikolai
Khabibulin, who is playing for the Long Beach Ice Dogs, might be
back for the end of the season because the team has lost confidence
in Sean Burke and Bob Essensa.
</P>
<P>
   But because he wasn't signed by the trade deadline, Khabibulin
will not be eligible for the rest of the season or playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   When last year's Kings coach Larry Robinson replaced Robbie
Ftorek in New Jersey even though the Devils have the best record in
the East, there were concerns in Phoenix whether first-year coach
Bob Francis was safe. The Coyotes are in a far greater free fall
than the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's certainly not my place to comment on
anything the New Jersey Devils do or how they run their team,''
Phoenix GM Bobby Smith said. ``From my perspective, I think Bob
Francis is a long-term coach for this team. He's a very good coach
and I expect him to coach our team for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith didn't want to give Francis a vote of confidence, which
usually means the coach will get fired. But there has been
grumbling in the Phoenix dressing room that Francis has worked the
team too hard, especially during the losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Respect always is a big issue, so anything could happen. Veteran
Rick Bowness is an assistant, but the Coyotes already have had four
coaches in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the reasons things have worked well here is the
message from the coach stays the same,'' Kings defenseman Mattias
Norstrom said. ``Players went down with injuries and we struggled,
but the expectation was always the same. This is a playoff team and
anything less is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   TIRADE DOESN'T HELP
</P>
<P>
   When Eric Lindros ripped the Philadelphia Flyers for withholding
the severity of his fourth concussion in two years, he guaranteed
the situation will not be resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers were wrong for not telling him his concussion was a
Grade II, which requires a minimum one month of doing nothing
before the situation could be reevaluated. They were seriously
wrong for letting him play four more games after the injury, which
occurred March 4 on a hit by Boston's Hal Gill.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia is two points behind New Jersey for the top spot in
the East. The Flyers need Lindros, one of the game's top offensive
talents. But they also know his teammates think he's a tad wimpy.
</P>
<P>
   Like the much-discussed visor issue after Toronto's Bryan Berard
was blinded in one eye by a stick, the Flyers were trying to play
the macho card. Now it is a mess.
</P>
<P>
   How will the Flyers trade Lindros when there is no certainty he
will ever play again? In a cash-strapped league, who will want to
pick up his $8.5 million annual salary?
</P>
<P>
   Lindros is a great talent, but he never has played a full season
since joining the league in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' dislike for Flyers GM Bobby Clarke is no secret. But if
he really wanted out of Philadelphia, it should have been done
behind the scenes. Now, he is viewed as a wimpy, overpriced,
perhaps irreparably injured player.
</P>
<P>
   Happy trading. &QL;

 &HT;    Capriati comeback checks off Williams
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Before the match, Jennifer Capriati tried
to ignore the thoughts of what beating fifth seed Serena Williams
could mean to her comeback. She didn't want to make herself nervous
with pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But after she upset one of the hardest hitters on the women's
tour 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 6-3, Capriati celebrated on stadium court at
the Ericsson Open like the teen-age tennis sweetheart she used to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Capriati said about 45 minutes after
leaping for joy when she hit a 102-mph service winner on match
point. ``I'm just very happy because it shows I've really come a
long way. All the hard work has paid off. For a long time, this is
my biggest win.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Williams, this was a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   It means the trophy won't go home to Palm Beach Gardens with a
Williams sister for the first time since 1998, when Venus Williams
won the first of her two titles. Venus, who watched from the stands
with two dogs, couldn't play this year because of wrist tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   But this loss also reinforces the fact that Serena Williams
isn't the dominating force she has tried to become since winning
the U.S. Open in September.
</P>
<P>
   Her ranking is No. 6 after she finished 1999 at No. 4. She has
won one title this year but had two at this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   Against Capriati, the Williams sister with the more reliable
serve landed only 44 percent of first serves during the first set
and made 40 unforced errors. She finished with a first-serve
percentage of 50 percent and 77 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati added 14 double faults and 65 unforced errors of her
own to the technically ugly match. Together, they hit 37 winners,
14 by Capriati.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I played OK,'' Williams said. ``She just played some
great shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But Etienne Dumas, a coach who has worked with the Williams
sisters off-and-on for nearly a decade, thought Williams should
have won the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought there were just too many unforced errors on her
part,'' he said. ``I think she played too much of a defensive game.
And I don't think she's moving well.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams, father and coach of the girls, apparently
agreed. He left his courtside seat after the first set and
apparently left the tennis center after Williams lost her serve in
the second game of the third set.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati and Williams played a nearly equally bad match for the
first set, trading six service breaks to force the tiebreaker.
Capriati, a former South Florida resident who has won fans on her
comeback from drugs and disillusionment, got the enthusiastic crowd
behind her early and played aggressively in the tiebreaker to win
it.
</P>
<P>
   But she started the second set exhausted. Williams played
better, too, and won that set in 27 minutes after the 60-minute
first set.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Capriati started well, winning the first game on
her serve and then holding on to break Williams' serve in the
second game on her fourth break point and after five deuces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like I started playing again like I did in the
first set,'' she said. ``I just got on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 3-0 lead, Capriati unintentionally solidified her fan
support for the rest of the match. Williams led 40-15 when Capriati
called a let mid-point because she saw something flying through the
air that turned out to be tennis ball fuzz.
</P>
<P>
   But only the chair umpire heard the let call, and she didn't see
the ball fuzz.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later, Williams returned a ball at least 6 inches
out. Capriati argued for the let, knowing she had little chance.
But fans thought Williams' ball had been called in. Instead,
Capriati lost the point because she ``stopped play for nothing,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   That incident seemed to disrupt Williams more than Capriati,
though, although Williams said the wind was the reason she fell to
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   In the next game, Capriati got within one point of victory,
leading 40-30. She made a mistake and, on the next point, hit her
first serve clear across the court and into the first row of fans
behind Williams. She put her hand over her mouth in embarrassment
and went on to lose the game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won the next game before Capriati got a chance to serve
again. She double faulted twice and fought off three break points
before winning the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to get back to playing how I was playing to get
up to 5-1,'' Capriati said. ``I just kept going for it. Some of
those things you just can't explain. It's something supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams didn't think so. Those were points she should have
won. Any loss ``shocks'' her, she said, but she didn't seem
distraught afterward. That's because she's been trying to improve
how she handles losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to get devastated after losses anymore,'' Williams
said. ``I have to realize that this is just a game. I'm just out
there to please the crowd, just do the best I can. If I go too
extreme, I'll end up in the nut house with the other
perfectionists.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing that desire with one to reach No. 1 seems difficult.
For example, Williams balked upon hearing that Hingis said she
thinks Hingis and Lindsay Davenport are in a tier above the other
players on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to play Martina again because she makes a lot of
comments,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   She paused briefly before continuing: ``But she's right. I've
been losing a lot. I lost in the Australian Open. I lost in Indian
Wells. I lost here. So yeah, it's her and Lindsay right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams seemed unsure what she will do to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I'm going to go home, talk things over with my
dad,'' she said. ``We'll evaluate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumas has much clearer ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Williams should have prepared better for this
tournament, and he hopes she will commit to working with him more
consistently so he can help her with things such as footwork,
conditioning and developing a full-time traveling team _ like those
of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi _ to help keep her at the top and
keep her improving during tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   All of that would and should be done under her father's
guidance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel that she's so close and it's so easy to get
there,'' Dumas said. ``I really hope this will confirm that this is
what she needs to do and let's just get to it.''

OSCAR STYLE: ALL POLISHED, PRETTY AND BANAL
</HEADLINE>
   (ms)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ On her way into the Vanity Fair Oscar
party early Monday morning, Queen Latifah did what any celebrity
might do when told she cannot bring her bodyguard into the hottest
party in town _ and it's 1 a.m., too late, practically speaking,
for a snit. She stripped off the several million dollars' worth of
borrowed Harry Winston jewels she had worn and handed them to the
bodyguard, right on the curb. Like they're loose change or
something.
</P>
<P>
   Then she sailed past the paparazzi gathered five deep behind the
rope line and into Morton's restaurant, where Brad Pitt, Jennifer
Aniston, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Hilary Swank, Chloee Sevigny,
Matt Damon, Winona Ryder, Faye Dunaway, Jane Fonda _ well, everyone
who is anybody _ were already engaged in the frenetic business of
being a star on Oscar night.
</P>
<P>
   How can one describe the scene inside Morton's except to say
that it was strangely, marvelously surreal? Walter Cronkite was
talking to Steven Tisch, the entertainment executive. Bob
Colacello, a Vanity Fair writer who is working on a book about
Ronald Reagan, was saying something to Connie Wald, widow of the
producer Jerry Wald, who made ``Johnny Belinda'' and ``Key Largo.''
She looked fabulous in a black taffeta couture skirt with a black
Gap T-shirt she had thoughtfully adorned with a Mongolian lamb cowl
and jeweled earrings.
</P>
<P>
   They had all been there since 5 p.m. So had Tony Curtis, Billy
Wilder, Steve Martin, David Geffen, Fran Lebowitz, Penny Marshall,
Regis Philbin and Kelly Lynch, about 150 people in all invited by
Graydon Carter, the magazine's editor, to watch the Academy Awards
on big-screen televisions as they ate grilled ahi tuna with baby
bok choy and warm chocolate truffle cake.
</P>
<P>
   Unless one was an Oscar nominee or a presenter, or decided to
stay at home, as Rita Wilson and her husband, Tom Hanks, did
(``I'll be in my sweats,'' Wilson said happily on Saturday at the
lunch Barry Diller, the former Paramount chief, gave at his house
for several hundred people), the place to be on Oscar night was at
one of the half dozen or so parties that now seem to rival the
awards themselves for sheer star power. DreamWorks and Miramax had
their parties, so did the Elton John AIDS Foundation (with In Style
magazine). And there were the private affairs held in the days
leading up to the Oscars, like the dinner on Saturday night that
the agent Ed Limato had.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to seeing all those familiar faces, and
debating the merits of who wore what _ which has become a kind of
ruthless sport at Oscar time _ the Vanity Fair party was by far the
most elegant cattle call in town.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 150 people could be invited to the dinner, nearly
1,000 started pouring into Morton's when the awards show ended at
10:30 p.m. Within 30 minutes, when Cruise and Kidman arrived, the
area in front of the bar was so jammed that when someone suggested
everyone move into the tent, which had been set up in the back of
the restaurant, for dancing and just sitting around, Cruise became
a kind of ring leader. ``Hey, let's go back,'' he called out above
the roar. ``We're moving in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the back, Kidman, who had on a gold silk Dior dress, let out
a sigh. ``I think we're just going to stay at this party,'' she
said, adding that she planned to leave at midnight for a flight to
Australia, where she is filming ``Moulin Rouge.'' Someone had
stepped on the train of her dress and put a tear in it. ``It's
madness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hefner was in a booth with four blondes, including a pair
of bosomy twins, and people came over just to gawk. Cher, who had
changed from her black Oscar gown into an ensemble of sequins with
a denim jacket, immediately spotted the dress designer Diane Von
Furstenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, how are you,'' Cher said to Von Furstenberg. ``I see your
stuff on QVC sometimes. One day I watched it for 45 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton's was throbbing with people. Carter was on the dance
floor with Minnie Driver. Lebowitz, meanwhile, spent most of the
night, until after 1 a.m., reclining on a sofa, with her high heels
dangling on the arm rest and a carton of Marlboro Lights next to
her. ``I have my drink and my cigarettes,'' she said. ``I'm just
waiting for the pizza to be delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then somebody brought over Heidi Fleiss, the former
Hollywood madam, to meet Lebowitz, and after Lebowitz introduced
another guest to Fleiss, who had on a velvet, fur-trimmed coat she
described as ``hooker-rock star,'' Lebowitz beamed. ``That's the
best introduction I've made since I introduced Liberace to Michael
Graves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Pitt, who was a presenter, made his way into the tent, he was
asked what he thought of this year's Oscar fashion, which many
thought was a mixed bag. Pitt grinned. ``That's a woman thing,'' he
said. ``You don't ask a guy that.''
</P>
<P>
   Aniston, his girlfriend, gave him a look. ``Oh now, ask a guy,''
she said. ``He knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitt shrugged handsomely. ``Everybody was dressed, and I was
happy they were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aniston, who was wearing a black halter-style dress by Lawrence
Steele, continued: ``You know the thing that burns me the most?
It's that people can't try something without going on trial or
getting ridiculed. It's that Joan Rivers and Melissa thing.'' She
was referring to the E! Entertainment channel's fashion critics.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, the fashion that comes down the red carpet has
become almost too banal to even comment upon. Actresses like
Charlize Theron, who had on a Vera Wang gown with Fred Leighton
diamond dress clips, and Ashley Judd, who wore lavender Valentino
with her hair in Southern ringlets, looked pretty. So did Sevigny
in a Madame X gown by Saint Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little surprise. No outrageous examples of bad
taste (unless you count Angelina Jolie's get-up, which was spooky).
Even the sexier clothes, like the Versace dresses worn by Cameron
Diaz and Lucy Liu, seemed somehow predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the beauty-pageant parade of Barbie doll dresses,''
said Randolph Duke, who scored something of a coup by designing
Swank's ball gown, made from 1950s French silk, which he called a
homage to Charles James. ``The risk-takers were fewer this year,''
he added. ``These girls get so many opinions: publicist, manager,
husband, mother. It's a committee decision, and you know what you
get with a committee decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an opinion, Lisa Eisner, the fashion muse and stylist,
said, ``I hate when young girls try to dress like older women.''
She mentioned the big gold hoop earrings that Uma Thurman wore with
her Alberta Ferretti dress, which she suggested were better than
aging diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   But who can say in Hollywood? There was Connie Wald, a doyenne,
in her Gap T-shirt. ``Nothing has changed in Hollywood,
basically,'' she said sweetly. ``It's all the same _ still
cutthroat, still competitive. Only the faces have changed.''

U.S. TAKES STEPS TO SEND BOY BACK TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: INSERTS new 5-6th grafs, In a letter ..., adding Justice
Dept.'s letter to boy's family with Thursday morning deadline;
Pickup 5th graf pvs, Officials scheduled ...)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration moved forcefully Monday
to end the drama over Elian Gonzalez as officials took steps to
take custody of the 6-year-old boy from his relatives in Miami as
early as Thursday and return him to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a federal appeals court in Atlanta said it
would hear arguments in the case during the week of May 8, an
action that could make it more difficult for the Justice Department
to put its plan into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials laid the groundwork for taking
control of Elian by asserting that the boy's Miami relatives had
failed to comply with a government request to say explicitly that
they would not block his return to his father Cuba if they lost
their court fight.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the officials said, they were considering revoking
an earlier decision allowing Elian to live with the relatives in
Miami who have cared for him since he was rescued at sea in
November.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives, Justice
Department officials wrote that if they did not get a specific
written committment that the boy would be turned over for return to
Cuba, ``we would have no choice but to move forward with the
termination of Elian's parole as of Thursday at 9 a.m.'' That means
the agency would take control of Elian at that time, although
officials would not say how they would do so.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Justice Department officials have acknowledged that they
could use the U.S. Marshall's Service to take custody of the boy,
but they have insisted that they hope that in such an event the
relatives would not resist and make such a move necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Officials scheduled a meeting early Tuesday morning at the
regional offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
Miami with the lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives to try to
resolve the situation. But Justice Department officials warned that
they would insist on an unambiguous statement from the relatives
that if they lost the legal appeals they would not obstruct efforts
to return Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the relatives and their lawyers have said repeatedly
that they would not violate any laws in their efforts to keep Elian
in the United States. But they have declined to be more specific
and to comply with the Justice Department's demand.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the Miami relatives, said in an
interview, ``We have said and we continue to affirm that the family
will obey the law.'' But asked if that means that the family agrees
to accept sending Elian back if the courts rule against them,
Coffey said that he was ``reluctant to speak to that because we are
far from that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers disagree, regarding the careful
statements by the family lawyers as holding on to their options to
resist.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, David J. Kline, a lawyer in the Justice Department's
immigration office, said that the government had the authority to
terminate permission for Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzales to
have temporary custody of the boy. But Kline said the agency would
agree to their having continued custody only if the relatives said
clearly they would send Elian back three days after they lost in
the appeals court unless they obtained an injunction from a court
allowing them to file an expedited appeal with the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Kline also demanded that Elian's family in Miami agree to an
expedited schedule of arguments before the appeals court that would
have the case argued and ready for a decision by April 4. But the
appeals court Monday may have made the department's case more
difficult by agreeing to a slower schedule
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have grown increasingly impatient
with the tactics of the family. Some officials said that they might
well move to take control of Elian and send him back to Cuba while
the appeals are not yet completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been more than generous,'' said one official.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami relatives have mounted a legal campaign to keep Elian
in the United States as supporters in Congress and many in Miami's
large Cuban-American community have rallied to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Elian was found clinging to a rubber tube last Nov. 25 after the
boat he, his mother, and several others used in their attempt to
come to the United States capsized. Elian's mother and most of the
other passengers drowned.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of the Miami relatives to keep Elian in the United
States suffered a setback last week when a federal judge dismissed
a lawsuit requesting a political asylum hearing for the boy,
concluding that a long, bitter legal battle was not in Elian's best
interest.

WITH SKILL AND MENTAL TOUGHNESS, SUTTON BEATS WOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ His determined face said it all. His
rock-solid game was all he needed. Like a marathon runner who keeps
churning until the finish line, Hal Sutton captured the Players
Championship Monday because he refused to beaten.
</P>
<P>
   It took five days. It took withstanding a late charge by Tiger
Woods. It took one last encounter with two of the toughest
finishing holes in golf at the TPC at Sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever it took, Sutton was willing to do it. Seventeen
years after he first won this tournament, Sutton captured it again.
Only this time it was sweeter. He beat the world's No. 1 player,
Tiger Woods, by one stroke Monday in the completion of the final
round and continued a brilliant resurgence in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton led wire to wire and finished 10 under par for the
tournament (278), one stroke ahead of Woods (279), who saw another
rally on the back nine fall just short. Nick Price, Robert Damron,
Scott Dunlap, Jeff Maggert and Colin Montgomerie finished in a
five-way tie for third at four under par.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the tournament, Sutton vowed that he would stand up
to Woods, who has intimidated more than a few of his peers while
dominating the PGA Tour during the last year. Sutton made good on
that promise, refusing to wilt when Woods made an eagle at No. 16
and closed within one stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton and Woods both made par at the nerve-racking island green
on No. 17, then Sutton closed the victory with a great tee shot and
a solid approach shot at No. 18, where both players made par.
</P>
<P>
   By winning Monday, the 41-year-old Sutton became the oldest
winner of the Players Championship, and he took home the biggest
paycheck in golf: $1.08 million. And by winning four times since
the fall of 1998, Sutton has overcome a midcareer slump in which he
did not win on Tour from 1987 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sutton was the star of the victorious United States
Ryder Cup team last year, earning 3{ points as one of the team's
inspirational leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's victory will hold a place of its own. Sutton
emphasized that he respected Woods greatly, and that made it
gratifying to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play in the final round with Tiger Woods in the last group
and beat him head to head, I can't paint that dream any prettier,''
said Sutton, who earned his 12th career victory on the Tour and
improved to No. 5 in the world ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not going to beat myself. If you give him an open door,
he's going to rush through it. To win on this golf course, you have
to overcome nerves. You have to show courage. And for Tiger to be
the one that I was playing in the last group, that made it
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who was three strokes down when play resumed at the 12th
hole Monday, quickly fell to four strokes down when he made a
three-putt bogey at No. 12. But his birdie at No. 13, followed by
his eagle at the par-5 No. 15, pulled him within one stroke and put
the pressure on Sutton down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   In his last 11 starts on the Tour, Woods has seven victories and
three second-place finishes. That sounds like someone who is ready
for next week's Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that I didn't win, but at least I made Hal
work for it,'' Woods said. ``I wasn't going to have a nice stroll
up No. 18 with no pressure on him. We had a good battle. Under the
most extreme conditions, I was able to hit the shots I wanted to.
That is what you want to see going into the Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   The day got very interesting after Woods eagled the par-5,
507-yard No. 16, using his power to reach the green in two shots.
After a huge drive, Woods hit a beautiful 5-iron from 195 yards
that landed 12 feet right of the hole. Then he made the putt for
eagle. As the ball dropped into the hole, Woods was already doing
his fist-pump. Was there any doubt Woods would make a run? Sutton
did not think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was planning on him making that putt,'' Sutton said. ``He
lives up to his No. 1 ranking all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sutton never flinched. He still had a three-footer for par
after Woods' eagle putt, and Sutton calmly made it to stay one
ahead. Then came No. 17, where Sutton made a triple-bogey on
Saturday after hitting his tee shot into the water. But the hole
was not nearly as scary Monday because rain had softened the green
overnight and there was little wind.
</P>
<P>
   Woods relieved some of the pressure on Sutton by hitting a poor
tee shot at No. 17 that landed in the rough, enabling Sutton to hit
a safe shot into the middle of the green. Woods chipped and putted
for par, Sutton two-putted for par, and they moved to the toughest
finishing hole on tour statistically with Sutton still ahead by
one.
</P>
<P>
   After Woods drilled a 2-iron tee shot into the middle of the
fairway, Sutton took out his driver and poured a ball down the
middle of the fairway past Woods. Sutton missed only one fairway in
the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Woods knew he needed to hit his next shot close, but his 6-iron
from 193 yards was too long as it sailed over the green and into
the rough. Sutton closed in style by hitting a beautiful 6-iron
approach shot to 10 feet. Woods' last chance for birdie failed when
his chip from 20 feet was short. Sutton two-putted for par, shook
hands with Woods, then talked about their battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you the truth: I got nervous as heck,'' Sutton
said. ``It was nerve-racking to beat him. I feel really tired.''

FREE-SPEECH SUITS FORCING U.S. COURTS INTO CITY HALL ROLES, JUDGES
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BROOKLYN-MUSEUM-SUIT)

 By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In sharp new criticism of the Giuliani
administration's First Amendment policies, two federal appeals
court judges have complained that a ``relentless onslaught'' of
litigation over restrictions on political demonstrations and
artistic events has forced the federal courts to take on the role
of city licensing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The judges leveled the criticism in a decision involving an
artist whose plans to photograph 75 to 100 nude models on a city
street were blocked by the police last July.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision, filed late Friday, the judges simply sent the
case to the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court,
for an interpretation of the state law at the center of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But in writing the opinion, Judge Guido Calabresi of the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Manhattan, noted that the judges
``would be ostriches if we failed to take judicial notice of the
heavy stream of First Amendment litigation generated by New York
City in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited 17 cases over the last four years in which federal
courts had either barred city actions on free-speech issues or
ruled that policies limiting political demonstrations were
unconstitutional. He added, ``In the current and rather remarkable
state of affairs in New York City, there is an all-too-clear danger
that the courts, instead of merely interpreting and defending
federal rights, may cross the line and become, in effect, an agency
that performs crucial local government functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert D. Sack, who concurred in the decision, wrote a
separate opinion in which he also criticized the city. He said that
police officials' decision to stop the photographer, Spencer
Tunick, from taking the nude photographs in the absence of clear
rules against the practice represented a ``variation on the classic
theme of censorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judges said it would be premature to rule on the
constitutionality of the city's actions until the state Court of
Appeals decided how to interpret part of a state law that bans most
public nudity.
</P>
<P>
   The third judge on the federal appeals panel, Ellsworth Van
Graafeiland, did not participate in the decision, saying he
believed that Tunick's case was now moot.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick has been arrested five times in recent years for
arranging photo shoots of naked people on city streets without a
permit, although the charges have been dropped. Last year, Tunick
applied for permits. He received one for a photo session involving
clothed models. But his request to photograph the nude models
between 5:30 and 6:30 on a Sunday morning on Madison Street,
between Catherine and Market Streets, was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick then sued, and a U.S. District Court judge ordered the
Police Department not to interfere with the photo shoot. But on
appeal from the city, the 2nd Circuit stayed that ruling, saying it
needed more time to take up the underlying legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   The case now centers on whether Tunick's photo sessions should
be covered under an exemption for artistic events in the state's
anti-nudity law. City officials have argued that the law allows
nudity in theater plays and other events indoors, where access can
be controlled, but not outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   But Calabresi wrote, ``One need not contemplate why, on the
city's reasoning, a totally naked production of `Hamlet' could be
staged in the middle of Grand Central Station during rush hour,
while Tunick's photo shoot had to be banned regardless of time,
place or manner in which it occurred, to say that the statute as
interpreted by the city would raise serious constitutional
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Koerner, the city's chief assistant corporation counsel,
said he thought that the judges' criticisms were gratuitous. He
said the city had asked them to send the case to the state appeals
court.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick's lawyer, Ronald L. Kuby, said, ``The bottom line is that
Tunick is moving closer to finally being able to take a picture.''

UCONN IS FORCED TO BREAK A SWEAT

<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ A fight. How unfamiliar. The Connecticut women's
basketball team had not participated in such an event recently.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, the nation's top-ranked team and the undisputed
favorite to advance to the Final Four, had walloped its first three
opponents in the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament by an average of 43.6 points a game. But Monday night in
the East Regional final, Louisiana State made the Huskies sweat for
their ticket to the Final Four in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until Svetlana Abrosimova buried a 3-pointer with 36
seconds left, giving the Huskies (34-1) an 84-69 lead, that
Connecticut had truly delivered its knockout punch. Abrosimova
scored 25 points to lead Connecticut to an 86-71 victory over LSU.
Abrosimova, a 6-foot-2 forward from St. Petersburg, Russia, was
named the East Regional's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is UConn's fourth trip to the Final Four in 10
years, it is the current Huskies first trip. In 1995, when
Connecticut won the national championship, it advanced from the
East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut did not care where it was playing, only that it
could advance to Philadelphia. The Huskies led by only 5 points at
halftime, after enduring an unconscious display of shooting from
LSU, 74 percent in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State, and its 18-year veteran coach Sue Gunter, have
never been to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova scored 8 points in the first five minutes of the
second half, keeping the Huskies on top by no more than 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the deciding two possessions of the night, the
kind that heavyweights like Connecticut make.
</P>
<P>
   Asjha Jones scored on a fast break layup with 10 minutes 26
seconds remaining to give the Huskies a 63-52 lead. Connecticut did
not pause, setting up in its ferocious fullcourt defense on LSU's
inbounds play. The sophomore forward Tamika Williams stole the ball
for Connecticut and passed it to Shea Ralph, waiting under the
basket for an easy chip shot that gave the Huskies what was then
their largest lead of the night, 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph was not done. Her 3-pointer with six minutes remaining
gave UConn a 17-point lead. And even though LSU fought back to
close to 9 points with under three minutes to play, Abrosimova
score the crucial 5 points to send the Huskies to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   For the second half, the Tigers shot only 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State, the third-best team in the Southeastern
Conference, went into the game knowing it was a long shot.
``Stranger things have been known to happen,'' Gunter said before
the game. And there was nothing stranger than her players making
all but six of their 23 shots in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   April Brown, a Louisiana State junior forward who finished with
23 points, scored 18 points, 7 more than her average, in the first
18 minutes of the half. She was 4-for-4 from 3-point range and
missed just two shots all half. So did the junior point guard Marie
Ferdinand, the hero of the regional semifinal victory over
Oklahoma, who was 5 for 7 with 13 points. Brown and Ferdinand
allowed the Tigers to stay within single digits for most of the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting shots was the key, Gunter knew, after studying game
films of Tennessee's victory over the Huskies, their only loss of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   While Connecticut played eight players in the first nine minutes
of the game, LSU did not substitute until six minutes were left in
the first half. Not a bad strategy when the players on the floor
were shooting so well.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies had their stars as well. Abrosimova scored 10
points in the first 10 minutes, answering each LSU basket with a
timely 3-pointer or a runner. Abrosimova then scored 8 more points
in the first five minutes of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Bird, with 14 first-half points for UConn, complemented her,
going 4 for 6 from 3-point range. &QL;

 MORE DIET-DRUG LAWSUITS ARE EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The advertisements began popping up on television and
radio two months ago: Weitz &AMP; Luxenberg, a Manhattan law firm, was
telling people who said they had been made ill by the diet pill
combination fen-phen that their chances of being fairly compensated
might be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   A $3.75 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit could be
approved by a federal court soon, and the ads warned that most
people harmed by the once popular prescription would be barred from
bringing individual suits unless they ``opt out'' of the
class-action suit by Thursday. And of course the announcer urged
those affected to call Weitz &AMP; Luxenberg to ``investigate your
legal options.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm says it has received more than 200 responses to its ads
and has taken on 25 of the cases. Along with another law firm's Web
site, which is highly critical of the proposed class-action
settlement and has offered to provide forms for those wanting to
withdraw from the suit, the ads make clear that the tangle of
litigation over fen-phen will continue even if the class settlement
wins approval.
</P>
<P>
   The ads and the Web site, by the New York firm of Napoli, Kaiser
&AMP; Bern, highlight a paradox of the legal profession: Class-action
agreements can fuel the litigation fires they are intended to
douse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you about the culture of the legal profession and
about the money at stake,'' said Stephen Gillers, vice dean of New
York University School of Law. He said the ads did not breach legal
ethics. ``When we see plaintiff lawyers vs. defense lawyers, that's
only Act 1,'' he said of widespread personal injury litigation
involving a product or material. ``Act 2 becomes plaintiff lawyers
vs. plaintiff lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester Brickman, a specialist in legal ethics at the Benjamin N.
Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, said plaintiff lawyers
skirmishing to either maximize or reduce the size of class-action
suits will say ``they're acting in the public interest.'' The
proposed fen-phen settlement includes up to $429 million in fees
for the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But Roy D. Simon, a law professor at Hofstra University, said,
``If it's accurate, I think this type of advertisement is actually
helpful to people.'' He said that usually in class litigation, ``If
people have large individual claims, they may be better off in an
individual action than a class action.'' An ad like this, he said,
affords ``another perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed settlement, intended to cover thousands of people
across the country who have suffered heart-valve damage after
taking two of the diet pills in the fen-phen combination, was
reached in October with American Home Products Corp., based in
Madison, N.J., and is subject to approval by the presiding judge,
Louis C. Bechtle, of U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The company's pharmaceutical division, Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories, made Pondimin _ its brand name for fenfluramine, an
appetite depressant that is the ``fen'' in the case _ and
distributed a similar drug, Redux. Some 6 million people took one
or the other, often in combination with phentermine _ the ``phen''
in the formula _ which increases the rate at which calories are
burned.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gordon, a partner in Weitz &AMP; Luxenberg, which is not
involved in the class litigation, called the ads ``a public service
to alert people to deadlines they might not know about and to let
them know they may do better'' with an individual suit.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley M. Chesley, a plaintiffs' lawyer from Cincinnati who
helped negotiate the settlement, said, ``It's just another law firm
trying to get business at this late date.''
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market
in late 1997 after studies linked them to heart-valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 individual suits have been filed by former users
claiming such damage. The class settlement would give those who
have ``serious'' damage _ and who did not opt out of the class
action _ payments ranging from $7,400 to nearly $1.5 million,
depending on factors like age and degree of damage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are provisions for withdrawing from the class lawsuit
after Thursday under certain circumstances. If too many withdraw to
pursue individual suits, American Home Products can scrap the
accord, and with it the legal fees. A spokesman for the company,
Doug Petkus, said it had not determined how many ``opt outs'' would
be too many.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon said Weitz &AMP; Luxenberg had ``turned down far more than we
accepted'' of those who responded to its ads, which stopped running
two weeks ago, and had told many callers to stick with the class
settlement plan `'if they don't have a significant claim.'' He
added, ``I'm not saying the plan is bad, only that it's not right
for every case.''

HOW LONG CAN TIME STAND STILL?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly four hours, we absorbed the jolts along gutted roads,
churned through gushing rivers and twisted and turned in the rugged
mountains until finally, our battered sport utility vehicle
shuddered to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   We stepped onto a lush green plateau that was dotted with yellow
flowers, skittish goats and wooden huts. Then the people we had
been searching for came to greet us. The women stood tall and
bare-breasted, their dark brown skin stained red with ocher, their
long braids swinging below their shoulders. The men wore loincloths
and sandals.
</P>
<P>
   They smiled and gestured wordlessly at the flat rocks scattered
about the village, inviting us to sit. As the sun dropped, we
shivered by the small smoky fire and watched the children herd
goats and the women milk cows, as these nomadic shepherds have done
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dec. 29 and I was searching for a tribe with no
wristwatches, no wall calendars and no champagne to celebrate the
arrival of the year 2000. During a visit with the Himba people in
Ekambu, a village in this arid corner of northwest Namibia, my
husband, Henri, and I found a place where the electric light bulb
does not exist, the flush toilet is not yet imagined and the
priests still call to the gods and holy ancestors over the sacred
fire that burns in every village.
</P>
<P>
   For years now, a steady trickle of foreign travelers has come to
this remote region to admire the craggy terrain, the magnificent
Epupa waterfalls to the north and the desert elephants that lumber
through the Sesfontein region to the south. But nowadays, it is
often the people, not only the scenery, who draw the tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Hiperue Koruhama, a villager with two wives and nine children,
had never heard of New York or the United States or the western
custom of numbering years and naming months. He told me his people
marked the new year with the coming of seasonal rains, and the
changing days and months with the sun and moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know in the morning the sun is high up and the cows must go
to graze,'' Koruhama said simply, speaking in his Herero language,
while my guide interpreted. ``At sunset, the cows must come home.
That is how we live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Himba people walked into the Kaokoland region from what is
now Angola nearly 300 years ago and keep proudly to their
traditional ways. More and more Namibian lodges are advertising
guided tours to their villages, hoping to attract the planeloads of
German, Italian and Japanese tourists and the smaller number of
Americans who fly across the world to glimpse one of the last
self-sufficient tribes in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not enough people like this left in the world,''
said Lente Hamel, the manager of the Ohakane Lodge, one of the
hotels we stayed in during our weeklong journey. ``So people come
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But finding people truly untouched by the outside world is not
easy.
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists estimate that only about 7,000 Himba live today
much as their ancestors did centuries ago, wearing animal skins,
raising cattle and moving as often as 10 times a year in search of
water and green grass for their goats and cows.
</P>
<P>
   It is often a harsh life, characterized by periods of drought
and hunger, and some Himba are giving it up, moving to towns,
finding jobs or sending their children to school. In the nearby
towns of Opuwo and Sesfontein, I found myself startled by the mix
of the modern and traditional. Young men wear baseball caps and
loincloths. And villagers sometimes cover their thatched roofs with
plastic tarpaulins to prevent leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Several lodges in those towns offer modest, welcoming rooms,
meals and daily tours of Himba villages. For many travelers, this
is the most comfortable option because the towns themselves offer
few amenities, like restaurants or movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   For tourists hoping to meet Himba people beyond the tourist
circuit, the traveling is rougher. We packed tents, sleeping bags,
mosquito netting, pots, canned food and bottled water. Ekambu is a
three-hour drive away from a working telephone. There are no
lodges, no hotels and no restaurants there.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists provide some struggling villages with desperately
needed assistance _ tour guides typically bring gifts of food on
each visit _ that helps the Himba get through lean times. But
increased contact with foreigners, who sometimes leave gifts of
alcohol and money, has also resulted in increased alcoholism and
prostitution, anthropologists and hotel owners say.
</P>
<P>
   And many tourists who arrive eager to snap photographs of the
Himba leave the villages thrilled by the people they have met, but
ambivalent about their visit. ``I was amazed by their way of
living, they're so beautiful,'' said Mariko Oura, who flew from
Japan with a large group of tourists. ``But frankly, I wonder if we
should come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They danced for us and posed for us and I took photos,'' said
Oura, an English tutor who lives outside Kobe in Japan. ``But I
wonder if everyone enjoys being photographed like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthropologists say tourism in its worst forms carries negative
implications for the Himba. But at the same time, Margaret
Jacobsohn, who has written a book about these nomadic shepherds,
says the world should not treat the Himba like curios that must be
preserved in museums.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the arrival of growing numbers of tourists, she
says, the Himba had become increasingly exposed to the outside
world as they began to send their children to school and to mix
with foreign anthropologists and missionaries, as well as other
Namibians who wear western clothing and often work in offices and
drive cars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many Himba dabble freely in both worlds. For instance,
Zepauandoui Koruhama, one of Koruhama's wives, told me she still
boiled the root of the sour plum tree to cure diarrhea but also
took aspirin for fever.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The Himba are changing,'' Jacobsohn said in a telephone
interview. ``It's not a static thing and it shouldn't be. People
are using both systems now. They live with a foot in each world.''
</P>
<P>
   Before taking busloads of tourists to the villages, the lodge
managers say they consult the local chief to see whether foreigners
and their cameras will be welcome there. Willy Kasupi, who works as
a guide for the Fort Sesfontein Lodge, says he tells tourists
specifically who wants to be photographed and who does not want to
have a picture taken, although he says tourists sometimes ignore
his instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people treat the villages like a zoo, which is what we
want to avoid,'' said Hamel, the manager of the Ohakane Lodge in
Opuwo. ``When we take tourists, we explain that they have to follow
the social rules of the village. You do not just walk into
someone's garden and start taking photos. It's basic. It's good
manners.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors typically start the journey in Windhoek, the capital of
Namibia, which is a two-hour flight from Johannesburg. From there,
you can rent a sport utility vehicle at the airport and take the 8-
to 10-hour drive to Sesfontein or Opuwo. Or you can charter a small
plane, which costs considerably more, and make the same journey in
about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   We flew to Sesfontein and stayed at the Fort Sesfontein Lodge,
which was built as a German fort back in 1896, when Namibia was a
German colony. The rustic lodge, while attractive, does not have
air-conditioning. But each room does have a ceiling fan, absolutely
essential if you're traveling during the hot months _ December,
January and February.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge offers day tours to Himba villages, but we wanted to
meet people unfamiliar with tourists. So we hired Kasupi, who
belongs to a tribe related to the Himba and speaks their language,
rented a sport utility from the lodge, packed our tents and
sleeping bags and drove two hours to Opuwo.
</P>
<P>
   In Opuwo, we shopped for pots, pasta, canned meatballs, fruit,
bread and bottled water. We booked rooms at the Ohakane Lodge for
our return to Opuwo and took off for Ekambu, where we pitched
tents, started a fire and cooked our pasta and meatballs and camped
for one night under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Kasupi, who has been guiding tours for about three years now,
said that the Himba were often tickled by the idea that foreigners
wanted to visit them. ``They ask me, `Who are these people who say
they have never seen Himba?''' Kasupi said. ``They cannot imagine a
place where there are no Himba.''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers I met peppered me with questions about where I was
from. And I found myself pointing northwest, describing this huge
nation across the water called the United States, as they shook
their heads trying to imagine such a place.
</P>
<P>
   When the afternoon rains started falling, Koruhama invited me
into her thatched hut so we could talk without getting wet. I
ducked my head to enter the small doorway and sat on the blanket
she had spread out on the dirt floor. Kasupi joined us to
interpret.
</P>
<P>
   As her children ran in and out, marveling at me, an oddly
dressed stranger, Koruhama told me about her family, about the
hunger they endure during the dry season, about sending one son far
away to a western school and about her fears that the boy might
ultimately reject her people's traditional ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes are mainly touching younger people, the boys who
wear T-shirts and shorts,'' she said, sighing. ``But the older
people, they do not change. As you see, I'm still traditional. I
will always keep my lifestyle.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How to visit the Himba &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, the State Department issued an announcement strongly
urging Americans to avoid the northern border area of Namibia,
including the entire Kavango and Caprivi regions, because fighting
in Angola has spilled over the border into Namibia on occasion. But
none of the places I visited to meet the Himba are in the region
covered by the State Department announcement. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations and Tours &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Sesfontein Lodge in Sesfontein, telephone and fax
(264-61) 25-2508, is built on the striking ruins of a German fort
370 miles from Windhoek, Namibia's capital. The 12 rooms and 2
family units are modest but comfortable and the stone patio has a
lovely swimming pool. There are no phones, TV or air-conditioning,
but all rooms have ceiling fans. (The lodge's generator goes off at
11 every night.)
</P>
<P>
   During the summer season, which ends in April, rooms start at
about $122 for a double with breakfast and dinner, based on 6
Namibian dollars to the American dollar. During the fall and winter
season, which begins in May, rooms cost $155 with meals. Guided
tours accommodating up to four people cost about $208 a day in
summer and $267 in winter, with lunch. If you have a rental car and
just want to hire a guide, the day rate is about $50 through April,
$75 after.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohakane Lodge in Opuwo, (264-65) 27-3031, fax (264-65)
27-3025, is a modern, comfortable hotel about 500 miles from
Windhoek and 120 miles from Sesfontein. The lodge has small rooms
(the single rooms are very small) with air-conditioning and
telephones. Rooms start at about $83 for a double with breakfast.
Guided day tours to Himba villages that include lunch cost about
$30 a person. Five-day camping safaris cost $133 a person a day.
</P>
<P>
   Kaokohimba Safaris, telephone and fax (264-61) 22-2378, arranges
package tours for small groups to Himba villages. These include
charter flights from Windhoek, rustic lodging, tours and meals.
Rates run from $1,053 a person for three days to $2,063 a person
for 12 days. &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Desert Air, (264-61) 22-8101, fax (264-61) 25-4345, offers
charter flights from Windhoek to Sesfontein and Opuwo and back. The
round-trip flight _ in single-prop planes that seat five people
with minimal luggage _ costs about $900. Bush Pilots, (264-61)
22-8316, fax (264-61) 24-5083, offers comparable fares.

UNEXPECTED POWER VACUUM AT WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France _ Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze spent
Monday afternoon in nearby Monte Carlo, their chances of winning
their third consecutive world title gone because of the drug test
failed by Berezhnaya at the European championships last month.
</P>
<P>
   But while Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze drove dejectedly along the
Mediterranean and while their coach, Tamara Moskvina, met the news
media and tried to explain how her pupil had inadvertently ingested
a banned stimulant, the rest of the world's top pairs were busy
filling the unexpected power vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the short program Monday night, the revised
pecking order was: first, Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao of China;
second, Mariya Petrova and Aleksei Tikhonov of Russia; third, Jamie
Sale and David Pelletier of Canada; and fourth, Sarah Abitbol and
Stephane Bernadis of France.
</P>
<P>
   The top Americans after the short program, which counts for
one-third of the final score, were Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman,
who skated very cleanly and received marks of 5.4 to 5.6 for
technical merit and 5.4 to 5.8 for presentation. In previous world
championships, that performance might have been enough to keep them
in strong medal contention. On Monday night, even in the absence of
the defending champions, it was only good enough for sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy and excited about the fact that pair skating made
such a big step forward,'' Tikhonov said. ``Last year we saw the
beautiful lines and style of Yelena and Anton, but they made
mistakes sometimes. And we also saw the dynamic and strong
performances of the Chinese couple. But now most of the couples
skated great technically.''
</P>
<P>
   The product was not as consistently eye-catching in the men's
qualifying round, which took place earlier on the first day of
these championships: too early for the brilliant Russian teen-ager
Yevgeny Plushchenko.
</P>
<P>
   Plushchenko, the reigning European champion, performed his free
program shortly after 10 a.m. and promptly fell while attempting a
quadruple jump; later in his program he downgraded two triple jumps
to doubles. Plushchenko still qualified comfortably by finishing
second in his group behind the three-time world champion Elvis
Stojko.
</P>
<P>
   The defending world champion, Aleksei Yagudin, was just as
impressive in the other group while performing his revamped free
program to Puccini's ``Tosca.'' Yagudin changed his music after
losing to Plushchenko at the European and Russian championships.
``After all my success last season, it was really hard to start
working hard again,'' he said. ``But I now understand that if I
don't work, I will lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind Yagudin in Group A was the American champion, Michael
Weiss, who landed nine triple jumps and skated cleanly.

EDITORIAL: LESSONS FROM THE DORISMOND FUNERAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, March 28:
</P>
<P>
   The mourners who erupted in violence at Patrick Dorismond's
funeral on Saturday made the event immeasurably more painful for
the Dorismond family _ and were playing with the kind of fire that
easily burns out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The melee, which ended with two dozen police officers injured
and 27 civilians arrested, was less serious than it might have
been, thanks to police officers who behaved with restraint and
civilians who urged fellow mourners back from the brink of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the violence at the funeral was proof that New York
City has reached a critical juncture in its race relations. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, whose comments over the weekend continued to
raise tensions in the black community, needs to reach out and start
a dialogue with the black elected officials he has previously
shunned.
</P>
<P>
   The escalating tensions stem from events on March 16, when
Dorismond, a security guard, became the fourth unarmed black man to
be shot to death by the police in little more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, despite the absence of conclusive facts about how the
incident had unfolded, defended the police and described Dorismond
as a violent person whose actions may have provoked the shooting.
Giuliani tried to support that claim in part by releasing
information from sealed juvenile records dating to when Dorismond
was 13 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor came under heavy criticism for failing to express
sympathy for the grieving Dorismond family, but on Sunday he
finally began to make amends with an expression of sympathy for any
parent who loses a child.
</P>
<P>
   But even then the mayor promptly returned to maligning and
blaming the victim. He reiterated that Dorismond recently hit his
girlfriend in the face and suggested that the dead man's
temperament had led to the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For the good of the city, the mayor needs to put aside this
inflammatory line of discourse and wait for the Manhattan district
attorney to complete his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Giuliani needs to confer with black elected
officials, many of whom feel shut out at City Hall. A
well-publicized meeting with those officials would show New Yorkers
that Giuliani recognizes the seriousness of the rift that exists
between the police and the community _ and is seeking insights on
how to bridge the gap.

PENN STATE'S COACH CONFRONTS AND ADMIRES THE OPPOSITION  

</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Growing up in Raleigh, N.C., Jerry Dunn had limited
choices in television viewing. He recalls Saturdays filled with
Atlantic Coast Conference basketball and Sunday mornings devoted to
replays of Notre Dame and Penn State football.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn developed an appreciation for ACC basketball and for the
success of Penn State and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, things are going to look very familiar to Dunn,
Penn State's coach, when the National Invitation Tournament
semifinals get under way at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State (20-12) will face Wake Forest (20-14) in
the first game at 7 p.m. Eastern time, and Dunn's Nittany Lions
(18-15) will play Notre Dame (21-14) in the second semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   If Dunn can find a way to tame Notre Dame forward Troy Murphy,
who is averaging 22.9 points and 10.5 rebounds a game, then Penn
State will get a chance to appear in its second NIT championship
game in three years. In 1998, Penn State lost to Minnesota, 79-72.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a guy like Troy Murphy, you have to get him the
ball,'' Dunn said. ``But I don't think Notre Dame is a
one-dimensional team. They have other guys who can score also.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame Coach Matt Doherty has brought his team to New York
for the second time this month. The team was here earlier for the
Big East tournament. Notre Dame had thought that a good showing
would produce a bid to the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really disappointed we didn't get into the NCAA
tournament,'' Murphy said. ``But Coach Doherty told us that we had
to get over it and get excited about playing in the NIT. If we win
the NIT championship, then it will show that the NCAA. was wrong
about us.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wake Forest and North Carolina State, this will be a rerun
of the head-banging matchups they experienced during the season.
The teams split games during the regular season, each winning on
its home court. But the teams did not meet in the ACC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden will present the perfect neutral site for this
all-ACC matchup.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State went through a seven-game losing streak
late in the season but reversed the trend just in time for the ACC
tournament and for postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   But Coach Herb Sendek said that, in a strange way, the streak
brought his Wolfpack team closer and made his players tougher for
the NIT.

GLENN EXUM, 88, MOUNTAIN CLIMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Glenn Exum, a mountain climber who conquered the summits of the
Alps and the Rockies and shared his experience with hundreds of
others through his guide service, died on March 17 at his home in
Littleton, Colo. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, debonair man, Exum established one of the routes to the
peak of Grand Teton in 1931. He climbed what came to be known as
the Exum Ridge of that Wyoming mountain in a pair of
leather-cleated football shoes. His path had required jumping a
chasm, which later climbers learned to climb around.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Williamson, a former president of the American Alpine Club,
said that Exum studied European methods of guiding climbers in the
1930s and worked to change them. Those methods, Williamson said,
essentially involved tying a rope around the climbers and pulling
them up the mountain whenever they encountered difficulty. Then,
rather than rappelling down on their own, they would often be
lowered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn's idea was that people ought to be responsible,''
Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Exum was born in Topaz, Idaho, on June 24, 1911. He had
taught music at a high school in Pocatello, Idaho. Building on his
passion for the outdoors, he climbed extensively in both the
Rockies and the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   He began working with Paul Petzoldt, the legendary mountaineer
and climbing instructor, in Petzoldt's guide service in Grand Teton
National Park, and took over the service in 1955. Now called the
Exum Mountain Guide Service, it has the concession from the
National Park Service for climbing instruction in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Al Read, the president of the guide service, said that Exum had
introduced courses to teach students technical skills. ``People can
now feel proud of what they're doing, instead of just being dragged
up something,'' Read said.
</P>
<P>
   Exum is survived by his wife, the former Beth Pauline Noben; his
son, Edward, of Denver; and his daughter, Glenda, of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, colon cancer was diagnosed in Exum, and he had several
operations, largely withdrawing from guiding and climbing.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1981 he climbed Grand Teton to observe the 50th
anniversary of scaling his ridge. He said that it was a privilege
to climb the peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grand Teton is endlessly different, with its changing
moods and attitudes, its eternal beauty,'' he said.

EWING AGAIN FINDS HIMSELF AT THE CENTER OF CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ After three years of dizzying injuries, the
rumpled, old Patrick Ewing has emerged from the spin cycle as fresh
and bright as clean laundry.
</P>
<P>
   He feels great, looks rejuvenated and is waving for the ball as
if it were the spring of '97.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, he was at his lifesaving best in the last 33
seconds. He sank two free throws under hostile conditions in
Portland. Then, as an encore, he swatted a runner by Scottie Pippen
to douse the Trail Blazers' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   On other nights, he has not been so perfect in his effort to
recreate the past. When faced with Shaquille O'Neal on March 19,
Ewing felt so spry he tried to match the Lakers' powerful superstar
by taking 20 shots. He only made six of them in the Knicks' loss.
When the Knicks were in the midst of a mental meltdown against the
Indiana Pacers two days later, Ewing took 6 of his 18 shots in the
fourth quarter. He made only one.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Knicks are living or dying by the grace or the
gaffe of Ewing. Even on the nights he has successfully turned back
the clock _ as in the aftermath of Sunday's game _ he still gets
questioned about his shot-happy tendencies. Lately, there has also
been an undercurrent of concern from a couple of Ewing's teammates.
Privately, they are thrilled with their proud star's ability to
contribute but a bit unsettled by the gradual return of a
Ewing-based offense.
</P>
<P>
   To Ewing, it is all just the same background noise he has been
ignoring for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to grumble,'' Ewing said. ``You have your
critics. I feel that I still have a lot of basketball in me. Like
I've said before, when they call my number, I've got to step up and
get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   His career has been punctuated by great moments and blown
opportunities. Year after year, the burden was on Ewing. But with
the development of Allan Houston and the acquisition of Latrell
Sprewell, the pressure was supposed to be dispersed. When Ewing was
forced to step back as he played through pain last season, Houston
and Sprewell took on the nightly load. Then the two players pushed
onward the day Ewing sustained a partly torn Achilles' tendon
during the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Until Ewing returned in December, Houston and Sprewell were
still leading the team. While there is no doubt the Knicks are
better with Ewing, how much of him is too much of a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   In the months since Ewing came back, Houston's shot attempts
have dropped from 17 a game in December to 14.3 so far in March.
Sprewell's attempts took a dip from 16.7 a night in December to
13.8 in February, before going back up to 16 this month. In that
same period, Ewing's average attempts have risen from 10 in
December to 13.6 over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of the adjustments, the Knicks have struggled to
find a rhythm. Right now, they are humming along well enough. They
are tied with Miami for the lead in the Atlantic Division and are
coming off their most impressive road victory of the season _
courtesy of Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone seems to think the champion is going to come out of
the West,'' Ewing said. ``We want to make a statement that if we
get there, we have as good a chance to win a title as anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks looked like top contenders Sunday night as they broke
out of their funk on the road against an elite team and began their
five-game West Coast swing with a victory. They will face the
Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night. With that in mind, Sprewell
said: ``It was just one game. If we finish this road trip the way
we started it, then we can say we made strides.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they can say they have found a groove. To this point,
everyone has been up and down. Ewing, in particular, has been prone
to rise and fall. At age 37, he can't bounce back the way he used
to. Even when he does, he is still asked about the appropriate size
of his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat has been here the longest,'' Larry Johnson said. ``'By
now, he knows how to take it all in stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has been the core of the Knicks' world for the better part
of 15 years. After three seasons interrupted by injuries, Ewing is
focused on regaining his elite form _ or as close to it as age will
allow. An hour before the team bus departed their Portland hotel,
Ewing was already at the Rose Garden shooting jumpers. He just
keeps working, keeps shooting, no matter what anyone says.

EDITORIAL: TRIMBLE'S NARROW VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, March 28:
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, who survived an unexpectedly strong challenge to
win re-election as head of the Ulster Unionist Party over the
weekend, is the most enlightened political leader Northern
Ireland's Protestant majority has yet produced.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his tactical maneuvers have been questionable. But
without his principled commitment to political power-sharing
between Protestants and Roman Catholics and respect for the civil
rights of all, there would have been no Good Friday peace agreement
two years ago and little hope for reviving Northern Ireland's
suspended home-rule government today.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial minority of Ulster Unionists has resisted
Trimble's peacemaking. Roughly 42 percent of party delegates
opposed his decision to join the home rule cabinet last November.
Some 43 percent voted Saturday to replace Trimble with the Rev.
Martin Smyth, an opponent of the Good Friday agreement. In both
votes Trimble was weakened by the Irish Republican Army's refusal
to commit itself to giving up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Besides re-electing Trimble, the Ulster Unionists also voted not
to participate again in a home rule government unless Britain
abandoned its plan to change the name of the province's police
force, now known as the Royal Ulster Constabulary, to the Northern
Ireland Police Service.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's top official on Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, is
right in refusing to back down on the planned name change. The new
title is part of a wider police reform designed to create trust and
aid recruitment in the Catholic community. Currently the force is
more than 90 percent Protestant in a province that is almost 40
percent Catholic. With home rule suspended, it is especially
important that other reforms, like the police changes, go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble must take care to bring his party along with him. But he
should not modify his own progressive positions to accommodate
party opponents. In particular, he should not retreat from his
recently stated view that he would be willing to bring his party
back into a Northern Ireland government once the IRA made a firm
commitment to disarm, without waiting for the actual handover of
weapons to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA should respond by reviving and amplifying the proposal
it made and then withdrew in early February suggesting a
``context'' that would lead it to disarm. Trimble's strong
leadership will be needed as Northern Ireland pursues its quest for
a lasting peace.

<P>
   Raymond Katz, a television and theatrical producer and a
personal manager, died on Thursday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He
was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   From 1970 to 1985 Katz, with his partner and cousin Sandy
Gallin, ran a management and production business that created
television shows starring some of the most popular entertainers of
the day. Among their hits were the series ``Donny and Marie'' and
the Emmy Award-winning ``Sold Out,'' starring Lily Tomlin and Kate
Smith, as well as specials featuring Cher, Mac Davis, Paul Lynde,
Dolly Parton and Olivia Newton John.
</P>
<P>
   They moved to television films in the early 1980s, producing
``The Miracle Worker'' with Melissa Gilbert and Patty Duke, ``Diary
of Anne Frank,'' ``Choices of the Heart,'' ``Family Secrets,''
``Splendor in the Grass'' and ``Without Her Consent.''
</P>
<P>
   They also produced the NBC mini-series ``Mussolini: The Untold
Story,'' starring George C. Scott, and ``Stagecoach,'' a CBS remake
of the John Ford Western, with Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson
and Johnny Cash.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York, Katz began his career as the stage manager
of the Capitol Theater on Broadway. After directing the NBC ``Navy
Hour'' during World War II he accepted the position of program
director with MGM's New York radio station, WHN, where he created a
syndication division for original programming that presented weekly
series like ``Maisie,'' with Ann Sothern; ``Hardy Family,'' with
Mickey Rooney; and ``Woman of the Year,'' with Bette Davis. He
retired in 1960 to focus on personal management.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 Katz produced the film ``I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,'' a
spoof of '70s blaxploitation movies, for United Artists. He also
produced several Broadway shows in the '80s, including ``Monday
After the Miracle.'' In 1991 he joined Herman Rush to establish
Katz-Rush Entertainment, which produced 13 episodes of ``The New
Original Amateur Hour'' for the Family Channel.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Barbara.

</P>
<P>
   Klaus Piper, a German publisher who helped build his family's
business into one of Europe's most respected intellectual imprints,
died on Saturday at his home in Munich. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Piper (pronounced PEE-per) learned the trade after joining his
family's publishing house in 1932 as an apprentice. The
Munich-based firm R. Piper Verlag was founded in 1904 by his
father, Reinhard, who grounded it in philosophy, literature and the
arts.
</P>
<P>
   When his father died in 1953, Klaus Piper took the helm and
broadened the Piper catalog to encompass history, politics and the
natural and social sciences. His stable of internationally known
authors included the German philosopher and psychopathologist Karl
Jaspers, the German-American political theorist Hannah Arendt, the
violinist Yehudi Menuhin and the pianist Alfred Brendel.
</P>
<P>
   He personally brought Kurt Vonnegut Jr. into the fold with the
1977 publication of Vonnegut's novel ``Slapstick,'' translated into
German, no mean feat considering the author's inimitable style.
Complimented on his ``large vision,'' Vonnegut, on a visit to
Frankfurt, said it was obvious that Piper was ``the publisher for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Piper, who spoke English and French, agreed: ``I don't publish
books, I publish authors.''
</P>
<P>
   He sold his majority share in Piper Verlag to the Swedish
publishing group Bonnier in 1994, saying he wanted to assure the
company's future. Until two years ago he remained an adviser to the
firm.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife and five children.

   NEW YORK _ Albert R. Connelly, a retired partner at the New York
law firm of Cravath, Swaine &AMP; Moore, died at his home in Manhattan
last Wednesday. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly spent his entire professional career, from 1932 to
1978, at the law firm. He became a partner in 1941 and practiced in
many fields. He was particularly well known as a litigator and an
antitrust lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He argued nine cases before the Supreme Court, including United
States vs. Penn-Olin in 1964, a case in which he obtained an
affirmation of a lower-court ruling that allowed a joint venture
between two large companies that were potential competitors, the
Pennwalt Corp. and the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Ray Connelly was born on Nov. 24, 1908, in Manhattan. He
graduated from Yale University and Yale Law School. From 1957 to
1958, he was chairman of the executive committee of the City Bar
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly's wife, Eleanor, died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by two daughters, Mary C. Graff of Urbanna, Va.,
and Jean C. Mooney of Healdsburg, Calif.; two granddaughters and
one great-grandson.

CLIPPERS WAIVE HUDSON, SIGN BOHANNON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They didn't exactly super-size their situation,
but - for the Clippers - it was a relatively ``big'' move.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Troy Hudson is out.
</P>
<P>
   Power forward Etdrick Bohannon is in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to bring in another `big','' interim head coach Jim
Todd said Monday after the Clippers waived the 6-foot Hudson and
signed the 6-9 Bohannon to a 10-day contract. ``We felt we needed
extra energy inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy just got caught up in a numbers game ... we have a lot of
guys who can play the point guard position.''
</P>
<P>
   Clipper Tyrone Nesby, Hudson's best friend on the team, former
teammate at Sioux Falls of the CBA and an acquaintance since their
days on the high school circuit in southern Illinois, thinks there
were other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upset,'' Nesby said of Hudson, who averaged 8.8 points
and 3.9 assists in 62 games, ``because he knew he gave it
everything he had. He might think it's a personal thing between him
and the coach. I feel the same thing, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing personal,'' Todd said of Hudson, who contributed
6.8 points per game last season after being rescued from the CBA
for the final 25 games. ``Somebody had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But things are far from gloomy in the Hudson camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy,'' said Hudson's agent, Bill Neff, who was hoping
the Clippers would pass on their option to pick up his client's
contract for next season. ``We saw it as a dead end there. We just
wish they had done it sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Neff also earned his percentage by throwing in a few
client-specific numbers. When Hudson played 30 or more minutes this
season for the 14-57 Clippers, they were 10-16.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are other factors involved in that record, but Neff
will stay the statistical course in his attempt to place Hudson
with another team next season. Any team hiring the former Southern
Illinois University star this season would not be able to suit him
up for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   PAIN IS GAINING: Bohannon, a springy 235-pounder from San
Bernardino, Calif. (not to mention a prep school and three
universities), averaged 12.5 points and 10.7 rebounds in 39 games
with the CBA's Fort Wayne Fury. Before joining the New York Knicks
on a recent 10-day contract, he had 21 rebounds in the CBA All-Star
game.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival was inspired by several nagging injuries currently
afflicting front-court Clippers. Maurice Taylor (ankle), Lamar Odom
(calf) and Keith Closs (asthma) will not play tonight against
Dallas at Staples Center. Nesby injured the middle finger of his
shooting hand against Detroit last Saturday; he didn't practice
Monday, but did have the finger X-rayed. Eric Piatkowski (back
spasms) also didn't practice, but expects to play. &QL;

SINKING RANGERS GIVE UP 14 GOALS IN CONSECUTIVE LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The boos grew louder each time Theo Fleury touched
the puck. By the time the Detroit Red Wings completed their 6-0
victory, all of the Rangers deserved to be booed.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at the Garden, Fleury went another game without a
goal. He has just 15 this season _ one more than his career-low _
in 77 games.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury and Valery Kamensky, who was also a target of audience's
wrath, were acquired during the off season from Colorado to
jump-start the offense. But neither player has provided any
production on offense.
</P>
<P>
   With four games left in their season, the Rangers are on the
brink of playoff elimination. They have lost their last five games
by a combined score of 27-10. The Red Wings outscored the Rangers
by 14-2 the last two days. They have not given up 14 goals in
consecutive games since 1993. That season they lost seven of their
last 12 games and Coach Roger Neilson was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star Game break, the Rangers are 6-15-4 and have
dropped a season-high 9 games under .500, at 29-38-11. The Rangers
are 1-8-1 over their last ten games. They are mired in eleventh
place in the Eastern Conference. They are playing out the string.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sunday's 8-2 thumping in Detroit, the Rangers peppered
the Detroit goaltender Chris Osgood, who made 40 saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have been so bad as of late that ABC announced
Monday that it would not broadcast the originally scheduled
Rangers-Bruins game in Boston on Saturday. The game had been
scheduled for a national broadcast at 1 P.M., Eastern time. The
Rangers-Bruins game has been rescheduled for 4 P.M.
</P>
<P>
   Fans began the chants of ``Fire Muckler!'' midway through the
second period, directed at Coach John Muckler, after the Red Wings
_ who received two goals from their captain, Steve Yzerman _ had
opened a 3-0 lead on Mike Richter at 12 minutes 29 seconds on a
Brent Gilchrist goal. Todd Gill, Kirk Maltby and Tomas Holmstrom
scored the other goals for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The chants for Muckler's job grew louder in the third period.
The boos rang in Fleury's ears.
</P>
<P>
   Richter would probably welcome a fresh slate. After a brilliant
first half, Richter's season has also disintegrated since the
All-Star Game break. The Rangers' sole All-Star representative,
Richter has lost his last seven starts, allowing a total of 28
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are in danger of finishing out the season on a
nine-game losing streak. Monday night's loss guaranteed that the
team will have a losing record at the Garden for the third
consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers cannot win either at home or on the road. Muckler is
certain to be fired after this season. The only real question
facing the Rangers is will team president and general manager Neil
Smith go, too.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's biggest signing, Fleury, has become the poster child for
the fading Rangers this season, but not in the way either he or the
Rangers envisioned when Fleury signed a 3-year, $21 million
contract last summer, one that is paying Fleury $8.5 million this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury will likely finish this season among the top 10 in the
National Hockey League in assists. But Fleury is being paid to
score goals. And that has not been lost on the Garden crowd, as it
watches the Rangers miss out on the playoffs for the third
consecutive year. &QL;

KCP&AMP;L SUBSIDIARY IS A PARTNER IN E-COMMERCE VENTURE FOR UTILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY Knight-Ridder Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Kansas City Power &AMP; Light Co. subsidiary
has become a partner in a venture that aims to boost the use of
e-commerce in purchasing supplies by electric utilities in the
United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   KLT Inc., KCP&AMP;L's deregulated subsidiary, and the St.
Louis-based utility Ameren UE have become partners with Bex.com on
an electronic site that will allow electric utilities to combine
their buying power and shop for everything from paper clips to
heavy machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ... exchange for the electrical utilities industry
effectively brings an old-economy market into the new economy,''
said Greg Orman, president of KLT.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of KLT's investment was not disclosed, although KCP&AMP;L
spokesman Tom Robinson described it as ``small.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is expected to begin operating in the second
quarter. Other utilities might become partners, said Erin Lutz, a
spokeswoman for Bex.com, based in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Lutz said the electronic platform would allow electric utilities
to amass more buying power. In addition, it is expected to smooth
the purchasing of supplies by putting in one place everything from
quotations to payment.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1996, Bex.com operates e-marketplaces specializing in
business-to-business transactions.

CLAYCOMO WORKERS AUTHORIZE STRIKE IF NEGOTIATIONS FAIL 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER, KNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Workers at Ford Motor Co.'s Claycomo plant
have authorized union leaders to call a strike if local
negotiations don't produce a new agreement with the automaker.
</P>
<P>
   About 99 percent of those who voted over the weekend approved
the move, said Jerry Kline, president of United Auto Workers Local
249.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Local 249 officials have negotiated for several months
without reaching a local agreement that supplements the national
contract settled in September.
</P>
<P>
   Kline said several health and safety issues remained unresolved.
In one dispute, the union is seeking a separate entrance for
commercial tractor-trailers doing business at the plant. The union
says truck traffic is a danger to employees as they arrive for and
leave their shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Kline said the two sides continued meeting through the weekend
in an attempt to reach a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The strike authorization vote is another step in the process of
negotiations in case union officials think a strike is necessary.
UAW officers from the international office in Detroit have also
begun participating in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said it was optimistic that a local contract would be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to them with an eye toward resolving any
potential problems,'' said Ed Miller, a Ford spokesman at its
Dearborn, Mich., headquarters. ``These kind of votes are part of
the process, and we respect them for taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the last local strike at a Ford plant was in Atlanta
in 1986, lasting 26 days. The last time the UAW struck Ford
nationwide was 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a history of getting these things settled,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Claycomo plant employs about 4,900 hourly employees. The
plant builds the Ford F-series pickup truck and is in the process
of launching a compact sport-utility vehicle called the Escape.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani agreed Monday to abandon his
months-long campaign to evict the Brooklyn Museum of Art and cut
its city financing for having mounted an exhibition last year that
he deemed offensive and sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Giuliani promised to restore the city's
monthly payments to the museum and to drop, once and for all, his
suit to evict it from a city building and remove its board of
trustees because of last fall's ``Sensation'' exhibition, which
included a painting of the Virgin Mary adorned with elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, in turn, dropped its First Amendment lawsuit against
the mayor, who was scheduled for a deposition in the case as early
as this week. The deal also resolved a lingering budget dispute
that had been put on hold during the months of squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials immediately welcomed the settlement, saying
that they were particularly pleased that the city had ended the
budget standoff by agreeing to pay $5.8 million over the next two
years to help repair the museum's entry hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of the past six months have only made our
institution stronger and more dedicated to our mission,'' said
Robert S. Rubin, chairman of the board of trustees. Officials at
the museum, he said, ``are proud of what we have done, happy with
this resolution, and are now eagerly looking forward to the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The city also said that it was happy with the agreement, though
Giuliani administration officials took pains at a news conference
Monday afternoon to stand by the mayor's original objection to the
exhibition. In a series of indignant public statements, Giuliani
had said that he found the exhibition to be pornographic and
anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very gratified with the settlement,'' said Michael D.
Hess, the city's corporation counsel. ``The exhibit is closed, and
at this point it was time to end the hostilities on both sides in
terms of court proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hess said, ``part of that exhibit was obviously
religion-bashing, and the mayor took exception to that, and rightly
so.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement Monday made permanent a temporary court order
issued in November by Judge Nina Gershon of U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn. When the order was first handed down, Giuliani ridiculed
it and promised to appeal, accusing Gershon of `'the usual
knee-jerk reaction of some judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's decision to drop his appeal followed several months
in which he seemed to have dug in his heels against the museum and
its lawyers, including Floyd B. Abrams, the First Amendment expert.
``Mayor Giuliani has done the right thing today,'' Abrams said
Monday. ``I think he should have done it earlier, but he was faced
with an insupportable legal position and a policy which is directly
at war with well-established First Amendment principles.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hess adamantly denied that the mayor had capitulated. ``I am
not saying it is a victory for anybody,'' he said. ``It is happy
that it is over, at this point. It is not a question of anybody
backing down. It is not backing down at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was traveling Monday and could not be reached after the
settlement was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said that the $5.8 million that the city had agreed to pay
for capital improvements was far less than the $11 million that the
museum had sought. He also noted that both sides would pay their
own legal expenses. The museum had sought to have the city pay its
$1 million in fees, Hess said, adding that the city's expenses were
nowhere near that much.
</P>
<P>
   The city, which provides about a third of the museum's annual
$24 million operating budget, began withholding the museum's
monthly subsidy of about $500,000 in October. All of the $3.5
million withheld during previous months has been paid back, and the
city _ as well as Giuliani personally _ could face contempt of
court charges should the money be kept from the museum again.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement seeks to ensure that the museum will be treated
fairly in the years to come by forbidding Giuliani from reducing
its public financing by any amount ``disproportionately greater''
than that of seven other museums, including the Metropolitan Museum
of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, that receive
city money. The agreement is binding on him until he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began when Giuliani announced his distaste for the
Virgin Mary portrait by Chris Ofili, a Roman Catholic of Nigerian
descent, and other works in the exhibition. ``Sensation,'' which
opened Oct. 2 and closed Jan. 9, originated in Britain and was
drawn from the collection of Charles Saatchi, the advertising
magnate.
</P>
<P>
   The fight, one of many First Amendment court battles that have
embroiled the administration, was rich with implications for
Giuliani's race for the U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
By settling the dispute out of court, the mayor avoided the ordeal
of answering questions by the museum's lawyers in a deposition
during the campaign, although Hess denied that was the reason for
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The case had legal implications for publicly financed art
institutions across the country, Abrams said, making them less
vulnerable to censorship by public officials. ``This sends a
message that the museum community is willing to fight back,'' he
said.

<P>
   LONDON _ At first glance, the commercial seemed like a spoof, a
comedy skit that could appear on ``Saturday Night Live.'' Nicholas
Leeson, the rogue stock trader who caused the collapse of Britain's
oldest merchant bank, Barings PLC, is appearing in a campaign that
promotes a Swedish dot-com stock trading company. It may sound as
bizarre as having the captain of the Exxon Valdez endorse Bounty
paper towels, but the commercial's creators said bizarre was very
much the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds strange if you're not here in the market,''
said Johan Almquist, chief executive of TBWA Stockholm, who came up
with the concept of using Leeson as an endorser. ``We always do odd
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Leeson, 32, is infamous for racking up a staggering $1.4 billion
in losses while wildly trading futures at Barings' Singapore
office, sinking the bank, which was later sold for 1 pound to ING
Group of the Netherlands. After four years in jail in Singapore,
Leeson returned to London last summer just after his story was
released as a film called ``Rogue Trader,'' based on his memoir,
which was published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   When Almquist began brainstorming advertising ideas for his
client, Matteus.com, the online trading company, he wanted to
differentiate the site from rivals that were setting up shop in
Sweden, including ETrade of the United States. Because Matteus also
serves as a traditional brokerage house providing financial
planning and stock advice, TBWA crafted a campaign that points out
the risky side of gambling in the stock market on the Internet and
portrays Matteus as the best alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought to ourselves, `Who could warn people that this is a
dangerous game?''' Almquist said. ``It occurred to us that Nick was
the best example.'' Getting Matteus' executives to go along with
using Leeson as an endorser was the easy part _ ``They laughed a
lot and said, `Of course,''' Almquist said _ but getting Leeson to
agree to appear was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Because Leeson still owes 100 million pounds, or $159 million,
to Barings' liquidators, all appearance fees have to be negotiated
by an army of lawyers. All fees are divided in half _ 50 percent
going to Barings and 50 percent going to Leeson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick gets offers all the time for endorsements,'' said Ian
Monk, Leeson's agent, who also represents Barings' liquidators.
``We wanted to do something socially responsible. He's the world's
best example of how things can go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   To TBWA's surprise, Leeson agreed to do the ad. ``We thought
there was an outside chance,'' Almquist said. Both TBWA _ part of
the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group _ and Monk refused to
divulge how much Leeson was paid for his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which is in English with Swedish subtitles, begins with
clips of news footage from when Barings collapsed and Leeson was
arrested. The commercial then cuts to a somber _ if not deadpan _
Leeson against a white backdrop staring at the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me four years and 2000 prison meals ago,'' he says in a
way reminiscent of a public service announcement. ``Barings went
bankrupt. I lost my life. It's a very risky business. You can make
a lot of money fast, but we all make mistakes. It's easier than you
think to lose everything overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The television commercial, which just finished its initial
three-week run, is scheduled to be repeated this spring and summer.
A separate print ad that included a picture of Leeson and his saga
ran in large Swedish daily newspapers and financial magazines and
is also scheduled for a second run. TBWA declined to disclose the
cost of the campaign, which is running only in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Leeson spent three days in Stockholm, Sweden, filming the
advertisement. ``He's a regular guy,'' Almquist said. ``We talked
about football and girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Almquist said the campaign had received a positive response,
``and of course a lot of press.'' He said the audience in Sweden,
which has one of the highest Internet-use rates in the world,
appreciated the commercial for its message, not simply as a gag.
</P>
<P>
   As for ING Barings' response, a spokesman who couldn't contain
his laughter said, ``No comment.''

REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER SEEKS SPECIAL COUNSEL IN E-MAIL FEUD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee asked the Justice Department on Monday to appoint a
special counsel to investigate whether the White House obstructed
justice by failing to surrender e-mail messages that had been
subpoenaed by Congress and other investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who is a frequent critic
of Attorney General Janet Reno's, said that Reno and her deputies
faced a conflict of interest in pursuing the inquiry because of
what he described as their longstanding unwillingness to
investigate allegations of wrongdoing at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you and your staff are in charge, the proposed
investigation is fatally flawed,'' Burton said Monday in a letter
to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing consensus that you were, and are, unable to
supervise investigations involving the president, the vice
president and your political party,'' he said. ``For that reason, I
call on you to appoint a special counsel to investigate the
obstruction of justice charges against the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's chief spokesman, Myron Marlin, said in an
interview that Burton's letter was under review to see if ``yet
another outside investigator is truly necessary.'' He noted that
Robert Ray, the independent counsel in the investigation of the
Whitewater case and other issues, was also studying the handling of
the e-mail matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department announced last week that it had begun a
criminal investigation into whether White House officials illegally
suppressed e-mail messages that had been subpoenaed in
investigations of Clinton administration fund-raising and other
activities.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the department said it was also looking into
accusations that White House officials had threatened employees of
a private contractor, warning them not to discuss that the messages
were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry by the campaign finance unit at the Justice
Department started after Republicans accused the White House of
concealing private electronic communications that had been sought
by investigators in Congress, the Justice Department and Ray's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr, was appointed under terms of
an independent counsel law that expired last year. Aides to Burton
said that he wanted a so-called special counsel appointed under
regulations put in place last year that allow the attorney general
to seek an independent investigator when the department faces a
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker's letter said that ``the individual chosen should
be completely independent, should have no current ties to the
Justice Department and should be seen by the American people to be
fair and impartial.''

EDITORIAL: HARASSMENT OF GAYS IN THE MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, March 28:
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Pentagon's inspector general should bring a dose
of reality to any military leaders who still refuse to believe that
anti-gay bias is a pervasive problem. Of the more than 71,000
officers and enlisted personnel surveyed, the overwhelming majority
said that anti-gay attitudes were common and to some extent even
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered the survey last December
after an Army private was convicted of murdering a gay soldier with
a baseball bat. The survey was conducted at 38 bases and on 11
ships and submarines.
</P>
<P>
   An alarming 37 percent of those responding reported that they
had witnessed or experienced harassment based on sexual orientation
in the past year. The harassment included such incidents as
vandalism, threats, unfair discipline, discrimination in career
opportunities and even physical assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a
legal aid group, also issued an annual report asserting that
incidents of verbal abuse and physical assaults against gay and
lesbian service members had more than doubled last year from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   These bleak results show that commanders are not doing enough to
root out abuse. Cohen is appointing a committee of senior military
and civilian leaders to review the survey results and draft a
corrective plan. Commanders need to make punishing harassers a
priority, and they must be held accountable for violations of the
Clinton administration's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, that policy needs to change. Banning gays from
serving openly only creates a hostile atmosphere. For years,
military leaders have argued that the presence of openly gay
service members would threaten unit cohesion and morale. But as
Cohen noted, it is harassment that now seriously undermines good
order and discipline.

BANK ONE CORP. NAMES DIMON CHAIRMAN AND CEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to change Bank to Banc in Banc of America Securities.)  
(mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bank One Corp., rocked by a series of management blunders and
earnings shortfalls following one of the biggest mergers in banking
history, on Monday named James Dimon as its chairman and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon, 44, one of the most well-regarded executives on Wall
Street, is himself a casualty of the recent merger boom in banking.
He was forced out of the presidency of financial-services giant
Citigroup in 1998 after an acrimonious and highly publicized
falling out with that company's co-chief executive, Sanford I.
Weill.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon faces an enormous challenge in turning around Bank One,
which is based in Chicago and has seen its profitability shredded
by, among other things, serious problems at its enormous credit
card operation, First USA. Bank One, which has $269.4 billion in
assets and is the fourth-largest bank in the country, has been the
subject of rampant takeover speculation ever since it began
announcing earnings shortfalls last August.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon said in a conference call Monday that the bank was not for
sale and that the company's board shared his desire to keep Bank
One independent. Dimon said the board had not given him a deadline
for restoring Bank One's profitability and reviving employee
morale.
</P>
<P>
   While Dimon, who goes by the nickname Jamie, is considered
extremely capable, his experience has largely been limited to the
corridors of Wall Street investment banks, not the hallways of Main
Street retail banks like Bank One.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie's young, he's inspiring, he's charismatic, and he's got
proven leadership abilities,'' said David Berry, a banking analyst
with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``On the other hand, he's never run a
bank before _ he's a brokerage guy and I would have thought he
would have stayed on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Dimon, however, took issue with that viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that we had a big retail brokerage
operation,'' said Dimon, referring to his tenure overseeing
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney investment banking unit. ``I think
that's fundamentally inaccurate because I understand retail
financial services.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of Dimon's new job leaked out before the close of stock
market trading Monday, and Bank One's share price rose smartly on
an otherwise lackluster day for bank stocks. In trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, the shares rose $2.75, to $31.125, on
extremely heavy volume. Just last May, Bank One's shares were
trading at a 52-week high of $63.5625.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon, who is moving his family to Chicago from New York, said
he plans to spend $2 million of his own money snapping up Bank One
shares. He declined to say how much Bank One was paying him to come
aboard, but his days on Wall Street and as Weill's right-hand man
had already left him a very wealthy man. His departure from
Citigroup alone netted him a severance package valued at about $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the musical-chairs-like quality of Monday's
announcement, Verne G. Istock, who has been Bank One's acting chief
executive since December, will leave that post but remain as
president. Istock replaced the bank's former chief executive, John
B. McCoy, who was forced to resign by the board because of the
managerial snafus and financial mishaps at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One was created by the 1998 merger of McCoy's bank, Bank
One of Columbus, Ohio, and Istock's bank, First Chicago NBD. At the
time of the merger, it was heralded as yet another example of the
advantages of size and consolidation in the banking industry. Yet
Bank One's problems have shown that size, untethered to realistic
business strategies or sound management, can quickly overwhelm
corporate managers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other banks, including First Union and Bank of America, have
been plagued with post-merger problems, while still others, like
Wells Fargo and Citigroup, have fared relatively well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue here is how do you run a big regional bank?'' said
Keefe Bruyette's Berry. ``Some have done it well in recent years
and some have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said, however, that Dimon had a good chance of
reversing Bank One's downward spiral. His biggest challenge will be
reviving the credit card operation _ the second-largest in the
country after Citigroup _ which in good times contributed as much
as a third of Bank One's total profits. Bank One also recently put
its online banking operation, Wingspan, up for sale in yet another
blow to the bank's credibility. Bankers with direct knowledge of
Wingspan's financial statements said that Bank One lost about $150
million in pretax dollars on the venture last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that I don't think the problems at Bank
One are intractable, despite how badly things have gone at First
USA,'' said Diane Glossman, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. ``I
don't think it's something that a dynamic, creative executive can't
address.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank One began searching for a new chief executive in
mid-January. It initially contacted 32 candidates for the job,
winnowing that list down to 10 executives who were interviewed. Of
that group, five executives were interviewed in depth. By late last
week, the survivors of the search were Dimon and Lewis W. Coleman,
the chairman of Bank of America's investment banking arm, Banc of
America Securities. Coleman was unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When Citicorp and Travelers Group merged in 1998 to form
Citigroup, Dimon was widely considered to be the person most likely
to run what is now the largest financial services concern in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Dimon had spent years assisting Weill as he built Travelers from
the ground up into a major player in the insurance industry and on
Wall Street. The two men were very close, and many around them
considered them to be almost like a father and a son.
</P>
<P>
   But, following the departure of Weill's daughter from Travelers,
and in other twists worthy of Shakespeare, Weill eventually
maneuvered to have Dimon forced out of Citigroup just a few months
after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been periodic speculation about Dimon's
next move, speculation that ended Monday. Dimon joked freely Monday
about his ouster from Citigroup, saying he hoped it was the last
time in his career he would lose his job that way.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Citigroup has been pegged as one of the companies
that might attempt to buy Bank One some day _ a deal that, if it
were to occur, would return Dimon to his former employer.

GUIDEBOOKS FOR A WILD NATION 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some important guidebooks are shelved not in the travel section
but over in the nature section of the bookstore, keeping company
with ``Silent Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   These books enable us to say, ``Ah, bluebonnets!'' to the
wildflower that briefly rolls blue waves across Texas, and explain
to children why the mangrove is the way it is. Our family's packing
lists include books about the natural phenomena of an area, along
with walking maps and museum guides, because discussing things by
name is more satisfying and takes us deeper into a place. And not
incidentally, because ``What's that?'' is a classic stumper from
kids.
</P>
<P>
   The point was underlined last month by a Nature Conservancy
report that the biodiversity of the United States was greater than
expected: It was found to be home to 200,000 native species, double
the previous estimates, although 7 percent of the species were
found to be critically imperiled. The United States ranked first,
for example, in freshwater mussels, with 292 types, and sixth in
types of mammals, with 416. In some more ordinary categories, the
United States also has an important place, for instance in
needle-leafed evergreens, or gymnosperms _ pines included _ of
which there are 114 varieties, giving the country second place in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   For helping put names to what we see, there are several major
book series and one just making a debut.
</P>
<P>
   The Peterson Field Guides, which many of us grew up with, are
prospering with more than 50 titles. The National Audubon Society
Field Guides have been standards for 20 years and appear in both
regional and subject-oriented volumes. The National Geographic, in
addition to its titles like ``National Parks'' and ``State Parks,''
is just publishing the first volumes in a new series, ``Guide to
America's Outdoors.'' The Smithsonian Guides to Natural America, a
series that appeared five years ago, is, alas, being phased out.
</P>
<P>
   Although paperbacks, all of these share a drawback: They are
heavy. This is probably inevitable, considering color pictures are
printed on coated paper. Peterson First Guides ($5.95), for
beginners, are compact and lighter, but rudimentary.
</P>
<P>
   Mysteries to Solve
</P>
<P>
   Trees and wildflowers, birds and animals, the contours of the
soil, marshes, deserts, intertidal spaces, local weather systems
and the altered view of the night sky _ these are part of what I
want to find out about when traveling. After watching armadillos _
could that be? _ scuttling around Cumberland Island, Ga., my family
pulled out books. The Southeast volume of the Smithsonian Guides
says these ``recent interlopers arrived mysteriously.''
</P>
<P>
   I recalled decades before having to swear to the Porter family
upon renting a place on Great Spruce Head Island in Maine, which
they owned, that our son's pet hamster was not only not pregnant,
but was certified a male, before we were allowed to take the cage
ashore. I thought it preposterous, but looking at those sneaky
armadillos, I can see why islanders get anxious.
</P>
<P>
   After a stroll around a couple of stores in Manhattan
specializing in travel books, both filled with what seemed to be
virtually indistinguishable series concentrating primarily on
cities and the works of human hands in the world, I went to a
Barnes &AMP; Noble, on Fifth Avenue near Rockefeller Center. Nature
books were downstairs, 20 yard-long shelves of them, covering ants,
bears, palms and special topics like ``Mushrooms of North America''
and ``The Essential Cockatiel.'' I paused at an old friend,
``Beautiful Swimmers: Watermen, Crabs and the Chesapeake Bay'' by
William W. Warner (1977, Little, Brown), an essential for embarking
on the bay. It, and Henry Beston's 70-year-old ``Outermost House''
(Henry Holt), about Cape Cod, are gems of nature writing that are
ever young.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Regional Field Guides, a series of eight covering
the United States, with California and Florida each getting their
own, have been coming out since 1998. These pocket-sized volumes
published by Knopf have plastic-coated covers with wide flaps to
mark pages; they cost $19.95 each. They have the densely packed
material one needs: Three pages of photos of pines in the Florida
guide clearly show the differences. After an overview, the bulk of
the books deals with flora and fauna of an area _ about 1,000 items
in each book _ but parks and preserves are also mapped and
described.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions deal with anomalies. The California fan palm is
described as the only palm native to the southwest United States.
Adjoining is a description and photo of a date palm, 20-foot leaves
akimbo. ``Habitat,'' says Audubon wryly: ``gardens, other
cultivated sites.'' This is a sanity-saver for visitors to Indio,
Calif., where the date palms wave and the proprietors advertise
their dates in grandiose terms.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   By Its Cover
</P>
<P>
   The topical Audubon Field Guides, with imitation leather covers,
deal with specific subjects like the weather and the night sky, or
fishes. They originally came out 20 years ago and are constantly
being reissued. Susan D. Ralston of Knopf books, who oversees the
series, says that the Leatherette covers are not likely to be
abandoned because owners know, even when the printed half-jacket is
gone, that the red back is ``Eastern Birds.'' These books cost $19
each.
</P>
<P>
   After these did well, Ralston said, the company moved to guides
to like ``Wetlands of the United States'' before deciding that
people did not travel that way, but drove around a region at a
time. The regional guides were an outgrowth.
</P>
<P>
   The first two of National Geographic's new outdoor guides, the
Northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest, are due next month. The
cover describes the series as ``nature adventures in parks,
preserves, forests, wildlife refuges, wilderness areas.''
</P>
<P>
   An advance look showed glorious photographs of the sort long
associated with the magazine, but with the familiar yellow border
reduced to a yellow emblem at the top of each cover. Maps, hiking
directions, phone numbers and Web sites are all packed in, as well
as short articles on features like the ponderosa pine, or Lewis'
return route. These books, at 288 pages, are thick but narrow
enough (4\ by 8{ inches) for pockets. They are $24 each.
</P>
<P>
   The Peterson Guides, published by Houghton Mifflin, follow Roger
Tory Peterson's 1934 identification method: If you are holding a
yellow flower, you open to the pictures of yellow flowers and keep
looking until you find a match. ``Southeastern and Caribbean
Seashores'' says it seeks to be a ``beachwalker's companion,'' not
an exhaustive study. The author, Eugene H. Kaplan, is a happy
companion. On the subject of propagation of horseshoe crabs, he
writes: ``Wait for a day when the water reaches 70 degrees for the
first time in the spring to view the fantastic spectacle of this
mass-mating ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 50 of these titles in print, $20 to $24
each, starting with the original, ``Birds (Eastern).'' If the bird
is blue, you know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Such books can also do what cultural guides do: make you want to
go look. In the National Geographic ``Wildlife Watching,'' there is
an entry on Cheyenne Bottoms Preserve in central Kansas, which I
had never heard of. It has been designated a ``wetland of
international importance'' in a treaty signed by 92 countries,
including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admittedly, the Bottoms does not comprise a majestic
landscape,'' writes Glen Martin, the author. ``Essentially it is a
mudflats hemmed in by agricultural fields.'' But it has been a
critical staging area for migratory shorebirds and waterfowl for
``at least 100,000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey found it to be the top shorebird springtime migration
area in the lower 48 states. And what is among the regular
visitors? A giant whooping crane or two, which was not so long ago
believed to be virtually extinct. The place, administered by the
state and the Nature Conservancy, is 128 miles northwest by road
from Wichita. Best time to go: March through May.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian Guides to Natural America, published by Random
House, began to appear in 1996. There are 15, divided by region,
costing $19.95 each. These are bigger, better for the shelf than
the pocket. The sad news is that the Smithsonian says the division
that was responsible for these books has closed, and when the
current supply is exhausted, the series will not be reprinted.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures in these books are large and beautiful, some of them
paintings by artists like Winslow Homer and Audubon himself. The
narrative prose is not interrupted with descriptions of how to get
into the sanctuary, but asterisks lead to entries in the back with
phone numbers and types of facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Maps are important in all these series. The National
Geographic's new outdoors guides have contour maps, and when I
looked at one of Grinnell Glacier Trail in Montana, my legs
remembered a too-late cold return to Many Glacier Hotel one
September evening when a friend had overestimated her capacities.
But then I began reading.
</P>
<P>
   Of Grinnell Lake, it said: ``The water gets its turquoise color
from rock powder milled by upstream glaciers. The powder, sometimes
called glacial flour, remains in suspension and refracts blue light
into this lovely shade of bluish green.'' The exhaustion and worry
were worth it, and the book recaptured the sights for me.

SHAKESPEARE AS KARAOKE, WITH CRUMHORNS ON THE SOUNDTRACK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 2) 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than 400 years, one of London's main lures has been the
theater. And one of the hottest attractions this season is
Shakespeare's Globe, the reconstructed playhouse on the South Bank
of the Thames where many of his greatest works were first
performed.
</P>
<P>
   A $12 adult ticket buys a group tour of the playhouse, a brief
history of the theater from a guide (who got only a couple of
things wrong) and entrance to the new Globe museum, which is where
the real fun begins.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe exhibitions mix computer technology and old-fashioned
display cases to provide something for everybody _ swordfighting
demonstrations (Elizabethans carried swords the way American
cowboys packed pistols); a costume exhibit (I never knew what
torture Elizabethan women endured just to get dressed in the
morning), and a music presentation (why doesn't anyone write
sonatas for cittern and shawm any more?)
</P>
<P>
   I hit the interactive exhibits like a kid in a video arcade.
There is a 10-question multiple-choice quiz on Shakespeare's First
Folio, the version actors use today. If you give a wrong answer,
you can try again. I aced eight answers on the first try, got
another one on the second and completely missed the tenth. (Well,
does anyone know how much a collection of plays cost in 1623?)
</P>
<P>
   I also tried the one where you can publish your own version of
Shakespeare, or at least the first 10 lines of Hamlet's ``To be or
not to be'' soliloquy. Choosing from half a dozen options, I opted
for the text from the 1603 quarto (a bootleg edition) with
Shakespeare's spelling and punctuation. It read:
</P>
<P>
   To be, or not to be, I there's the point,
</P>
<P>
   To Die, to sleepe, is that all? I all:
</P>
<P>
   No, to sleepe, to dreame, I mary there it goes.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem to me that one would play, let alone sell, so I
went back to the First Folio.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's plays also had music, of course, and that exhibit
features a case filled with Elizabethan instruments _ from
crumhorns (tenor and alto) to sackbuts _ and a terminal that allows
one to call up a brief history of each and then hear it played.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite exhibit consists of four booths where one can hear
great actors performing familiar Shake-spearean speeches: Ellen
Terry reading Portia's ``Quality of mercy'' soliloquy from ``The
Merchant of Venice'' (admittedly sounding a bit like chalk on a
blackboard); Edwin Booth reading from ``Othello'' and Henry Irving
declaiming ``Now is the winter of our discontent'' from ``Richard
III.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gielgud does ``Howl, howl, howl, howl!'' from ``King Lear''
and reads three sonnets, and in another booth different actors
interpret the same monologues from Hamlet. There are eight ``To be
or not to be's,'' ranging from Herbert Beerbohm to Richard Burton,
and four renditions of ``O, what a rogue,'' including Peter
O'Toole's. There is also the graveyard scene with Laurence Olivier
as Hamlet and Stanley Holloway playing the gravedigger.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the pros, I was ready for the main attraction, a
sort of Shakespeare karaoke in which you choose a scene from one of
eight plays to act in. The monitor scrolls through your lines, then
you are allowed a practice run-through. When you're ready for your
take, you punch a button and a voice gives you your cue. You
deliver your line, punch the button again, and your invisible
co-star responds. At the end you hear a playback of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   I went through most of the computer's repertory. I did the
gravedigger's scene from ``Hamlet'' (after my ``Alas, poor
Yorick,'' they'll forget Olivier); ``The King is dead'' from
``Macbeth,'' and the Soothsayer's ``Beware the Ides of March''
warning from ``Julius Caesar.'' Then I persuaded my wife, LuAnn, to
do the balcony scene with me from ``Romeo and Juliet.'' I was
pretty good; she needed work. I suggested that when we return she
should first brush up her Shakespeare. She suggested I volunteer
for the swordfighting demonstration. A hit, a palpable hit.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare's Globe is at 21 New Globe Walk, Bankside, (44-20)
7902 1500 for the exhibit, (44-20)7401 9919 for the theater,
www.shakespeares-globe.org. The theater is open for guided tours
from 9 a.m. to noon during the May to September performance season;
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily the rest of the year. The exhibit is open
daily 9 a.m. to noon and 1:30 to 4 p.m. during the season; 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m. the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is $12 for adults for the tour and exhibit combined;
the price for the exhibit only (when the tour is not available) had
not been set in late March. Groups of 15 or more can prebook, but
it's first-come, first-serve for smaller parties.

CITY BACKS AWAY FROM GUN-LOCK GIVEAWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLEVUE, Wash. _ City leaders Monday backed out of a national
program that offers residents free gun locks through police
departments.
</P>
<P>
   Project HomeSafe, sponsored by the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, had offered to donate up to 1,500 cable-style gun locks
valued at $15,000 over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   To date, 31 cities, including Las Vegas, Pittsburg and Orlando,
Fla., have accepted a total of 50,000 gun locks from the
foundation's program. Another 106 cities, including Houston and
Miami, have scheduled giveaways this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The program is funded by gun dealers who are members of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But after visiting the foundation's Web site and consulting with
Interim City Manager Linda Barton and Mayor Chuck Mosher, Bellevue
Police Chief Jim Montgomery decided not to participate in the
program two days before it was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the idea of giving away gun locks, and we'd do it if
we had the money ourselves to fund it, absolutely, especially, when
it comes to children,'' said police spokeswoman Marcia Harnden.
``But at this time, the chief felt that until they were a little
better known to us, we couldn't be sure of their agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's political bent has spooked several other cities
approached to participate in Project HomeSafe. Seattle and King
County are among those who declined to accept the gun locks.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is a firearms trade organization that shares
members with the National Rifle Association. It also is a defendant
in civil lawsuits some cities have filed against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery planned to announce Bellevue's participation in the
giveaway program along with eight other Puget Sound cities at a
news conference Thursday. But a visit to the NSSF home page cooled
his interest.
</P>
<P>
   In news releases on the web site dated March 18, NSSF President
Robert Delfay blasts Smith &AMP; Wesson's recent decision to put safety
locks on its handguns, add smart-gun technology to new firearms to
prevent unauthorized use, and discontinue sales at gun shows where
background checks of buyers aren't done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ill-conceived action on the part of one of the most
revered names in the American firearms industry,'' Delfay states in
one of the releases.
</P>
<P>
   Said Harnden: ``We don't want the public to think we don't care
about gun safety but it's about this group's reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Police departments in eight other area cities _ Bothell, Des
Moines, Issaquah, Mercer Island, Kirkland, Tukwila, Sammamish and
Duvall _ plan to distribute the devices.
</P>
<P>
   Tukwila Police Chief Keith Haines had never heard of the NSSF
until last week when the Bean Agency, a Seattle public relations
firm, contacted one of his officers about Project HomeSafe.
</P>
<P>
   For Haines, the chance to save young lives overcame any
reservations he had about the Newtown, Conn.-based foundation, he
said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing it to encourage firearm safety in our community
and they are offering free cable gun locks that can work on
semiautomatic pistols, bolt-action rifles and revolvers. And
they're also offering safety tips,'' Haines said. ``If it keeps
even one child safe ... then it will all have been worthwhile, at
least in my view.''
</P>
<P>
   The King County Sheriff's Office hasn't signed on to distribute
the gun locks because the King County Council has to approve a
waiver before the sheriff's department can accept free merchandise,
said spokesman John Urquhart.
</P>
<P>
   Politics played no role in Seattle's decision, but Mayor Paul
Schell's spokesman, Dick Lilly, said credibility did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some inquiries about the public relations agency and
discovered that some of the cities that they said were involved
with Project Homesafe were not,'' Lilly said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the city worried that the NSSF, best known as a
sponsor of shooting competitions and the Olympic target-shooting
team, was a defendant in civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers.
That fact convinced the mayor of St. Louis to reject the free
locks.
</P>
<P>
   And Seattle city attorneys were concerned that the gun locks,
which consist of a vinyl-covered loop of steel cable and an
inch-wide key padlock, wouldn't be compatible with some weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that they would not work for some types of guns and we
were in danger of liability if they didn't work,'' Lilly said.
</P>
<P>
   When properly installed into the ejection port and magazine well
of an unloaded semiautomatic pistol or the barrel of a revolver,
the locks prevent closing the firearm's action.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Bean, whose public relations firm is coordinating the
project, admits the safety locks aren't a panacea for gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, wire cutters will snip it just like you can take a
hammer and knock a trigger lock off. But this is going to slow
someone down. ... It will deter a child,'' Bean said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a critical safety program because it reaches out
to a new audience among gun owners _ people who have purchased
firearms but haven't gotten gun-safety education,'' said Doug
Painter, executive director of the NSSF.

REFINERY BLAST KILLS WORKER, INJURES AT LEAST 52 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH RENDON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An explosion and fire ripped through a section of the
Phillips 66 plant in nearby Pasadena on Monday, killing one worker,
injuring at least 52 others and shutting the chemical facility
down.
</P>
<P>
   At least three of the injured were listed in critical condition
at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston and six were listed in
serious condition. Officials there and at other hospitals that
received victims said the injuries included burns, cuts from flying
fragments of debris and injuries from falls.
</P>
<P>
   Huge flames erupted after the 1:22 p.m. CST blast, sending a
massive column of black smoke upward and spurring area school
officials to seal their buildings and keep children inside as a
precaution against the possibility of toxic airborne fumes. The
fire finally was extinguished shortly before 5 p.m. and Phillips
officials said their monitors found no sign that anyone outside the
plant was exposed to toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The worker who was killed was recovered Monday night. His name
was not released.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the explosion _ the fourth at the plant in the past
12 months _ had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's being looked into at this time,'' said Kevin Collins, a
plant manager who was in charge of emergency response Monday. ``Our
efforts right now are focused on making the remainder of the plant
safe and ensuring the other employees and other operating units are
in a safe condition.''
</P>
<P>
   He said all other plants in the Phillips complex are believed to
be in safe condition, but were shut down as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``No equipment will be restarted until we know it's safe,''
Collins said, adding that he has no idea why the facility has had
so many serious accidents in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The K-resin section is where an explosion killed two workers and
injured four others in June 1999, but Phillips officials said
Monday they did not know whether both explosions involved the same
reactor. That section contains four reactors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very closely monitoring this event from a remote
location,'' said Ray Skinner of the U.S. Occupational Safety and
Health Administration. ``As soon as it's safe to enter, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips complex also had explosions in April 1999, when a
rail car containing polypropylene blew up, and in August, when
there was an explosion in the polypropylene section of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The complex also was the site of a devastating explosion in
October 1989, when 23 workers were killed and about 130 were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Roberts, an employee of subcontractor H.B. Zachry, said she
was working in a warehouse at the plant Monday and saw a fireball
that was at least one city block wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if we should go or what,'' she said. ``When I
saw my boss running, I ran.''
</P>
<P>
   About 850 Phillips employees and about 100 subcontractors work
at the complex. Officials said about 600 workers were on duty at
the time of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Of those injured, 27 are Phillips employees and 25 are contract
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the main shop talking to a guy and all of a sudden,
there was a loud boom,'' said Tim Williams, a Phillips employee.
``It hurt my ears. There was stuff in the air, and we just took off
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarms sounded in the plant, but the city of Pasadena's siren
system didn't alert residents until about 1:45 p.m. said Mayor
Johnny Isbell. He said the system had been undergoing repairs
because the sirens recently had been sounding when they were not
supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   The all-clear for the schools and area homes was sounded about
3:25 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena, a petrochemical city of about 134,000 people, is about
10 miles east of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Simpson, environmental director for the plant, said
styrene, butadiene and cyclohexane were being burned in the fire.
She said the chemicals could irritate the eyes, nose and throat if
inhaled in high concentrations, but air monitors indicated that the
chemicals were consumed by the fire.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA investigators planned to return to the Phillips plant early
Tuesday to begin searching for the cause of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what has happened in this case,'' said Phillips
spokesman Norm Berkley. ``The only similarity (to the fatal 1989
explosion) is that we had a tragic, tragic day. We've had an
explosion. We've had a fire. We've got injured employees. I
couldn't feel worse about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked tremendously hard to make sure that a situation
like that never, ever occurred again. Obviously, it has.''
</P>
<P>
   The K-resin made at the plant is a chemical used to make an
array of products including clear packaging materials such as
shrink wrap, bread wrappers, bottles for drinking water, clear
boxes and trays, cups, lids, toys, shower doors, and high-quality
coat hangers.
</P>
<P>
   With a capacity of 370 million pounds per year, Phillips is the
nation's major manufacturer of what is basically a toughening
additive, according to Pat Duke of DeWitt &AMP; Co., a consulting firm
here.
</P>
<P>
   K-resin, which is a styrene-butadiene copolymer, was developed
by Phillips in 1967 and is made by the company only at the Pasadena
chemical complex.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion's effect on prices has yet to be determined. The
company does have inventories of K-resin and has part ownership of
a plant in Asia that makes the resin, said a spokesman at Phillips
headquarters in Bartlesville, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips should be able to import the resin out of South Korea,
said Duke.

DISTRICT SAYS RE TIREES MUST WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JIM GINTONIO  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Glendale, Ariz.) - A Glendale school district has told more
than 80 retired teachers and staff members that they must return to
work for up to 70 days a year _ without pay _ or lose their medical
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The employees, some in poor health, signed early retirement
packages with Glendale Elementary as long as 11 years ago. They
OK'd the deals with the understanding that they would receive
insurance until they reached 65.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Perry Hill says the issue popped up as he and
district lawyers were creating a separate early retirement plan
that requires 20 days of work annually in order to retain health
insurance. That's when Hill realized that no work was being
required of the 82 people who had signed papers since 1989. Letters
were then sent out to the group, saying they'd have to report back
in the 2000-01 school year.
</P>
<P>
   That might be difficult for some, like Alberta McCartney, 60,
who worked in the district's accounting office. She has had a liver
transplant, and the anti-rejection medication she takes has caused
partial kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Retiree Truman Brewster, 56, is a diabetic, and the sores on his
feet have at times confined him to a wheelchair. He is using a
walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you teach junior high school, you don't spend a lot of
time sitting down,`' said Brewster, who taught math and science at
Landmark Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   If retirees refuse to return, it could cost them as much as $700
a month for insurance premiums. &QL; 
NEW INTERPRETATION
</P>
<P>
   District lawyers cited attorneys general opinions, some of which
were issued almost two decades ago, that it is illegal to pay
benefits to school personnel who are not working. Some of these
same opinions were read by teachers, who claim no such language
speaks directly to their situation.
</P>
<P>
   The subject apparently has not been revisited in years.
</P>
<P>
   Work requirements and compensation vary widely throughout the
state. Some districts pay the retirees for working in addition to
providing the benefits. Glendale Union High School District, for
example, requires no work, and neither does Peoria Unified. The
Phoenix Union High School and Alhambra districts say teachers must
work one day, but they are paid, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Former teacher Nancy Haley told Hill at a recent meeting that
the retirement packages are not gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a benefit we earned,'' she said. ``So many of us had
faith that if we took the early retirement the benefits would be
there. We had faith in you, and you let us down.'' &QL; 
A BROKEN PROMISE
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Signorille, an attorney for the American Association
of Retired Persons, said when someone leaves a job under certain
retirement rules and there is a change, it constitutes a broken
promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad enough when there's a change when people are still
working, but it's another thing to change after retirement,'' she
said. ``When you take retirement, it's with the expectations that
the benefits are going to be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it's not fair. It's changing the rules in the middle
of the game. Unfortunately, from a legal perspective, participants
have not been very successful in arguing that to a court.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she is unaware of any other public sector situation
similar to the one in Glendale. In the private sector, however, she
said it has happened many times over. The courts have said that
employers do have the right to change the rules unless the
complainants can show that they were promised a lifetime benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In general, employees have reason to worry no matter what their
profession, according to Earline Foster, human resources staff
consultant in the employee/labor relations division of SRP.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to be more and more that many employers do not
offer medical regardless of the age when you retire,'' she said.
``There have been many changes and cost conservation as far as that
benefit goes.'' &QL; 
A CHANGE IN STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Hill emphasized that this change is by no means a strategy to
streamline the budget, and a spokeswoman in his office said it had
nothing to do with rumors of an impending teacher shortage in the
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question came out when studying this with our attorney:
Why do the present people (on the new plan) have to work and the
present retirees do not,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he was advised that giving a benefit that does not
require work is a gift of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do that,'' he said. ``To receive benefits, you have
to work. We're not doing this based on what other districts do,
that's their responsibility. The issue is we have to be legal. . .
. When you find out you're doing something that's not legal, you
have to stop the practice right then.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kieffer, Glendale Union superintendent, said he has never
entertained notions of making early retirees work again. When
people retire, he said, they retire. &QL; 
CLASS-ACTION SUIT
</P>
<P>
   The retirees are thinking about filing a class-action lawsuit.
Their union, the Glendale Education Association, has said it would
assist the retirees in any way it could, including letter-writing
and picketing. The group has met with the Arizona Education
Association, and another session is planned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the AEA say they are monitoring the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would argue that (the health benefit) was part of their
compensation package,'' said Raquel Altreche, an organization
consultant. ``There is nothing in the law that says you have to
work dollar for dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Altreche has compassion for those employees who have to return:
``What about the retirees who have moved out of state? And what
about those who are disabled?''
</P>
<P>
   Glendale Elementary's new plan involves issuing credits, valued
between $115 to $250 per day, based on the type of job performed.
That means someone who either retired at a lower pay rate or
decides to do a task on the lower end of the scale would have to
put in at least 70 days a year. Former administrators, meanwhile,
might have to work as few as 20 days to qualify for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   There are two potential catches here: If workdays are missed,
the credits will be pro-rated, and all who return will face job
evaluations. &QL; 
FLEXIBILITY PROMISED
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the GESD would be flexible, and that each case would
be considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   Even that's not enough for McCartney, whose doctor has
classified her as ``lifetime disabled.`' She said it would not be
fair for her not to work, while others who reached the same
agreement as she did have to return.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said: ``In today's market, it's very difficult to develop a
one-for-all attitude. There are still things we have to resolve,
like disability issues. We're going by the ground rules that people
will need to return.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems may be lurking on that front.
</P>
<P>
   Many retirees have moved out of state, and others are
caregivers. Health issues are paramount for some _ one woman had to
go the hospital after she received her notice in the mail. Then
there's Kathleen Stewart, who is a missionary in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he would listen to concerns, and that he has until
July 1 to work out everyone's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to be careful that we just don't make exceptions
for everything,'' he said. ``It was not the intent of the board to
go to extremes but to obey the law. To us, it is a legal issue, not
a punitive issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it has been reported that at least 34 other
district employees have agreed in recent months to a similar deal,
and they apparently will have to return to work when their
retirements become official. &QL;

SYMINGTON RETRIAL CHOICE IS COMPLEX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JERRY KAMMER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - George Cardona, one of two federal prosecutors who
won the 1997 bank fraud conviction of Fife Symington, is resigning,
complicating the federal government's decision on whether to retry
the former Arizona governor.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona, who is headed to a lecturer's post at UCLA's law
school, sought to minimize his importance to the Symington case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of good prosecutors,'' he said. ``The exhibits
are there, and there is a lot of witness testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cardona's pending departure, which follows last year's
resignation of his partner in the complicated case, comes at a
particularly problematic time for the office.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals last week rejected prosecutors'
request to reconsider a 1999 ruling that threw out Symington's
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona's loss is one of many concerns that the U.S. Attorney's
Office must now weigh as it ponders whether to retry the case, drop
it or seek review in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Some concerns are subtle, involving the age of the case, public
perceptions of the justice system and the prosecutors' appetite for
another courthouse war against a man they already have forced from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Some are technical, involving the strength of the evidence
against Symington, who was charged with lying to lenders on his
real estate projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some concerns are simply pragmatic matters of cost and time.
</P>
<P>
   Symington, vowing Monday not to plea-bargain, said simple
fairness demands termination of a case that cost him the
governorship and cost his family millions in attorneys fees.
</P>
<P>
   Symington resigned immediately after a U.S. District Court jury
found him guilty of six counts of bank and wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that at some point an element of fairness needs
to enter the picture, and I feel it's time to end this,'' Symington
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Dowd, Symington's attorney in the case, said he will take
that message to Los Angeles when he meets with U.S Attorney
Alejandro Mayorkas sometime in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd was often combative and hostile in his exchanges with
Cardona and former prosecutor David Schindler. Now he is extending
an olive branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense Mr. Mayorkas is a very fair man,'' said Dowd, a former
top Justice Department prosecutor who is known for his talent at
high-level schmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola University in Los
Angeles, said three factors of the Symington case suggest to her
that prosecutors will yank him back to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high-profile case, it involves serious crimes, and
the conviction wasn't lost because of problems with the evidence,''
she said. ``It was lost on a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington's conviction was overturned last year when a
three-judge panel ruled that an elderly juror had been improperly
dismissed from the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Trial Judge Roger Strand had cut the juror loose after other
jurors complained that she was confused and unable to participate
in their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the other jurors' statements showed that
there was a possibility that they wanted her off because she was
holding out for acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York
University Law School, said prosecutors have to be concerned about
conclusions that the public may draw from the Symington case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want him to be able to claim that he has been
vindicated for what they believe were serious crimes,'' Gillers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cardona took note Monday of the practical matters that will
enter into the decision on Symington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to trial would take substantial resources,'' he said.
``But the exhibits are there, there's a lot of testimony on the
record, and we know from the first time what the defense would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he leaves, Cardona will help guide decisions on the case.
One question is whether prosecutors at a new trial would present
only the six counts that produced guilty verdicts or try to
reinstate the 11 counts on which the jury deadlocked. &QL;

WITH TENSION GONE, LABONTE CHASES CHAMPIONSHIP FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Terry Labonte hasn't won a NASCAR Winston
Cup points race since a year ago today, but he's handling the bumps
in the road more easily because of a renewed team atmosphere at
Hendrick Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RNow\S all the tension is gone,'' said Labonte, who last won
at Texas Motor Speedway in the No. 5 Kellogg's Chevrolet for team
owner Rick Hendrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just a lot more relaxed now. We definitely were three
separate teams,'' Labonte said. ``I am not going to sit here and
say it was one person, because it was not. It was a combination of
a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   When Robbie Loomis, Jeff Gordon's crew chief, walked into
Labonte's hauler at a recent race looking for Gary DeHart, it
furthered Labonte's point. ``That right there,'' he said, ``is
something you would not have seen.''
</P>
<P>
   DeHart, who began his second stint with Hendrick Motorsports in
December, has seen a different organization than the one he left in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot more cooperation among the teams; that is the
biggest thing,'' DeHart said.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Ray Evernham and Andy Graves, and the return of
Hendrick were among the changes. Evernham moved on to head up
DaimlerChrysler's return to Winston Cup in 2001. Graves, Labonte's
crew chief in 1998 and '99, went to work for Target/Chip Ganassi
racing on the CART circuit.
</P>
<P>
   DeHart returned as the crew chief for Labonte, and they appear
on track to make a run at their success of 1996, when Labonte won
the Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte made a late run in Sunday's Food City 500 at Bristol
Motor Speedway to finish fifth, his best finish this season. He
moved up to ninth in the Winston Cup standings heading into
Sunday's DirecTV 500 at TMS, 10 points ahead of Gordon. Jerry
Nadeau drives the team's third car, the No. 25 Michael Holigan
Homes Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways it seems like \RDeHart\S never left,''
Labonte said. ``He came back and picked right up. I hated that it
did not work out any better for Andy because he is a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   DeHart didn't want to talk about what happened in 1997 when he
left, but added he is happy to be back with longtime friends
Labonte and Hendrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Hendrick Motorsports, I didn't burn any bridges, but there
were a few things I felt that were not right,'' DeHart said. ``I
decided I wanted to pursue my own things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrick Motorsports, once a model for the multicar team, began
to drift apart in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Labonte and Gordon teams seemed to separate that season when
the two were battling for the Winston Cup championship, which
Labonte eventually won.
</P>
<P>
   There was tension between the crew chiefs and the crews.
Meanwhile, Hendrick was fighting for his life after being diagnosed
with leukemia in 1996, and spent 1998 confined to his house after
pleading guilty to mail-fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham, Gordon's former crew chief, allegedly attempted to
control the organization in Hendrick's absence, alienating the
other Hendrick teams.
</P>
<P>
   There was more tension ``than there should have been,'' DeHart
said. ``The bottom line is this: You tear yourself up from within,
and you are not going to let someone tear you up from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   DeHart left Hendrick Motorsports in October 1997 and went to
work for Lyndon Amick in the Busch Grand National Series. He also
did some work for Morgan-McClure racing the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   Since DeHart left, Labonte has not enjoyed the same success he
had in 1996, when he won two races, finished in the top 10 in 24
races and won his second Cup title. He has won only three races
since the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he won at Texas and took The Winston all-star race
in Charlotte, N.C., in 1999, Labonte was disappointed with last
season. He finished 12th in points, his first time out of the
Winston Cup top 10 since he started driving for Hendrick in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have won at Bristol \Rlast year\S, too,'' Labonte
said. ``It was not that bad of a season, but it was disappointing
that I did not finish in the top 10 in points. That is what really
burned me up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel pretty good about this year. We got some real good
race tracks coming up that we're going to run good at.''

SLOAN REJOINS STARS' CHECKING LINE TONIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stars' most-consistent line this season is
intact again. Rookie wing Blake Sloan returns tonight after missing
15 games since he suffered a hairline fracture of his left fibula
on Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   He rejoins Mike Keane and Guy Carbonneau, who wears a playing
cast on his fractured right wrist, on the line usually charged with
shutting down the opponent's top scoring line. Sloan adds speed and
peskiness to a line with two of the strongest positional players in
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Keane, however, expects more than solid defense out of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go out and not only play well in our end, but we
have to help the team and go out and score goals also,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trio has had a productive goal-scoring season, combining for
23 goals. Keane has 11, the most he has scored since 1993-94 when
he had 16 with the Montreal Canadiens, Carbonneau has eight, tying
his highest total in five seasons with the Stars, and Sloan has
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sloan has the legs and the tenacity to create pressure on a
deep forecheck, so he can get a lot pucks in areas where Keane and
Carbo can get them turned over, and then we can attack back to
them,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I think that's why that line is
so effective.'' &QL; 
Morrow pleased
</P>
<P>
   Rookie left wing Brenden Morrow expected to play this season for
the Stars' minor-league affiliate, the Michigan K-Wings. Instead,
injuries forced his promotion, and, as they say, the rest is
history.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow's 14 goals are the most by a Stars rookie since the team
moved to Texas before the 1993-94 season. With three game-winning
goals, he is tied for second among NHL rookies. He has played the
majority of the season alongside All-Star center Mike Modano on the
No. 1 line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing I expected for my first year,'' Morrow said. ``I
thought I would be playing three or four minutes a game and five
goals would be a good season. It's been unbelievable. Every day,
playing with great players, it's just a lot of fun.'' &QL; 
Lehtinen exam delayed
</P>
<P>
   Stars left wing Jere Lehtinen will have his ankle evaluated
tomorrow instead of today as previously scheduled. Lehtinen
underwent surgery after re-injuring the ankle Jan. 19, eight games
into his original comeback. If doctors deem his ankle fit, he could
be in the lineup Sunday in Colorado. \Nsubheds:Forward thinking
With Blake Sloan returning tonight, Scott Thornton coming back
tomorrow from his three-game suspension, and Jere Lehtinen a
possibility soon, a logjam of forwards deserve playing time.
Hitchcock said he won't hesitate to go with who's hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always found you need to have 15 forwards ready to
play,'' he said, ``but I think right now some of the younger
players have played better than some of the older players and I
think we wouldn't hesitate to start that way.'' &QL; 
Two's the goal
</P>
<P>
   Ed Belfour is expected to be in goal tonight. Coach Ken
Hitchcock had said he wanted Manny Fernandez to play in two of the
remaining seven regular-season games, but the coach has not said
when Fernandez will play.

ELSTER GOES FROM POOL TO PLAYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The lake, a five-minute drive from Kevin
Elster's house in suburban Las Vegas, is gorgeous. But he never
went; sitting by the pool was relaxing enough.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Elster spent last summer, that and making plans to
build a bar near the Las Vegas strip. The conceptual drawings were
complete and it probably would be opening soon.
</P>
<P>
   And then things changed slightly: Elster the entrepreneur has
reverted to Elster the ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   No more sleeping all morning, heading to the gym in the
afternoon and then coming home to do nothing. Elster is back in the
major leagues and working as hard as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Elster, 35, is a year removed from the game and 14 years removed
from a World Series title with the Mets. The cynics say his range
was only adequate and his offense lacking when he was 21, which
makes one wonder about the present.
</P>
<P>
   But the scouts are impressed. They say he fields flawlessly and
his bat speed is good, good enough that the Dodgers have named him
their starting shortstop to begin the season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all this seems crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Elster was done with baseball last year. Now, he's an integral
part of a club whose payroll could bankroll a chain of high-end
bars.
</P>
<P>
   It all started about a month before spring training began, when
Elster decided he wanted to play baseball again and the Dodgers
decided they had nothing to lose if they invited him to spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have worked out better for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, I didn't come in here expecting this to
happen, but it has, so I'm really looking forward to it,'' Elster
said. ``On the weekends during (last) summer, I was by the pool all
day long. All day long. I'd cook out, have friends over. That's
what I did. That's my story. It was so nice by the pool I never
went to the lake, and the lake is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster's agent/brother, Patrick, began calling around when Kevin
decided he hadn't had his fill of baseball. Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone returned the phone call immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Elster was on the phone with Malone and liked what he
heard. Then his former manager and current Dodgers manager, Davey
Johnson, rang. After a 30-minute conversation, during which they
reminisced about their days together in New York in the late 1980s,
Elster was in effect a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was to provide a safety net in case young
shortstop Alex Cora struggled in the spring. Cora, 24, did just
that. Elster, having nothing to lose, was consistent from the first
grounder he caressed into his glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Kevin well, and I know that as long as he was in shape
he would be all right,'' Johnson said. ``I asked him what kind of
shape he was in and he said he was fine. I know what he's capable
of doing. When he was with me with the Mets, he went through that
streak (of 88 games without an error).''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an effortless transition.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Elster swung a bat or took a grounder was when he
was released by the Texas Rangers on July 31, 1998. He has some
rust to shed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I picked up a bat was when I got here,'' Elster
said. ``I did play catch three or four times. You can't come in
here and expect to start throwing 15 minutes a day from day one, so
I did throw the ball a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did come to spring training a week early to get as many
swings as he wanted in the batting cages and take grounders to get
back in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems a little weird, I know,'' Elster said. ``I've never
worked out in the winter. I like to forget all my bad habits and
start anew every year and see if I can find it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are convinced he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's way ahead of where I thought he'd be,'' Malone said.
``He's been much more consistent than I thought he would be after
missing well over a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster missed almost all of '92 when he had surgery on his right
shoulder, played 10 minor-league games in '93 and played sparingly
in '94 and '95. Then Texas invited him to spring training as a
nonroster invitee in '96.
</P>
<P>
   He stunned everyone by hitting 24 homers, driving in 99 runs and
batting .252 in 157 games. In his other 703 career games over 11
seasons, Elster has 50 homers, 245 RBI and hit .222.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, hitting ninth in the American League is a
joy,'' Elster said. ``That was the first year after being hurt. ...
I was a different person. I was bigger, stronger. I discovered
lifting weights with my upper body rather than my legs. That was
the first chance I got to play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster parlayed that into a starting job with Pittsburgh in '97,
and he was producing again. He led the team with seven homers and
25 RBI in mid-May. The Pirates were so thrilled they offered Elster
a multiyear deal. The sides agreed, but the night before Elster was
to sign he was involved in a baserunning collision and shattered
his left wrist. Goodbye contract.
</P>
<P>
   He re-signed with the Rangers in '98, battled injuries and
fought for playing time before he was released.
</P>
<P>
   Elster had enough of baseball, so he went to the desert to start
the next phase of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I guess I just wanted one more shot at the
ring,'' Elster said. ``I think this team has a chance. That's why I
decided to come here. It's the championship ring. I have one, and I
want another.'' &QL;

RANGERS SEEKING BALLAST FOR TOP-HEAVY LINEUP
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. _ Like Christopher Columbus, when the
Rangers embark on a new season Monday afternoon they can't be sure
whether they're going to discover the new world or simply drop off
the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   What they do know is exactly where the old world stops and the
new one, if it's there, kicks in _ at the No. 6 spot in the batting
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're going to prove,'' manager Johnny Oates predicted
boldly yesterday, echoing the Italian explorer of old, ``is that
the world is round.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates' first five hitters represent the Rangers' world as we've
come to know it: Royce Clayton, Rusty Greer, Pudge Rodriguez,
Rafael Palmeiro and even new Ranger David Segui, who at least is a
known major-league quantity.
</P>
<P>
   But is there life after No. 5?
</P>
<P>
   More important, can the Rangers' veterans hold the fort long
enough for the babes who linger below the Segui Line to mature and
develop into bona fide major-league players?
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, this team could be history before the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to fall off the face of the earth,'' Oates
declared. ``Supposedly, the strength of our ballclub is our
starting pitching. If we all carry the load and do our part, not
just our pitching, but Raffy and Pudge and Segui and Greer, we
should be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veterans need to get us going and let the young kids catch
up. I don't think it's going to take long.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Opening Day, Oates was more than comfortable with the last
four hitters in his batting order, and why not? They included
American League MVP Rodriguez (.332, 35 home runs, 113 runs batted
in), first baseman/designated hitter Lee Stevens (.282, 24, 81),
third baseman Todd Zeile (.293, 24, 98) and Clayton (.288, 14, 52).
</P>
<P>
   This season, his last four hitters include two rookies, a
second-year player who hit .245 in his rookie season and an aging
veteran who struggled to break .200 last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a clear delineation: Through No. 5, it's All-Stars and
solid veterans; below No. 5, it's one big question mark.
</P>
<P>
   But don't write the Rangers off yet.
</P>
<P>
   The brightest story from this camp has been the hitting and
all-around play of center fielder Ruben Mateo, who will bat sixth,
and right fielder Gabe Kapler, who will be the seventh hitter in
Oates' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Evans, the minor-league journeyman who won the third-base
job by default when rookie Mike Lamb faltered this spring, and
veteran second baseman Luis Alicea complete the lineup, but there
may be relief there, too. Frank Catalanotto, another piece of the
Juan Gonzalez trade, has also impressed Oates with his bat this
spring and will get his share of playing time at second or third.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers' veterans can just buy the kids a little time ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We need for our veteran pitchers to pitch well in the first
month to give our young guys a chance to get their feet on the
ground,'' general manager Doug Melvin said. ``Without putting any
more pressure on them than is already there, you'd like to see them
give the younger guys a chance to get comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing for young players in the big leagues is to
feel you belong. These guys _ Mateo and Kapler _ act like they do
belong and that they're already big-league players.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to become impressed with the numbers Mateo and Kapler
have put up this spring, but those can easily be skewed. Lots of
players put up big numbers early in training camp as they feast on
pitchers throwing 85-mph fastballs. But numbers aren't all Oates
sees when he watches Mateo and Kapler play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skills and what they've already done at the minor-league
level, not in spring training, that's what I see,'' Oates said. ``I
watch how they've come together in the outfield, how they talk to
each other, how they're working on becoming a unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I get back to their skills again. They're not fringe
minor-leaguers who have been hanging around for 15 years and are
finally getting a shot. These are two players of the year. They are
five-tool players, both of them.''
</P>
<P>
   We haven't heard so much about five tools (hitting for average,
hitting for power, speed, defensive ability with the glove and arm
strength), in fact, since ``Five-Tool'' Tony Chance was in camp
with the replacement players.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not go back there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both \RMateo and Kapler\S have shown good bat speed,'' Melvin
pointed out. ``You look for the skills and the adjustments they
make. They both went through a little stretch two or three weeks
ago where they weren't swinging it well, and they were out here,
putting in extra work after the games. Then they came on and got
hot again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gabe's been pretty consistent. Ruben's been on this hot
stretch now after struggling a little bit early. He kept his poise
and kept working at it. All of these guys have good work ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the reason the Rangers believe there can be life after
No. 5, if their young players don't get buried early. They won't if
the veterans can keep the team competitive while the youngsters are
learning the big-league ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be more reliance on guys who have been there,''
Greer said. ``By the same token, you can't go into a game thinking
that. You just have to let it happen. You don't want to put more
pressure on yourself, but you'd like to be able to take some
pressure off Gabe and Ruben.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, whether the Rangers can defend their AL West
championship will depend on what happens below the Segui Line.
</P>
<P>
   That's where they'll either discover a brave new world, or
completely drop off the face of the earth. / nn

NO-FEAR APPROACH NETS TITLE FOR SUTTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Hal Sutton added an exclamation point
yesterday to his weeklong message that Tiger Woods, the world's
top-ranked golfer, is not a final-round force to be feared at PGA
Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Respected, certainly. But Woods, in Sutton's estimation, is not
worthy of being placed on a pedestal and considered unbeatable, as
some peers have suggested during a streak that had seen the
24-year-old win 70 percent of his past 10 starts at tour events.
</P>
<P>
   That percentage dipped to 63.6 yesterday, when Sutton completed
a rain-delayed final round by holding off Woods in a head-to-head
duel at the TPC at Sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
   The defining moments came at No. 18, where Sutton arrived with a
one-stroke lead after frittering away three strokes over the
previous five holes.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Woods split the 18th fairway with a 2-iron,
Sutton pulled a driver and pounded the ball 15 yards past his
pursuer. When Woods' 6-iron approach flew to the back fringe,
Sutton answered with a 6-iron that stopped 10 feet below the hole.
Sutton's two-putt par clinched the $1.08 million winner's check
after Woods' long birdie attempt from the fringe stayed wide of the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what golf is all about, coming down the stretch with
the best player in the world ... and winning,'' said Sutton, who
pumped his right fist after his momentum-turning approach at No.
18, then shared a lengthy high-five with caddie Freddie Burns after
tapping in for the clinching par. ``I stayed focused on what I was
doing, not Tiger. That's what I did best. I was not going to beat
myself. I'm proud of the way I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who shot Sutton a ``thumbs-up'' sign after Sutton's
6-iron at No. 18, told his conqueror ``Well done'' as the two
walked off the 18th green. For Woods, it was only the fourth time
in his past 11 starts at PGA Tour events that he has failed to win.
But he took little solace from his third runner-up finish in that
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   This, Woods said, was Sutton's day. In fact, it was Sutton's
week. Before the tournament, Sutton criticized peers _ in
particular, Colin Montgomerie _ for adopting a ``defeatist
attitude'' in matchups with Woods. During the final round, he
backed up his bow-before-no-Tiger stance with a closing 71,
matching Woods' final-round score, to finish at 10-under par and
protect the one-stroke advantage he enjoyed after 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton became the third wire-to-wire winner in the 27-year
history of the event, joining Steve Elkington (1997) and Greg
Norman (1994). At 41, Sutton is the oldest TPC champion. Sutton,
however, admitted to bouts of nervousness after his ``defeatist
attitude'' comments became the talk of tournament week and he
realized a matchup with Woods loomed on his horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been nervous for the last two or three days, knowing
the big deal that was made of it,'' Sutton said. ``The other night,
I was sitting in the bed saying, `You know, I'm not praying to him
\RWoods\S.' So he is not a god, for sure. When that realization
came over me, it was like, `OK, he's just human like I am. So I can
do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton did it in style, finishing the final round without a
bogey. He collected seven consecutive pars during yesterday's
conclusion to Sunday's suspended round, forcing Woods to take
chances to try to trim a three-stroke deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Woods began with a three-putt bogey at No. 12, falling four
strokes off the pace, before turning up the heat with a five-foot
birdie at No. 13 and a 12-foot eagle putt at the par-5 16th. That
sent Sutton to the tee box at No. 17, the TPC's island-green hole,
with a one-shot lead. During the third round, Sutton splashed his
tee shot there and took triple-bogey. This time, he stuck a 9-iron
on the middle of the green and two-putted, while Woods saved par
from the deep rough around the collar.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 18, Sutton applied the clincher, which drew praise from
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed I didn't win, but at least I made Hal work
for it,'' Woods said. ``I wasn't going to give him a nice stroll up
18 without any pressure. I put a little heat on, and he responded.
It was a good battle. It was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sutton, it was validation of his weeklong stance that being
No. 1 in the world golf rankings does not always equate with being
No. 1 on the final-round leader board. &QL; 
Pleasant surprise
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton said he was ``really shocked'' when Tiger Woods hit a
2-iron off the tee box at the water-lined 18th hole. Briefly,
Sutton contemplated bagging the driver he was holding but stuck
with his instinct. He belted the ball 15 yards past Woods, straight
down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I needed the advantage on the last hole,'' said
Sutton, whose approach to the 18th green was 30 feet closer than
Woods'. ``I told myself, `I'm one of the best drivers in the game,
so I'm going to play to my strength.' '' &QL; 
Steady Sutton
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton said his bogey-free finish to the final round proved
pivotal in keeping Tiger Woods at bay. During yesterday's seven
holes, Sutton missed only one fairway and hit every green in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big factor,'' Sutton said. ``It never looked like I
was in trouble, from Tiger's perspective. That's what I was trying
to do. If you give him an open door, he just rushes through it. I
wanted to make sure I kept the door closed.''

VEGAS PRESENTATION INTERESTS RANGERS

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Las Vegas made a serious pitch yesterday to
six major-league teams, trying to get them to move their
spring-training bases to the desert in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are definitely interested, said executive vice
president John McMichael, who represented the team at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team was sufficiently interested to proceed with the
discussions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers, pushed by their Fox television owners,
have shown the most interest in training in Las Vegas. The Toronto
Blue Jays, Houston Astros, Baltimore Orioles and Tampa Bay Devil
Rays were also represented at the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael said the financial and economic considerations were
not discussed. Instead, Las Vegas officials and architects showed
them a plan for a four-to-six-team training facility in the
southwest part of the city and a stadium downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a lot has to be in place to go from some nice
drawings on a board to an actual facility,'' McMichael said. ``But
based on what we saw, the teams have decided to proceed with the
financial and economic discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   McMichael said the teams involved will meet to discuss strategy,
then get back with the representatives from Las Vegas as early as
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest has been piqued,'' McMichael said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers want to make a decision on a future training site by
early summer. They have one more year on their lease in Port
Charlotte, Fla. A bill pending in the Florida legislature would
provide funds to upgrade spring-training facilities in the state.
The Rangers' baseball people, including general manager Doug Melvin
and manager Johnny Oates, have expressed a desire to remain in Port
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rangers owner Tom Hicks has concerns about Port
Charlotte's remote location and availability to fans traveling from
Texas. There are also concerns about attendance, although the
Rangers are drawing almost 1,000 more fans per game this year than
in 1999. The Rangers drew a sellout crowd of 4,519 yesterday when
the Cincinnati Reds brought Ken Griffey Jr. and Deion Sanders to
town.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas is obviously a more glamorous location that Port
Charlotte, but there are concerns about the weather, which is
colder and windier than Florida in February and March, and having
young baseball players training in a gambling and entertainment
mecca.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have also looked into Arizona and other Florida
locations.
