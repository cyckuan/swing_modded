   LOS ANGELES -- The studio hype may be real this time.
</P>
<P>
   A rapidly escalating crescendo of buzz -- an indefinable sense
that a movie is about to become a blockbuster -- has overtaken Jim
Carrey's ``The Truman Show,'' which opens today in 2,350 theaters
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity has become white-hot and largely fawning, the kind
that a certain giant lizard couldn't buy with millions of dollars
of advertising earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers have been ecstatic about the tale of Truman Burbank,
and Carrey's elastic mug has been on the covers of Time and
Entertainment Weekly magazines just in time to generate even more
interest.
</P>
<P>
   If America agrees, ``The Truman Show'' may be that
once-in-awhile movie that, against appearances, somehow becomes a
cultural event in tune with its time like ``Easy Rider,''
``Network'' and ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a real steamroller on this film,'' said Chandler
Wood, head film buyer for the Pacific Theatres chain. ``The buzz
has been getting stronger every day. It's going to attract the
whole spectrum of people over 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago, ``The Truman Show'' looked like little
more than a quirky, $60 million film. It had been delayed twice,
presumably because of Paramount's concern that Carrey's fans
wouldn't be interested in anything other than his typical goofball
persona.
</P>
<P>
   But Paramount's recent good fortune appears to have continued
with ``Truman.'' First, Paramount invested $65 million in the
way-over-budget disaster movie, only to see ``Titanic'' break the
record for biggest-domestic-grossing film of all time and earn a
boatload of Oscars this spring, including Best Picture.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Paramount's ``Deep Impact'' performed far better than
expected when it opened last month -- so well, in fact, that it's
partially credited with bringing ``Godzilla'' to its knees.
</P>
<P>
   When they open the doors today, multiplex operators will be
giving screens to ``The Truman Show'' they previously planned to
use for ``Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paramount has a lot of clout with exhibitors right now,'' said
analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital Management. ``This film
had been a question mark, but now the feeling is that it's so good
that you've got to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fay, president of films for the AMC chain, believes
``The Truman Show'' can pull in an impressive $30 million to $35
million this weekend, then remain at or near the top of the box
office for the rest of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think even Paramount is a little surprised at how the buzz
has kicked in just as the film opened,'' Fay said. ``I would see it
a second time, but the trick will be getting the younger audiences
to see something that doesn't have the usual Jim Carrey in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of Reel Source, forecasts an opening
weekend of $24 million and believes a $200 million final gross
won't be out of the question if ``Truman'' catches on with
teen-agers. ``It's an excellent film that will receive a lot of
support from older audiences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Carrey squandered some of his good will in
Hollywood by stepping outside his usual manic characters (``Ace
Ventura,'' ``The Mask,'' ``Dumb and Dumber'') to play the lead in
``The Cable Guy,'' a dark-humored film mostly ignored by fans. But
others have already forecast that Carrey will be picking up an
Academy Award next year, much like Tom Hanks did for ``Forrest
Gump.''

PANAVISION NOW BELONGS TO PERELMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Ronald Perelman, one of America's richest men,
completed his $600 million takeover of Panavision, the world leader
in supplying cameras to the motion-picture industry.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, first announced in December, was approved Thursday at
a special shareholders meeting in New York City and leaves Perelman
with a 72 percent holding in Panavision -- the same level held by
venture-fund manager Warburg Pincus Capital, which had owned
Panavision for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman has a fortune worth an estimated $6.5 billion and
controls Revlon, Consolidated Cigar, California Federal Bank and
Coleman. He has promised to increase Panavision's sales and retain
senior management, but has given no details yet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which employs 300 people at its suburban Woodland
Hills headquarters and 800 overall, earned $3.5 million on revenues
of $43.2 million in the first quarter. It produces about 80 cameras
annually, leasing them to studios and producers through rental
agents, and dwarfs rivals Arriflex and Moviecam with a market share
estimated at 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman's deal provided no premium to shareholders, but offered
a debt recapitalization and other investments worth $150 million.
The transaction cut ownership of publicly held shares to 10 percent
from 19.5 percent, with Warburg and its managers owning the
remaining 18 percent.

HOUSE LEADERS ACT TO AVERT SLPLIT AS BUDGET IS DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders scrambled on Thursday to
avert a crippling split in their ranks over their budget plan for
next year, seeking to mollify both conservatives who are demanding
big tax cuts and moderates wary of a bitterly partisan
election-year fight over deep spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   With their chances of passing their tax and spending outline
hanging on a handful of votes, Republican leaders opened debate on
the House floor, saying that they were intent on giving taxpayers
back more of their money as the nation entered an era of budget
surpluses and that they would head off Democratic efforts to expand
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Republican plan is to address the
provision in the tax code that forces many two-income couples to
pay more in taxes than they would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan would ``make the government budget smaller
and the family budget larger,'' said Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon,
R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., said the Republican budget ``picks on
those most vulnerable in our society'' by cutting spending on
assistance to low-income families, schoolchildren, veterans and
other groups.
</P>
<P>
   A final vote on the plan is expected on Friday. But in its first
procedural test on Thursday night, the Republican plan passed, 216
to 197, with four Republicans voting against it.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, drafted by Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the
chairman of the House Budget Committee, calls for $101 billion in
tax cuts over the next five years and spending cuts of a similar
magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   The party's most conservative members want tax cuts of $150
billion and hope to resurrect the drive for a smaller government
that led to bitter political clashes with President Clinton and a
partial shutdown of some federal agencies in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican moderates have little stomach for the deep
spending cuts in domestic programs called for by Kasich's plan. And
although relatively few of them are likely to defy their
leadership, the defections of as few as 10 Republicans would leave
the party short of the votes needed for final passage.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders were sufficiently concerned about the
potential defections that they used a parliamentary maneuver late
on Wednesday night to block consideration on the floor of a
substitute budget, offered by a group of conservative Democrats,
that closely mirrored the plan passed by the Republican-controlled
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate plan provided for $30 billion in tax cuts and largely
stuck to the spending path agreed to by both parties in Congress
and Clinton in last year's balanced-budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Republicans, including Pete Domenici of New Mexico,
the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, have made it clear
they think the House version goes too far in tax and spending cuts.
But conservatives in the Senate want at least $60 billion in tax
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the House version passes when it comes to a final vote,
House and Senate negotiators would then have to work out a
compromise between their versions
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republican leaders were telling wavering moderates on
Thursday that voting for the budget plan was only an interim step
toward a final package, and that the version that emerged from
House-Senate negotiations would be more palatable to them,
Republican aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership in the Senate used the same tactic to
win support from conservatives when the Senate voted on its budget
outline earlier this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders in the House were almost gleeful, both at the
divisions among Republicans and at the prospect of going into this
fall's midterm congressional elections with the Republicans on
record as favoring deep spending cuts in popular programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unacceptable, not only to Democrats but also to many
Republicans,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority
leader, said of the Republican plan. ``They want to withdraw from
our commitments to education, health care and the environment, key
areas critical to the future of our country and the security of our
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win more votes, Kasich changed his plan late on
Wednesday. In a nod to conservatives, he added a provision saying
that would make it easier to use some of any future budget
surpluses for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to deal with the concerns of some moderates,
Kasich shifted proposed cuts in Medicare, the health insurance
program for the elderly that has often been a political
battleground, to a broader spending category that finances welfare
payments.

GROFF WANTED OUT OF UNDERFUNDED CAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A frustrating and disappointing month in
Indianapolis came to a bitter end for Chatsworth High product Mike
Groff this week.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling to qualify and then finishing 15th in the
Indianapolis 500 _ 17 laps behind winner Eddie Cheever Jr. _ Groff
was replaced as driver of the Jonathan Byrd/Cunningham Racing No.10
G Force Aurora, a car he felt was badly outclassed at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran John Paul Jr. will drive the car at Saturday night's
Indy Racing League True Value 500 in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Groff said the decision to make a change was mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the race, I decided to stand back and take a look at
things,'' said Groff, who now lives in Pasadena. ``I talked to
Jonathan (Byrd) a little bit and we decided to part ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Groff said he felt the owners and crew chief blamed him for his
car's poor performance even though for the first few races of 1997,
he had the team in first place in IRL season points. But the real
problem, Groff said, was with the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   First, the team struggled just to qualify the car, finally
earning the 32nd of the 33 spots on their last try on the last day.
Groff described that effort as frightening, a ``white-knuckle''
let-it-all-hang-out, desperation run around the course.
</P>
<P>
   In the race, Groff said his car's top speed was around 205 mph,
while other drivers were hitting the 220s and lapping him
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not very competitive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Groff said the problem was mechanical and the result of using
outmoded equipment as the owners tried to keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that we were not one of the better-funded teams
out there,'' Groff said. ``The owner came to me after the second
race this season and said we had already spent our budget for the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Groff said he doesn't understand why guys who can't afford to
race do it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's easy for me to be an armchair quarterback,''
he admitted. ``But if you choose to own an car, own it with a
passion. To be competitive, you've got to keep up with the Joneses
and I don't think we did that.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of putting money into making the car faster, Groff
feels, his team chose to blame the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easy thing is to say, `Hey, that Mike guy doesn't stand on
the gas very hard,' '' Groff said.
</P>
<P>
   Groff several times told Byrd there was one way to find out if
he was the problem: Put another driver in the car. Twice before
Byrd took him up on the offer, bringing an outsider for testing.
This time, he's brought in Paul permanently.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK with Groff, who is tied for 11th with Billy Boat in
season points with 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed, but I also realize this just wasn't a good
situation for us,'' he said. Groff said he hopes to catch on with
another team soon.
</P>
<P>
   Good start: North Hollywood product Jeff Shafer finished seventh
in his first race with the MCI Racing KOOL/Toyota Atlantic team.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer, who started fifth, wound up just behind MCI teammate
Anthony Lazzaro at the Miller Lite 200 in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finishing in the top 10 is pretty exciting for me,'' Shafer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee race was Shafer's first with MCI after signing on
with it earlier this spring as a part-time driver.
</P>
<P>
   Tach it up: For 25 years, Lions Drag Strip roared on weekends
with sounds of souped up engines. Those who remember those days
fondly are holding a reunion this weekend at the Carson Community
Center, 3 Civic Plaza Drive, in Carson.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of vintage cars and other memorabilia from the strip,
which closed in 1972, will be displayed. Also on hand will be NHRA
funny car driver Gary Densham.
</P>
<P>
   End of the string: Granada Hills' M.K. Kanke couldn't overcome a
poor starting position and finished sixth at Saturday's NASCAR
Featherlite Southwest Tour Colorado 125. His winning streak thus
was stopped at two.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke's season-points lead was only slightly affected, however.
He will go to next week's Altamont 100 near Tracy, Calif., leading
Steve Portenga by 97 points.
</P>
<P>
   Baja-bound: More than 200 off-road racers are expected in
Ensenada, Mexico, this weekend to run the SCORE Baja 500 Desert
Race. One of the marquee events of the SCORE season, the race draws
the top names in off-road racing, including nine-time overall
champion Ivan Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers will run in 23 classes, 16 for cars and trucks, seven
for motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty midgets: Simi Valley's Rick Hendrix won a 30-lap showdown
at Tucson Raceway Park last weekend and continues to lead the USAC
Western States Midget standings. Simi Valley neighbor Alex Harris
continued his domination of the three-quarter midget ranks, winning
at Perris Auto Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix, Harris and the rest of the midget tour will race at
Ventura Raceway June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: In just three years, Italy's Alex Zanardi has
become the dominant figure in CART racing. In 38 starts he has 10
poles and 10 victories. In his past 13 races, he has been in the
top three 11 times.... The IRL will run twice at Texas Motor
Speedway this year. The two events, Saturday night's True Value 500
and Sept. 20's Longhorn 500, have been dubbed the Texas Two-Step
Championship with an extra $100,000 going to the driver with the
most combined points.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAKAYAMA, Japan _ In what colleagues hailed as a historic
landmark, 120 physicists from 23 research institutions in Japan and
the United States announced on Friday that they had found the
existence of mass in a notoriously elusive subatomic particle
called the neutrino.
</P>
<P>
   The neutrino, a particle that carries no electric charge, is so
light that it was assumed for many years to have no mass at all.
After Friday's announcement, cosmologists will have to confront the
possibility that much of the mass of the universe is in the form of
neutrinos. The discovery will also compel scientists to revise a
highly successful theory of the composition of matter known as the
Standard Model.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the discovery had drawn some 300 physicists here to
discuss neutrino research. Among other things, they said, the
finding of neutrino mass might affect theories about the formation
and evolution of galaxies and the ultimate fate of the universe. If
neutrinos have sufficient mass, their presence throughout the
universe would increase the overall mass of the universe, possibly
slowing its present expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the newly detected but as yet unmeasured mass of the
neutrino must be too small to cause cosmological effects. But
whatever the case, there was general agreement here that the
discovery will have far-reaching consequences for the investigation
of the nature of matter.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the collaboration of scientists who discovered the
existence of neutrino mass using a huge underground detector called
Super-Kamiokande, Dr. Takaaki Kajita of the Institute for Cosmic
Ray Research of Tokyo University said that all explanations for the
data collected by the detector except the existence of neutrino
mass had been essentially ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Yoji Totsuka, leader of the coalition and director of the
Kamioka Neutrino Observatory where the underground detector is
situated, 30 miles north of here in the Japan Alps, acknowledged
that his group's announcement was ``very strong,'' but said, ``We
have investigated all other possible causes of the effects we have
measured and only neutrino mass remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bahcall, a leading neutrino expert and astrophysical
theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.,
said in an interview that there had been many claims in recent
years of the discovery of neutrino mass by other groups. ``But this
one is by far the most convincing,'' he said. ``Besides the strong
evidence they have found, this team has a magnificent track record
of discoveries.''
</P>
<P>
   But because the elusive particles cannot be seen, the evidence
that they have mass is indirect.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Standard Model of matter, neutrinos come in three
types or ``flavors.'' The data gathered by the Super-Kamiokande
team during the two years the detector has operated indicate that
at least one of these three ``flavors'' can ``oscillate'' into one
of the other flavors as it travels along at nearly the speed of
light. According to the theories of quantum mechanics, any particle
capable of transforming itself in this way must have mass.
</P>

   Study of the neutrino particle has been glacially slow since its
existence was hypothesized in 1931 by the Austrian physicist
Wolfgang Pauli as a way to explain the mysterious loss of energy in
certain nuclear reactions. The particle was finally discovered in
1956 by two physicists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Dr.
Frederick Reines (who was awarded a Nobel Prize for the discovery)
and the late Dr. Clyde Cowan.
</P>
<P>
   But understanding of the particle since then has been acquired
painfully slowly, because neutrinos have no electric charge and
rarely interact with any kind of matter. A neutrino so rarely
collides with an atom of ordinary matter that a typical neutrino
can easily penetrate a one-light-year thickness of lead _ some six
trillion miles _ without hindrance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the writer John Updike put it in a poem he wrote in 1960:
</P>
<P>
   ``Neutrinos, they are very small.
</P>
<P>
   They have no charge and have no mass
</P>
<P>
   And do not interact at all.
</P>
<P>
   The earth is just a silly ball
</P>
<P>
   To them, through which they simply pass
</P>
<P>
   Like dust maids down a drafty hall.''
</P>
<P>
   But once in a great while, a neutrino does hit an atom and the
resulting blast of nuclear debris supplies clues about the neutrino
itself. The debris generally includes many particles that can race
through water, mineral oil or even ice, sending out shock waves of
blue light. This light, called Cherenkov radiation, can be detected
by sensitive light sensors and measured.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few decades, scientists have learned that matter
is made up of three distinct flavors or types. This means that
there are three flavors of neutrinos _ the electron neutrino
associated with the electron, the muon neutrinos, associated with
the muon particle, which is a kind of fat electron, and the tau
neutrino, associated with the tau particle, an even fatter relative
of the electron.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the muon and tau particles and their associated
neutrinos in the universe has mystified physicists. ``Who ordered
that?'' the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Isidor Rabi is said to
have remarked when the muon was found.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Super-Kamiokande detector was built two years ago as a joint
Japanese-American experiment. It is essentially a water tank the
size of a large cathedral installed in a deep zinc mine one mile
inside a mountain 30 miles north of here. When neutrinos slice
through the tank, one of them occasionally makes its presence known
by colliding with an atom, which sends blue light through the water
to an array of detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous volume of water in the detector increased the
likelihood of neutrino impacts to the point at which the discovery
of neutrino mass became possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Super-Kamiokande collaboration is studying several neutrino
phenomenon simultaneously, but the one that led to Friday's
announcement was based on ``atmospheric'' neutrinos created when
highly energetic cosmic ray particles from deep space slam into the
Earth's upper atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists knew that different flavors of neutrinos constantly
arrive from the upper atmosphere and they have calculated that the
ratio between muon neutrinos and other flavors must have a certain
value. But over the years detectors found only about half the muon
neutrino predicted by theory.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent shortage of muon neutrinos was explained by the
recent observations that led to Friday's announcement. The
physicists found that when neutrinos come from the sky directly
over the Super Kamiokande detector _ a relatively short distance _
the proportion of muon neutrinos among them was higher than among
the neutrinos coming up from beneath the detector after having
passed through the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists reasoned that by traveling through the entire
Earth these neutrinos had had time to oscillate, probably many
times, between muon neutrinos and some other type, especially the
tau neutrino, and this accounts for the deficit seen in muon
neutrinos. (The tau neutrino has not yet been directly detected but
it must exist to make observations consistent.)
</P>
<P>
   A related problem has to do with neutrinos produced by the
fusion process in the sun. This process, which merges the nuclei of
hydrogen atoms to form helium nuclei and energy, produces
neutrinos. Astrophysicists believe they understand the mechanism in
complete detail.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that all the best detectors ever built find far
fewer neutrinos than should be present according to understanding
of the fusion reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the anomaly can be explained by the
oscillation of detectable solar neutrinos into types that cannot be
detected by existing instruments. But no one has proven this
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigation of the neutrino have not been limited to the
Super-Kamiokande collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the collaboration's University of Hawaii Group,
for example, Dr. John Learned, has also worked on an underwater
detection system in the Pacific Ocean off the Hawaiian coast (which
ran out of money before completion) and a project at the South Pole
where a neutrino detector had been buried under thousands of feet
of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach to penetrating the neutrino secrets involves
the use of particle accelerators capable of producing intense beams
of neutrinos. In two experiments currently being prepared, one in
Japan and the other at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in
Illinois, beams of neutrinos will be directed through the Earth
toward detectors several hundred miles away. The goal will be to
observe changes the neutrinos undergo in transit, both in numbers
and types. Physicists expect the experiment to confirm the
existence of neutrino oscillations like those seen in the
Super-Kamiokande detector.
</P>
<P>
   Although the neutrinos are now known to have some mass, most
physicists agree that the mass must be very small. The
Super-Kamiokande experiments suggest that the difference between
the masses of muon neutrinos and other types of neutrinos is only
about 0.07 electron volts (a measure of particle mass). This does
not yield a value of the masses themselves, only of the difference
between those of muon neutrinos and other types.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mass of the neutrino of any flavor must be small,
Totsuka said, it may be several electron-volts, and if so, the
overall gravitational effect on the universe would perhaps be
significant. It has been estimated that at any given moment, every
teaspoon worth of volume of space throughout the universe contains
an average of 300 neutrinos, so their aggregate number is
staggering.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 68 years, a legion of distinguished physicists
has devoted inquiries and careers to the puzzling neutrino, which
was given its name by the great Italian-American scientist Enrico
Fermi. Fermi quickly came to believe in the particle's existence,
even though it was not proved in his lifetime, and named it
``neutrino,'' which means ``little neutral one'' in Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of dozens of neutrino experiments meet once
every two years to exchange ideas at conferences like the one under
way here. Present are representatives of teams that have installed
neutrino detectors on the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia, under
the Aegean Sea off the Greek coast, inside the Gran Sasso tunnel
under the Alps, under the ice covering the South Pole, and in many
other places.

BLOOD SUPPLIER TAKING ON RED CROSS IN BID TO PUMP UP PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For all of its 20-year history, blood products
specialist HemaCare Corp. has operated in the shadow of the
American Red Cross, struggling in the role of David to the Red
Cross' Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an apparent effort to even the playing field, HemaCare's
board of directors has hired a Red Cross insider to serve as chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   After a year in which the company saw essentially zero earnings
on stagnant sales of $11 million, William Nicely, former chief
executive for the Red Cross' Southern California blood services
division, was brought in Monday with a mandate to cut costs,
improve efficiency and drum up new business. In the process, the
board hopes, he will help bolster the company's anemic shares.
</P>
<P>
   It's a deceptively simple list, Nicely said, and one for which
he is under the gun to devise a strategy. HemaCare's board will
meet June 29, and Nicely must make his recommendations then.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past I can't change, only the future,'' the new CEO said
this week. ``But it's just too early to be concrete about what I
plan to do.''
</P>
<P>
   HemaCare was founded in 1978 to make money at what had
traditionally been a nonprofit business: the collection of blood
and blood components for resale to Southern California hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   By emphasizing its small size relative to the Red Cross, and
putting a premium on customer service, HemaCare met with some
success, enough at least to go public in 1986. By 1992 the firm was
generating $12.4 million in annual sales. Earnings were harder to
come by, however, and from 1992 to 1994 the company lost money in
every quarter but one.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was a lack of focus. Over the years,
HemaCare dabbled in several money-losing projects, including
research on an alternative treatment for HIV infection and the
establishment of a blood services center in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistakes were made,'' Nicely said.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the endeavors was subsequently scrapped, leaving
HemaCare wiser but poorer, with only the business of collecting and
distributing blood to fall back on. But a back-to-basics strategy
based on those operations may simply not be enough to turn the
company around now, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   With its high concentration of hospitals, the Southern
California market has in recent years drawn additional suppliers
beyond HemaCare and the Red Cross, making it far more competitive
than in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A large San Diego blood bank, for example, recently began
peddling its products in the Greater Los Angeles region after the
loss of a major local contract to the Red Cross left it with an
oversupply.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the nonprofit Red Cross, meanwhile, say they have
no intention of ceding any more of the $100 million L.A. market to
competitors. From an estimated 90 percent-plus market share a
decade ago, the Red Cross controls about 75 percent today. HemaCare
supplies about 10 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``HemaCare's fighting one of the most entrenched monopolies in
the U.S. health-care system, and that's really tough,'' said
Michael LeConey, an analyst at Dirks &AMP; Co. ``The Red Cross plays
hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the Red Cross need not make money -- and in fact is
supplemented by charitable donations -- some have said it cheats. A
year ago, the organization settled out of court a lawsuit HemaCare
filed in 1995 alleging that its blood pricing in Los Angeles and
Orange counties violated federal fair-trade laws. And Nicely said
his former division did lose money throughout the first half of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would discuss terms of the settlement. Red Cross
spokesman Mark Jackson said only that his organization ``views
competition as healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the deck appears stacked against HemaCare and Nicely,
LeConey said if the company can grab even a few more percentage
points of the Southern California market, ``it would be a home run
for shareholders.'' HemaCare shares have lost 50 percent of their
value over the last 12 months, closing Thursday at 62.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're basically the only publicly traded company in the
country attempting to build a position against the Red Cross in
what is a gargantuan market,'' LeConey said. ``Can they do it?
That's where the rubber meets the road.''

SENATE PANEL AND CIA FIGHT OVER CHINA DOCUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The director of central intelligence caused a stir
on Thursday by refusing to share some information with a Senate
committee investigating the transfer of satellite technology to
China, prompting Justice Department officials to backtrack and
permit the release of certain information.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began with the testimony of George Tenet, the
director of central intelligence, who cited a criminal inquiry by
the Justice Department in declining to disclose a document to the
Senate panel on its very first day of hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet told senators that the department had advised him that the
release of such information could jeopardize its inquiry into
whether a private company illegally passed on sensitive technology
to China.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal had threatened to put the Clinton administration and
Congress at odds over an inquiry with serious national security
overtones, one to which President Clinton had promised his
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   After much criticism by senators on the committee Thursday, the
department lifted its objections to Tenet's disclosure of the
disputed document. But its spokesman, Bert Brandenburg, said on
Thursday night that the department still reserved the right to
excise sensitive information from other documents that might tip
off the government's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., who heads the intelligence
committee, plans to make an issue of the department's reluctance to
release information on Friday when Attorney General Janet Reno and
Louis Freeh, director of the FBI, testify before the committee, his
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Thursday, Shelby warned the administration to honor
its promise to cooperate with the inquiry and not hide behind the
Justice Department's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're stonewalling,'' Shelby told reporters.
``This is central to our investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Justice Department officials said on Thursday that Tenet
was initially told not to talk to senators about certain
information because the disclosure could hamper the federal
investigation of the satellite company, Loral Space and
Communications of New York.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said on Thursday night that the
information Tenet refused to discuss was a CIA assessment of the
incident that led to the Loral inquiry. A similar report by the
Pentagon concluded last year that American national security was
harmed by the information passed on to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Shelby said on Thursday night that the senator would
welcome the release of the CIA document, but would ``maintain that
we should have access to all information in unredacted form that
pertains to our oversight responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby said that the information Mr. Tenet had refused to
discuss ``was known to intelligence agencies before the criminal
inquiry began.'' Shelby said Tenet was obligated by law to disclose
the information to the panel. Indeed, Tenet told senators he had
been prepared to answer all questions until the Justice
Department's warned him against it, and that the director felt he
was ``in a box,'' Shelby said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel played down the wrangling. ``There's a
lot of partisan energy behind this,'' Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in an interview. ``The
Justice Department has legitimate reasons based on previous leaks
to ask for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's three-hour closed hearing with Tenet marked the
opening round of months of hearings by several House and Senate
committees into whether China learned secret information from
American satellites that Beijing then used to aim its nuclear
missiles more accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also delving into accusations that the Chinese
government illegally funneled money to the Democrats during
Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby's committee is leading the investigation in the Senate.
The House plans to create a select committee to handle its separate
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury is investigating whether Loral and another
satellite maker, Hughes Electronics, a Los Angeles division of the
General Motors Corp., illegally gave China space expertise that
allowed Beijing to more accurately aim its nuclear missiles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loral's chairman and chief executive, Bernard Schwartz, was the
largest personal contributor to the Democratic National Committee
last year. Schwartz has denied he sought any favors in exchange for
his contributions.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many strands to the various Congressional
inquiries, federal and congressional investigators are focusing on
the events following the Feb. 15, 1996, explosion seconds after a
Chinese rocket carrying a $200 million Loral satellite was
launched.
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion, China asked the two American companies to
conduct an independent review of the accident. The team was led by
Loral, but included experts from Hughes.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say the American experts overstepped
the boundaries of what they could tell the Chinese during the
review. The State Department asked the Defense Technology Security
Administration in the Pentagon to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-May 1997, the Pentagon agency's report, based on
intelligence and rocket experts, found that American security had
been harmed. Two weeks later, the U.S. Customs Service began an
investigation that became the basis for the government's criminal
inquiry.

<P>
   PARIS _ Borrowing an idea from the Guardian Angels on the New
York subway, the Paris transit authority is deploying dozens of
uniformed young people as ``mediators'' on the Paris Metro in an
attempt to reassure passengers and help combat violence and
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   The first 14 of the Local Social Mediation Agents, or ALMS, as
they are called, began patrolling the network this week after a
four-week training course _ just in time for next week's start of
the World Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   If soccer brings with it hooliganism, as many fear, the agents,
men and women around the age of 20, will be in the front line.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the transit authority, the RATP, said the agents
had a dissuasive and mediating role rather than a repressive one.
If trouble breaks out, the unidentified agents can call on the
police for help. Their only weapon is the power of persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer Guardian Angels, who came to Paris in a
short-lived experiment a few years ago, are seen by many as
unlawful vigilantes although they claimed to have reduced crime in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris agents on the other hand will carry an official
warrant jointly issued by the RATP and the Paris police, and will
work in close collaboration with the police.
</P>
<P>
   They have been given instruction in public liberty, principles
of law and psychological training in dealing with problems ranging
from drunkenness to graffiti spraying. The RATP said they were also
expected to lend a helping hand to people who are lost or in
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that a perceived lack of security is foremost among
the concerns of passengers. Metro employees have gone on strike
several times in recent months because of attacks against
co-workers, and the RATP spends tens of millions of francs cleaning
up trains defaced by vandals.
</P>
<P>
   The agents are being hired under a government plan to create
jobs for young people, under which the government will pay up to 80
percent of their wages.
</P>
<P>
   The RATP says it hopes to have 50 agents on duty by the end of
June, and 250 within three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro network already employs specialized security officials
and dog-handlers in addition to transit policemen _ a total of
about 1,000 men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the young agents, who wear black uniforms, is
more specifically targeted at other young people. &QL;

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The reconfigured Texas Motor Speedway is
fast, according to the speeds run by Indy Racing League and NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series drivers during practice sessions yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   However, not even a state-of-the-art drainage system can make it
dry any faster after a thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Truck qualifying for tonight's Pronto Auto Parts 400K was
delayed 31/2 hours when a storm front dumped half an inch of rain
on the track in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Sprague won the truck pole with a lap of 178.642 mph, and
Jay Sauter was second 177.480.
</P>
<P>
   IRL officials decided at 10:25 p.m. to postpone qualifying until
today.
</P>
<P>
   The revised schedule has the IRL cars practicing in two groups
from 1 to 1:30 p.m and 1:30 to 2 p.m. Qualifying under a
best-of-two-laps format is scheduled for 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a dampness out there,'' said Leo Mehl, the IRL's
executive director. ``We think we're getting into an area where
we're in a safety situation. For the speeds we're going, it's got
so late that we thought it was wise not to squeeze it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a guy running an Indy car at 1 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehl said there was no problem with the track or its new
drainage system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no puddles,'' Mehl said. ``On the inside (of the
corners) there is a dampness. But the track is as good a racing
surface as I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Reigning Indy 500 champion Eddie Cheever Jr. said he welcomed
the delay, because it gave his team an extra practice session.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very slow on the straightaway today, so we put in a
fresh engine to see if that's the problem,'' said Cheever, whose
top lap was 213.152 mph. ``We're flat with the throttle and not
going fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Indy 500 pole sitter Billy Boat, who was second-fastest overall
at 221.067 mph, said the delay was not a huge problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would have run quicker (last night), but I'm used
to these late nights,'' Boat said. ``We have a car capable of
winning the pole. We always got a little bit left. But it's hard to
have much left here driverwise, because you're always flat.''
</P>
<P>
   It began to rain at TMS about 7:10 p.m., and rained for about a
half-hour. Drying crews got on the track about 8 p.m., and it took
more than two hours to get the track dry.
</P>
<P>
   Truck qualifying finally got under way at 10:15 p.m., 31/2 hours
later than the 6:45 p.m. scheduled start.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be dry instantly, but it's normal stuff,'' said
Eddie Gossage, TMS executive vice president and general manager.
``We're at the mercy of the weather. You've got a real humid night,
so it takes longer to dry.''
</P>
<P>
   It also took longer because the track had to be dry for two
series with distinct handling characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We not only had to dry the track for us, but also for the IRL
guys,'' said Owen Kearns Jr., news media coordinator for the truck
series. ``They run a different line than we do. That took a little
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least the track was finally dry enough for the trucks to
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rains came, there seemed to be plenty of evidence
that the track is faster since it was revamped.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart turned a hot lap of 223.224 in his Indy car, the
fastest ever at the speedway. The fast lap during the True Value
500k last year was 218.094 by Stewart.

   PARIS _ Borrowing an idea from the Guardian Angels on the New
York subway, the Paris transit authority is deploying dozens of
uniformed young people as ``mediators'' on the Paris Metro in an
attempt to reassure passengers and help combat violence and
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   The first 14 of the Local Social Mediation Agents, or ALMS, as
they are called, began patrolling the network this week after a
four-week training course _ just in time for next week's start of
the World Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
   If soccer brings with it hooliganism, as many fear, the agents,
men and women around the age of 20, will be in the front line.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the transit authority, the RATP, said the agents
had a dissuasive and mediating role rather than a repressive one.
If trouble breaks out, the unidentified agents can call on the
police for help. Their only weapon is the power of persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer Guardian Angels, who came to Paris in a
short-lived experiment a few years ago, are seen by many as
unlawful vigilantes although they claimed to have reduced crime in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris agents on the other hand will carry an official
warrant jointly issued by the RATP and the Paris police, and will
work in close collaboration with the police.
</P>
<P>
   They have been given instruction in public liberty, principles
of law and psychological training in dealing with problems ranging
from drunkenness to graffiti spraying. The RATP said they were also
expected to lend a helping hand to people who are lost or in
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that a perceived lack of security is foremost among
the concerns of passengers. Metro employees have gone on strike
several times in recent months because of attacks against
co-workers, and the RATP spends tens of millions of francs cleaning
up trains defaced by vandals.
</P>
<P>
   The agents are being hired under a government plan to create
jobs for young people, under which the government will pay up to 80
percent of their wages.
</P>
<P>
   The RATP says it hopes to have 50 agents on duty by the end of
June, and 250 within three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro network already employs specialized security officials
and dog-handlers in addition to transit policemen _ a total of
about 1,000 men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the young agents, who wear black uniforms, is
more specifically targeted at other young people. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ In Jordan and Egypt, they are predicting an explosion
by the autumn. In Lebanon, the betting is the detonation will occur
in midsummer. In Jerusalem, the Palestinians _ and a large number
of Israelis _ fear the worst on an almost hourly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian-Israeli confrontations now occur several times daily
_ with almost the same frequency as they did during the
``intifada'' uprising that preceded the now-dead Oslo agreement.
And still, incredibly, oil is being poured upon the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The latest provocation against the Arabs has been the work of
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose flirtation with Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has included a motorcade
past the proposed site of an American embassy in Jerusalem _
anathema to any peacemaker who believes that Jerusalem's future
must be decided under the terms of the Oslo agreement _ and an
insistence that Israel, and only Israel, can decide how much
occupied land should be returned to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, according to Gingrich, is to blame for the
virtual collapse of the ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is news to the Europeans who are warning with
ever more desperation that the Middle East is approaching disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The EU itself is considering whether Israel should be blocked
from all future trade concessions with Europe because of its
settlements policy.
</P>
<P>
   EU diplomats were outraged to find that produce arriving in
Europe from the ever-growing Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza were being labelled ``made in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, French President Jacques Chirac has been infuriated
by Netanyahu's rejection of his offer of a ``Saviors of Peace''
conference, launched with Egyptian President Mubarak in Paris two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army have already staged a computer projection of
the violence which could soon break out on the West Bank and Gaza.
Another wicked suicide bomb by a Palestinian might provide the
Netanyahu cabinet with a reason to retake West Bank towns _ in a
search, no doubt, for ``terrorists'' _ where they would be
confronted by Arafat's armed policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Israeli ``intelligence sources'' (for which read the
Israeli army's chief of staff) have been telling the Jerusalem Post
that Arafat may have been smuggling rocket-propelled grenades _
``even missiles'' _ through a series of tunnels linking Gaza to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   This fantasy _ all the odder since Israel itself insisted on
controlling the Palestine-Egyptian border beneath which this
subterranean burrowing has supposedly taken place _ helps to set
the stage for the battle to come.
</P>
<P>
   Even history is being rewritten with this apparent aim. When in
1996, Israeli artillerymen slaughtered 106 Lebanese refugees
sheltering in a U.N. position at Qana in southern Lebanon, they
claimed they were shooting at Hezbollah gunmen at least 600 feet
from the U.N. barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, Israel's representative at the U.N., Zvi
Cohen, claimed _ untruthfully _ that the Hezbollah had been using
the U.N. position as ``their headquarters.'' This astonishing and
mendacious statement went unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   If Cohen actually meant what he said, however, the implications
are appalling _ that Israel deliberately fired at the U.N.
compound, something it has hitherto always denied.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to the U.N. soldiers north of the Israeli
border if the expected conflict spreads to Lebanon? Israeli
officers involved in the end-of-peace computer projection in the
West Bank say that there would be massive bloodshed, with hundreds
_ perhaps thousands _ dead.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Arafat is still, according to the Israelis, not doing enough
to ``crack down on terrorism,'' even though the PLO leader has
detained at least 70 Hamas members since March 29 (the day on which
the Hamas leader Muhi al-Din al-Sharif was mysteriously killed) _
most of whom, according to Amnesty International, were cruelly
tortured by the PLO in prisons in Ramallah and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 men have now been murdered in Palestinian custody _
all held for questioning about ``threats to Israel's security'' _
though not a word of criticism of this appalling abuse of human
rights has come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nor about Israel's now overt decision to hold 22 Lebanese as
hostages in return for information about the fate of missing
Israeli servicemen. Of these 22, one has now been held for 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Originally imprisoned in the notorious Khiam jail by Israel's
proxy Lebanese militia allies, Ali Hussein Ali Ammar was then
secretly _ and illegally, under international law _ transferred to
Israel where he was sentenced to four and a half years for
``membership of an illegal organization'' and military training
inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   When he was due for release in 1991, he was put under
``administrative detention'' and Israel now admits that he and the
other 21 Lebanese are now held solely as ``bargaining chips.''
</P>
<P>
   American cowardice _ in the face of the immensely powerful
Jewish lobby in the United States _ has now produced a situation in
which Washington remains supinely silent while Netanyahu, according
to the Israeli paper Yediot Ahronot, threatens to ``burn
Washington'' should President Clinton attempt to force Israel to
accept a 13 percent withdrawal from occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the State Department and the American press go on
talking about ``putting the peace process back on track,'' the most
tired and most untruthful metaphor in recent Middle East history.
</P>
<P>
   And still American journalists refuse to explain how or why the
``peace process'' has collapsed. Indeed, only last week, Richard
Cohen was telling Washington Post readers that ``on any given day,
it looks as if a deal can be reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Could anything be further from the truth? Subconsciously,
perhaps, the world is beginning to understand the nature of the
nightmare scenario confronting the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Hitherto, it has been a habit to distance Arab populations from
their ruthless dictators when attacking Arab countries; before
bombing their cities, Presidents Reagan and Bush respectively
assured Libyans and Iraqis that Washington had no argument with
them personally.
</P>
<P>
   It was an acknowledgement of the lack of democracy in the Arab
world. Now, oddly, this same practice is being applied to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   We are repeatedly told how many Israelis disagree with
Netanyahu, how many American Jews dissociate themselves from the
Israeli government's policies _ as if the Netanyahu cabinet is an
Arab-style dictatorship rather than the much-trumpeted democracy
Israel always claims to be.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the West, too, may be preparing itself for another
conflict in the Middle East, one from which the Israeli people are
already absolved.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab world, the fear is simpler: that Netanyahu and his
government are trying to provoke a war that will prove Oslo is
dead, and that the Arabs will be blamed. They can be sure of the
second. &QL;

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Texas Motor Speedway fostered high speeds
and even higher praise from NASCAR Craftsman Truck and Indy Racing
League drivers yesterday in its first test since a $2 million
renovation that included a newly paved track and a reconstruction
of troubling Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   The only blemish on yesterday's events may have been the rain
that moved through the area about 7:30 p.m. and delayed qualifying
for tonight's NASCAR Craftsman Truck Pronto Auto Parts 400K race
for more than three hours and postponed the qualifying round for
tomorrow's Indy Racing League True Value 500K competition until
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so smooth out there, you lose perspective on how fast
you're going,'' said Tony Stewart, IRL series defending champion,
who turned a practice lap at 223.224 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Renovations began less than three weeks after the NASCAR Winston
Cup Texas 500 on April 5, which was marked by a major crash in Turn
1 and drivers' complaints about the transition at the exit of Turn
4 and entrance into Turn 1.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Huth, NASCAR vice president for administration, said
officials at the speedway will continue to listen as drivers come
off the track and give reviews throughout the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers complained of a bump in the racing line between
Turn 1 and Turn 2, but IRL driver Kenny Brack said those bumps
``are no problem for now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis 500 champion Eddie Cheever Jr. said the bumps ``are
there, but they are small and negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   Huth said: ``As the weekend goes on, we'll continue to keep the
lines of communication open and see if anything changes. But
everything we've heard about Turn 4 and the situation on Turn 1 is
that the problems have been solved.''
</P>
<P>
   The first endorsement for Texas Motor Speedway's newly
resurfaced Turn 4 and ``special-mixture'' asphalt came from driver
Ron Barfield, who was standing beside his crumpled pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half-hour into yesterday's NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series opening practice, Barfield and his No. 35 Ortho Chevrolet
spun going into Turn 2. But he put all the blame for the crash on
himself.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the track's fault, Barfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track was holding so well in my first few laps that I
thought it was time to open it up and go a little faster,'' he
said. ``I probably should have waited. I was a little too anxious
because the asphalt is smooth, and it's really gripping in the
banks.''
</P>
<P>
   But after their first practice session for tonight's Pronto Auto
Parts 400K, truck drivers followed Barfield in extolling the
track's new surface. Later yesterday afternoon, drivers of the
faster Indy Racing League cars, which race in tomorrow's True Value
500, also praised the track.
</P>
<P>
   It was the vote of confidence Texas Motor Speedway officials
hoped for after they completed what Vice President and General
Manager Eddie Gossage called a ``major reconstruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavement was torn out and replaced in those turns and the
8-degree banking _ part of the ``dual-banking'' concept _ was
eliminated in favor of a full 24-degree bank in each turn.
</P>
<P>
   A new drainage system was installed after water seeped through
the pavement in Turn 1 during Texas 500 qualifying on April 3,
forcing postponement of the session until the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The problems appear to be solved. It cost the speedway a
two-year headache and more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely wider, a whole other lane wider,'' IRL driver
Billy Boat said. ``I think we're going to be able to race side by
side. With the exception of a small bump in Turn 4, it is
glass-smooth. I wouldn't be surprised if we're racing three wide
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever said: ``We didn't have a problem with this place last
year. It's almost too easy now. The track is so smooth and so
clean, and it's got so much grip. ... They did a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Pronto Auto Parts 400, Mike Bliss took the pole
at 175.667 mph. Yesterday in practice, Bob Keselowski and Jay
Sauter ran faster than 177 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``New asphalt is always going to stick better, but I'm excited
about how the track felt,'' Sauter said. ``It's smooth, wide, and
the transition out of Turn 4 is great. I can't wait to race. I'd
like to go out there and go right now.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Craftsman Truck series defending champion Jack Sprague,
who pushed his truck to 176.062 mph by the second practice session,
said Texas Motor Speedway stands up to some of the more popular
tracks on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beautiful,'' he said. ``They did a great job. They did it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he is pleased about the positive response and is
hoping for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we want the drivers all to be pleased,'' he said.
``That's why we spent 2-3 million here. We are tickled the drivers
are complimentary across the board. We still want to hear what
Rusty ( Wallace) and Mark (Martin) and Dale (Earnhardt) and Jeff (
Gordon) have to say.''

 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ In Jordan and Egypt, they are predicting an explosion
by the autumn. In Lebanon, the betting is the detonation will occur
in midsummer. In Jerusalem, the Palestinians _ and a large number
of Israelis _ fear the worst on an almost hourly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian-Israeli confrontations now occur several times daily
_ with almost the same frequency as they did during the
``intifada'' uprising that preceded the now-dead Oslo agreement.
And still, incredibly, oil is being poured upon the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The latest provocation against the Arabs has been the work of
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose flirtation with Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has included a motorcade
past the proposed site of an American embassy in Jerusalem _
anathema to any peacemaker who believes that Jerusalem's future
must be decided under the terms of the Oslo agreement _ and an
insistence that Israel, and only Israel, can decide how much
occupied land should be returned to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat, according to Gingrich, is to blame for the
virtual collapse of the ``peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is news to the Europeans who are warning with
ever more desperation that the Middle East is approaching disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The EU itself is considering whether Israel should be blocked
from all future trade concessions with Europe because of its
settlements policy.
</P>
<P>
   EU diplomats were outraged to find that produce arriving in
Europe from the ever-growing Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza were being labelled ``made in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, French President Jacques Chirac has been infuriated
by Netanyahu's rejection of his offer of a ``Saviors of Peace''
conference, launched with Egyptian President Mubarak in Paris two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army have already staged a computer projection of
the violence which could soon break out on the West Bank and Gaza.
Another wicked suicide bomb by a Palestinian might provide the
Netanyahu cabinet with a reason to retake West Bank towns _ in a
search, no doubt, for ``terrorists'' _ where they would be
confronted by Arafat's armed policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Israeli ``intelligence sources'' (for which read the
Israeli army's chief of staff) have been telling the Jerusalem Post
that Arafat may have been smuggling rocket-propelled grenades _
``even missiles'' _ through a series of tunnels linking Gaza to
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   This fantasy _ all the odder since Israel itself insisted on
controlling the Palestine-Egyptian border beneath which this
subterranean burrowing has supposedly taken place _ helps to set
the stage for the battle to come.
</P>
<P>
   Even history is being rewritten with this apparent aim. When in
1996, Israeli artillerymen slaughtered 106 Lebanese refugees
sheltering in a U.N. position at Qana in southern Lebanon, they
claimed they were shooting at Hezbollah gunmen at least 600 feet
from the U.N. barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, Israel's representative at the U.N., Zvi
Cohen, claimed _ untruthfully _ that the Hezbollah had been using
the U.N. position as ``their headquarters.'' This astonishing and
mendacious statement went unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   If Cohen actually meant what he said, however, the implications
are appalling _ that Israel deliberately fired at the U.N.
compound, something it has hitherto always denied.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to the U.N. soldiers north of the Israeli
border if the expected conflict spreads to Lebanon? Israeli
officers involved in the end-of-peace computer projection in the
West Bank say that there would be massive bloodshed, with hundreds
_ perhaps thousands _ dead.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Arafat is still, according to the Israelis, not doing enough
to ``crack down on terrorism,'' even though the PLO leader has
detained at least 70 Hamas members since March 29 (the day on which
the Hamas leader Muhi al-Din al-Sharif was mysteriously killed) _
most of whom, according to Amnesty International, were cruelly
tortured by the PLO in prisons in Ramallah and Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   At least 12 men have now been murdered in Palestinian custody _
all held for questioning about ``threats to Israel's security'' _
though not a word of criticism of this appalling abuse of human
rights has come from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nor about Israel's now overt decision to hold 22 Lebanese as
hostages in return for information about the fate of missing
Israeli servicemen. Of these 22, one has now been held for 12
years.
</P>
<P>
   Originally imprisoned in the notorious Khiam jail by Israel's
proxy Lebanese militia allies, Ali Hussein Ali Ammar was then
secretly _ and illegally, under international law _ transferred to
Israel where he was sentenced to four and a half years for
``membership of an illegal organization'' and military training
inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   When he was due for release in 1991, he was put under
``administrative detention'' and Israel now admits that he and the
other 21 Lebanese are now held solely as ``bargaining chips.''
</P>
<P>
   American cowardice _ in the face of the immensely powerful
Jewish lobby in the United States _ has now produced a situation in
which Washington remains supinely silent while Netanyahu, according
to the Israeli paper Yediot Ahronot, threatens to ``burn
Washington'' should President Clinton attempt to force Israel to
accept a 13 percent withdrawal from occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the State Department and the American press go on
talking about ``putting the peace process back on track,'' the most
tired and most untruthful metaphor in recent Middle East history.
</P>
<P>
   And still American journalists refuse to explain how or why the
``peace process'' has collapsed. Indeed, only last week, Richard
Cohen was telling Washington Post readers that ``on any given day,
it looks as if a deal can be reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Could anything be further from the truth? Subconsciously,
perhaps, the world is beginning to understand the nature of the
nightmare scenario confronting the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Hitherto, it has been a habit to distance Arab populations from
their ruthless dictators when attacking Arab countries; before
bombing their cities, Presidents Reagan and Bush respectively
assured Libyans and Iraqis that Washington had no argument with
them personally.
</P>
<P>
   It was an acknowledgement of the lack of democracy in the Arab
world. Now, oddly, this same practice is being applied to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   We are repeatedly told how many Israelis disagree with
Netanyahu, how many American Jews dissociate themselves from the
Israeli government's policies _ as if the Netanyahu cabinet is an
Arab-style dictatorship rather than the much-trumpeted democracy
Israel always claims to be.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, the West, too, may be preparing itself for another
conflict in the Middle East, one from which the Israeli people are
already absolved.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab world, the fear is simpler: that Netanyahu and his
government are trying to provoke a war that will prove Oslo is
dead, and that the Arabs will be blamed. They can be sure of the
second. &QL;

TEAM CHANGE PUTS ONCE-IN-LIMBO PAUL IN SECURE SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Indy-car veteran John Paul Jr. is racing
with job security at Texas Motor Speedway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Paul has succeeded Mike Groff as driver of Jonathan Byrd's No.
10 Dallara//Aurora, beginning with tomorrow night's True Value
500k. For a driver who exited the Indianapolis 500 with his Pep
Boys Indy Racing League future in limbo, the past three days have
been like winning the lottery. In three states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big break for me, a great opportunity,'' Paul said
after practice yesterday afternoon. ``To have a home for the rest
of the year, that means a lot to me. I'm not good at change. I like
staying put.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul finished seventh in the 82nd Indy 500 on May 24, driving
for Team Pelfrey, a ride he picked up after Danny Ongais was
injured in a practice crash. Paul drove the first two races of 1998
_ and the previous two IRL seasons _ with PDM Racing. He finished
10th at Orlando, Fla., and 19th at Phoenix this year before his
stirring performance at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where he
led 39 laps. Only race-winner Eddie Cheever Jr. led more laps with
76.
</P>
<P>
   ``Team Pelfrey wanted to come here, but it was going to be for
one race,'' said Paul, a 38-year-old resident of Palm Beach, Fla.
``There's not a lot of assets there. They're still trying to become
a full-time team. I've done that for two years with PDM, and that's
a hard road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jonathan's team is not the most well-funded in the IRL, but at
least they're making all the races and they've got a spare car.
They're going to do some testing _ all the ingredients to win
races. That's what I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's team, which is sponsored by VisionAire-Bryant Heating &AMP;
Cooling, is one of the IRL's originals. But it has been
overshadowed by the recent successes enjoyed by Team Menard,
Treadway Racing and A.J. Foyt Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best equipment, the best crew, the best
engineering available,'' Byrd said. ``There's no reason for us not
to score well.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said Paul's performance at Indy was not the sole reason he
got the job. At age 22, Paul became the youngest champion in the
history of the International Motor Sports Association GT series in
1982 _ the year he also won the 24 Hours of Daytona and Sebring 12
Hours endurance races. Paul also won the Championship Auto Racing
Teams' Michigan 500 in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known John Paul for a long time, and he's an exceedingly
talented race driver,'' Byrd said. ``There's just never been an
opportunity for him. I decided it was time to try something
different.''

WASHINGTON MEETING TO EXPLORE HOW TO SPUR AMERICANS TO SAVE MORE
FOR RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Consumers boycotted high-priced beef in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Odd-even gas ration lines formed at service stations across the
nation, and skyrocketing mortgage rates made young families despair
of ever owning a home.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans, on average, saved more than twice as much of
their income for the future (ital)then(end ital) as they do now.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a long period of relative prosperity, that should be a
wake-up call,'' said Bill Lyons, president and chief operating
officer of American Century Cos. Inc., parent of the American
Century mutual funds family, based in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our savings rates are lower than at any time since the end of
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a change, that means potential difficulties for the
estimated 77 million baby boomers who will reach retirement age
over the next two decades, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons and more than 200 other business and government leaders
are meeting in Washington Thursday and Friday (June 4 and 5) to
help sound that wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the Retirement Education Savings Summit, ordered
last year by Congress and the White House as part of a national
effort to spur Americans to begin saving more for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Other Midwesterners invited by White House and congressional
organizers to participate include Missouri Sen. William Clay of St.
Louis; Sheryl Davenport, president of the St. Louis teachers union;
and Mike Fitzgerald, Iowa's treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Summit participants will tackle two major tasks, U.S. Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman said in a telephone news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They will map out an aggressive public awareness campaign to
warn U.S. workers that they will need personal savings as well as
Social Security and pension income to live comfortably in
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many Americans _ particularly women, minority and low- to
moderate- income Americans _ remain unaware of the need to start
saving early,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   Summit participants also will be asked to explore ways that
businesses can reduce barriers that keep many workers from saving
more, the secretary said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials particularly want suggestions to help small businesses
provide savings opportunities for their employees. An estimated 25
million workers, mostly in businesses with fewer than 25 employees,
are not covered by pension plans of any kind other than Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those workers could be covered by plans if their
employers knew more about low-cost pension programs that are
available, Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also need to talk about practical solutions, using tools we
already have to remove barriers to saving,'' Herman said.

SPRAGUE WANTS REDEMPTION IN A BIG WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jack's back, and he has an attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it bad,'' he said. ``We want it real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A scene from The Shining? No, not that Jack.
</P>
<P>
   This little drama could be called ``The Redemption,'' and the
star is NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series driver Jack Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   The ``it'' in question is the Pronto Auto Parts 400-kilometer
race scheduled for tonight at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing personal. It's just that the 1997 event at TMS is
the scene of Sprague's worst weekend in his four seasons racing the
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague seemingly won the pole for last year's race, but was
caught with an illegal part in his engine during NASCAR's
post-qualifying inspection. He had to start from the back of the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can do about it, so we just accepted it
and went on,'' Sprague said. ``I don't build the motors, and I'm
not sure what was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He put on an incredible charge during the race, working his way
back to third, but the backup engine blew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put on a cool show, but the second one didn't last,'' he
said. ``I had to race hard to get back to the front, where I felt I
belonged. But that had nothing to do with (the engine). It was just
one of those deals.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an extremely rare deal. It is the only time in 77 starts
that Sprague failed to finish a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we had it last year, and lost the motor,'' said
the defending NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series champion and current
points leader. ``We were on a mission there, and it was looking
good; it just didn't last long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jack is back, and he's still on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to win this race,'' said the 33-year-old driver of
the No. 24 Team Hendrick Chevrolet. ``We felt like we had it won
last year. The track doesn't owe us anything. It's more along the
lines of we owe ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague looks like a pretty good bet to cancel the debt.
</P>
<P>
   He has seven victories on tracks of one mile or longer, the most
in series history.
</P>
<P>
   His average finish on superspeedways _ tracks of 1.5 miles or
longer _ is third if the 31st at TMS last year is disregarded
</P>
<P>
   He has finished in the top five in all seven truck races this
year, including a victory at the NAPACARD 200 in Monroe, Wash., on
May 9. His average finish this year is 3.14.
</P>
<P>
   He has nine consecutive top-five finishes going back to the
final two races last year.
</P>
<P>
   He has 19 consecutive top-10 finishes, one shy of the series
record by Ron Hornaday.
</P>
<P>
   And he is coming off one of the best rides of his career.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics show that Sprague finished fifth at the Parts
America 150 last week at Watkins Glen. What the stats don't show is
a charge reminiscent of what he did at TMS last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague started fifth, but had a flat tire on the 15th lap. By
the time he got into the pits and got out again he was back in 32nd
place.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't stay there long. He immediately began to pass trucks,
a feat that can be difficult on a road course, and eventually kept
alive the string of top-five finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive hard every lap,'' he said. ``Last week I was more
proud of the team for digging deep and giving me as many spots as
they could on pit road. We just never gave up and that's what this
team is all about. We don't ever give up. We didn't give up last
week, and we didn't give up last year when we started from the
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, was that the engine didn't blow last
week. It did last year. That's why Jack is back with something to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Texas Motor Speedway bad,'' he said.

SOME SEE LITTLE CHANGE IN 30 YEARS SINCE RFK ASSASSINATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Thirty years ago today, a bullet felled Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy at the Ambassador Hotel, the last in a chain of
assassinations that robbed many Americans of their political
idealism and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that those who were with Kennedy on that
tragic night are feeling melancholy about how little has changed
since June 5, 1968 -- from the fragmented state of race relations
to the unresolved controversy that surrounds the senator's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaders like Kennedy don't just improve things themselves.
They inspire others to take steps to make the nation better,'' said
Rosey Grier, the former Los Angeles Rams defensive lineman who was
in the room when Kennedy was shot. ``I would imagine that racial
relations would be a lot farther along the line if he lived to
become president.''
</P>
<P>
   The man known as RFK would be 72 now.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Kennedy was at the Ambassador Hotel to claim
victory in California's presidential primary. As he left through
the hotel's kitchen pantry, he passed Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian
immigrant enraged by Kennedy's support for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were fired, and Kennedy collapsed. Sirhan ran, but was
wrestled to the ground by Grier and others. Kennedy died 26 hours
later. Sirhan was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, recent events surrounding RFK's death have added
fuel to the conspiracy theorists, who are still demanding a new
government investigation into the three-decade-old crime. Today
through Sunday, the Coalition on Political Assassinations will
convene at the Continental Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles to trade its
latest theories.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, Sirhan himself insisted to a parole board that
he did not shoot the senator but was framed. His request to be
released was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the controversy, a Los Angeles jury awarded a
photographer $450,600 in 1996 on claims that his photos of the
senator's death were mysteriously destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Enyart was 15 on the night of the assassination and
contends that he was standing on a pantry table taking photographs
before, during and after the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it was a great loss,'' said Enyart, now 45, who
claims he isn't a conspiracy theorist but would like to see the
crime re-examined. ``This was to me the beginning of terrorism in
the United States. This was the first election decided with bullets
instead of ballots.''
</P>
<P>
   Enyart sued the city, claiming police confiscated his valuable
negatives, then lost or destroyed them. After years of litigation,
state authorities notified him in January 1996 that his film had
been found, misfiled in state archives.
</P>
<P>
   But a city courier lost those images, claiming someone stole
them from a rental car when he stopped to fix a flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys claimed Enyart was never in the pantry and
that he only shot one roll, capturing little more than crowd shots
-- not the image of Kennedy twisting and falling, as Enyart has
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the defense witnesses who backed Enyart's account that he
was in the hotel's pantry area snapping photos of Kennedy was Ted
Charach, a producer who wrote ``The Second Gun'' and two other
documentaries about the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Charach, who said he too was in the room when Kennedy was
killed, has made a career investigating Sirhan's claim that another
man fired the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cover-up has grown to great dimensions,'' Charach said at
a news conference Friday. ``It's gone beyond anything I ever
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirhan's attorney also continues to insist his client is a
victim of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   In a request for a new evidentiary hearing and trial for Sirhan,
Lawrence Teeter filed a petition last year with the Court of
Appeal, and now it sits before the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meanwhile, this historic crime remains unsolved,'' Teeter
said. ``Its true perpetrators have never been brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition claims police and prosecutors ignored evidence that
an armed security guard with anti-Kennedy views may have fired the
fatal shot. Teeter claims Sirhan may have been hypnotized when he
fired his own gun.
</P>
<P>
   Grier isn't on the conspiracy theory convention circuit.
Instead, the football-player-turned-reverend commemorated the
anniversary earlier this week by leading a prayer in front of the
Ambassador Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But Grier refused to join a group touring the now-closed hotel,
a somewhat surreal journey that climaxed with Los Angeles
Councilman Nate Holden speaking hopefully about racial unity in the
pantry where Kennedy was slain.
</P>
<P>
   Grier's message was anything but uplifting. ``We still have
racism, and we still have trouble relating to other folks today,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cerrell, a Los Angeles political consultant who was
working in his Ambassador Hotel-based office on June 5, 1968,
recently took his first tour of the building in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrific night,'' Cerrell said, touring the ballroom
near the pantry where Kennedy was assassinated. ``This place hasn't
changed a bit.''

BUSINESS OFFERS A PIECE OF THE PIE FOR THE ENTIRE STAFF

<P>
   EXCELSIOR SPRINGS, Mo. _ A lot of American workers go to work
knowing exactly what they're earning _ a set amount for each hour,
each week or each month. They know it. They plan on it. And they
grouse about it.
</P>
<P>
   They watch top executives get bonuses when corporate profits
soar while, barring overtime, their paychecks stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens when the rank and file are paid like CEOs? No,
not the same amount. In the same profit-based way. If the company
does well, everybody's paycheck increases. Everybody's.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sternberg is going to find out whether the concept works.
When The Elms Resort and Spa reopens this summer in Excelsior
Springs, general manager Sternberg will have every employee on an
incentive pay plan. Each month's paychecks will reflect the
strength of corporate performance the month before.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's guaranteeing base pay. But, frankly, that minimum is
likely to be below what employees could earn elsewhere in the
hospitality industry.
</P>
<P>
   In hiring interviews now under way, Sternberg has encountered _
and he pauses a long while before deciding what word to use _
puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not used to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitality industry is seasonal. In lean months, paychecks
will be smaller, though Sternberg said he wouldn't cut into the
guaranteed base pay. In profitable months, paychecks will be
larger. The vagaries will require better budgeting by all workers.
</P>
<P>
   Some applicants aren't willing to take the chance. Others are
willing to give it a try. Those are the workers Sternberg wants _
the people who will work hard to help the entire operation prosper,
not just because their own paychecks will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg prefers to think of the profit-distribution plan as an
incentive program rather than a pay program. The goal, he said, is
for all employees to come to work each day thinking about what they
can do to maximize company profits, which, of course, is done by
satisfying customers, saving operating costs and performing
productively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The naysayers say I won't be able to find people who are
interested,'' Sternberg said. ``They say the average hourly worker
wants a guaranteed base, won't understand it and won't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg is confident he'll prove the naysayers wrong. He
figures this kind of incentive plan is at the heart of
entrepreneurism, where people work hard because of financial
self-interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a private company,'' Sternberg said of Millenium
Management Co., owner of the hotel and conference center complex.
``There's no stock for employees to purchase. But we can give them
profit-sharing. If the business makes money, everybody makes money,
not just a handful of execs.''
</P>
<P>
   The exact profit-sharing formula is not set, but as of a few
weeks before the scheduled reopening in early July, Sternberg is
aiming for a monthly distribution of about 8 percent of profits.
</P>
<P>
   Profit distribution will not be entirely egalitarian. It will be
distributed to workers as fractions of their salary or wage rate.
In other words, the president's fraction is bigger than the maid's
because the president's base pay is higher.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg still thinks the front line will come out ahead of
where they would have been without profit-sharing. A year from now,
he should know.

RIVER'S EDGE PROVES ELUSIVE, YET STILL POWERFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sometimes, on an afternoon in summer, it can
be fine just to strike out aimlessly in some unfamiliar direction
and see where the road takes you.
</P>
<P>
   That's how childhood summers are recalled _ as having been
spiced with accidental pleasures. Even now, an eternity past
childhood, that was the feeling of this day.
</P>
<P>
   Our destination, more or less, was the river. Beyond that, there
was no plan.
</P>
<P>
   Once I walked the whole river bank, from the city's west end to
its far eastern limit. There were fresh beaver cuttings in the
willow and cottonwood brakes at the water's edge. And half-buried
mooring cables from the time when the Missouri was a busy highway
of settlement and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to have shown her that. But the river is harder to
get to now.
</P>
<P>
   It's been most of 30 years ago, and maybe memory is flawed. But
I think you could walk down to it almost anywhere you cared to, and
in many places could drive at least as far as the levee.
</P>
<P>
   There may be ways to do that still, but if so we couldn't find
them. Chains and gates barred every approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind,'' I said. ``It will be different when we get out
of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   So, paying no attention to the highway numbers, we proceeded
east a bit, then crossed a bridge and continued on, the river on
our right-hand side now.
</P>
<P>
   The landscapes broadened and changed. Warehouses and giant
factories gave way to rolling pastures, soft as green pillows,
mounting up from wooded valleys through which ran bright little
streams.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we were near the river, and could spy it through the
trees. Other times the road bent away from the lowland and up into
the hills.
</P>
<P>
   We passed through towns we'd never seen before, and whose names
we only half-thought we might have heard _ some of them places of
modest substance, others faint outposts of habitation that
sheltered fewer than 150 souls.
</P>
<P>
   Proud signs told the year of their establishment, only a couple
of decades short of two centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   River ports, some of them surely were _ when the river was the
westward way. Then the world rushed on, and took prosperity with
it, and left those places hardly changed.
</P>
<P>
   In one of them we saw three boys talking by the road. We stopped
to ask the way to the river, which could not have been 500 yards
from where they stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``No place to it here,'' one said. ``About five miles that
way.'' He pointed. ``You'll see a little sign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How about in the other direction?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No way there at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So that's what it's come to now. Boys growing up in a river
town, unable to get to the river without hoofing it five miles down
the road. Sam Clemens would spin like a top in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   We did find the little sign, and took the way it pointed, up
over a railroad track and across the flats to a parking place and a
ramp for launching boats.
</P>
<P>
   Three men had just put in their metal johnboat and headed
upstream.
</P>
<P>
   Only then could one appreciate the true power and swiftness of
the current. Its surface broken by little rips and whorls, the
great muscular Missouri came sliding past on its journey across and
down the continent as it has all these many thousand years.
</P>
<P>
   With their outboard engine laboring at full throttle against the
flow, the men in the boat hardly could be seen to move.
</P>
<P>
   Then the sun lay like a fat apricot atop the trees. A little
breeze came up and blew the heat away. The air between the hills
softened to blue.
</P>
<P>
   And we turned back in twilight, trying to remember the way we'd
come, filled up with the summer adventure of having done almost
nothing at all.

NEW ABORTION-RESTRICTION LAW IN KANSAS IS CHALLENGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN PETTERSON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Even before its contentious provisions could be
implemented, Kansas' new abortion-restriction law was challenged
Wednesday in the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   George Tiller, a Wichita abortion provider, and his Women's
Health Care Services filed the lawsuit. Tiller wants the new law,
which becomes effective July 1, to be put on hold to give the
justices time to decide its fate.
</P>
<P>
   Those on both sides of the abortion issue have raised questions
about the wording of the hastily written bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves signed the measure but later said it might take
a court challenge to clarify it.
</P>
<P>
   Graves, who ran for office four years ago as a supporter of
existing law, drew fire from abortion-rights activists after he
signed the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hopeful the court will give us what the Kansas
Legislature and the governor could not: clarity for physicians
providing abortion services and justice for women seeking
services,'' said Peggy Bowman, a spokeswoman for Tiller and an
official in the Kansas ProChoice Action League.
</P>
<P>
   Tiller's lawsuit contends that the new law is vague, has
unconstitutional reporting requirements providing for sanctions
against physicians and medical care facilities, ``and places
unconstitutional limits on a woman's right to an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Gittrich, a spokesman for Kansans for Life, said the
organization would file briefs in support of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill hurts his business, and now he's challenging it,''
Gittrich said of Tiller. ``It goes to show that he has been
aborting babies that can live outside the womb, and that comprises
a considerable amount of his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiller, in urging the court to hear the case, said it should
take the action now because if the case is filed in a lower court,
appeals eventually will bring it before the justices anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to decide before the end of the month
whether to hear the case, dismiss it or send it to a district
court.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the filing came as no surprise to Planned Parenthood of
Mid-Missouri and Eastern Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was coming,'' said Erika Fox, vice president for
public policy. ``We fully support this challenge and the effort to
clarify what we consider to be an ill-conceived law.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the lawsuit appeared to address the questions of
vagueness and constitutionality ``that have concerned many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibits abortions of viable fetuses after 22 weeks'
gestation, including those with severe, life-threatening
abnormalities and deformities.
</P>
<P>
   The provision of the act that has generated the most public
debate allows a post-viability abortion to be performed if
``continuation of the pregnancy will cause a substantial and
irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether ``mental health'' should be included as a
major bodily function, as Graves said he believed the law intended.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the law includes the mental-health exception, while
another is silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Petitioners face the problem of `guessing' which
interpretation will be applied,'' Tiller said in his lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The new law also requires detailed reporting of abortions to the
Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Tiller argued that
such a requirement could violate the self-incrimination provisions
of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   That could occur, the lawsuit said, if he performed abortions he
believed to be legal and completed reports on them, and then they
were ruled illegal and he was prosecuted. The records could be used
against him.
</P>
<P>
   In another area, Tiller said the law was so restrictive in cases
of medical emergency that a doctor could not act quickly to perform
an abortion when the fetus was viable if the woman's life was in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit does not challenge a portion of the law that bans a
procedure often referred to as partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Gittrich argued that the bill took steps toward reducing the
number of late-term abortions performed on Kansas women as well as
those who traveled to the state specifically for the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas may be known all over the world as great agriculture
and airplane centers, but it shouldn't be known as an abortion
center,'' he said.

METS DEAL WITH DODGERS TO GET NOMO 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two weeks after the New York Mets acquired Mike
Piazza from the Los Angeles Dodgers, they reunited him on Thursday
night with one of the pitchers he caught every five days, Hideo
Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after they designated Nomo for assignment following
his request to be traded, the Dodgers shipped the Japanese
right-hander to the Mets along with reliever Brad Clontz. The Mets
sent the Dodgers Dave Mlicki, their No. 5 starting pitcher, and
reliever Greg McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, who had a 2-7 record and a 5.05 earned run average in 12
starts this season, had hoped he would be traded to the Mets.
According to a person familiar with the development, the pitcher's
agent, Don Nomura, told the Dodgers that if they did not traded
Nomo to the Mets, he would go home to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides rejoining Piazza, Nomo becomes a teammate of his best
friend, Masato Yoshii, another of the Mets' starting pitchers. They
will make the Mets the first team in major league history with two
Japanese starting pitchers, and New York will have three, including
the Yankees' Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have had good starting pitching this season, but Mlicki
was the weak link with a 1-4 record and 5.68 era.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, the National League rookie of the year in 1995, has never
duplicated that season's performance of 13-6 and 2.54 era. His
record has slipped in each succeeding season, reaching 14-12 and
4.25 last season. He has maintained his strikeout total, but the
ratio of strikeouts per inning has slipped.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of Fred Claire, the Dodgers' general manager, to
designated Nomo for assignment _ that meant the Dodgers had to move
him within 10 days _ was a shocking development, apparently even to
Nomo and Nomura, who thought the Dodgers would just proceed with an
attempt to trade the 29-year-old native of Osaka.
</P>
<P>
   Claire, however, explained that he took that step because he did
not want Nomo pitching for the Dodgers once he publicly declared
his desire to be traded. Nomo had planned to disclose that desire
at a news conference last Monday, but at that session, Claire
announced his action.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the 30 major league teams called Claire to
inquire about a possible trade, but apparently only a handful
seriously pursued Nomo. The Baltimore Orioles were interested, but
the Dodgers wanted a starting pitcher in return and the Orioles did
not have one to give them. Cleveland was another team that was said
to have tried to make a deal with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets willingly included Mlicki in the package, but they did
not want to part with McMichael; they would have preferred
including John Hudek or Turk Wendell. But the Dodgers wanted a
reliever of the caliber of McMichael, and the Mets relented because
they wanted Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher has other connections to the Mets besides Piazza and
Yoshii. Dave Wallace, who is a senior adviser to General Manager
Steve Phillips, had been the Dodgers' pitching coach. In addition,
Manager Bobby Valentine managed in Japan, though that was in 1995,
the year after Nomo's last as a pitcher in Japan.

HOLLANDSWORTH MAY BE OUT FOR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just when it appeared Todd Hollandsworth had
regained the form that helped him be the 1996 National League
Rookie of the Year, he learned Thursday he could miss the rest of
the season with torn cartilage in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, who batted .410 (16 for 39) during a recent
nine-game hitting streak, underwent an MRI Thursday at Centinela
Hospital Medical Center that revealed a cartilage tear in the front
of the shoulder. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list and will
have surgery next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Taking Hollandsworth's place on the roster is Triple-A infielder
Alex Cora, brother of Seattle second baseman Joey Cora. The Los
Angeles Dodgers will use a platoon of Jim Eisenreich and rookie
Paul Konerko in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is discouraging; this is the hardest thing I've ever had to
deal with in my professional career,'' said Hollandsworth, who was
batting .269 (47 for 175) with three homers and 20 RBI. ``It is
something I just have to push through.''
</P>
<P>
   He first injured the shoulder diving back into first base two
weeks ago when the Dodgers were in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, 24, has been plagued by injuries his entire
career. In 1995, he was limited to 41 games because of a broken
left hand that required surgery and a fractured right thumb. He
recovered to hit .291 with 12 homers and 21 stolen bases in 1996
when the Dodgers won the NL West and he became the fifth straight
Dodgers player to be named Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Hollandsworth went on the disabled list twice and
never recovered his stoke. He batted .247 with just 31 RBI in 106
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd was playing very well and had really gotten back in a
groove,'' Dodgers executive vice president Fred Claire said. ``He
thought he could play through this, but it is serious. He could
miss the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Radinsky gets the win: Closer Scott Radinsky, who blew two saves
over the weekend, pitched the ninth inning to earn the victory. He
got a save Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are seeing that his confidence has been
restored,'' said pitching coach Goose Gregson, who sat with
Radinsky in the Dodgers dugout for more than an hour after Sunday's
loss. ``This is a quality pitcher. Everyone goes through slumps.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire misses series: Mark McGwire, the major-league home run
leader (27) who did not play against the Dodgers, is hopeful he
will be ready tonight when the Cardinals face the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who strained his lower back Monday in San Diego,
jogged, stretched and played catch before the game but did not take
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why everybody is concerned about it,'' McGwire
said after Thursday's game. ``There isn't an athlete in America
that hasn't been injured.''

PLAN WOULD TURN L.A. INTO 15 `QUASI-CITIES'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Calling for ``revolutionary'' change, reform
movement co-founder David Fleming proposed the creation of 15
``quasi-cities'' throughout Los Angeles, each with elected mayors
and councils, each with broad powers over local budget, services
and planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do is push power down,'' said Fleming, an
attorney in suburban Studio City and a prominent San Fernando
Valley civic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, who last year co-sponsored with Mayor Richard Riordan
the measure that created an elected Charter Reform Commission and
recently helped fund a poll on Valley secession, warned that
failure to take dramatic action could lead to the breakup of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   His charter proposal, announced Thursday, would preserve Los
Angeles as a city by having each of the 15 elected district boards
send its mayor -- the City Council member under the current system
-- and several representatives to a 50-member Metropolitan Council
that would decide citywide issues such as harbor, airport,
utilities, police and fire services.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the district boards and Metropolitan Council would
serve on a part-time basis and be paid about $100 a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown metropolitan government would continue to provide
centralized police, fire, public works and other services for the
whole city, but the local districts would be free to shop from a
menu of services.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive to development, local districts would be able to
keep revenue generated by their decisions for enhancing their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, who has avoided direct comment as the elected and
appointed Charter Reform Commissions grappled and often stumbled in
different directions, chose as a forum for his proposal a major
meeting on charter reform sponsored by the Valley Industry and
Commerce Association.
</P>
<P>
   With his longtime leadership roles in the VICA, the Economic
Alliance of the Valley and numerous civic and philanthropic
organizations, Fleming long has been regarded as the unofficial
mayor of the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal was well-received by VICA and other Valley leaders
who have been debating endorsement of similar proposals, but others
outside the Valley rejected Fleming's ideas outright.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Bell, who heads the Los Angeles Business Advisors, said
downtown business leaders would actively oppose any system of local
councils with power to decide planning matters.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the group of prominent downtown corporation leaders
wants to expand the City Council from 15 to 33 or 35 members, but
opposes empowered neighborhood councils.
</P>
<P>
   George Kieffer, president of the city's appointed Charter Reform
Commission, said his panel has tentatively endorsed trying advisory
councils first since no other major city has given neighborhood
councils decision-making power.
</P>
<P>
   Kieffer said having elected, decision-making district councils
might not guarantee that business and other groups are represented
in the process. ``Right now we're not comfortable that there's a
system that can do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, however, said he would transfer significant powers to
the 15 district boards, including authority to set locations and
hours for local parks and libraries, deciding which trees to trim
and streets to repair, and regulating street vending and signs.
</P>
<P>
   Each district could contract with the metropolitan government
for local services, but they could also put tax-increase measures
on the district ballot to improve services in their area.
</P>
<P>
   ``These in effect should be quasi-cities within the city of Los
Angeles,'' Fleming said during the forum, attended by 50 business
and political leaders at the Sheraton Universal Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming's charter would contain a doctrine of regional supremacy
that would allow citywide interests to take precedence over local
ones. For instance, a district near Los Angeles International
Airport could not shut &UR;  &LR; down the facility if it conflicted with the
citywide policy.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor would serve as the arbitrator when the interests of
two districts conflict, with the mayor's decision subject to
ratification by the Metropolitan Council, which could override on a
two-thirds vote.
</P>
<P>
   Each district board could issue building permits, adopt curfews
and street vending rules, and decide local land-use and planning
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Answering concerns about anti-development neighborhood boards,
Fleming proposed the incentive of having new tax revenue generated
by development staying with the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just give them the power to say no, they will say no,''
he said. ``What you have to do is give them incentives to say yes
to expansion, to say yes to new jobs, to say yes to new business.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the economic boom in Burbank, in the San Fernando
Valley, as an example of what could happen if each of the 15
districts benefits from rising tax revenue generated by new
development.
</P>
<P>
   While the 15 districts reflect the current number of council
districts, boundaries would be reconfigured to reflect communities
and shared interests.
</P>
<P>
   VICA leaders said the plan is very similar to their proposal of
a system of elected town councils with decision-making powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his proposal is right in line with the empowered town
council idea that we've been talking about,'' said Robert Scott, a
VICA board member and city Planning Commission member.
</P>
<P>
   Added VICA leader Joyce Prager, ``We wanted an elected board, an
empowered board . . . with substantial fiscal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fleming proposal is also similar to an idea advanced by
elected Charter Reform Commission member Paula Boland. She was not
at the forum, but attorney Rob Glushon of suburban Encino, another
member of the city's elected charter panel, said he is open to
Fleming's concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it deserves thoughtful attention and dialogue,''
Glushon said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brain, co-chairman of Valley Voters Organized Toward
Empowerment, the organization pushing for a study of Valley
cityhood, said Fleming's proposal ``goes in the direction of
addressing some of the issues we have raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Brain was skeptical about whether the proposal will be accepted
either by the Charter Reform Commissions or the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``David can propose it. I'm not sure how far it will get,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Some City Council members were equally skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's provocative. It's entertaining. I don't know if it's
workable,'' said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who supports
advisory councils.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said she is concerned that some
parts of the city would have more development, new tax money and
better services than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be unconstitutional,'' Goldberg said. ``You
would have the problem of having tremendous potential for some
areas of the city becoming destitute, `have-not' areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said his proposal would require that all areas of the
city retain, at a minimum, their current levels of services and
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody should get hurt by what we do with charter reform,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg favors local councils with decision-making power on
land-use issues and access to a small pot of money, about $250,000,
to spend on local priorities.
</P>
<P>
   She also challenged any comparison between Los Angeles and
suburban cities like Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those smaller cities have the ability to `zone out' most of
the people who are poor, most of the people who are blue-collar,
and they do,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles cannot afford, for instance, to do what she said
Torrance does, which is to turn down federal funds for low-income
housing.
</P>
<P>
   She also predicted it would also be hard to get voter approval
of expanding the City Council to 50 members.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said his proposal provides for part-time members of the
district boards and Metropolitan Council, who might at most receive
a $100-per-meeting stipend, except for the district mayors.
</P>
<P>
   The first mayor of each district would be the City Council
member who represents the district in 2001, when the new charter
would take effect. They would be paid the same $107,390 a year they
now earn as City Council members and would retain their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Each five- to seven-member district board would meet once a
week. Each would send its mayor and a few board members to the
Metropolitan Council, which might meet three or four times a month.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Los Angeles would remain the city's chief
administrator, with expanded power over policy, and hiring and
firing department heads.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said the new system of government should begin July 1,
2001, when the current mayor and half of the City Council will be
term-limited out of office. He plans to formally present the plan
to Riordan and both Charter Reform Commissions soon.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan has proposed creation of a system of advisory
neighborhood councils, selected at local caucuses, with some power
over a portion of the city budget.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Kelly Martin, a forum panel participant, said
Riordan is open to other ideas, including Fleming's. ``I think it's
very intriguing,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said, ``It seems to me this kind of devolution is what
Los Angeles needs.''

RETRAINING IS ORDERED FOR AIR CONTROLLERS AFTER NEAR COLLISION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page)  (sw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A near-collision by two big passenger jets at La
Guardia Airport in New York in April has prompted the Federal
Aviation Administration to order retraining for the 10,000 air
traffic controllers working in airport towers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   A US Airways DC-9 arriving at La Guardia on April 3 flew under a
departing Air Canada A-320, the two planes missing each other by as
little as 20 feet, according to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The near-collision had not been previously disclosed, in part
because information about it was not forwarded properly for
investigation and agency officials therefore did not learn about it
until several weeks later, the FAA said. Agency officials said a
controller at the La Guardia air traffic tower had promptly
informed his supervisor, but the supervisor did not properly report
it to his superiors.
</P>
<P>
   The US Airways pilot did report the incident after he returned
to his base in Pittsburgh, but that report, too, was mishandled,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Brenner, the chief spokesman for the FAA, said on Thursday
night that ``for reasons we don't know, people in Pittsburgh
thought this was a carbon of what was expected to have been filed
at La Guardia,'' and that FAA officials in Pittsburgh had not
passed the report on to headquarters either.
</P>
<P>
   The retraining that has been ordered takes about two hours and
is to be completed for all 10,000 air traffic controllers by June
30. It covers ``all the procedures dealing with approach and
landing and departure issues,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said that his office had received inquiries about the
incident in early April from The New York Times, The Washington
Post and CBS News. But after checking records and finding no
mention of a near-collision or a so-called operational error _ when
a controller's mistake puts two planes in close proximity _ he told
those organizations that there had been no problem. News of the
retraining was first reported in Friday morning's editions of The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said on Thursday night that the incident occurred about
9:30 a.m. on April 3, when the winds were low and La Guardia was
using two intersecting runways. The Air Canada flight was departing
to the northwest and the US Airways flight was approaching on a
southwest heading.
</P>
<P>
   When the US Airways plane was at an altitude of about 200 feet
and about half a mile from the end of the runway, a controller gave
that plane an order to ``go around,'' or abort its approach. The
plane was less than a mile from where the two runways intersect.
</P>
<P>
   The crew complied, but not before flying under the departing Air
Canada jet. The aircraft were both traveling at more than 100 miles
per hour.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FAA, the go-around order was proper but came
late. But the FAA still has not cited the controller who gave the
order, and has not ascribed an error to anyone else. The FAA is
continue to investigate, as is the National Transportation Safety
Board.
</P>
<P>
   The tower supervisor was removed from duty temporarily and
retrained in making reports to his superiors, Brenner said. ``It
took a long time for this one to bubble up,'' he said of the
incident, adding that all supervisors are being instructed on ``the
importance of insuring that management is aware of significant
events,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The executive vice president of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, Randy Schwitz, said that the FAA had come
to his union and said it wanted to order two hours of additional
training for all controllers in airport towers around the country.
The FAA said the reason was to reduce incidents at airports, but
the agency did not tie it to the event at La Guardia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The retraining plan does not include controllers at air route
traffic control centers, which handle mostly high-altitude,
long-distance airliners, or at the terminal radar approach
controls, which handle planes as they descend to airports or climb
away from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every tower in the country is being ordered to do this
training, with a video on runway incursions,'' Schwitz said,
referring to cases where planes collide on a runway. The rest of
the training, he said, was reviewing ``phraseology,'' or the proper
terms to use with pilots, and the rest of the air traffic rulebook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We O.K.'d it, we told them we agreed, that this was stuff that
could be done, to refresh the controllers' minds,'' he said. He
pointed out that this was in addition to the controllers' regular
annual refresher courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real unusual for them to react like they have with
this,'' he said of the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   At the FAA, Brenner said, ``We handle 180,000 takeoffs and
landings every day and we take very seriously any lapse in safety.
We investigate each one, and learn from it to make certain whatever
particular issue was involved doesn't arise again.''
</P>
<P>
   Priscille LeBlanc, a spokeswoman for Air Canada, had no specific
information about a near-collision on April 3 at La Guardia
Airport. She did recall receiving a query from a newspaper around
that time about a near-miss incident, but couldn't say for certain
whether that was the same incident.
</P>
<P>
   She said that the airline has not been investigating any major
incidents in the last few months. ``We don't consider that there
was a major incident that occurred during the time that they're
talking about,'' she said, referring to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Taylor, a spokeswoman for US Airways, said that she did
not have any information on such an incident.

HARTMAN CHILDREN ATTEND MEMORIAL SERVICE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The two young children of Phil and Brynn Hartman
joined relatives at a private memorial service for the
actor-comedian and his wife, a week after she killed him and then
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong eulogy Thursday in a stone cemetery chapel at
Forest Lawn Memorial Park in suburban Glendale drew more than 20
family members and their spouses, as news helicopters hovered above
and reporters stood outside the cemetery gates.
</P>
<P>
   A few paparazzi tried to storm the hilltop Church of the
Recessional but were turned back by security personnel, said family
spokesman Stan Rosenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield would not disclose details about Thursday's service,
including the eulogies. A public memorial is being planned, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman and his wife have been cremated, in accordance with
their wills, which directed that the 49-year-old comic's ashes be
scattered at Emerald Bay off Catalina Island, Rosenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Birgen Anika Hartman, 6, and Sean Edward Hartman, 9, will be
cared for by Brynn Hartman's sister, Katherine K. Wright of Eau
Claire, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield said he hopes that by Monday he will announce the
charities that relatives have selected to receive donations on
behalf of the Hartmans.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, celebrities and friends of Phil Hartman
attended a memorial service at The Groundlings, the Melrose Avenue
improv company that Hartman belonged to from 1975 to 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Others at The Groundlings included ``Saturday Night Live'' guru
Lorne Michaels, Steve Martin and Paul Reubens, a former Groundling
who co-wrote ``Pee Wee's Big Adventure'' with Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Los Angeles police released a tape of the 911
call that led them to the couple's home in suburban Encino on May
28. The caller, Ron Douglas of nearby Studio City, told dispatchers
that Brynn Hartman, a longtime friend, had come to his home
sometime after 3 a.m. and confessed to shooting her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Initially disbelieving her, Douglas followed her back to the
Hartmans' home, where he saw Phil Hartman's body and called police.
Douglas was taking one of the couple's children from the house when
Brynn Hartman, 40, locked herself in the master bedroom and shot
herself.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, she did not tell Douglas why she killed her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Hartmans said the marriage was troubled by both
the comedian's inability to communicate with his wife and her bouts
with drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Police found no illegal drugs in the house after the
murder-suicide, but coroner's investigators plan to do further
toxicological tests, the results of which will not be available for
at least a week.

DODGERS WIN AMID MADNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The circus left town Thursday night, but not
before a huge finale under the Dodgers big top.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched around an exciting 3-2 victory over the St. Louis
Cardinals, the Los Angeles Dodgers traded Hideo Nomo to the New
York Mets and learned that they might have lost left-fielder Todd
Hollandsworth for the rest of the season with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   And now they head to Seattle, ground zero for the failed Randy
Johnson trade, where they open a three-game interleague series
tonight with the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the distractions don't seem so distracting now that we are
winning again,'' said Raul Mondesi, whose two-out single in the
sixth inning gave the Dodgers their first run. ``Seattle could have
been a messy place to go. But we feel pretty good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   They feel pretty good winning for the second consecutive night
after dropping four in a row. They feel better about seeing Chan Ho
Park regain his confidence by pitching seven strong innings on a
night he didn't have his best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, they got clutch hitting from Charles Johnson,
who won it in the ninth with a two-out single after Eric Karros
tied it in the eighth with his sixth RBI in two games.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lot for a team that already was having a bizarre week.
</P>
<P>
   They finally unloaded Nomo, who had demanded to be traded. The
Dodgers receive two pitchers: hard throwing starter Dave Mlicki,
who will join the team in Seattle and could start in that series,
and reliever Greg McMichael. The Dodgers also gave up reliever Brad
Clontz, who was pitching at Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the club learned that Hollandsworth, who was
hitting well for the first time since winning the 1996 Rookie of
the Year Award, had torn cartilage in his left shoulder and will
undergo surgery Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But for the players, the game was the thing. And for Johnson, it
was particularly gratifying. He got Park through a long outing and
continued his hot hitting. Johnson is 10 for 23 with three homers
in a six-game hitting streak that started after an 0 for 35
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad that we were able to win the ballgame and I was
able to contribute,'' said Johnson, who singled off Jeff Brantley
(0-2) to score Jim Eisenreich.
</P>
<P>
   The victory went to Scott Radinsky (2-2), who has a win and a
save after blowing two save opportunities over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps Karros, who was in the cleanup spot again, best
symbolized the Dodgers the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   He was coming off a five-RBI game Wednesday night, but he was
booed when he had trouble running out a sixth-inning grounder
because of his chronically sore left knee. Later, when a foul pop
landed near him, Karros couldn't dive because of the knee that
forced him to miss 22 games to begin the season.
</P>
<P>
   Karros might be the Dodgers player most looking forward to
Seattle. He will be the Dodgers designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days are better than others,'' Karros said. ``Hitting
wise, it's not that bad. Running wise, it's not where I want to be.
I know I have to pick my spots and not play everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Park goes every fifth day, but few of them have been pleasant
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he pitched well last Friday, the Dodgers bullpen blew
the lead in the ninth and lost the game in the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Park threw 130 pitches because he knew the relievers
needed relief.
</P>
<P>
   He did not have his good fastball. But when he started to retire
Cardinals hitters without it, his confidence soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great feeling,'' Park said. ``In the last few
starts I have lost confidence when I could not get out of jams.
Tonight was a good sign for me.''

NFL STAR ELWAY'S HIGH SCHOOL RENAMES STADIUM AFTER HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC MOSES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- When John Elway walked the halls of Granada Hills
High School in the late 1970s, he was a big man on campus --
leading the baseball team to back-to-back city championships and
the football team to the city playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he was the biggest man on campus.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Denver Broncos quarterback and Super Bowl
champion returned to suburban Granada Hills to join 3,500 fans for
the renaming of the football field as John Elway Stadium. It had
been named after founding Principal Bryce Schurr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has dreams,'' Elway told the crowd. ``But you know
when I was playing back here in '77, '78, '79, this was something I
never even thought of. Even last year this is something I never
thought of.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly a treat for me to be here and to have the
stadium named after me.''
</P>
<P>
   For Elway, who traveled from his home in Engelwood, Colo., with
his 8-year-old son, Jack, this marked a rare appearance at his alma
mater.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted by more than four dozen former teammates,
teachers and coaches, and of course, his fans.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, the quarterback was mobbed by students and
fans in orange-and-blue Bronco jerseys. He was given flowers, and
after he kissed a woman's cheek, she wandered through the throng
with her hands on her cheeks, screaming: ``Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
He kissed me! Oh, my God!''
</P>
<P>
   Granada Hills students were impressed but not obsessed with the
1979 graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty cool,'' said Jen Dallis, an 18-year-old
senior who was assigned to work with the media. ``I think it's a
bigger deal than everybody's making it out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, Elway announced that he would play one more
season in the National Football League before calling it quits. On
Thursday, his return to the stadium where it all began elicited
memories of his high school victories -- one in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was against San Fernando, and I threw a touchdown pass to
Chris Sutton to go ahead with 20 seconds left or something like
that,'' Elway recalled. ``But it got called back because of
holding, and we called a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the sidelines and Coach (Jack) Neumeier said, `Same
play.' And we went back and Chris made a great catch again, and
that was really kind of the first comeback I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   The renaming of the stadium was engineered by Elway's high
school teammate Chris Sutton, coach Darryl Stroh and Principal
Kathleen Rattay. And it did not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of keeping Schurr's name argued that giving the honor
to Elway emphasizes athletics over academics.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise, Schurr's name was placed on the athletic
complex, including all sports fields. A dedication ceremony is
scheduled for Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Irwin, the school's principal from 1976-86, who signed
Elway's diploma, acknowledged there was a lot of controversy over
the name change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's recognition of one graduate that's symbolic of the many
students that have come out of here and gone on to other things,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former teammates and current coaches also say Elway deserves the
honor. His name on the new $8,000 scoreboard, donated by an
anonymous former high school teammate of Elway's, will help
motivate future Highlander players, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it reinforces the idea of having goals for the
future,'' said current Highlander co-coach Tom Harp. ``He went to
the Super Bowl and won it. He kept trying after losing it a few
times.''
</P>
<P>
   In talking to the students, Elway espoused those ideals, telling
them to set goals just above their reach and get an education so
they will be prepared for future opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got different talents,'' he said, ``and somebody
is going to be better at something than somebody else. But what
you're good at, be the best at.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Elway's accomplishments: four trips to the Super Bowl, 33
last-minute, game-winning drives, the 1993 American Football
Conference's Most Valuable Player award and seven Pro Bowl
selections.
</P>
<P>
   That and more have earned him cult status among his fans, but
that was nowhere more apparent than in Denver, where two TV
stations carried the 50-minute ceremony live.
</P>
<P>
   Others hope playing on the newly named field will help the team
improve its record: three wins in three years.

   ``It pumps us up,'' said Robert Baca, a freshman quarterback and
wide receiver. ``I can't wait to play next year. We're the first
players to play on it.''

SABERHAGEN DISPLAYS SURGICAL PRECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There may have still been a few holdouts despite what
they saw on television last weekend in New York, but no more.
</P>
<P>
   The Bret Saberhagen bandwagon is back at capacity after the Red
Sox righthander, in his longest start since 1995, went seven
innings in a 9-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles before 33,104 fans
Thursday night in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were struggling, I was a big part of why we were
struggling,'' said Saberhagen, who has rebounded from three
horrific starts with two straight wins to raise his total to a
staff-best seven, one more than Friday night's starter, Pedro
Martinez. ``But don't get discouraged with me when I go into a
slump. You've got to remember, I've had the last two years off.''
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd included Cardinal Bernard Law, who is said to
have a passing acquaintance with miracles, and Saberhagen's former
New York teammate John Franco and a couple of his playmates,
including newcomer Mike Piazza, who will be in uniform for the Mets
in their first visit to Fenway Park since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   FYI: The Steamer, Bob Stanley, has not been invited back to
throw out Friday night's ceremonial first pitch. The Sox did not
want to renew the debate on whether it would be a wild pitch or
passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice that Johnny would come to watch the game,'' Saberhagen
said of Franco's presence. ``He called this morning and asked for
tickets, and I said, `You got it.' They sat up in the NESN box. I
saw him up there in the second inning and tried to point at him,
but he was looking at Fenway, checking everything out.''
</P>
<P>
   For most ballplayers, the ballpark is the last place they'd want
to spend an off day. Saberhagen figures Franco stuck around for no
more than five innings, which in the past would have assured the
Mets closer of missing at most an inning of his friend's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But not Thursday night, as Saberhagen went seven innings for the
first time in 23 starts dating back to Aug. 13, 1995. Aided by two
double plays and throwing his curveball with a frequency that
surprised the Orioles, Saberhagen clearly ended the tailspin that
raised questions about the staples, paste, and paper clips holding
his surgically repaired shoulder together.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Orioles had runners in each of his innings,
Saberhagen did not allow a run until B.J. Surhoff hit a hanging
curveball over the Red Sox bullpen for a home run with one out in
the seventh. Saberhagen's best inning was the sixth, when the
Orioles had runners on the corners with no outs and he struck out
Joe Carter and retired the next two batters, Harold Baines and
Rafael Palmeiro, on easy fly balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days the pitcher gets you,'' Carter said, ``and Bret sure
got us. He still has to be reckoned with. He can hit his spots when
he has to. He's got good location on his fastball, and his curve's
pretty sharp.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen's most efficient inning was the fourth, when he gave
up a leadoff single to Carter on his first pitch and needed only
two more pitches to retire the side. Baines hit a comebacker that
Saberhagen turned into a double play, and Palmeiro flied to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice to be able to get those quick innings,'' Saberhagen said.
``I don't know how many bullets I have in my arm from night to
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had been shut out the night before by Doug Johns, an
itinerant pitcher who began the previous spring touring cheese
factories while playing in Parma, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night against a 22-year-old righthander from Aruba,
Sidney Ponson, the Red Sox finally took advantage of an Orioles
pitching staff that has three starters occupying the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Every batter in the Boston lineup reached base at least once
against Ponson and three relievers, with Darren Lewis breaking the
game open in the sixth by wrapping a two-run homer around the Pesky
Pole, making it 5-0. Lewis now has three home runs, two that have
curled into the right-field grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn had his first three-hit game since May 8, while Mike
Benjamin, who will be alternating with Lou Merloni at second base,
had two singles, scored three runs, drove in two, and made two
terrific defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll probably have to ask me on a daily basis,'' Williams
said when asked how he will deploy Merloni and Benjamin. ``Both
have contributed. Both deserve to play. I'll try to keep them both
sharp so they can both help us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who begin a week's worth of interleague play with a
three-game set against the Mets this weekend, split a pair here
with the Orioles, whom they won't see again until right after the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   In their first extended stretch against their chief rivals in
the American League East _ the Yankees, Blue Jays, and Orioles _
the Red Sox went 6-7, including five wins in their last six games.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those wins belong to Saberhagen, which led to this bit of
Jimywocky from Williams. Asked if Saberhagen had exceeded his
wild-est dreams, the manager said, ``I never have wild dreams at
the ballpark.''

12-YEAR-OLD SCHOLAR VENTS ANGUISH OVER LOSING DAD TO SMOKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Debbie Weiss sat on the edge of her son Brian's
bed, watching him take out his anger and hurt on the keyboard of
his computer.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to walk over and hug him, cry with him. Instead, she
let him be, let him write it from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The woman from the hospice had left the house only minutes
earlier. It would be a few more days, a week tops, she had told
Debbie and Brian.
</P>
<P>
   A week tops for 51-year-old Rick Weiss, slowly dying. And then
Debbie would be a widow, and Brian fatherless. Because of a bad
habit.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no more nights when Debbie would look into the
den and see her husband and son on the couch together, watching one
of those science or nature shows they loved so much on the cable
channels. No bringing them dinner while they sat in front of the
computer working out some difficult science and math problems
together.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't much for sports, this father and son, but they
bonded solidly in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're intellectually connected,'' Debbie would always tell
friends when they came over and saw Rick and Brian off together
again in their own private world of mind games.
</P>
<P>
   And now, when her husband should be here sharing the proudest
moment of his son's academic life -- reveling with Brian in the six
medals he won individually and with his Fairmont Private School
teammates in the Orange County Academic Pentathlon -- Rick was
instead lying in a hospice, dying.
</P>
<P>
   And a 12-year-old boy wasn't able to share a joyful hug with the
father who led him down this academic road to victory.Instead, the
boy was up in his room venting his anger and hurt -- writing a
letter to tobacco manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   All because of a bad habit.
</P>
<P>
   It took Brian five minutes, his mother says -- five minutes in
front of the computer in his room to bang out this letter to the
people he felt were responsible for killing his father: the tobacco
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago my father smoked a cigarette,'' the kid
began. ``He became addicted and smoked constantly. When I was born,
he quit. All was well for 11 years. On April 26, 1997, he had a
seizure. At the hospital, we found out that he had brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We searched for the cause, and it was lung cancer. Cigarettes
caused that lung cancer. We have suffered horribly for a year, and
now we found out that he is going to die. He knows it, too, and
that is suffering at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is confused, not talking correctly, and suffering. My
father's life has been cut short, all because of cigarettes. They
kill people, and that is why I ask how you can let people kill
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are dying because of your product. There must be an end
to this suffering and death. That is why I calmly ask you to stop
this menace. Stop making cigarettes. Stop killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian Weiss (12).''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie sat by her husband's bed in the hospice a couple of
nights before he died, holding the letter her son had written to
the tobacco manufacturers. She wanted Rick to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want me to read it to you, honey?'' Debbie asked.
</P>
<P>
   Rick closed his eyes and shook his head. ``No,'' he finally
muttered.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody but Rick could say for sure what was going through his
mind at that moment, but most fathers could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   He was too upset and angry at himself to listen to his son's
letter. He was leaving behind a wife and a son he loved very much
because of a bad habit. How tragically stupid he had been.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie held her husband's hand and told him it was OK. She
understood. She said Brian had decided not to go ahead and mail the
letter to tobacco manufacturers because they probably would just
throw it in the trash can anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Brian had come up with a better plan. With his rabbi's blessing,
he was using the letter as his act of good deed for his bar mitzvah
next year -- using it to gather signatures for a anti-smoking
petition to send to tobacco manufacturers and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old boy going out and spreading the word to anyone who
will listen about how it is to lose a father you love very much to
a bad habit that kills.

OROSCO HAS SEEN IT ALL, BUT HAS FRESH OUTLOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He is the fourth-oldest Oriole ever, behind Rick
Dempsey, Dizzy Trout, and Dave Philley. He stands seventh all-time
with 979 games pitched and is taking a run at the No. 6 man, Lindy
McDaniel, at 987.
</P>
<P>
   Add the two World Series rings with the New York Mets and Los
Angeles Dodgers and you'd think Baltimore reliever Jesse Orosco,
who turned 41 April 21 and is in his 21st professional season _ 18
in the majors _ would look back on his career and point to the
championships and the personal statistics as his crowning
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   But Orosco, who saved Game 7 of the 1986 World Series against
the Red Sox for the Mets, figures he's probably set a different
kind of rec-ord.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my professional seasons,'' he said before Thursday
night's game at Fenway Park, ``I've never been on the disabled
list. Knock on wood, I've been fortunate. I try real hard in the
offseason to stay in shape and I run every day to keep my body
going and my arm in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've also got to have good work habits, good mechanics to
keep your arm sound. When I first broke into the majors, I had
hoped to play a long time, but I never imagined this long.''
</P>
<P>
   Orosco, who had a career-high 71 appearances with the Orioles
last season and whose 975 relief appearances for five teams rank
fourth in major league history, is still going strong, physically
and mentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still love coming out of the bullpen,'' he said. ``I love
the competition. It's not every day you can wake up and say, `Well,
I might be facing Ken Griffey or Mark McGwire today.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, I've learned how to mix my pitches. Watching a
lot of baseball also helps, and I've watched a lot of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   For nine National League seasons, Orosco, despite his mechanics,
his ``book'' on hitters, and his natural skills, had a terrible
time facing slugger Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed that he got hit after hit after hit on me,'' Orosco
said. ``We were pretty good friends, and I used to ask him, `Chili,
what are you doing to me?' And he'd say, `I don't know, Jess, it's
just one of those things.'''
</P>
<P>
   A California native, Orosco lives in San Diego with his wife,
Leticia, and three children. ``That's the tough part, missing the
heck out of my family,'' he said, ``and that's the hard-est part of
playing 21 years. It makes me think about how much longer I want to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Orosco said that when he retires as a player, ``I'll definitely
take a year off before deciding what to do. If I stay in baseball,
I'd like to stay around the San Diego area and perhaps do something
with baseball camps or at the college level. But I just want to cut
out the traveling.''
</P>
<P>
   But that day hasn't quite come, and there's a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly believe that I'm throwing harder now than 20 years
ago,'' said Orosco. ``And not having serious arm problems has
helped. I'm also glad I took the advice of George Bamberger years
ago when he told me to develop strong wrists that would enable me
to throw a good breaking ball. Developing the breaking ball did a
lot for my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he's witnessed many changes over 21 seasons, said Orosco,
one thing remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American League games take forever,'' he sighed. ``The
National League games don't take very long at all.''

LEWIS TAKING IT FROM THE TOP AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He was a career .247 hitter who signed on last December
with his fifth major league team since the 1995 season. But Red Sox
outfielder Darren Lewis, who went 3 for 5 with a home run in
Thursday night's 9-1 thrashing of the Orioles at Fenway Park, is
not only batting .300, he's rediscovered his old San Francisco
Giants niche as a leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed into service at the top of the order by Jimy Williams
when Nomar Garciaparra went down with a shoulder injury in early
May, Lewis has batted leadoff in 23 of Boston's last 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had my struggles the last couple of years,'' said Lewis,
whose third home run of 1998 was the second this season that he's
wrapped with an inside-out swing around Pesky's Pole in right
field. ``But the key for me has been to work through that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been nice being on this team is that there's no
pressure for me to be an offensive force because we have such a
great offensive club. But at the same time,'' added the 30-year-old
former Gold Glove winner who holds the major league record for
consecutive errorless games (392) by a non-pitcher, ``I'm a little
older and a little smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to do my little part. I was a leadoff hitter
my first 3 1/2 years in the big leagues. You have to learn when to
take pitches, but also when to be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Williams and Lewis were part of the dramatic 1993 pennant
race in the National League West when the Braves, for whom Williams
was a coach, won their 104th game on the last day of the regular
season. The Giants, who won 103 games that season, the last before
the wild card, were beaten by the Dodgers in their final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darren's allowed us to spread that lineup,'' said Williams,
``and it's helped a lot. He understands his job as a leadoff
hitter, to see how many runs he can score in the course of the
season. I saw him when he first came up (with the Giants) when he
and Royce Clayton were at the top of that order.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1993, those two guys set the table for the (Barry) Bondses
and the (Matt) Williamses and those other guys. He's acclimated to
hitting at the top of the order, so it's not unusual for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who set a personal season high Thursday night with six
total bases and tied his season highs with three hits and three
RBIs, would like nothing better than to get another taste of
postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   He came heartbreakingly close as a key man with the Giants in
'93 and was a backup outfielder with the Reds in 1995 when they
were eliminated in the National League Championship Series by the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1993 season was the year the wild card was made for, and I
can't really describe that disappointment of losing out by one
game,'' he said. ``That's in the back of my mind every day. We had
the best all-around team I've ever played on, and to go home after
that kind of season was very hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who said his opposite-field stroke is ``tailor-made'' for
Fenway, may be on track for consideration for Comeback Player of
the Year honors, but he quickly dismissed that subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' he said. ``The way I've always approached the game
is that individual awards are secondary. What I would love is an
opportunity to get back in a playoff setting.''
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, Lewis has certainly helped the Red Sox make
a run at the postseason with his well-documented outfield defense
and his offensive presence. But, he said, ``even though we're
playing good baseball, I'm not too excited yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long year. Guys have to stay healthy and things have to
continue to go right. There are so many different ingredients that
go into a successful season.''
</P>
<P>
   Like an experienced leadoff hitter with some newfound pop in his
bat.

JUNEAU LIFTS CAPITALS INTO CUP FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Joe Juneau, pilot, aeronautical engineer, and center,
helped the Capitals fly into the Stanley Cup finals Thursday night
when he knocked home Brian Bellows's rebound at 6:24 of overtime,
leading Washington to a 3-2 victory over the Sabres in Game 6 of
the Eastern Conference finals at Marine Midland Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Juneau, the former Bruin who was traded to Washington in March
1994 for Al Iafrate, was left with an easy tap at the right post
after Bellows twice took shots at goalie Dominik Hasek _ shots that
were set up by another ex-Bruin, Adam Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam gave it to me just outside the blue line and said, `It's
all yours, B.B., take it to the net' _ he actually said that,''
recalled Bellows.``I tried to get in there the best I could, got
one shot, then another, and then I saw Joe there with the rebound.
I didn't see it go in, but I knew something good happened.''
</P>
<P>
   And so ended the Sabres' Cinderella run in the spring of '98.
Although backed by Hasek, considered the best goalie in the world,
the young Sabres ultimately could not match the Capitals' veteran
touch around the net as they lost the best-of-seven series, 4-2.
And Hasek was slightly outplayed by Olaf Kolzig, who turned back 39
shots Thursday night in leading the Caps to the finals for the
first time in their 24-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The Caps will visit the winner of the Western Conference finals
_ Dallas or Detroit _ in Game 1 Tuesday. Game 2 will be Thursday,
followed by Games 3 and 4 in Washington the following Saturday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday Washington coach Ron Wilson captured his club's
imagination by asking his players to focus on the accomplishments
of Apollo 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting the men to the moon and back,'' said Wilson, ``had to
be the greatest accomplishment of this century. The Caps had never
been to the finals, so it was like landing on the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   What his Caps would need, said Wilson, was a Neil Armstrong on
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's when Joe Juneau said, `I'll be Neil Armstrong,'''
said Wilson. ``He has his degree in aeronautical engineering and he
was kidding the guys, saying he was a rocket scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It became kind of a joke _ `Who was going to be Neil
Armstrong?''' said Juneau, referring to the atmosphere in the
dressing room before overtime. ``I said to Tim (Army, an assistant
coach) before the OT, `You're looking at Neil Armstrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   The one giant leap for the Caps came on a neutral-zone turnover
by Buffalo defenseman Darryl Shannon. Oates took possession outside
the blue line, fed Bellows, and the rest was in the hands of
Mission Control.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres appeared to have a date for Game 7 set in the third
period when Paul Kruse used one of his skates to knock in a Bob
Boughner slapper. Fighting for position down low in the slot, Kruse
couldn't have seen Boughner's steamer tick off his boot and slip
past Kolzig for the 2-1 lead. Thousands of white pom-poms in the
crowd were raised in celebration, looking like ghosts of playoffs
past for the Caps, who three times in their history lost series
after taking 3-1 leads.
</P>
<P>
   With 5:59 remaining in regulation, the persistent Caps tied it,
2-2, when Peter Bondra redirected Andrei Nikolishin's pass from the
right wing board. It turned out to be the end for the Sabres, a
plucky bunch of kids who rallied around Hasek, their Olympic
gold-medal goalie, and came within six victories of a Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tough pill to swallow,'' said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff. ``But
I'm extremely proud of our guys. Obviously, it wasn't meant to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Caps now have four days to rest their aged bones and prepare
for the finals. Too old and too tattered to get to where they're
going, they could be trooping the Stanley Cup down Pennsylvania
Avenue in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Wilson can work on his next theme, maybe
something with William Shattner or Leonard Nimoy. The Caps have
shown there is a whole universe of possibilities.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hideo Nomo got his trade Thursday night with a big
assist from former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, designated for assignment Monday after demanding the
Dodgers trade him, was sent to the New York Mets in a four-player
deal that was completed after O'Malley assured the pitcher he would
not be sent to a team against his wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The trade reunites Nomo with former pitching coach Dave Wallace
and catcher Mike Piazza. Mets starter Masato Yoshii was a former
teammate with the Kintetsu Buffaloes and New York manager Bobby
Valentine managed one season in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who also sent minor-league reliever Brad Clontz,
received pitcher Dave Mlicki and reliever Greg McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to Don Nomura (Nomo's agent) and he was thrilled,''
Dodgers executive vice president Fred Claire said. ``The New York
Mets was their No.1 preference. The deal was not made for that
reason. It was win-win for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the end of a great career for a Dodger and a great
chapter in Dodger history.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to several sources, O'Malley's personal
relationship with Nomo helped shape the deal. O'Malley stressed
Thursday in a private meeting with Japanese media the importance of
his friendship with Nomo, who O'Malley helped sign in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a close friend and he will always be a close friend,''
O'Malley said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his signing with the Dodgers, O'Malley told
Nomo's parents that ``he would treat him as if he was one of his
own sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire spent most of Thursday negotiating with four clubs
including Baltimore, Cleveland and Texas. The Angels, who had
expressed an interest in Nomo, were asked about closer Troy
Percival but said no.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, the 1995 National League Rookie of the Year, is looking to
get his career back on track after dropping to 2-7 with a 5.05 ERA
at the time he was designated. He is in the final season of a
three-year contract that is paying $2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo became frustrated when the Dodgers did not offer a contract
extension this winter. Last fall, he underwent surgery to remove
bone chips from his right elbow. He also had personality clashes
with Dodgers manager Bill Russell, but the lack of a contract
beyond this season was the leading reason for his unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   Claire was very close to completing a deal with Baltimore on
Wednesday, but O'Malley intervened after Nomo indicated he did not
want to play for the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki, who will join the Dodgers this weekend in Seattle, is
making $1.25 million in the first of a two-year contract.
McMichael, who will join the Dodgers on Monday when they open a
three-game series against Oakland, is guaranteed $1.8 million this
season with a $1.95 million option for next season. The option
becomes guaranteed if he pitches in at least 31 more games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were hoping to get left-handed reliever Brian
Bohanon, who is earning $350,000 this year. But his 2-2 record and
2.30 ERA and the ability to start and relieve made him too valuable
to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Claire said he spoke to 20 teams. One of the more intriguing
deals involved Indians closer Jose Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very good trade for us,'' Claire said. ``In Mlicki, we
get a starting pitcher with outstanding ability that we've always
liked. In McMichael we get one of the top setup pitchers in the
National League and a pitcher with the ability to close games as he
did for Atlanta a couple seasons. We've helped our pitching staff
to a great degree.''

JAZZ THRIVING AFTER EXPECTED EXPIRATION DATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Since errors occur so infrequently in this
space, the discovery of one becomes a rare nugget worthy of
examination. Strictly for the advancement of science, we bring
forth a particularly luminous one.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago this week, it was written here that the
triumph of the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals crushed
the last, best chance for the aging tandem of Karl Malone and John
Stockton to lead the Utah Jazz to an NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   In the technical jargon of basketball journalism, the
observation is known as a boink (in Seattle, a boink is also known
as a Vin Baker free throw).
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Jazz put the Chicago Bulls in a place they
haven't experienced in seven years _ behind in the Finals _ on
Wednesday night, it is apparent that I severely misread the
expiration date stamped on the side of the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But that simply balances out the error regarding the expiration
date on the Sonics' budding dynasty. You remember the rhetoric
after the '96 Finals between Chicago and Seattle, don't you?
``Powerhouse on rise;'' ``Great mix of young and old;'' ``Long
reign coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of solace in the faulty judgment comes from the fact that
the premature obituary of the Jazz was written, read and accepted
by lots of people, including the handful of folks smarter than
sportswriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange thing is, other coaches were saying it,'' Utah coach
Jerry Sloan said Thursday. ``I had to answer their questions too.
Seems like I've been talking about it for five years. Evidently
some of these guys have never played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That might be true, but the more likely cause is that few have
ever seen the likes of Stockton and Malone. We're not talking about
their floor games here; certainly, every sports fan in Seattle
knows the Malone-Stockton pick-and-roll better than they know
breakfast. Malone's big haunches have been backing down on Sonic
post men for a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that Malone and Stockton keep doing it. Again and
again and again. Malone has missed just five games out of the 1,076
in his career. Until Stockton missed this season's first 18 games
recovering from knee surgery, he had missed just four compared to
the 1,158 games he had put in.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the accolades, statistics and awards that these future
Hall of Famers have accumulated, their constancy of excellence at
the top of the NBA game is the most astonishing feat.
</P>
<P>
   A little bit is luck from lack of injuries. But the source for
this legacy is the supplementing of their physical gifts with a
work ethic that is unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Stockton, 35, and Malone, 35 next month, can be
attempting to wrest the NBA world from the Midwestern Hercules is
through a year-round dedication that is unknown to so many younger
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers to the Jazz team are regularly dumbstruck by Malone's
habits. He arrives two hours before practice to lift weights, and
after practice he spends an hour on a Stairmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton takes two weeks off after the season, then begins a
cruel regimen back home in Spokane that has him up to a five-hour
daily workout by August.
</P>
<P>
   His resting heart rate is 35 beats a minute, which is half the
rate of the average person. He and Malone have 4 percent body fat,
about what is found on world-class bike racers. Their
cardiovascular systems, lung capacities and blood pressures are far
superior to most athletes in any sport.
</P>
<P>
   Which is just another way of explaining how the Jazz outscored
the Bulls 21-6 on fast-break points in Game 1. Despite the chronic
aches that afflict joints, and some decline in skill, Stockton and
Malone are confined to mid-30s bodies only by the numbers on their
drivers' licenses.
</P>
<P>
   This defiance of age is an enormous source of pride among the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I'm the oldest on the team, I feel good about it,'' said
reserve forward Antoine Carr, 37 next month. ``Everybody says: `You
guys are too old. You can't do this, you can't do that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we do it, turn around and give 'em a little smirk.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sloan, the ethic of Stockton and Malone exacts the kind of
teammate pressure that makes coaching new players easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helps my job that John and Karl put in the kind of
hours they do to keep in shape in the offseason,'' Sloan said.
``But it's also a sad commentary on the league when something like
that is considered special.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that the Jazz's opposition in this
tournament is led by a semi-elderly group (Michael Jordan, 35,
Scottie Pippen 32, and Dennis Rodman, 37) that also has told Father
Time to drop dead. Sloan was amused that so much was made of
Jordan's apparent game-ending fatigue Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do people see how hard the guy plays?'' he said. ``Michael,
Karl and John should be tired. Why don't guys 23, 24 years old play
hard so they'd be tired? What do they get paid for? Not to be
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Cranky as ever, Sloan is also a pragmatist. He knows that
dedication comes from less than Olympian ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like to make the big money,'' Sloan said. ``That's one of
the most important things keeping guys in the game. Money will do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet what has driven them is not altogether mercenary. Jazz owner
Larry Miller told the Deseret News of a locker-room encounter with
Stockton a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw something I'd never thought I'd see,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' Stockton replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw you dog it on one play down the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Miller described the moment: ``I'm not kidding. John turned
red as a Coke can and said through clenched teeth, `I've never
dogged a play in my life.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to punch me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is never a wise decision to underestimate Stockton. Or
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is a calendar an effective instrument with which to measure
them.

LISTLESS MARINERS LOSE TO ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It does not seem possible, but the Mariners discovered
another way to lose a game Thursday night. Unbelievably, the
bullpen was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels delivered the newest blow, a 6-2 defeat, which means
the Mariners have now been swept in two straight two-game series.
It won't happen again this weekend. The Dodgers are here for three
games.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night the Angels scored the winning run on a
suicide-squeeze play, unusual enough at the major-league level,
particularly when executed flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Baughman got the bunt down, and Orlando Palmeiro raced
home untouched as starter Ken Cloude threw to first for the second
out in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Dan Wilson positioned himself outside the plate, but
Cloude fired one down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't get the ball out there,'' said Cloude, now 3-4
and a non-winner since April 24. ``I saw the guy square to bunt.
After I let the ball go, I kind of wanted to grab it back because
you know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the team's lack of fire and timely hitting, Joey
Cora said: ``We're losing, we suck, very simple.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, he sprayed on some cologne and walked away, the man
who took a called third strike to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella was equally terse. No one knows what to say
anymore because everyone has seen this picture.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the M's missing enthusiasm, Piniella said: ``Zip
comes with winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. supplied the only response during the game, a
two-run homer in the first inning. Afterward, it was clear the
center fielder is not being paid by the syllable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you win, things are a lot different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Fielder is usually spotted launching majestic home runs.
In the Angels clubhouse, he was holding a victory brew and perhaps
a few answers for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The slugger knows what the Mariners are going through. He played
for the Detroit Tigers, a high-scoring team with a pitching staff
that could not shut anyone down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offense is scoring so many runs and they're still
getting beat,'' he said. ``In Detroit it was the same way. We'd
score a touchdown and two field goals and still end up losing. It
gets you down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start pressing to score more runs. You try to get a
seven-run homer every time you're at the plate. When a guy is in
scoring position, you do too much to try to get him in. The next
thing you know, you're not scoring at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielder also believes the Mariners might be struggling because
of all the trade rumors revolving around Randy Johnson. Like many
others, he doesn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want that guy on my team until he says he quits,'' Fielder
said. ``It might be a distraction to everybody involved. They're
talking about trading the big dog. ... Who are you going to look to
to stop a losing streak, know what I'm saying? When you've got the
Big Unit, that's a streak killer. If I'm anywhere near being a GM,
I want Randy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielder did not hit any bombs Thursday night, but teammates
Darin Erstad and Gary DiSarcina slammed solo shots, both off of
Cloude.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners went in front 2-0 in the first inning after Griffey
smacked a two-run homer off the facing of the second deck in right
field. Griffey entered the game with just one hit off Angels
starter Ken Hill in 15 career at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey broke ahead of teammate Alex Rodriguez in their American
League home-run battle, Junior stroking his 22nd while the Mariner
shortstop remained at 21 after going 0-for-3. Griffey tied
Colorado's Vinny Castilla for second in the major league home-run
race. They both trail Mark McGwire, who has 27.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey waddled into an impressive milestone, tying Ron Cey,
``the Penguin,'' at No. 69 on the all-time home-run list with 316
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 4-2, the Angels added another run in the eighth amid
Kingdome silence that was interrupted only by occasional boos from
some disgruntled customers among the gathering of 23,709.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the boos were directed at two ineffective Mariner
relievers, Greg McCarthy and Mike Timlin. McCarthy, the left-hander
who was just called up from Tacoma Wednesday, received a hostile
welcome after walking three of the five batters he faced. Timlin
was doused after allowing a run-scoring single to DiSarcina.
</P>
<P>
   A fitting accessory to a Mariner loss showed up in the ninth
inning. Bobby Ayala is the reliever with an 0-5 record who allowed
a game-winning two-run homer in his last appearance Tuesday in
Baltimore. Thursday night he gave up one more run as the mood
turned somber and fans turned toward the stairs and the parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners blew a chance to pick up ground on AL West-leading
Texas but moved within one game of last-place Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Although he leaves Seattle with his team six games in front of
the beaten opponents, Fielder remains a wary observer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an incredibly talented team,'' he said. ``The Seattle
Mariners, no way are they out of the running in this division.''

SAFECO FIELD TO BE HOME OF THE MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mariners' annual $1.8 million take for allowing their park
to be called Safeco Field for 20 years is more than twice the fees
that corporations paid to put their names on Coors Field in Denver,
Jacobs Field in Cleveland or KeyArena in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners thus will become the 11th major league baseball
team to play in a stadium with a corporate sponsor's name on it.
Before 1990, no baseball teams played in a stadium with a corporate
sponsor. In just that short span, naming-rights fees have become an
integral component in financing hundreds of millions of dollars in
stadium construction around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It typically goes into contractually obligated income that is
important for securing financing for the stadium in the first
place,'' said Sean Brenner, a national expert on stadium finance
and construction for Team Marketing Report in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In return, companies with naming rights deals enjoy years of
name marketability and publicity that has untold value on business,
according to Brenner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sponsorship like this can truly broaden exposure both
geographically and outside of a company's core industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the 3Com telecommunications company purchased the naming
rights to Candlestick Park in San Francisco five years ago for $4
million, the company told Team Marketing Reports that its stock
trading volume went up and the number of qualified applicants for
jobs also increased from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Safeco hopes to get similar national exposure from purchasing
the naming rights from the Mariners. Company officials intend to
draw comparisons between Safeco's insurance business and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agents really work in mainstreet America, the smaller
communities and smaller towns where the people need home, small
business and auto insurance,'' said Safeco president Boh Dickey.
``I grew up in Montana, and baseball was always mainstreet America.
... It's not so much the sports opportunity here for us as it is
the opportunity for us to be associated with something that is in
the marketplace where we do our business through our independent
agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said Safeco, which also sponsors the Safeco Classic LPGA
golf tournament in Kent every year, researched the value of several
other naming-rights deals before entering into their agreement with
the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were aware of the bang for the buck that others have gotten
for the naming rights of stadiums,'' he said. ``We thought it
worked well for other companies, we did a little research on it,
and it fell right in with where it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The wave of stadium naming-rights deals spread in the late 1980s
with the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles, the Delta Center in
Salt Lake City and ARCO Arena in Sacramento, followed by the United
Center in Chicago and the Target Center in Minneapolis, all
National Basketball Association venues. Now there are 18 NBA teams
playing in arenas with naming rights sold to corporate or private
sponsors and 56 teams total in the NBA, major league baseball,
National Football League and National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mariners' case, the money will help offset the minimum of
$45 million that the team is obligated to pay as its share of the
$417 million ballpark. Over the 20-year life of the deal with
Safeco, the Mariners will receive about $40 million for the naming
rights when the annual figures are adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner president Chuck Armstrong noted the team already has
paid about $22.5 million of its share for stadium construction,
which is just over half complete.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest naming-rights deal in the country is the $100
million over 20 years that Staples Office Supply will pay for
having its name affixed to the new Staples Center in Los Angeles.
Brenner noted that the deal is so high because three professional
sports teams _ the Clippers and Lakers of the National Basketball
Association and the Kings of the National Hockey League _ will play
in the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that it is in Los Angeles and the media exposure that
is attendant to that were factors that really made it a lucrative
deal,'' Brenner said. ``One would expect that if any of the teams
in New York would put together a similar deal, the value would be
that much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   The figure for the new Mariners stadium is in the same ballpark
with the new Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco ($2.08 million a
year), the new Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix ($2.2 million) and the
remodeled Edison International Field in Anaheim ($2.5 million).
Those naming-rights deals all were consummated within the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level has hit a plateau in a sense because teams and
sponsors are seeing what's been done and using that as the
baseline,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Having the naming rights deal completed now allows the Mariners
to fully market other lucrative areas of the new ballpark, in
particular the 79 corporate suites, 352 Diamond Club seats, 4,222
Terrace Club and 966 charter seat licenses it hopes to sell before
the new stadium opens in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some instances, it may help things move along, and it may
help public perception of the project that there is a name to it,
especially if naming rights have been a topic of discussion for a
number of months,'' Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the M's deal had been circulating for the past
several months in meetings with the Public Facilities District, the
agency set up to oversee construction and manage the money
collected from taxes and other sources for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong acknowledged that the process might have seemed
laborious, but the team received more than two dozen inquiries from
interested companies. That number then was winnowed down to about
seven companies under serious consideration, but Armstrong declined
to disclose the runners-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody that got down there, we would have been pleased to
have them as the name on the facility, but there were a lot of
other factors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue for the team, he said, was Safeco's strong
presence in the community and the fact that it is a national
company with headquarters in Seattle. Brenner also noted the
importance for a company with naming rights to have a strong
presence in the region of the facility. Without that, the name
might face public resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best opposite example is the Pro Player apparel company,
which bought the naming rights to Joe Robbie Stadium (in Miami).
They told us that they went after the best available stadium to
attach a name to,'' Brenner said of a deal that suffered public
backlash. ``But most of the other deals have been a company
attaching its name to a stadium where either it has strong business
(in that region) or it's in an area where its headquarters are
located.
</P>
<P>
   ``Backlash is sometimes caused when you attach a corporate name
to an existing stadium, or even more to the point when you are
replacing an individual's name.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent case in point is the negative reaction the University
of Washington athletic department has received this week after
announcing that it had effectively sold naming rights to the
remodeled Hec Edmunson Pavilion to Seafirst Bank in a $9 million
sponsorship package. Another case is the renaming of Jack Murphy
Stadium in San Diego (named after a longtime local sportswriter) to
Qualcomm Stadium for the Qualcomm communications company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was seen as somehow sacrilegious to remove an individual's
name in favor of a corporate name just because the dollar amount
was right,'' he said. ``... But I think these naming-rights
sponsorships have become accepted practice even among fans at this
point in the game.''

D-BACKS GO ICE-COLD ON OFFENSE  
 THOMSON HOLDS KEY IN ROCKIES' VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Anyone who thinks that John Thomson's shutout of the
Diamondbacks at Bank One Ballpark on April 1 was a fluke, better
think again.
</P>
<P>
   The kid can pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies' 24-year-old right-hander came out in
46-degree, misty conditions on Thursday night and put Arizona's
bats in the deep freeze again.
</P>
<P>
   He was perfect through 4 innings and went on to scatter four
hits and strike out a career-high 11 as Colorado (26-34) salvaged a
split of the four-game series with a 5-2 victory at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second-lowest hit total allowed by the Rockies staff
at Coors Field. It was the third straight victory for Thomson (5-5)
and the third complete game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He did it by spotting his fastball and mixing in a nasty slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody else has solved him, but we haven't,'' said Arizona
Manager Buck Showalter, whose team fell to 19-41. ``It was a
legitimate quality outing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Diamondbacks shortstop Jay Bell, it was the best of times
and it was the worst of times. He had the first hit off Thomson,
breaking the shutout with a two-out home run (his eighth) to left
field in the fifth inning, but also struck out twice.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who hit a slider for the home run, said Thomson ``had
extremely good stuff. His fastball was between 90-97 (mph) and he
was changing speeds. He got his slider over very well, with a lot
of bite and great location.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as Thomson's location was, he also got help from plate
umpire Jim Quick, who had a liberal strike zone. Particularly
against Diamondbacks rookie first baseman Travis Lee, who struck
out three times.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken Lee didn't voice his displeasure, but his body
language spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Diamondbacks hitting coach Jim Presley had had enough.
He spoke more than volumes, barking at Quick from the dugout and
getting the thumb. He came out of the dugout to complete his
colorful diatribe before Showalter came out to escort him from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time a Diamondback had been ejected this
season. Center fielder Devon White was tossed on April 3 against
San Francisco for disagreeing with plate umpire Angel Hernandez on
his choice of strike calls.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Pres' was upset with what he thought was inconsistency,''
Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   There were some pitches thrown by Diamondbacks left-hander Omar
Daal that appeared to be in the same location as those from
Thomson, in some cases better, but Quick's right hand remained at
his side.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Presley simply voiced what many others in the
Arizona dugout were thinking, Showalter said, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said previously that umpires were testing Lee, but
they appeared to back off for a while. They apparently have resumed
their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Daal (1-4) gave up single runs in the first, third and fourth
innings, then struck out five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks pulled within 3-2 in the sixth when Kelly
Stinnett led off with a walk, was sacrificed to second by Daal and
scored on a triple to right by Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page out of the Larry Walker book from Wednesday night
and earlier Thursday night when he took extra bases on lethargic
Arizona outfielders, Fox stunned the Rockies' rocket-armed right
fielder by taking third base.
</P>
<P>
   A fly ball to left field by White was too shallow for Fox to
score and the throw by Dante Bichette was on the money. Lee then
took a called third strike, which undoubtedly caused Presley's
blood to start boiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, if we could have tied it up, things would have been
different. But Dante got off the good throw, and you have to give
him a lot of credit,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Daal gave Bichette more than credit in the Rockies' half of the
sixth. He gave him a good pitch to hit. Bichette hit a two-run
homer to left to make the score 5-2. &QL;

IS IT ALL OVER FOR THE BULLS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Madness has become a way of life, a fishbowl of
groupies, microphones, leeches and distractions that would sink any
other outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, it had never reached the basketball floor. But
for the first time since Michael Jordan climbed the mountain, the
Bulls show signs of cracking.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jazz squeezed out a victory in Game 1, fingers were
flying in all directions. Jordan blamed Scottie Pippen for not
knowing the play on a crucial 24-second violation. He said Luc
Longley acted like a 6-foot-5 guard. And in a snit of pretzel
logic, Pippen was angry that Longley deflected a pass, thereby
destroying his rhythm on an errant three-point shot that ended the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had eyes in the back of my head, I would have known he
was there,'' Longley retorted. ``And I wouldn't have touched the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   There were signs of doubt entering the Finals. Strange words
never before heard from the defending champions. Jordan said he
could handle his career ending in defeat. Dennis Rodman said the
Bulls still would be winners even if they lose this series. Pippen
talked openly about being the underdog. In sum, it sounded very
much like reconciliation and resignation of the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling moment occurred Wednesday, when Jordan
openly berated Pippen for not passing him the ball . . . after his
teammate nailed a three-pointer to tie the score. After the ensuing
timeout, Pippen rebelliously launched another three-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about that,'' Jordan said. ``I don't think it was any
bickering. I was just trying to figure out a way to attack and sort
out the situation of the game. I read that I was screaming at
Scottie Pippen. I don't have a reason to scream at Scottie Pippen.
Because of the loudness of the arena, I'm pretty sure I was yelling
to get a point across. But it wasn't anything derogatory toward
Scottie Pippen.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, Phil Jackson was caught lecturing Rodman
before he bolted to Las Vegas. According to the ``Las Vegas Sun,''
Rodman was refused credit at one casino, prompting him to humiliate
the cashier. At 5 a.m., he ended up at the Vegas Hilton, where his
request for $5,000 in chips was granted. Rolling the dice with his
injured right hand, Rodman reportedly reached $20,000 in winnings,
just a few feet from a sports book that listed the Jazz as 2{-point
favorites for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a bleary-eyed Rodman made it to practice on time
and the Bulls were trying to heal themselves. Jackson complained
that newspapers seem to print unflattering pictures of the Bulls
coach, so he smiled like a model, inviting a group photo shoot. And
when asked whether Pippen took an ill-advised three-pointer late in
the game, Pippen stuck his head through a curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he answered, speaking for his coach.
</P>
<P>
   So Pippen and Jordan not only denied any bickering but laughed
like there wasn't a care in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still feel like we're in control of the series,'' Pippen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Do they? Or is it just false bravado?
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls know another defeat in Game 2 could be fatal. If they
lose again, they would have to win four of five games. Certainly
possible, except they've lost four of their past six.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is group that always comes through in moments like
this, prevailing when they are most vulnerable, when the madness
becomes a monsoon. But it has to end sometime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the inner strength and confidence about
ourselves in what we're capable of accomplishing,'' Jordan said.
``Sure, it's a pressure situation, the ultimate apex of the season.
But you don't fight that apex with frustrations and anger. It's
that Zen Buddhism stuff we've been learning. We're practicing some
of it now, smiling when we're frustrated inside. To relieve some of
that tension so we can go out and do our jobs. It's an art form. It
takes some time to learn. You know, 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's been a long ride. And a long time since the Bulls were
in a predicament like this. &QL;

JAZZ HOPES MALONE, HORNACEK GET IN TUNE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ While the Chicago Bulls snipe at each other,
the Utah Jazz has remained all quiet on the Wasatch Front.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Despite getting subpar performances from two of its
top three players _ Karl Malone and Jeff Hornacek _ in Game 1, Utah
leads the best-of-seven NBA Finals series, 1-0, going into Game 2
tonight at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   The rust is off after a 10-day layoff, and the Jazz figures it
can only play better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we might come out flat in the first game,''
center Greg Foster said. ``We missed some shots, did some other
things well. We can take some confidence from it knowing that we
didn't play our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from it, according to Utah Coach Jerry Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to jump up and down about,'' said Sloan,
who probably wouldn't have been satisfied with a 20-point victory
any more the one that came in overtime. ``Hopefully, we can execute
a little better. And hopefully, we can try and defend them a little
better.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Jazz also knows that, to beat the Bulls, it's going to
need a lot more from Malone and Hornacek. John Stockton carried the
team, especially down the stretch, in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who had a similarly poor performance in Game 1 of the
1997 Finals, made only 9 of 25 shots this year. He said he'll make
a few minor adjustments but expects his shots to start falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shots I took were within our offense,'' Malone said.
``There's one thing I might do differently, and I'll adapt. I'm not
going to say what it is. But I'm not going to stop shooting. I
didn't do some things I'm capable of doing. I'll adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hornacek, who made only 2 10 shots, it's not so simple.
First, he has to expend a lot of energy trying to guard Bulls star
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realizes he's not going to stop him,'' Malone said. ``It's
up to us big guys to help him a lot more. I don't think we did that
as well as we could have in Game 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, Hornacek is not healthy, even if he insists that he is.
Hornacek has had a chronically bad left knee, admitting that it has
been swelling off and on for the past seven seasons. This season,
he also has sore Achilles' tendons during the playoffs that have
limited his mobility and made it difficult for him to shoot his
jump shot with normal lift and rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   And Hornacek really started wondering whether he's star-crossed
last week. With that 10-day respite, Hornacek not only had a rare
opportunity to let his body rest, he also had a chance to get some
work done around the house. It turned out to be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you have to realize my garage is a disaster,'' Hornacek
said. ``I was carrying an extension ladder, trying to go between
the cars and stepping over some junk. I tripped over some stuff and
hit my head.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek took a dive, and and the ladder whacked him in the
head. He needed a half-dozen stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rough year,'' Hornacek said.
</P>
<P>
   Not as rough as the Bulls' start in this series, though. Jordan
scored 33 points and Scottie Pippen had 21, but neither shot the
ball well, and Pippen had five turnovers. And the rest of the Bulls
were mostly ineffective. Forward Toni Kukoc made only 4 of 12
shots. Guard Ron Harper scored four points and had only one assist
in 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago bench was worse. But Chicago reserve Steve Kerr said
too much was made of Utah's advantage in bench scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play more minutes, so we don't pay a lot of attention to
the stats off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is for us to be effective while we're out
there. The biggest thing in Game 1 is that Utah didn't play well
and we passed up a great opportunity to win.'' &QL;

<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ It was March 18. It was dreary. It was Fresno. And
Pat Murphy was miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we ever going to win another game?'' he wondered out loud.
</P>
<P>
   True story. This team on the brink of a College World Series
championship was once on the brink of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State had just lost its sixth game in a row to drop to
16-12. The offense was struggling. Some tension existed among these
typically close-knit players.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few guys had major attitude problems,'' one player said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Murphy handled it well,'' outfielder Mikel Moreno said.
``He confronted the problems, the players backed him, and the
attitudes changed.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened after that 6-5 loss to Fresno State on March 18,
the midpoint of the season, is why the Sun Devils will play for the
national title Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ASU went 18-9 in the second half primarily because its offense
kicked in gear. The Sun Devils scored 199 runs in the first half,
262 in the second. They had 281 hits in the first, 330 in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you've got to get knocked down before you rise to
the top,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted the turnaround? Murphy and several players point
to three things:
</P>
<P>
   _A straight-shooting team meeting before the start of the next
series, against California.
</P>
<P>
   _An inspiring performance by pitcher Phill Lowery in the first
game against the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   _Murphy's handling of several attitude problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we got sick and tired of underachieving,'' third
baseman Andrew Beinbrink said. ``We were not playing as well as we
could. Each player finally took responsibility for themselves and
their performances and turned it up a level.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players, in particular, seemed to step it up
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Michael Collins' batting average leaped from .206 at
the midway point to .287 at the end of the regular season. Catcher
Jeremy Jones improved from .250 to .342; Moreno from .317 to .343;
and Casey Myers from .328 to .389.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came just before California visited on March 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept it real simple,'' Murphy said. ``We didn't try to
philosophize with them. We didn't try to analyze. We just said,
`Hey, take some responsibility, button your chin straps and go
after it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Several players said Murphy's conviction in that meeting was a
wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nothing I did,'' Murphy said. ``The players took charge
and did what they needed to do. (Pitcher Ryan) Mills was willing to
make some adjustments, and that helped. And then Lowery came out
and gave us a great performance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the series opener against California, Lowery allowed just two
hits and struck out 12 in seven innings as ASU won, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the Sun Devils rallied with six runs in the
ninth to beat the Bears, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of sparked us offensively,'' Moreno said. ``It gave
us momentum for the rest of season. Until then, we weren't scoring
any runs. We couldn't swing with confidence. Once we got on a roll,
we saw what our capabilities were.''
</P>
<P>
   And players whose goals were singular changed their tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of attitude adjustments that needed to be made,''
Murphy said. ``We had a lot of guys that didn't want to take that
next step up. You've got to take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until then I was very concerned. It didn't seem like we had
a lot of fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy and several players said Moreno was a key to the
second-half turnaround, more by example than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been at the crux of a lot of it,'' Murphy said. ``He's a
great leader. He doesn't give a hoot what anyone thinks about him.
He speaks his mind to the coaches, the players. He's a respectful
young man, but a great leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just his focus. He made everybody recognize we're all
on the same page here.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Beinbrink, ``We finally learned from our mistakes and had a
better attitude. We got more confidence within ourselves. We let go
of any fears. That's what turned us around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were finally willing, as a team, to do anything necessary
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players never doubted that they would turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set a goal not to just make it to Omaha, but to win in
Omaha,'' Willie Bloomquist said. ``And we weren't going to back
down from anybody.'' &QL;

PARTICLE OFFERS CLUE TO COMPOSITION OF COSMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    In a discovery climaxing decades of research into the past and
future of the universe, a team of physicists reported Thursday that
they have determined that the quirky subnuclear particles called
neutrinos carry at least as much mass as all the stars and galaxies
created since the Big Bang.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ghostly particles may also account for a significant portion
of the universe's mysterious ``missing mass,'' the researchers
said. The phenomenon has puzzled cosmologists for years because all
the stars, the galaxies and every bit of ordinary matter we know
cannot possibly weigh enough to account for the over all mass of
the universe.
</P>
<P>
   No recent cosmic discovery has generated as much excitement in
the scientific community as Thursday's confirmation that neutrinos
do indeed have mass and that they oscillate from one state to
another as they stream by the trillions from cosmic rays, from the
sun, from exploding stars known as supernovas, and from the decay
of other particles that make up every nucleus of every atom that
exists.
</P>
<P>
   The eagerly awaited neutrino discoveries were announced Thursday
from Japan, where scientists from all over the world were gathered
to hear the news and to describe their own experiments hunting down
the elusive particles.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been trying to study the neutrinos that zip
unscathed through Earth by capturing them in deep mines or creating
them though violent nuclear collisions at some of the world's
biggest atom-smashers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They are so fantastically small, so nearly weightless and so
electrically neutral that trillions of them can zip through every
human body every day without being felt. Even more of them
constantly stream unchanged through Earth without altering anything
_ except, of course, when a few are trapped inside detection
devices like the one in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 scientists from Japanese, American and European
research institutions had collaborated for two years on the
``Super-Kamiokande'' experiments that were conducted in a vast
detection chamber located a mile deep inside the Kamioka zinc mine
about 150 miles northwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with 121/2 tons of highly purified water and surrounded
by 13,000 photomultiplier tubes and electronic data recorders, the
chamber _ insulated from any possible interference by other nuclear
particles _ captured a few elusive neutrinos that had been created
by the interaction between cosmic rays and Earth's atmosphere. The
experiment then detected their oscillation rate from one state to
another as the changes yielded tiny flashes of radiant energy.
</P>
<P>
   To John G. Learned, a University of Hawaii physicist and member
of the research team, the results are virtually unprecedented and
an extraordinary contribution to science's fundamental insights
into the past and present of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business you only get great data like this once in a
lifetime _ if ever,'' Learned said in a telephone interview
Thursday. ``This is as good as it gets. It could prove to be the
key to the Holy Grail of physics, a unified theory of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   That theory, a concept first proposed by Albert Einstein and
often reiterated by British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, seeks
to find a single set of equations that can explain all the
fundamental forces in the universe: gravity, electromagnetism, and
the strong and weak interactive forces among subnuclear particles.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery announced Thursday does not provide that ultimate
explanation, but it seems bound to change significantly the current
``standard model'' of physics.
</P>
<P>
   And to Learned, altering the standard model could well mean a
new understanding of the origin of all matter, and a clue to the
fate of the universe _ whether it will continue expanding forever
or whether it contains so much mass that in billions upon billions
of years it will collapse on itself in a final ``Big Crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   To Princeton astrophysicist John Bahcall of the Institute for
Advanced Study, another experimenter, the discovery ``is something
that physicists had hoped for and eagerly sought for decades. It's
a huge step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current ``standard model'' of the universe, all matter is
fundamentally made up of six particles called quarks (whimsically
so named by the late Nobel laureate Murray Gell-Mann for James
Joyce's cryptic quotation ``Three Quarks for Muster Mark'' in
Finnegan's Wake) plus three electrons, tau particles, and muons,
plus three kinds of neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   In that standard model, all those particles except the neutrinos
have mass, but now the model will have to be revised if the new
discovery is validated.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese experiment did not actually measure the mass of the
neutrinos it detected, but instead it enabled the experimenters to
calculate the tiny difference between the mass of neutrinos in each
state just as they oscillated to another state.
</P>
<P>
   As Learned explained it, those oscillations altered each
neutrino &UR;  &LR; known as a muon neutrino into a new and different state
called a tau neutrino. At most the actual mass of each of those
neutrino states was an almost infinitely small fraction of the
total mass of an entire electron, the lightest of the traditional
fundamental particles.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much of the ``missing mass'' of the universe is
accounted for by the neutrinos remains a question that has long
vexed astronomers and physicists alike. And according to physicists
like Joel Primack of the University of California at Santa Cruz and
Joseph Silk of the Center for Particle Astrophysicists at UC
Berkeley, the mystery is by no means solved by the Super-Kamiokande
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever the mass of the neutrino may be, it makes up only
the part of the missing mass known as ``hot dark matter.'' And to
Primack and Silk, there remains an even larger quantity of massive
stuff in the universe that they call ``cold dark matter''_ and no
one even knows what that stuff might be.
</P>
<P>
   To Silk, who is working in Paris right now, the news from Japan
was ``very exciting, exciting indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   But at best, he said in an interview, only about 20 percent of
the entire mass of the universe is made up of neutrinos, while
barely 5 percent is the mass of ordinary matter we can see or touch
or feel or observe through telescopes. All the rest _ about 75
percent of the mass of the universe _ must be cold and dark and
wholly unknown so far, Silk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early universe,'' he said, ``neutrinos must have been
very hot, and because of that they tended to suppress the formation
of galaxies after the Big Bang. So the implication is that because
of this mixture of hot and cold, dark matter the galaxies we know
must have formed much later than we've supposed. And there's a
statement we're wrestling with right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The neutrino experiment announced Thursday surely will result in
one or more Nobel prizes for the experiment's leaders, according to
Primack. ``This has been a wonderful experiment,'' he said, ``and a
real triumph for Japanese science. It's now truly a golden age for
neutrino physics and astrophysics.''

<P>
   DENVER _ There appears to be no end in sight to Travis Lee's
painstaking indoctrination into major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie first baseman twice was called out on a strikes by
home plate umpire Jim Quick on Thursday night. Each time the third
strike appeared to be several inches off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Lee said nothing, continuing to show far more
resolve and cool-headedness than most 23-year-olds could display.
Lee has got to be burning on the inside. Somehow, he refuses to
show it on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on any umpire,'' he said. ``I'm not
supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly where one of baseball's most deep-seeded
problems lies. Players and staff cannot say anything disparaging
about an umpire for fear of suffering severe consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting coach Jim Presley finally did say something when a
seventh-inning pitch to Colorado's Greg Colbrunn was called a ball,
even though it was practically in the exact location where Lee was
rung up.
</P>
<P>
   Presley's commentary came from the dugout, making it impossible
for anyone at Coors Field to know anything was said. Nonetheless,
Quick, ejected Presley, who then jumped onto the field and let the
veteran umpire know, face to face, what he thought of the strike
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to get my money's worth at that point,'' said
Presley, who probably will be fined the customary $250 for his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Talk frankly with anyone involved in the major leagues, and one
common subject arises _ the lack of accountability of big-league
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Once a person becomes a major league umpire, it's the equivalent
of being named a Supreme Court justice; if you want the job, it's
yours for life. Try to name the last umpire who was fired?
</P>
<P>
   Until American and National League Presidents Gene Budig and Len
Coleman, respectively, decide to truly take control of the umpiring
the charade will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is the only sport that does not use the merit system to
reward its best officials for use in the playoffs, preferring to
use a rotation basis where every umpire works the postseason once
his turn comes up.
</P>
<P>
   It's a laughable system.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA selects its best referees for the playoffs. The NBA also
gets rid of its two or three worst referees after every season,
which alone should get every referee to be at his best every night.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL evaluates its officials each week, flicking away those
who consistently receive poor grades. The NFL also selects its best
officials to work the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Players are not forbidden from criticizing umpires, but know
that if they do, they can expect to be branded by the close-knit
fraternity of umpires.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, a player can talk with a referee and even _ get this
_ disagree in a civil manner without worrying about being ejected.
Not so in baseball, where nearly every umpire views any
disagreement as a question of integrity.
</P>
<P>
   It's an age-old problem in baseball but one that seems to be
getting worse with each season. The gap between umpires and
managers/players seems to be growing.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball needs to realize a real problem exists. The leagues can
make a stand to take control of the umpiring.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the umpires union has won so many concessions from
Major League Baseball that it is stronger than the leagues. There
is no way a sport's officials should have more control than the
league.
</P>
<P>
   If for no other reason than perception alone, the leagues should
strip away some of the power the umpires have. Because the best
clubs advance past the regular season, the leagues should instill a
system where the best umpires work the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a system that sent the worst umpires back to the
minors should be implemented. That would get some of the lazy
umpires to work as hard as they did when they first made it to the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the big leagues are a place where the best players
stick around. If Travis Lee goes into a swoon and cannot find his
swing, you can bet the Diamondbacks will send him to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   What would be the big problem with sending an umpire or two down
if they aren't doing their job up to a major league standard? &QL;

SCIENCE, RELIGION INTERSECT AT UC BERKELEY CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DON LATTIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH BERKELEY, Calif. _ From his study here, the Rev. W. Mark
Richardson sits amid the ivy-covered seminaries of the Graduate
Theological Union, enjoying an inspiring view of the Campanile, the
symbolic center of the University of California.
</P>
<P>
   It is the perfect setting for this philosopher and cognitive
scientist, whose mission is to promote dialogue between the secular
scientists working inside UC's numerous research laboratories and
the doctors of divinity in the adjacent seminaries atop ``Holy
Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson directs the Center for Theology and the Natural
Sciences, which Sunday convenes a four-day conference where
physicists, biologists, cosmologists and computer scientists from
around the world will talk about finding the hand of God in
everything from the genetic code to the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost unprecedented for scientists to be able to sit
down with their colleagues and talk about spirituality,'' said
Richardson, who is an Episcopal priest.
</P>
<P>
   Many universities and research laboratories, he said, oppose
``any perspective with an element of transcendence,'' refusing to
question ``the claim that the physical universe is all there is,
all there ever was, and all there ever will be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this idea that the universe was created wearing a lab
coat,'' he added. ``Scientists make ontological claims that surpass
the evidence and scope of their science.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which runs through Wednesday at UC Berkeley's
Wheeler Auditorium, was designed for scientists who are also
believers in one of the three Abrahamic faiths _ Judaism,
Christianity and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the big questions the scientists will ponder include:
</P>
<P>
   --Does science offer evidence of a transcendent reality and
purpose?
</P>
<P>
   --Is there a bridge between science and morality?
</P>
<P>
   --Is there something distinctive about being human?
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from England, the Rev. Arthur Peacocke,
an Anglican priest and a biochemist, said it is hard to talk about
scientific ``evidence'' of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``In religion, you don't get evidence. It's not a court of
law,'' he said. ``But the modern scientific vista is so
comprehensive, it raises more sharply the question, `What's the
meaning of it all?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Peacocke, a theologian at the University of Oxford and a former
genetics researcher at UC Berkeley, has witnessed almost
unimaginable advances in that field during the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 150 years, science has painted a great canvas of
connectedness,'' he said. ``It's not `evidence' of God, but if you
believe in a God who has a purpose, faith fits together with our
universe now more than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, scientific breakthroughs like the mapping of
the entire human genome pose new challenges for moral theologians.
For example, what are the implications for church teachings on
homosexuality if scientists establish a genetic basis for sexual
orientation?
</P>
<P>
   ``That may require revisions within Christianity,'' Richardson
said. ``You might say you now believe in the goodness of creation,
and no longer see homosexuality as the result of something called
`the fall.' Maybe now you see it as part of the pre-moral condition
of the mammal even before human beings came along.''
</P>
<P>
   Another conference speaker, Dr. Carl Feit, worked as a research
scientist at the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research
before accepting an appointment as a professor of health sciences
at Yeshiva University in New York, where Feit is free to mingle his
scientific research and Jewish faith.
</P>
<P>
   Feit cited a growing body of research showing that religious
faith may strengthen the immune system and help the body fight
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith is an important factor,'' he said. ``I don't believe in
the mind-body split. There is an interplay of all these systems. A
positive attitude, an attitude of hope, can have physical effects
on the body.''
</P>
<P>
   Feit agreed that science cannot prove God's existence, but he
said his faith allows him to see ``the hand of God in creation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My specific scientific knowledge about the tens of thousands
of chemical reactions taking place in our cells at any moment
enhances my appreciation of the maker of the universe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez Hewlett, an associate professor of molecular and
cellular biology at the University of Arizona, said he is starting
to see more openness to ``God-talk'' on secular campuses. His
school, for example, just offered a course on science and theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, that course would have met with much more
resistance. People would say that is outside our interest, or not
even a proper thing to think about,'' said Hewlett, a Roman
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Not invited to the conference are proponents of ``creation
science,'' Christian fundamentalists who question the validity of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the biologists we invited believe in evolution,''
Richardson said. ``They are practicing scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson did not invite Phillip Johnson, a law professor at UC
Berkeley and an outspoken critic of evolutionary theory. In an
interview, Johnson said the fuzzy mix of science and spirituality
at conferences like the upcoming Berkeley gathering produce neither
good science nor good theology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tolerate religion and science as long as science is in
the driver's seat,'' Johnson said, author of ``Defeating Darwinism
by Opening Minds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I find it easier to dialogue with atheists than these
theistic evolutionists.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will have many more opportunities for debating these
folks. Last week, the John Templeton Foundation, which funded the
conference, announced that it was giving another $12.6 million to
the Center for the Theology and the Natural Sciences to develop
programs in science and religion at universities worldwide.

   Gayle White, religion writer of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, will be in Salt Lake City next week covering
the Southern Baptist Convention, which will consider amending its
denominational statement of faith, untouched in 35 years, to add a
definition of marriage as between a man and a woman, and a
statement that a woman should be submissive to her husband. Daily
stories will be filed, including spot coverage of the election of a
new president, probably Tuesday for Wednesday. Paige Patterson,
president of Southeastern Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C., is running
and, barring a huge surprise and a nomination of someone else from
the floor, is likely to be elected. The significance of this is
that Patterson is generally credited with being one of two men who
planned the conservative resurgence in the SBC. A Q&AMP;A with
Patterson is available from Cox News Service.

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

 &UR; By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

 &UR; By KEITH SCHNEIDER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

</P>
<P>
   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

   An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

<P>
   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

   An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

   &UR; WHY CARE? &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

<P>
   An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

<P>
   It is difficult to know for sure, but there may be more kinds of
creatures living on Earth now than ever before in the planet's
4.6-billion-year history. Or at least there were that many before
human beings appeared very late in the game and began changing the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   At first, life consisted of microscopic, single-cell balls, rods
and filaments. For perhaps 3 billion years, these microbes were all
the life there was on this wet, stark and rocky world.
</P>
<P>
   Not until about 600 million years ago, after the Earth emerged
from its deepest ice age ever, did bigger species evolve. Then
life's variety exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of biological variety has been on an upward curve
since then. From sequoias and nematodes to fungi and elephants,
millions of species populate the world.
</P>
<P>
   The curve has not been a smooth one. At least five times in the
last 600 million years, planetwide environmental cataclysms, like
drastic climatic change and colliding asteroids, have wiped out
whole families of organisms. Such events have threatened to erase
life, but succeeded only in partly clearing the stage for new and
different families.
</P>
<P>
   Between extinction spasms, in the background hum of evolution,
single species winked out here and there to be replaced by new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this continuous turnover, scientists believe, more
than 95 percent of all species that have ever existed are extinct
today.
</P>
<P>
   Now one species, Homo sapiens, has become so powerful an
influence on the rest of the biosphere that many experts fear it is
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a sixth major extinction.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is happening simply because people are acting
naturally _ harvesting wild species to burn, eat or sell;
expropriating and destroying wild habitat to make way for human
works like farms, cities and suburbs; moving plants and animals
around the globe in a mix-and-match game in which a relatively few,
superadaptable plant and animal species are crowding out a larger
number of less hardy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the numbers is magnified greatly by technology's
power to shape the landscape and exploit the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   This combination has been especially worrisome for the rain
forests, where most of the world's species are found and
large-scale clearing is under way.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many species live on Earth. About 1.4
million have been described and named, but biologists believe there
are at least 10 times that many.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can put precise numbers on the rate of present-day
extinction, although several scientists have made rough stabs.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively conservative estimate says that for some species
found only in one locality, the rate may be 100 to 1,000 times the
normal ``background'' rate between mass extinctions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists who study the situation doubt that humans are
driving other creatures toward extinction at a growing rate.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever extent they are doing so, people are reducing the
variety of life on Earth _ what conservation biologists now call
biological diversity, or just biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Biodiversity is not merely a matter of different kinds of
species. It applies to many layers of nature on different scales.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is expressed by the number of genetic
variations within a species, the raw material of evolution; destroy
the wrong genes, and the species might not be able to adapt and
survive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, biodiversity is expressed in the bewildering
variety of types of ecosystems, the tightly interwoven communities
of plants, animals and microbes that are nature's working units.
</P>
<P>
   Forests, wetlands and grasslands are examples of one level of
ecosystem variety, and each comprises numerous interconnected
subunits, right down to the microscopic. It is these interconnected
communities that constitute the fabric of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree human activity is narrowing the variety of
life, scientists say, it is doing so on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter? Conservationists and biologists offer a
number of answers. On the practical level, wild species provide the
raw material for medicine and food. Who knows what undiscovered
plant might provide a cure for our era's killer diseases?
</P>
<P>
   Acting together, wild species support the human economy by
providing an array of services like water purification, soil
formation, pollination, flood control and, in our age, outdoor
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   On a more fundamental level, they support human life: Without
humans, the biosphere would not miss a beat. But without insects
and microbes, humans would disappear quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say natural systems are intrinsic to psychological
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many conservationists assert a moral imperative: It is
simply wrong to destroy large slices of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Moral arguments aside, are all species equally valuable?
Scientists believe that in many ecosystems, a few keystone species
hold everything together, and that if they are removed, the system
will collapse and all the other species in it will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in most instances, no one is sure which are
the crucial species.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, scientists have found, the greater the variety of
plant species in an ecosystem, the more productive it is over all.
</P>
<P>
   So, conservationists argue, it is necessary to save as many
species as possible. They have their work cut out for them, since
the catalogue of imperilment is long.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the World Conservation Union, in Gland, Switzerland,
added nearly 34,000 plant species _ one of every eight known plant
species in the world, and nearly one of three in the United States
_ to its growing ``red list'' of imperiled organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In possibly an even more important gauge of overall biological
vitality, an earlier assessment, by United States Federal
Government scientists, found that vast stretches of the natural
landscape, amounting to at least half the area of the contiguous 48
states, had declined to the point of endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   This report, the first ever done on the state of health of the
nation's individual ecosystems, found that 30 of them, some of
which dominated vast regions before the arrival of Europeans, have
been destroyed or degraded by 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the trackless ocean is immune. Overfishing has pushed
some marine species _ the cod and the blue-fin tuna, for example _
to the brink of commercial extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs in some parts of the world are under severe assault;
in parts of Asia, fishermen squirt sodium cyanide into the water to
stun fish, in doses strong enough to kill the corals that maintain
the reef ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The abundant evidence for the threat to biodiversity should not
be overinterpreted. The recent red-listing of plants includes many
simply because they are rare. While many may be vulnerable, humans
do not threaten them just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The red list of plants can be read another way, too: While one
in eight plants was judged imperiled, almost 90 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   On the action front, there are bright spots. Over the last
century, a worldwide conservation movement has struggled to stem
the human assault on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Endangered Species Act is regarded as the
strongest protection law in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, more than 160 countries, not including
the United States, have ratified a treaty obligating governments to
protect plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
   But victories are scattered or overturned. Recently, a federal
court, for instance, invalidated the Yellowstone wolf restoration
project, and a legal battle is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, habitat continues to disappear at an
``unprecedented'' rate, according to the United Nations. The
magnitude of the sixth extinction, if that is what is occurring,
will become clear in time.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century may reveal whether the clever brain bequeathed
to Homo sapiens by the evolution of biological diversity can be
used to save diversity as well as destroy it.

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been more than 20 years since advocates of
saving the snail darter, a minnow-sized fish believed to be on the
brink of oblivion, blocked the mighty Tennessee Valley Authority
from building the $137 million Tellico Dam.
</P>
<P>
   That case went to the Supreme Court, which sided with the fish,
and only when Congress intervened did the dam go forward.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Weyerhauser Corp. is negotiating a voluntary
plan to protect dozens of species on hundreds of thousands of acres
of rich forest habitat in Oregon over several decades, during which
development of the land will be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   These cases are strikingly different manifestations of the
Endangered Species Act, a law evolving so rapidly that it almost
resembles a new species itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the law was mostly used to block development
and preserve the habitat of a species close to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious and
subtler, as the government and landowners design management plans
to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of private
land, but at the same time not block development.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fundamental change in how the law should work. It also
reflects the realization that the Endangered Species Act's true aim
is to protect healthy and biologically diverse habitats, and not
just one imperiled species after another.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be done without the involvement of private
landowners. So Congress and the Clinton administration are trying
to give developers a bigger role in protecting the nation's
biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Endangered Species Act was under attack
by business groups, the Clinton administration began to
aggressively encourage the use of ``habitat conservation plans,''
or HCPs, on private lands, which are estimated to provide habitat
to 80 percent of all protected species.
</P>
<P>
   HCPs are binding, voluntary agreements in which a landowner
adopts conservation measures, sometimes going beyond what the law
strictly requires, in exchange for permission to develop some
property even if endangered wildlife and habitat are hurt in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A landowner might agree to leave some forest untouched to
protect wetlands from sediment and stream banks from erosion and to
preserve natural corridors for animals. Otherwise, homes can be
built, sewers trenched and driveways paved.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat conservation plans were authorized by Congress in 1982.
But before 1994, there were only about 20 such active arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, by the end of last year there were more than 200;
hundreds of more are coming. And their size is increasing from
fewer than 1,000 acres at the outset to tens or even hundreds of
thousands of acres in recent cases.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, advocates said, would reassure property owners
and provide incentives to protect the diversity of life on their
land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration credits the new arrangements for
helping to ensure the recovery of hundreds of species. But it is an
approach that creates suspicion and even hostility among some
environmentalists and conservation biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under many HCPs, development is permitted and habitat is
destroyed despite great uncertainty about whether the landowners
have provided enough mitigation to sustain species in the long
run,'' said the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife in a
report written by Laura Hood, a biologist, and published in
February. Hood examined 24 such plans.
</P>
<P>
   The critics' fire is particularly directed at a part of the plan
that has proved crucial to winning acceptance by property owners:
the guarantee of ``no surprises'' to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises clause tells the landowner whose plan includes
permission to harm some of the species or habitat during
development _ a so-called incidental take permit _ that the
government will place no additional restrictions on how the land is
used during the plan's life, usually several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The promise holds even if unforeseen circumstances arise, which
may demand further steps to preserve species.
</P>
<P>
   If the landowner agrees and the federal government picks up the
costs, additional conservation measures can be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landowners with private or commercial land have a legitimate
concern,'' said Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of Interior. ``They
want some assurance that once they agree to be a party to an HCP
and to mitigate the effects of their activities on listed species,
we won't come back later for a second bite from the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A deal is a deal,'' Babbitt added.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem, some skeptical scientists say, is that nature
is full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great uncertainty in natural systems, but HCPs and
no-surprises agreements act as though that is not the case,'' said
Dr. Gary K. Meffe, a professor of biology at the University of
Florida and the editor of the journal Conservation Biology.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises policy is at the heart of a bill offered by the
Republican Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Dirk A.
Kempthorne of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supports the bill, as do many Senate
Democrats. But so far, sponsors have been unable to bring it to the
Senate floor, partly over disputes about how to pay the
government's costs in the future, when surprises arise and
no-surprises clauses trigger federal payments to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kempthorne's proposal, supported by Senator Pete V.
Domenici of Arizona, the budget committee chairman, to pay these
costs by selling big tracts of publicly owned land, caused an
immediate uproar among conservation advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Most major environmental groups oppose the Chafee-Kempthorne
bill and instead favor a proposal written by Representative George
Miller, a California Democrat, for consideration by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says his bill would better ensure that endangered species
can actually begin to recover by setting aside critical habitat for
them and by restricting the use of the no-surprises guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's bill is very unlikely to win approval this year,
and the prospects for rewriting the law before Congress adjourns
for the November elections appear dim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, conservation groups are fighting some proposed HCPs
by enlisting scientists to challenge the no-surprises provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society in Portland, Ore., for example, assembled
scientists to review Weyerhauser's proposed HCP for tracts of its
Oregon property.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhauser and federal agencies are negotiating a complex plan
for species conservation and ecosystem management on approximately
400,000 acres of land in the Willamette Valley, foothills of the
central Cascade mountains and the Oregon coast ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would be implemented for 40 years with up to four
additional 10-year extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cover not only northern spotted owls (there are
about 160 owl sites on the land) but many other species, including
marbled murrelets, Umpqua River cutthroat trout, American peregrine
falcons, Columbian white-tailed deer, bald eagles, Aleutian Canada
geese and Oregon chubs.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for incidental take permits, which allows
Weyerhauser to damage the habitat of some of these species during
logging operations, the company agrees to accept detailed
prescriptions on how to manage the logging.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 40 percent of the land at a time will be reduced to
seedlings, and less than 60 percent at a time to seedlings and
saplings combined.
</P>
<P>
   The company will keep buffers around streams and leave behind
snags, large trees and big logs, all imperative to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Wininger, a timber manager at Weyerhauser, said that
the plan includes flexibility to change practices along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the water in streams is not within prescribed
temperature ranges, the company must change the amount of forest
left to shade the streams. But that is not enough to satisfy some
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel has several concerns with freezing a management
program in place for the 40- to 80-year term of the HCP,'' the
Audubon scientists' report said. ``The next 40 years of scientific
research will certainly produce new data and insights. One need
only consider the change in science's understanding of spotted owls
and other species affected by the proposed HCP in the last 40
years.''

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been more than 20 years since advocates of
saving the snail darter, a minnow-sized fish believed to be on the
brink of oblivion, blocked the mighty Tennessee Valley Authority
from building the $137 million Tellico Dam.
</P>
<P>
   That case went to the Supreme Court, which sided with the fish,
and only when Congress intervened did the dam go forward.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Weyerhauser Corp. is negotiating a voluntary
plan to protect dozens of species on hundreds of thousands of acres
of rich forest habitat in Oregon over several decades, during which
development of the land will be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   These cases are strikingly different manifestations of the
Endangered Species Act, a law evolving so rapidly that it almost
resembles a new species itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the law was mostly used to block development
and preserve the habitat of a species close to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious and
subtler, as the government and landowners design management plans
to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of private
land, but at the same time not block development.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fundamental change in how the law should work. It also
reflects the realization that the Endangered Species Act's true aim
is to protect healthy and biologically diverse habitats, and not
just one imperiled species after another.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be done without the involvement of private
landowners. So Congress and the Clinton administration are trying
to give developers a bigger role in protecting the nation's
biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Endangered Species Act was under attack
by business groups, the Clinton administration began to
aggressively encourage the use of ``habitat conservation plans,''
or HCPs, on private lands, which are estimated to provide habitat
to 80 percent of all protected species.
</P>
<P>
   HCPs are binding, voluntary agreements in which a landowner
adopts conservation measures, sometimes going beyond what the law
strictly requires, in exchange for permission to develop some
property even if endangered wildlife and habitat are hurt in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A landowner might agree to leave some forest untouched to
protect wetlands from sediment and stream banks from erosion and to
preserve natural corridors for animals. Otherwise, homes can be
built, sewers trenched and driveways paved.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat conservation plans were authorized by Congress in 1982.
But before 1994, there were only about 20 such active arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, by the end of last year there were more than 200;
hundreds of more are coming. And their size is increasing from
fewer than 1,000 acres at the outset to tens or even hundreds of
thousands of acres in recent cases.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, advocates said, would reassure property owners
and provide incentives to protect the diversity of life on their
land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration credits the new arrangements for
helping to ensure the recovery of hundreds of species. But it is an
approach that creates suspicion and even hostility among some
environmentalists and conservation biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under many HCPs, development is permitted and habitat is
destroyed despite great uncertainty about whether the landowners
have provided enough mitigation to sustain species in the long
run,'' said the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife in a
report written by Laura Hood, a biologist, and published in
February. Hood examined 24 such plans.
</P>
<P>
   The critics' fire is particularly directed at a part of the plan
that has proved crucial to winning acceptance by property owners:
the guarantee of ``no surprises'' to landowners.
</P>

   The promise holds even if unforeseen circumstances arise, which
may demand further steps to preserve species.
</P>

costs, additional conservation measures can be imposed.
</P>

   THOMPSONVILLE, Mich. _ I Finally understood why Adam was so
enticed by Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through
our orchard near the northern coast of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 apple trees _ some gnarled and thick at the trunk
like an old ash, others mere saplings _ stood scattered on a sandy
ridge between the maple forest and a dun-colored meadow.
</P>
<P>
   It was September 1991, weeks before the fruit fully matured.
Still, the orchard's scent was sweet and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A dry summer had produced unblemished apples that hung from the
limbs in a wondrous display of variety and color. Big, red round
apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree, and they
had a light, candy taste.
</P>
<P>
   There were large green apples, a kind that had probably been
stored during the winter in straw-lined pits to be eaten in spring.
</P>
<P>
   And there were smaller green apples with brown patches that
might have originated from the old Roxbury Russet varieties popular
in northwestern Michigan around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist who covered farming and wrote about modern
agriculture's shrinking genetic resources, I was struck by the
number of varieties, none of which could be found at the markets in
the towns of Benzonia or Frankfort nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '70s, plant breeders have worried that the
abundance of the world's food supply is balanced on a narrowing
supply of wild and domestic plant genes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a handful of varieties bred for peak production
make up the bulk of the world's rice harvest. Meanwhile,
irreplaceable genetic traits that enabled old varieties of rice to
grow in harsh conditions have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is playing out for wheat, corn, barley,
tomatoes and most other major food plants. Homogenization in the
market is one result. Hunger can be another. The Irish potato
famine was caused by a plant disease that raced through crops
containing no genetic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As the new owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in
Manistee County, Mich., my wife and I wanted to know more about the
place we had just bought and who had preceded us.
</P>
<P>
   Although historical records are incomplete, sometime during the
1880s, Hiram Hier moved to the township and built a plain two-story
home for his wife and two children on a rise above Nurnberger Road.
</P>
<P>
   Like other homesteaders, he planted different varieties of apple
trees _ in his case, three neat rows down the south-facing slope of
the widest ridge on his land.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 19th century, American farmers were encouraged
to spread seeds and see what came up. Hier almost surely followed
the protocol, as did his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Long growing seasons moderated by Lake Michigan, well-drained
soils and high ridges, which kept untimely frosts at bay, had
already distinguished Michigan's west side as one of the nation's
prime fruit-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 20th century, the fruit belt of northwest and
western Michigan was producing more than 50 commercial varieties of
apples, authorities say. Among the old favorites, some of them
recognizable in my orchard, are Snow apples, which are pure white
to the bite; the Wolf River, a big, round baking apple; Maiden's
Blush, an early ripening yellow apple with a bewitching dark-pink
patch on the side that receives the most sunlight; and Golden
Russet, with skin the color of brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, apple varieties were so diverse, it was just
like human beings,'' said John Kilcherman, a farmer in Northport,
Mich., who cultivates 240 heirloom varieties for his thriving
mail-order business. ``There were as many apples as there were
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I walked our land and tried to count the number
of varieties, concluding there were at least 14.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a simple task. The old trees that Hier had planted
were mostly dead, and a forest of maple and ash had grown up around
them. Hier's son, Lee, was the last to farm the place, and when he
died in the 1960s, deer began spreading the seeds. Young
fruit-bearing trees are now growing throughout the property.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, I was certain there were more varieties
available than in almost any commercial supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Even along the Lake Michigan coast, the center of a $100 million
apple-growing industry, the nation's fourth largest, the markets
offer paltry pickings. Red Delicious, Jonathan and McIntosh are
Michigan's big three. Northern Spy, an old variety, is still grown
widely for use in pies and to make cider.
</P>
<P>
   Shelf life, texture, uniform ripening and disease resistance are
the most sought-after traits. Distinctive taste is barely in the
first tier of breeding goals.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, moreover, are reluctant to experiment by introducing
unfamiliar varieties. Production costs are too high and profit
margins too slim, and tearing out a productive orchard to test an
unknown is too big a leap for most growers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, apples have not descended to the level of the
modern tomato. Cornell University keeps a well-stocked germ-plasm
repository in Geneva, N.Y., which is collecting wild seeds from the
Caspian Sea region and from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Wild apple trees are still so prevalent in this so-called center
of diversity that they constitute 40 percent of the native forest,
said James Luby, an apple breeder and a professor of horticulture
at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are 6,000 known commercial apple varieties in
the world, a deep reservoir of genetic material for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I'm more interested in apples developed in the
last century. In mid-May, the blossoms open and our trees look as
if they are covered in snow.
</P>
<P>
   In October, friends come to pick apples and haul them to
Swanson's mill three miles away to be pressed into the most
delicious tart cider.
</P>
<P>
   We have baked our apples into crisps and pies, eaten them
straight from the trees and stored some of the harder green ones
into the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving a diversity of strains may be part of a global
solution. But for us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures
that are all the more precious because we can't find them anywhere
else.

the towns of Benzonia or Frankfort nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '70s, plant breeders have worried that the
abundance of the world's food supply is balanced on a narrowing
supply of wild and domestic plant genes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a handful of varieties bred for peak production
make up the bulk of the world's rice harvest. Meanwhile,
irreplaceable genetic traits that enabled old varieties of rice to
grow in harsh conditions have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is playing out for wheat, corn, barley,
tomatoes and most other major food plants. Homogenization in the
market is one result. Hunger can be another. The Irish potato
famine was caused by a plant disease that raced through crops
containing no genetic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As the new owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in
Manistee County, Mich., my wife and I wanted to know more about the
place we had just bought and who had preceded us.
</P>
<P>
   Although historical records are incomplete, sometime during the
1880s, Hiram Hier moved to the township and built a plain two-story
home for his wife and two children on a rise above Nurnberger Road.
</P>
<P>
   Like other homesteaders, he planted different varieties of apple
trees _ in his case, three neat rows down the south-facing slope of
the widest ridge on his land.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 19th century, American farmers were encouraged
to spread seeds and see what came up. Hier almost surely followed
the protocol, as did his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Long growing seasons moderated by Lake Michigan, well-drained
soils and high ridges, which kept untimely frosts at bay, had
already distinguished Michigan's west side as one of the nation's
prime fruit-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 20th century, the fruit belt of northwest and
western Michigan was producing more than 50 commercial varieties of
apples, authorities say. Among the old favorites, some of them
recognizable in my orchard, are Snow apples, which are pure white
to the bite; the Wolf River, a big, round baking apple; Maiden's
Blush, an early ripening yellow apple with a bewitching dark-pink
patch on the side that receives the most sunlight; and Golden
Russet, with skin the color of brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, apple varieties were so diverse, it was just
like human beings,'' said John Kilcherman, a farmer in Northport,
Mich., who cultivates 240 heirloom varieties for his thriving
mail-order business. ``There were as many apples as there were
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I walked our land and tried to count the number
of varieties, concluding there were at least 14.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a simple task. The old trees that Hier had planted
were mostly dead, and a forest of maple and ash had grown up around
them. Hier's son, Lee, was the last to farm the place, and when he
died in the 1960s, deer began spreading the seeds. Young
fruit-bearing trees are now growing throughout the property.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, I was certain there were more varieties
available than in almost any commercial supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Even along the Lake Michigan coast, the center of a $100 million
apple-growing industry, the nation's fourth largest, the markets
offer paltry pickings. Red Delicious, Jonathan and McIntosh are
Michigan's big three. Northern Spy, an old variety, is still grown
widely for use in pies and to make cider.
</P>
<P>
   Shelf life, texture, uniform ripening and disease resistance are
the most sought-after traits. Distinctive taste is barely in the
first tier of breeding goals.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, moreover, are reluctant to experiment by introducing
unfamiliar varieties. Production costs are too high and profit
margins too slim, and tearing out a productive orchard to test an
unknown is too big a leap for most growers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, apples have not descended to the level of the
modern tomato. Cornell University keeps a well-stocked germ-plasm
repository in Geneva, N.Y., which is collecting wild seeds from the
Caspian Sea region and from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Wild apple trees are still so prevalent in this so-called center
of diversity that they constitute 40 percent of the native forest,
said James Luby, an apple breeder and a professor of horticulture
at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are 6,000 known commercial apple varieties in
the world, a deep reservoir of genetic material for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I'm more interested in apples developed in the
last century. In mid-May, the blossoms open and our trees look as
if they are covered in snow.
</P>
<P>
   In October, friends come to pick apples and haul them to
Swanson's mill three miles away to be pressed into the most
delicious tart cider.
</P>
<P>
   We have baked our apples into crisps and pies, eaten them
straight from the trees and stored some of the harder green ones
into the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving a diversity of strains may be part of a global
solution. But for us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures
that are all the more precious because we can't find them anywhere
else.

<P>
   Ten years ago, two botanists from the New York Botanical Garden
eagerly hiked up a hill in Haiti to examine what would prove to be
one of only seven known remaining specimens of Attalea
crassispatha, a very rare palm tree.
</P>
<P>
   To the scientists, the palm, with its unusual flowers and
soaring trunk, was a special, splendid thing. But to the farmer
about to cut it down, it was blocking his plans to expand his
sparse field of stunted corn stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A polite discussion ensued, recalled Dr. Michael Balick, one of
the botanists. With a Haitian colleague translating, he tried his
best to persuade the farmer to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about his children and grandchildren, about the
global value of maintaining biological diversity,'' Balick
explained. ``He said, `But what value is it to me today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Balick said the hilltop debate in the shadow of the palm was a
turning point, marking when he began to realize that efforts to
preserve the diversity of life cannot rely on abstract arguments,
but must be grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation
to fit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for
seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans. The
farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convinced to begin to preserve it, not only as a source
of nuts, but also for income derived through the sale of the seeds
so the tree could be grown elsewhere,'' Balick said.
</P>
<P>
   Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel
stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered
species around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify
preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer
drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals
extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that
are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests,
preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
   And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from
maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like
the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a
healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific advocate exists for almost every living thing, even
those that most people loathe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian
Institution, is perhaps the world's staunchest booster of beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of
beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is
about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru _ just beetles, just
one tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our everyday experience, insects are usually problems _
mosquitoes, roaches, that kind of thing,'' Erwin said. ``But,
really, 98 percent of all insect species provide ecological
services that keep the environment going.''
</P>
<P>
   An important service is taking out the garbage, with fly maggots
and dung beetles recycling rotting meat or feces into useful
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   And without the thousands of bees, beetles and other insects
that pollinate flowering plants, Erwin said, ``we'd all be eating
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem
is as critical as the benefits of preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the
structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is
more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform
landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are
more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and
fabric of our own lives,'' Klemens said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with people he has encountered on both
continents, he has found that ``if given a choice, people in Africa
and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of
their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Balick said: ``It's still very important to talk about its
importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some
of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic
benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to
small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal
plants for some part of primary health care,'' he noted. ``You'd
think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful,''
he said. ``And that puts great pressure on ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's a goner,'' Henderson said.

 By PETER PASSELL 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the big picture and in the long run, it's true: To paraphrase
Yosemite Sam, there is biological gold in them thar rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The active ingredient in roughly one in four prescription drugs
comes from plants. And biotechnology companies are eager to gain
access to exotic environments containing tens of millions of plant
and animal species that have yet to be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   In the most visible deal, Merck, the giant pharmaceutical maker,
is paying Costa Rica cash plus royalties to preserve the country's
fragile tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
   But economists speak with virtually one voice in warning that
biodiversity is not going to pay for itself. The creation of
property rights in the wilderness can play only a minor role in
protecting endangered habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential return to bioprospecting has been greatly
exaggerated,'' argued David Simpson, a senior fellow at Resources
for the Future, an environmental research organization in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the major contribution of economics in the
biodiversity debate will likely be the forcing of policy makers to
deal more realistically with intangible, nonuse values. That is the
kind of thing usually left to philosophers. And since such
intangibles are more immediately interesting to the citizens of
affluent countries than to the largely poor custodians of tropical
``hot spots'' of biodiversity, the lesson's starting point is that
there are no free rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, species preservation comes down to tradeoffs _ in
deciding how much we are willing to sacrifice in the name of
preserving natural habitats,'' concluded Martin Weitzman, an
economist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, economists assume that the keys to
everything, from more effective drugs to more nutritious,
disease-resistant crops, are secreted in tropical forests. Why,
then, isn't the repository for these natural wonders valued
accordingly?
</P>
<P>
   What counts, Simpson said, is scarcity. And while there may be
millions of potentially useful species, there is also vast
biochemical redundancy in the environment. Thus the value of any
acre is limited by the fact that an identical species probably
grows on thousands of other acres, and that many of the useful
chemicals will show up in hundreds or even thousands of species.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution decreed, after all, that both coffee and tea contain
caffeine as a defense against predators. And where naturally
occurring chemicals are extremely rare, the value of looking for
them is offset by the high cost of such a task.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Roger Sedjo and John Reid, his colleagues at
Resources for the Future, estimated the potential value of
preservation in 18 biodiversity hot spots around the world. And
while their figures are necessarily crude _ extrapolating from
useful new chemicals found in exotic environments and the cost of
developing drugs from them _ they are deliberately designed to err
on the high side.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate value of undiscovered species might be,
the three researchers calculate that the current bioprospecting
rights for pharmaceuticals are worth a maximum of $8 an acre in
western Ecuador to $2 an acre in the Philippines to a mere 40 cents
an acre in the eastern Himalayas. That may be enough to justify
biosurveys, but hardly counters pressure for other uses like
grazing or gathering firewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' Simpson said, ``exaggerated claims of the
pharmaceutical companies' willingness to pay to preserve exotic
environments has been counterproductive,'' as poor countries balk
at what they view as efforts to claim their natural treasures for a
song.
</P>
<P>
   In the stalemate, rain forests continue to be destroyed by
farmers and prospectors seeking short-term gains.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean biodiversity has little value, said Robert
Stavins, an environmental economist at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard. But it implies that ``the lion's share of
the value is intangible,'' Stavins said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, what can economists contribute to the debate? For
one, they can help a society sort through its priorities by looking
at what people are willing to pay to support those values. The
evidence is that public policy toward endangered species reflects
only the narrowest of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In research to be published this summer in the Journal of
Economic Perspectives, Weitzman and Andrew Metrick, a Harvard
colleague, look for the priorities reflected by the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service's spending to protect 142 invertebrate
species that are listed as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect that the biological distinctiveness of a
species would increase its standing. So ought the probability that
intervention would preserve the species. Last but hardly least is
cost: With limited funds, priorities should reflect the resources
needed to keep the species intact.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Metrick-Weitzman analysis shows that the more
endangered a species is, the less money is spent to preserve it.
And the higher the cost of preserving a species in terms of
dislocating economic activities, the higher the priority the
species gets.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic uniqueness seems to play little or no role in priority.
Think of the northern spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to count most in determining spending priorities are
size (the bigger the better) and taxonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Mammals and birds, which economists dub ``charismatic
megafauna,'' are popular with preservationists, while amphibians
and fish go to the rear of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Stavins put it more plainly. The species we defend most
aggressively, he said, are ``warm and cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   That may worry biologists who are concerned about the potential
disappearance of broad categories of plants and smaller animals
that help knit healthy ecosystems. But the focus on fur balls may
or may not bother taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have no business telling people what they should
value, Weitzman argued, but they have plenty to contribute on the
subject of rationality.
</P>
<P>
   If we are committed to biodiversity, economists can help make
the cost-benefit calculations critical to obtaining the most bang
for a buck. And they can help people to think seriously about how
to provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' Mr. Weitzman said, ``then we should be honest about
our desire to have charismatic megafauna effects dominate our
decisions.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the big picture and in the long run, it's true: To paraphrase
Yosemite Sam, there is biological gold in them thar rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The active ingredient in roughly one in four prescription drugs
comes from plants. And biotechnology companies are eager to gain
access to exotic environments containing tens of millions of plant
and animal species that have yet to be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   In the most visible deal, Merck, the giant pharmaceutical maker,
is paying Costa Rica cash plus royalties to preserve the country's
fragile tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
   But economists speak with virtually one voice in warning that
biodiversity is not going to pay for itself. The creation of
property rights in the wilderness can play only a minor role in
protecting endangered habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential return to bioprospecting has been greatly
exaggerated,'' argued David Simpson, a senior fellow at Resources
for the Future, an environmental research organization in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the major contribution of economics in the
biodiversity debate will likely be the forcing of policy makers to
deal more realistically with intangible, nonuse values. That is the
kind of thing usually left to philosophers. And since such
intangibles are more immediately interesting to the citizens of
affluent countries than to the largely poor custodians of tropical
``hot spots'' of biodiversity, the lesson's starting point is that
there are no free rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, species preservation comes down to tradeoffs _ in
deciding how much we are willing to sacrifice in the name of
preserving natural habitats,'' concluded Martin Weitzman, an
economist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, economists assume that the keys to
everything, from more effective drugs to more nutritious,
disease-resistant crops, are secreted in tropical forests. Why,
then, isn't the repository for these natural wonders valued
accordingly?
</P>
<P>
   What counts, Simpson said, is scarcity. And while there may be
millions of potentially useful species, there is also vast
biochemical redundancy in the environment. Thus the value of any
acre is limited by the fact that an identical species probably
grows on thousands of other acres, and that many of the useful
chemicals will show up in hundreds or even thousands of species.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution decreed, after all, that both coffee and tea contain
caffeine as a defense against predators. And where naturally
occurring chemicals are extremely rare, the value of looking for
them is offset by the high cost of such a task.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Roger Sedjo and John Reid, his colleagues at
Resources for the Future, estimated the potential value of
preservation in 18 biodiversity hot spots around the world. And
while their figures are necessarily crude _ extrapolating from
useful new chemicals found in exotic environments and the cost of
developing drugs from them _ they are deliberately designed to err
on the high side.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate value of undiscovered species might be,
the three researchers calculate that the current bioprospecting
rights for pharmaceuticals are worth a maximum of $8 an acre in
western Ecuador to $2 an acre in the Philippines to a mere 40 cents
an acre in the eastern Himalayas. That may be enough to justify
biosurveys, but hardly counters pressure for other uses like
grazing or gathering firewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' Simpson said, ``exaggerated claims of the
pharmaceutical companies' willingness to pay to preserve exotic
environments has been counterproductive,'' as poor countries balk
at what they view as efforts to claim their natural treasures for a
song.
</P>

   In the stalemate, rain forests continue to be destroyed by

   Commentary

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ Considering what he did, you should know the
kid's name.
</P>
<P>
   You should know the identity of anybody who would do something
so unspeakably vile. I can't even describe to you in detail either
the images he created or the words he used.
</P>
<P>
   But he's only 17, and his grandfather called me in tears,
begging me not to name him. And, given the fact that no crime has
been committed and that none of the kid's victims has been left
dead or bleeding, I hadn't planned on naming the kid anyway.
</P>
<P>
   So, let's just call him Beavis _ although, once you hear this,
you'll realize what a slur that is on that repugnant cartoon
character. Compared to this kid, Beavis and Butt-head come off like
Wally and the Beav.
</P>
<P>
   I will name the school district, however. That's North Colonie,
an upscale suburban district just outside New York's state capital.
One district official I spoke to seemed horrified that anybody in
the public _ you know, like the taxpayers who pay the bills _ might
learn that something like this can happen in a classy school like
Shaker High.
</P>
<P>
   Our young friend Beavis is computer literate, so his problem
seems to be something other than stupidity. He is, according to his
grandfather, quite sensitive and easily wounded. Apparently, it
doesn't occur to him that other people can be wounded, too. Or,
more likely, he doesn't much care.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what he did:
</P>
<P>
   He took photos of girls in his high school, apparently from the
yearbook. He used his computer to put the girls' faces on
pornographic pictures of naked women in lewd poses. Then he put the
whole thing on the Internet on a Web site entitled, ``Shaker Girls
at Their Best.''
</P>
<P>
   He included with the photos phony autobiographies of the girls _
little missives to Web browsers around the globe that read like
this: ``I am only a senior in high school, but already I have a
reputation as one of the biggest sluts in school. I am just a
little nymphomaniac!''
</P>
<P>
   Beavis had several of the girls bragging about sex with
teachers, about getting pregnant and having abortions, about their
affection for exotic sex acts. Thoughtfully, he also included their
e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Just an adolescent prank? Well, this stunt seems to go well
beyond that. It's sheer, unadulterated viciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The girls found out about it, of course. So did the school. The
district saw it as sexual harassment. The kid was suspended for
five days. The district is considering more action against him, but
it has no authority to expel him from school.
</P>
<P>
   In the perpetually benevolent state of New York, expulsion from
school doesn't exist. Every New York citizen is guaranteed a free
public education until age 21, regardless of behavior. By law, the
maximum suspension lasts only a year, and the kid gets private
tutoring at public expense.
</P>
<P>
   The cops did pay Beavis a visit. They did their best to scare
the hell out of him, but there's nothing they can really do to him.
If the kid had sent this material directly to the girls, that would
have constituted aggravated harassment. But sending false,
defamatory filth out to the universe via the Internet violates no
criminal law of the State of New York.
</P>
<P>
   It's essentially publishing it _ you know, First Amendment
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   What Beavis did, however, does seem to constitute libel. That's
according to my home newspaper's hot-shot First Amendment lawyer,
Mike (The Hammer) Grygiel. So, the girls could sue the kid and take
everything he has. Given his age, that's probably not much.
</P>
<P>
   But if some jury awarded the mud-splattered girls nothing more
than Beavis' computer and his collection of dirty pictures, they'd
be doing humanity an enormous favor.

 &HT;    Everglade restoration plan criticized for aiding agriculture
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Water managers and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have crafted
a $7.5 billion plan for creating a healthier, more natural
Everglades while expanding South and Central Florida's water supply
during the next half-century.
</P>
<P>
   But even supporters acknowledged that the blueprint needs a lot
of work before they can present it to Congress next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would be the linchpin of what water managers call the
largest, most complex ecological restoration ever. Yet it faces
skepticism from some state and federal scientists, who say the plan
would go too far in serving farms and cities without fully
restoring the Everglades' natural flow.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag, based on the project's first detailed cost
rundown, is considerably higher than the corps' earlier estimates
of $3 billion to $5 billion. As a comparison, $7 billion is the
state's annual Medicaid budget to provide medical care for 1.3
million people.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress approves the plan, corps officials expect the
federal government to pay half the bill during the next 20 to 50
years. The rest would come from some undetermined mix of state,
county, municipal and regional sources, which could include
property taxes or surcharges on water bills.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists still are studying whether the proposal would
do all they hope. They say the region's future depends on the
plan's central concept, an overhaul of the 1,600-mile-long drainage
network that the corps built after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last, best chance to save the Everglades,'' said
Shannon Estenoz(cq/female) of the World Wildlife Fund. ``This is it
for the next 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``We're not going to support a plan that doesn't
restore the Everglades.''
</P>
<P>
   Corps ecosystem restoration chief Stuart Appelbaum(cq) said the
proposal would provide the tools for helping both humans and
nature. His agency and others will try in coming weeks to make it
even better for the Everglades and waterways such as the St. Lucie
River.
</P>
<P>
   Further changes would come during the next 20 years as the corps
and the South Florida Water Management District start building and
operating the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got is the nucleus,'' Appelbaum said Thursday,
after three days of meetings in which federal, state and local
government representatives picked one of four competing proposals.
They chose the most expensive plan, the one that scientists and
engineers called best for the region's needs.
</P>
<P>
   The corps plans to unveil a revised version in mid-October
before holding public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would rely on a vast network of reservoirs, storage
wells and marshes. That labyrinth would occupy 286 square miles _
equivalent to 8 1/2 Manhattans _ while storing enough water to fill
Pro Player Stadium more than 1,300 times.
</P>
<P>
   The extra water would help feed the faucets, toilets, swimming
pools and lawn sprinklers of a 16-county region where the
population is expected to more than double to 12 million by the
year 2050.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers say the water also would allow the reflooding of
parched stretches of the Everglades when the park needs it. The
storage capacity would provide a place to put unneeded water during
gluts, rather than dumping them into the Everglades or Lake
Okeechobee and wreaking havoc on wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at Everglades National Park and the state Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commission said the plan still would leave
large areas of marsh with too much or too little water. Park
scientists said the proposal also would rely too little on natural
flow and too much on pumps, canals and floodgates, and would give
the most reliable water sources to cities and suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   They also expressed dismay at a study concluding that some
endangered species, such as snail kites, would see only ``slight''
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even in the ballpark'' to a true restoration plan,
park biologist Sue Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   But water district biologist John Ogden said the plan would aid
a wide variety of wildlife. For instance, it would add months to
the nesting season for wood storks and other wading birds, whose
numbers have declined by 90 percent in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``These plans are really strong ecologically,'' Ogden said.
``We're talking about a system that's been much too dry and making
it wetter again.''
</P>
<P>
   Public water utility directors and state agriculture officials
were happier than environmentalists with the plan's assurances that
they would have enough water most of the time. But sugar growers
south of Lake Okeechobee vehemently object to a provision that
would use 94 square miles of their cane fields for some of the
proposed reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, utility officials question the proposal's reliance on
vast underground storage wells, a technology that no one has ever
used on such a scale.

   QuickReadCongress has ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
to come up with a plan to restore the Everglades by overhauling the
drainage system of South and Central Florida. A $7.5 billion
proposal would accomplish these steps during the next 20 to 50
years:
</P>
<P>
   Store more water: Engineers would build 286 square miles of
reservoirs and filter marshes on all sides of Lake Okeechobee and
along the Everglades' eastern fringes. They could store as much as
467 billion gallons that otherwise would flow out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Try new technology: Hundreds of storage wells could trap 1.7
billion gallons a day underground during rainy years, then give it
back during droughts. The average yearly yield could be 130 billion
gallons.
</P>
<P>
   Go with the flow: The corps would bulldoze some interior
Everglades canals and levees to return some of the natural,
broad-flowing sheets of water to its marshes.
</P>
<P>
   What's next: The corps and the South Florida Water Management
District expect to unveil a revised proposal in mid-October, hold
public hearings in November and submit a final version to Congress
by July 1, 1999. Want to learn more? The corps' proposal, studies

 &HT;    Fagan, Kurth continue battle on national TV
 &HT;    By George Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hopes for a reunion between Barbara Kurth and the daughters
taken from her in 1979 appeared dim Thursday as the kidnap saga
involving her ex-husband Stephen Fagan played out on national
television for the second night in a row.
</P>
<P>
   One night after Fagan blasted her on ABC's Prime Time Live as a
drunkard who had endangered their daughters' lives, Kurth defended
herself on CNN's Larry King Live. The back-to-back interviews shed
little new light, but turned up the heat in a case that has drawn
national attention since Fagan's April 16 arrest at his Palm Beach
mansion on 18 1/2-year-old Massachusetts kidnap charges.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said he spirited the girls to Florida and changed their
identities to rescue them from Kurth. He points to affidavits from
three of her neighbors at the time who said she neglected the girls
and often appeared drunk. Fagan also cites two driving under the
influence convictions against Kurth from 1979 as evidence of a
drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth on Thursday called the affidavits ``fabrications'' that
were instigated by a ``self-righteous'' neighbor who disapproved of
her child-raising methods. Of the DUI convictions, she said, ``I
used poor judgment a couple times when I was going through a
seriously stressful time.''
</P>
<P>
   On Prime Time Live Wednesday, the daughters, now 23 and 21 and
supportive of their father, criticized Kurth for not reaching out
to them privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling that if I did that they would accuse me of
bothering them,'' Kurth said Thursday when a caller from Texas
asked about contacting the daughters. ``It's difficult to hear your
children tell you they want nothing to do with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurth said Fagan had poisoned the daughters against her and
wouldn't allow them to talk to their mother. But Fagan's current
wife, Harriet Martin, said Thursday that Fagan hasn't tried to
block a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all said, `If you want to see her, see her,' '' Martin
said in a brief interview after the King show. ``He in no way has
tried to alienate them.''

   Cedar Park could become gospel music's TV home
</P>
<P>
   By Kevin Wishard
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   CEDAR PARK _ A Baptist preacher and a rock-singer-turned-promot
er say that the Southern gospel music performance at Hilltop
Baptist Temple could lead to a Williamson County version of the
television program ``Austin City Limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely partners have hired a production crew to hang
lights, run wires and operate cameras. Many crew members have
worked on ``Austin City Limits,'' a nationally syndicated Public
Broadcasting Service show that features taped performances by an
eclectic array of musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pastor Jack Humbert and Rob Brandon, owner of BNI
Enterprises, have prepared a script and overseen rehearsals. With
showtime approaching, the duo is dreaming of how their venture
could shape this community's image for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do to Cedar Park with gospel what country and
western did for Nashville,'' said Humbert, who described ``Hill
County Gospel Music'' as a cross between a Statler Brothers
performance and a ``Hee Haw'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   Humbert expects to sell all 650 tickets available at $12.50
each, and he is confident one of four cable networks that have
shown interest in a 13-episode package will pick up the gospel
music show. He won't reveal the names of the networks for fear of
jeopardizing negotiations but said they are based in Texas,
California, Florida and Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is strongly courting us, and another is saying don't sign
with anyone before you talk to us. We've approached the other
two,'' Humbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gates, a gospel music promoter who lives in Austin, said
the program could succeed here if done correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographic that they would be broadcasting to is people
who are going to be at home _ older people, mostly,'' said Gates,
who helped promote a recent Amy Grant concert. ``There's definitely
a market for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon, a music promoter, shares Humbert's vision and energy
for the project, even though he has a limited religious background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob had never heard a gospel song, seen a Bible or been to
church,'' Humbert said. ``But the more he was exposed to this, the
more he liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon said he was originally skeptical but changed his opinion
after hearing that another gospel music enterprise netted sales of
$30 million last year. ``I thought, God, if there's that much money
in gospel, let me sign up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon, a native of Canada, wears his curly hair long, to his
shoulders. The earrings and black felt boots fit the persona he
built while singing with rock bands Damian, the Fury, the LA Sharks
and Bad Boys. He talks about an extensive network of contacts he
has expanded since he gave up his singing career four years ago and
began managing musicians. Brandon said he hopes to persuade
high-profile performers to appear on future ``Hill Country Gospel
Music'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe how many big people love gospel or have a
background in gospel,'' Brandon said. ``We've got Larry Gatlin, and
Wayne Newton is calling us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon said ``Hill Country Gospel Music'' will look and sound
different from any current gospel music production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gospel music has been so poorly produced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Brandon's flashy style, Humbert is a grandfather
who drives a minivan and knows prominent gospel music figures such
as Blackwood and Lister on a first-name basis. He's a savvy
promoter himself, and recently removed the word ``fundamental''
from the sign in front of his church. ``It has negative
connotations,'' Humbert said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes the television production will help raise money
to complete an 1,100-seat football stadium for the private school
next door. A lighted baseball and softball complex also are
envisioned for Hilltop Christian Academy, and Humbert said he wants
eventually to build assisted-living homes on the 40-acre campus.
It's all part of a master plan that began 20 years ago when he left
his executive office in a Chicago skyscraper to build a church on
the hill along U.S. 183 overlooking Cedar Park.
</P>
<P>
   Humbert and Brandon have agreed to split any profits 50-50.
Humbert's share will benefit Hilltop Christian Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Humbert estimates the school and Brandon's company will spend
$35,000 to produce Saturday's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect to make any money from our ticket sales, but
when we tie in with a TV network, that's when we'll make our
money,'' Humbert said.

 &HT;    Commentary: The accused wore freckles
 &HT;    By JOHN YOUNG
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A neighbor described Kip Kinkel as an all-American kid, and by
appearances it was so: close-cropped red hair and freckles, right
off a cereal box. But the day witnesses said he shot 51 rounds into
a crowded school cafeteria, he also was an accused felon.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a freshly accused felon who had spent the night before at
home.
</P>
<P>
   It was the home where investigators would find Kinkel's dead
parents, and five bombs that the boy had stashed to protect himself
from the monsters under his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was more serious than it seemed when police in
Springfield, Ore., released Kinkel to his parents' custody after
arresting him at school for buying a stolen handgun from a
classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Horrible carnage aside, one of the scariest circumstances in
this tale is the matter-of-fact disposition of what is, or should
be, a most serious crime _carrying a gun on a school campus.
</P>
<P>
   In Kinkel's case it was two crimes, possession and theft by
receiving. And yet he went home. I'm trying to imagine an adult
offender who, having been charged with two felonies, could expect
to be home by dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield authorities were saying that with a first-time
juvenile offender on their hands they were just following the law.
If that's the case, the law needs to ascribe to juveniles the same
sense of severity that the words ``felony charges'' convey to the
adult world.
</P>
<P>
   As for being a first-time offender of this nature, it shouldn't
matter one whit. Imagine that Kip had hauled a pipe-bomb onto
campus. Would ``first-time offender'' have mattered then? The fact
is that a gun is little more than a surgical pipe-bomb, far more
efficient, far more utilitarian.
</P>
<P>
   This brings up the fact that many rural counties don't even have
juvenile detention centers. (That wasn't a factor in the Kinkel
case. Springfield had that option available for him.) In too many
cases, because those counties can't afford juvenile detention sites
or can't find a place to have offenders detained, kids like Kip go
home.
</P>
<P>
   It's called juvenile justice on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Currently a bill in Congress seeks to put an imprint on juvenile
justice that sounds tough but would backfire. One controversial
ingredient would allow local governments to house young offenders
in jails, abolishing a standard that for 24 years has kept young
offenders and older ones apart.
</P>
<P>
   This is portrayed as a get-serious approach to juvenile crime.
Actually it is an incentive for local governments to keep doing
things as cheaply as possible and to not make needed investments in
juvenile detention, probation and counseling.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen in such a tightwad community in the case of
Kip Kinkel? Sure, you want to be tough with serious, hardened
juvenile offenders. But you'd be reluctant to put a first-timer, an
All-American, freckle-faced kid with good parents, behind jailhouse
bars.
</P>
<P>
   And so you wouldn't. Until he sprayed a school cafeteria with
bullets.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Perfect wife? Perfect husband, too.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In a love letter about his wife, Donald L. Weeks
turned this phrase:
</P>
<P>
   We are fortunate enough to have this gift of love which is like
a precious plant. One just can't accept it, leave it, and think
it's going to grow by itself. Even after 50 years we must keep
watering it, to look after it, and nurture it. This I know we will
do.
</P>
<P>
   I found Weeks' words in a note I opened last May as I sorted
through the hundreds of letters submitted in conjunction with our
annual Mother of the Year contest.
</P>
<P>
   The letter caught my eye. I pulled it out of the pile.

   Weeks, 71, of Washington Twp. is an engineer who worked 46 years
for NCR in Dayton before he retired in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, he wrote: ``I know you are looking to honor a
mother, but the purpose of this is to call my wife to your
attention, and to ask you to consider honoring her as the 1998 Wife
of the Year. She is an incredible life companion.''
</P>
<P>
   To his day , June 5, 1998, is the 50th anniversary of the
marriage of Don Weeks, and his wife, Virginia, who is 70. So this
is an appropriate day to put a spotlight on them.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Weeks said she is not at all surprised that her husband's
words are imaginative, sensitive and somewhat poetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the years Don has written me love notes on special
occasions. I have stored them in envelopes and boxes in the dresser
drawer. One day I may assemble them in a book. My husband has been
good at being husband and a father.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weeks have two grown children, both married. A daughter in
Beavercreek has two children and their son in Canada has four
children , the youngest of them 13-year-old twins .
</P>
<P>
   The family plans to have a reunion in July to celebrate the
Weeks' 50th anniversary. But Don also plans to take his bride to
dinner. He said he plans to read some thoughts to her, doing it
quietly so other diners won't be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   I love you: For being a terrific wife and a wonderful mother
when it hasn't been easy. For helping, supporting, and taking care
of me when such was sorely needed. For creating and keeping an
immaculate, warm and cheerful home. And for the fanatistic life we
have had.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to close out with the sentiment, Virginia, I pray we
have many more happy years together. It is with these thoughts I
extend my love to you, on this, one of the greatest days of my
life. Happy 50th Wedding Anniversary. With all my love, Don.

 &HT;    Symons payments to boy viewed as coverup
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett and Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The plain business envelope was waiting
at the reception desk of the bishop's chancellory each week during
the late summer of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Written on the white paper was the name of a former altar boy
from Boynton Beach who was struggling to overcome the torment of
his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Inside was $125 cash that was supposed to help him do it.
</P>
<P>
   The money was left by Rev. J. Keith Symons, bishop of the Palm
Beach Diocese. He told the troubled man's family it came from his
heart and out of his pocket. The parents told him another priest
had assaulted their son, and Symons said he wanted to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was giving it because he liked our son,'' said the
man's mother. ``He said he was a good boy and wanted to help him
out. I never believed that. I thought the whole thing was a
coverup.''
</P>
<P>
   As Symons was making the weekly payments, the mother's two sons,
now in their 30s, were giving prosecutors sworn statements in a
lurid sexual molestation case in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Rocco Charles D'Angelo was being accused by five former
altar boys of assaulting them in the 1960s and 1970s. The boys said
in court papers D'Angelo abused them while he was at St. Mark's
Church in Boynton Beach. Records show D'Angelo admitted being a
molester, sometimes assaulting boys while wearing his priestly
vestments.
</P>
<P>
   Symons was the chancellor of the St. Petersburg diocese from
1971-81 when D'Angelo was moved there from Miami. Symons was the
keeper of the paperwork, the official church records. He was the
administrator who admitted receiving a letter describing D'Angelo's
history as a pedophile in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symons was the man who brought D'Angelo to St. Petersburg,''
said Kevin Sidaway, a 42-year-old Lake Worth mail carrier who was
one of D'Angelo's victims. ``He was responsible for allowing him to
continue the molesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Divito, general counsel to the Diocese of St. Petersburg,
did not return repeated telephone calls Thursday. Symons, church
officials say, is undergoing psychological treatment at an
undisclosed site.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he resigned as bishop of the Palm Beach diocese,
admitting he _ like D'Angelo, his subordinate _ had molested altar
boys decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Symons' departure comes a week after Sidaway announced he'd
settled a lawsuit against the church in the D'Angelo case. Sidaway
is one of at least eight men who say the priest molested them.
</P>
<P>
   Sidaway sued Symons, the Diocese of Palm Beach and the
Archdiocese of Miami in 1996. In court documents, the church later
admitted to the sexual assaults and to placing D'Angelo in
treatment. The church admitted promising victims' parents the
priest would be sent where he could not bother children; instead,
D'Angelo spent 25 years in the Tampa Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person was allowed to work in different parishes around
St. Pete and work with children,'' said Sheldon Stevens, an
attorney for Sidaway and other victims. ``Symons was totally aware.
He hid it from people like the church always does.''
</P>
<P>
   As chancellor in St. Petersburg for more than a decade, Symons
compiled ``the professional psychiatric evaluations that at the
time clearly demonstrated the fitness of Reverend D'Angelo to serve
as a priest,'' he said in a statement to The Palm Beach Post for a
1996 story about the D'Angelo case.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1975, D'Angelo had been in St. Petersburg for seven
years and wanted his affiliation officially transferred from Miami,
according to church documents.
</P>
<P>
   Symons wrote Archbishop Coleman F. Carroll of Miami; the Miami
chancellor wrote back to Symons' supervisor, the bishop of St.
Petersburg, explaining the circumstances of D'Angelo's departure
from South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archbishop Carroll trusts that at the time of Father
D'Angelo's transfer to the Diocese of St. Petersburg, you were made
fully aware of the facts of the case,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boynton Beach mother, who asks that her name be withheld,
said her son went to the Palm Beach Diocese in the summer of 1995
after decades of emotional problems. Symons paid him about $725
cash in all in weekly installments for therapy. He left it at the
desk outside his office at St. Ignatius Cathedral on Military Trail
in Palm Beach Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symons told us he had never heard any bad reports about
D'Angelo,'' the mother said. ``He said he knew nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing pastoral confidentiality, Symons declined comment three
years ago when the payments were being made and later when they
were mentioned in sworn statements to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it an attempt to keep the family quiet,'' Stevens
said. ``Here was a bishop who was supposed to be a protector.''
</P>
<P>
   Three suits remain pending against the Diocese of St.
Petersburg, accusing its officials of knowing about D'Angelo's past
but allowing him in the community anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Sidaway, who was first to come forward as victim and plaintiff,
has settled his suit against the church out of court. He is
continuing a separate case against D'Angelo, who is retired and
believed to be in a Maryland psychiatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vindication comes in the terms and conditions of my
settlement because it will help other children,'' Sidaway said.
``My validation comes from Symons having to resign because he was
an admitted child abuser. I believe the church is corrupt.''

PC PEEP SHOW: COUPLES SHED INHIBITIONS, CLOTHES FOR INTERNET
PROFIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  Editor's note: Web addresses are not included because of the
explicit nature of some of the sites. 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the Oregon couple known in cyberspace as Hubby and
Wifey had a little secret _ they liked to take video and still
pictures of each other when they made love.
</P>
<P>
   But their private pastime became public about a year ago when
Hubby, on a lark, posted a Polaroid of a topless Wifey on an
Internet discussion group.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're making money at it.
</P>
<P>
   The couple regularly posts explicit photos in several forums,
and each posting casually mentions that ``videos are available.''
</P>
<P>
   They've been selling a lot of those videos at about $40 to $50
each. They don't want to say how much money they've made, but it's
a large sum _ enough that they worry that revealing it would hurt
their image as earnest amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey _ who don't want their real names used _ are
among hundreds, maybe thousands of individuals who post nude and
sexually explicit images of themselves online.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't professionals. These aren't porn stars or topless
dancers. They are everyday people who like to show off, and like
Hubby and Wifey, some of them are making good money doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey, who met in high school, are now both 33 years
old. He owns a distribution business; she's a stay-at-home mom with
three young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really just kind of plain-jane plain-Jane people,''
said Wifey. ``If you ever saw us on the street, you wouldn't
recognize us. I look just like a suburban housewife; I'm not very
glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   These provocative images appear in one of two places.
</P>
<P>
   One is in Usenet news groups, thousands of individual discussion
forums on the Internet, each devoted to a specific topic. Some of
the groups are set up exclusively for the posting of erotic
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The other area is the World Wide Web, the part of the Internet
that combines graphics, text, sound and video. There, a growing
number of people who don't consider themselves part of the sex
business are setting up Web sites that feature photos of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sex on the Web is big business, one of the few on the Internet
to turn a tidy profit. Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass.-based
market research firm, estimates that sex Web sites will rake in
$137 million this year, a figure that will jump to $296 million in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that, said Forrester analyst Seema Williams, ``will come
from smaller players. Big name brands don't mean that much in this
business. The brand name doesn't necessarily dictate the type of
product you are going to be getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web is the perfect delivery system for pornography, because
it's very private, said Williams. ``No one is going to see you
walking into an adult video store.''
</P>
<P>
   Pornography on the Net has been largely unregulated since the
U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down as unconstitutional the
Communications Decency Act. That law, crafted as part of
telecommunications reform in 1996, made it illegal to place
``indecent'' material on the Web in a way that it could be
regularly accessible to minors. Since the ruling, several
replacement bills have begun making their way through the
legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of pornographic material on the Internet raises
tempers on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough issue, because it's a free speech issue,'' said
Steven Carr, general manager for Clearsail Communications, a
Houston-based Internet service provider that filters out
pornographic Web sites and news groups on behalf of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Carr, like many who oppose pornography on the Web, said its
open availability is just morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is where the money is made, but it is Usenet where most
of the amateurs begin. Much like Wifey and Hubby, it is usually
through an expression of exhibitionism that generates positive
feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Wifey, who happily admits to an exhibitionist streak, wasn't
upset when Hubby first posted those topless Polaroids. And she was
particularly gratified at the e-mail that poured in from people
wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting 100 to 200 e-mails every day,'' said Hubby.
``It became a kind of game for us _ let's try to guess how many
e-mails we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey gladly obliged and gave the regulars in the
Usenet news groups what they wanted _ extremely explicit photos of
the couple having sex, including still pictures from a high-quality
video camera.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the couple began offering to sell videotapes,
and orders began pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main issue right now is time,'' said Hubby. ``It takes a
lot of time to process all these orders, box up the videos and take
them to the post office.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth it financially _ enough that the couple has paid
an experienced Web site design firm to create Wifey's World, which
will be used to sell their videos in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Web site, we can take credit cards _ that should cut
back on the amount of time we have to spend processing orders,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple speculate that one of the reasons their pictures and
videos are so popular is that ``people are turned on by the fact
that we are monogamous,'' Wifey said. ``I'm madly in love with my
husband, and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Danni Ashe, former topless dancer and soft-core porn film star,
was one of the first professionals to launch a sex Web site back in
1995. Danni's Hard Drive has grown dramatically from the days when
she was designing the site herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I have 17 employees,'' she said. ``We made $3 million
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular venue for online exhibitionists are Web-cams _
live video cameras that show either the intimate details of
someone's life or planned strip shows.
</P>
<P>
   Billy DaMota, a Hollywood casting director, maintains a
tongue-in-cheek directory on the Web of sites that feature women
who take their clothes off in front of a Web-cam and charge money
for it. Customers pay a monthly fee to have access to the cams,
enticed by a free area up front that shows past scenes.
</P>
<P>
   DaMota said his listing began as a parody of another site, but
he soon began getting requests from women who wanted him to include
them on his pages.
</P>
<P>
   DaMota said there are now businesses that set up shop and hire a
stable of women to pose for Web-cams. ``They take half the girls'
money,'' he said, ``just like pimps.''
</P>
<P>
   For many amateurs who want to show off, the Internet is a kind
of safe underground where they can do so without being seen by the
mainstream _ including their relatives, friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   A Maine man who goes by the online name of F1guru began posting
pictures of his girlfriend Tobi late last year. The first shots
were ``very plain _ bathing suits and workout stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobi didn't know about it, but soon found out,'' F1guru said
in an e-mail interview. ``She was positive, but apprehensive at the
same time. I convinced her to let me post a topless picture after
getting a lot of mail asking for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobi became an online sensation, with Usenet regulars clamoring
for more. The couple set up a Web site earlier this year, charging
visitors $14.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two months, we made a couple thousand dollars,'' he said.
``We got about 3,200 hits a day.'' Hits represent people viewing
their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But then, a boyfriend of Tobi's cousin spotted her pictures on
Usenet. Her cousin then told the rest of Tobi's family, who accused
F1guru of taking advantage of her.
</P>
<P>
   After her family confronted her, Tobi asked that the site be
taken down.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey keep their Internet activities away from their
children. And Wifey worries that her religious parents will find
out. If that happens, she said, her days of flaunting it on the Net
will likely be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what bothers me about this _ the children,'' said Carr
of Clearsail Communications. ``What if her children find out? What
if she's in the grocery store one day with her kids and someone
recognizes her and says, `Hey, I know you!'''

IMPRESSIONS IN 3-D: GAMING GROWS UP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Each year at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, better
known as E3, there's some easily defined trend, something that a
journalist looking for a snappy lead paragraph or pithy sound bite
could latch onto.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, E3 was about evolution instead of revolution.
The computer and video game industry, which combined is now bigger
in dollars spent than the motion picture business, is either just
stopping to catch its breath or is in serious danger of maturing.
</P>
<P>
   E3, which is now 5 years old, is easily my favorite trade show.
It's smaller than the megashows such as Fall Comdex and PC Expo,
where productivity often takes a back seat to the sheer logistics
of moving around.
</P>
<P>
   And while there's plenty of hype _ everyone's product is a
``major breakthrough'' that will ``radically change the way you
play'' _ it's fairly easy to scratch the surface and find the tin
beneath the sheen of gold. Rather than professional demo-gods
manning the booths, those demonstrating the games are often the
programmers, artists and designers who've created them, and they're
often honest enough to concede their products' limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent three days last week chatting up these folks and
looking at their wares, I've come to the following conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   _ 3-D video cards have come of age. The first crop of video
cards that could use 3-D graphics was disappointing, to say the
least. Even the second generation lacked the punch necessary to
make them must-have components in consumer systems.
</P>
<P>
   But this latest crop, as well as some that will be available
later this year, make good on the original promise. Video card
chipsets such as Intel Corp.'s i740 and the current 3-D champion,
3Dfx Interactive's Voodoo2, make it possible for designers and
artists to fulfill almost any vision they have.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to do realistic graphics is having a major impact on
game design. The best example I saw was the latest version of
Sierra Online's popular adventure game series, King's Quest.
Subtitled Mask of Eternity, it abandons the series' previous visual
style of Disney-like cartoon characters in favor of a realistic,
3-D design. Sierra's artists and legendary game designer Roberta
Williams are comfortable enough with the quality of this look to
have it become a part of one of the company's franchise titles.
</P>
<P>
   Games such as Ion Storm's Daikatana _ created by John Romero,
the id Software co-founder who was responsible for the game design
in Doom and Quake _ Sierra's Half-Life and GT Interactive's Unreal
show what happens when incredibly talented artists are turned loose
with a technology that has almost no visual boundaries. The worlds
these people are creating constitute a new art form, a kind of
living comic book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR;  Stories are becoming more important. While adventure games
have always relied on plot and characters to draw players into
their worlds, action and strategy games have not. In the past, this
genre has been typified by the kill-it-if-it-moves philosophy of
game play.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   In games like Half-Life, Unreal, GT's upcoming Duke Nukem
Forever and DreamWorks' Trespasser _ a 3-D shooter set in the world
of ``Jurassic Park'' _ blasting away without thinking can be quite
foolhardy.
</P>
<P>
   In Half-Life, for example, one of the creatures you confront is
blind, but has excellent hearing. All you see of the monster is a
set of huge, clawed tentacles that feel their way around the room.
If you run in firing, you're toast _ the thing will pin you with
its claws. The game also has other, computer-controlled humans who
will give you vital information. If you kill them _ or let a
monster take them down _ you may miss something vital.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every game is multiplayer, but who's playing? Game developers
and publishers continue to be frustrated by their seeming inability
to make money with online, multiplayer games. The head of
Electronic Arts complained during an executive forum at E3 that the
company's Ultima Online _ an online-only, role-playing game that
can host thousands of players at once _ brought in just $150,000
but cost $10 million to develop and maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers and analysts say the problem is that consumers see
online PC gaming as a cumbersome process _ many people who own
games with online components don't utilize them because they're
intimidated by trying to get them to work. Others complain that
there's so much free online play available _ such as games like
Quake and Quake II, in which anyone with a PC and a fast Net
connection can host a multiplayer game _ that people are reluctant
to pay for the same experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tradition is not dead. Developers have discovered that
mainstream computer users are most comfortable with traditional
titles they know from classic games. Hasbro Interactive, which was
a nonentity in the game community just 18 months ago, has become a
major force by reviving familiar names such as Monopoly, Boggle,
Scrabble and Yahtzee.
</P>
<P>
   Other publishers are following suit, and also are mining video
game nostalgia. One title drawing a lot of interest was a 3-D
version of Pac-Man, the 1980s icon. Would I sound too much like a
digital fuddy if I admitted I liked the original version a lot
better?

POWERDESK UTILITY HAS FILE VIEWER, MULTIPLE DESKTOPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Remember PC Tools for Windows? The file manager had a viewer
so you could toggle through files in many formats and see the
contents, then open, copy or delete. There was no waiting, and no
programs were launched for viewing. What current program offers the
same features for Windows 95?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ah, PC Tools! I haven't heard or read those words in a long
time _ too long.
</P>
<P>
   PC Tools, from Central Point Software, was easily the best
Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS utility of its day. It competed with
Symantec's Norton Utilities, until Symantec bought Central Point
Software and discontinued the line.
</P>
<P>
   PC Tools for Windows had two great features _ an option that let
you set up multiple desktops, and a file manager that let you
instantly view a data file. Those technologies found their way into
an early Windows 95 product, Norton Navigator. But that product had
a lot of problems, most notably the fact that it bogged down even
the most powerful of computers. Norton Navigator has since been
discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a product that's similar to PC Tools for
Windows. Mijenix's PowerDesk Utilities 98 has a lot of the same
features, including a file manager with a built-in file viewer. It
also includes the multi-desktop feature found on PC Tools. Best of
all, it won't bog down your system.
</P>
<P>
   PowerDesk Utilities began its life about the same time as Norton
Navigator, as an early Windows 95 product from a company called
MicroHelp. That's the same company that developed UnInstaller, the
original third-party uninstall program for Windows. Mijenix now
owns PowerDesk and has done an excellent job of tweaking and tuning
it.

   Q: I recently learned how to build Web pages, and I've put
together a nice little home page for myself. Now I want to put it
up on the Internet, but I'm kind of at a loss. How do I do this?
I'm on America Online _ do I need to switch to a different provider
to make my Web page available?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the best-kept secrets about America Online is that the
service gives each subscriber two megabytes of server space per
screen name for a personal home page. Since AOL allows you to have
up to five screen names, you could command as much as 10 megabytes
of server space!
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, you don't have to switch just to post a home page.
</P>
<P>
   You can post your Web site several ways. If you do a keyword MY
PLACE, you'll find an area that lets you post Web pages you've
created on your own. You can upload the files here, one at a time,
until you've delivered all your graphics and pages to the server.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL also has an area called Personal Publisher (use that as
your keyword), which automates the process of building a Web site
by using a template. If you're a novice, this is the place for you.
You don't need to know anything about Hypertext Markup Language, or
HTML, the code in which Web pages are written. Building your own
page is as simple as filling in a form.
</P>
<P>
   Once you upload your page, it's located either at the
members.aol.com or the home.aol.com server _ the system will tell
you where. You can then point your friends to the site by telling
them to look at the name of the server, followed by a slash and
your screen name. For example, if your screen name is JoeSmith and
your page was on the members.aol.com server, your site's address
would be members.aol.com/joesmith.

SCHOOL KIDS MAROONED ON TREASURE ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Treasure Island School has 460 kids in
kindergarten through seventh grade, with an eighth grade and 140
more kids to come next year. All students are bused from San
Francisco's Tenderloin, Chinatown and Mission neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say the concrete jungle,'' principal Janet Dong
said.
</P>
<P>
   I just adopted this school. It's on an island paradise, except
it's called Willigan's Island (as in Mayor Willie Brown, who has
kept the island off-limits to the general public). That means these
kids need help. It's either me or Quentin Kopp.
</P>
<P>
   You see, the kids are fenced in on an acre of asphalt a
softball's throw from palms and playing fields. But they can't play
there without clearance from the island administration.
</P>
<P>
   They plant little gardens in boxes inside the fence, keep tabs
on the robin in its nest, and the kindergartners play in a patch of
weeds they find glorious.
</P>
<P>
   The only playground equipment on the school's asphalt is a
volleyball net and some balls bought by teachers, and hula hoops
donated by the San Francisco Sheriff's Department, which also has
adopted the school.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet beyond the fence are slides and jungle gyms in the
unused former Navy housing area on Treasure Island, a former naval
base.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of equipment the school needs, but needs help
getting from the island bureaucracy. The principal still hasn't
gotten a response from her request last August for a piece of
playground equipment she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   I immediately called island administrator Annemarie Conroy, who
said: ``It's certainly possible to get the equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   I love being an adoptive columnist. Unfortunately, the school
also needs a $10,000 mat to put on the asphalt under the playground
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are Quentin and I going to wrestle on it?'' asked Conroy,
referring to state Sen. Quentin Kopp, whose Proposition K took the
wind out of Willigan's sails.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows where the money for that mat comes from, when
teachers choked on the $70 insurance fee Conroy's office was going
to charge for two class picnics on an island field Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fee was eventually waived, but only after Sheriff's
Department Capt. Rich Cairns heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rich Cairns did say, `I want to pay for it myself,''' Conroy
said. ``I said I would go to the city attorney to get a waiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy said the kids now can go beyond the school fence without
paying for insurance, as long as they tell her office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say this spot or that spot,'' Dong said. ``It's so
limited. There's no running room.''
</P>
<P>
   Conroy says she's watching out for the kids' safety. She said
recently a class took a walk to an island cove, and some kids went
into the water. ``That was irresponsible of the teachers to let
them in the water,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't in the water,'' Dong said.
</P>
<P>
   Dong is a first-year principal learning how to deal with island
bureaucracy. One thing this experienced educator doesn't have to
learn is how to run a school.
</P>
<P>
   The school sparkles. The walls are covered with projects done on
computers and paintings of scenes from ``Nutcracker,'' which kids
saw with their energetic, cultured 67-year-old part-time gym
teacher, Manuel Tchakalian.
</P>
<P>
   ``This school is very good,'' said Francie Estandarte, a
seventh-grader who has been at the Treasure Island School since
kindergarten, and says he plans to become a gourmet chef. ``They
have no trouble. It's very safe. It's very peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``See, there is a positive thing about our gate policy,'' Conroy
said. ``They can come here and go to school and be children.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's the fence policy I'm concerned with now.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday I was on this island-within-an-island while
kindergartners commemorated the end of their ``first year toward
college,'' as Dong put it.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and kids in the finest clothes stood in a circle
cheering and chanting as blindfolded children took whacks at a
pinata.
</P>
<P>
   Three generations of the Aucar family came over the Bay Bridge
to see 6-year-old Wilda Faride Aucar graduate from kindergarten in
her gown. When I asked her 81-year-old grandmother, Zoila P.
Torres, how she liked the island, she gestured expansively and
said, ``Linda!''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty. It is very pretty, beyond the fence.
</P>
<P>
   This has been the first year the school's enrollment has been
all city kids. When the Navy left, taking its dependents, city
parents were afraid the school would close, and 600 of them signed
a petition to keep it open.
</P>
<P>
   The school brings life to a corner of the island, joy to the
kids and pride to the teachers. One hundred percent of the
seventh-graders, all of whom learned English as a second language,
passed the writing test given by the school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, they live with rats and roaches,'' said Carolyn
Froeberg, who has taught for 12 years at the school. ``Here they
don't have to deal with gangs and drugs. One thing the parents say
when they see the school is the kids can't slip out. It's on an
island.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids didn't seem to want to escape. They watched attentively
on Thursday as middle school boys played soccer against teachers
and parents.
</P>
<P>
   It was fearless soccer. Parents crashed into sixth-grade backs.
Seventh-grade forwards dribbled past puffing teachers and booted
goals between goal posts made of traffic cones.
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks away were real soccer fields with real nets. Unused.
Off-limits. Behind a fence.

WHAT WOULD AN RFK PRESIDENCY HAVE MEANT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the newsmagazines asked the question in a headline:
``What If RFK Had Survived?''
</P>
<P>
   Any number of deep thinkers have tried to provide an answer as
we observe the 30th anniversary of Robert F. Kennedy's death at the
hands of an assassin. Much of the punditry ventures the opinion
that Kennedy would have just plain changed the world if only his
life hadn't ended so abruptly and violently in June 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Schlesinger Jr., an acclaimed historian who served in the
administration of President John F. Kennedy, opined in Newsweek
that everything might have been different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Kennedy's legacy?'' Schlesinger wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A patriot's demand that the republic live up to its generous
ideals; a determination to bring the excluded and desolate into the
national community; a conviction that politics is an honorable
profession; an invincible faith in the capacity of individuals to
make a difference to history; a life and death that confront us
with the republic's unhealed wounds and unfulfilled possibilities
...''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. Was this guy running for president when he died, or
sainthood?
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy aficionados such as Schlesinger believe that an RFK
presidency would have saved the nation and the world from many of
the terrible things that occurred in his absence: the continuing
Vietnam War; the continuing cycle of poverty and despair;
paralyzing scandal and the growth of public cynicism about
government and politics ...
</P>
<P>
   That's speculation, of course. Others might speculate that
President Bobby Kennedy would have presided over an unbridled
expansion of the welfare state; a debilitating dismantling of the
national defense; the undermining of America's health-care system
through the imposition of socialized medicine; and, last but not
least, the long-term strangulation of the nation's economy
resulting from Kennedy's voracious appetite for taxing and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't read much about such possibilities in the media
because the media remain mesmerized by the Kennedy mystique. Never
let facts stand in the way of a good story: If cruel fate hadn't
intervened, one of the Kennedy brothers would have led us to the
promised land.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like fantasy land to me, but maybe I'm one of those
cynics who would have been spared the anguish of cynicism if only
Bobby had ascended to the throne. Maybe I'm too cynical to
understand what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I wasn't cynical at all back in 1968 as I
geared up for my first vote in a presidential election. As a
first-time voter, I was in the market for an idealist to vote for.
</P>
<P>
   I figured my best hope was Eugene McCarthy, who stepped up to
the plate and took on Lyndon B. Johnson in the New Hampshire
primary while RFK lurked in the shadows, agonizing over the hazards
of challenging the incumbent president of his own party. Kennedy
didn't throw his hat into the ring until McCarthy demonstrated
Johnson's vulnerability by nearly pulling off a gigantic upset in
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   It must be noted that all the projections about what Kennedy
might have achieved are based on the premise that he would have
been president _ that he would have won his party's nomination and
defeated Richard Nixon in the general election. Neither of these
eventualities was anywhere close to the foregone conclusion that
Schlesinger and others would have us believe.
</P>
<P>
   But what if Bobby had become president? Would he have saved the
world, as Schlesinger believes? Or would he have left the world a
bigger mess than he found it, as his detractors would suggest?
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd be inclined to lean toward the bigger-mess
theory. But who knows?
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that RFK was a man of great compassion and
insight, particularly when it came to those who were shortchanged
by society. One of his fondest dreams was to bridge the gaps that
separate Americans by race, class and even political philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   If he'd achieved that dream, we might be saying now that nobody
cared what else he did or didn't do.

<P>
   Although overshadowed by all the hyperbole about Baptists going
to Salt Lake City to convert Mormons, one of the biggest issues
facing Southern Baptists at their convention next week is
``submission of women.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptists meeting Tuesday through Thursday at the Salt Dome are
expected to add a passage to their statement of faith declaring
that the wife should ``submit graciously to the servant leadership
of her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement on ``submission'' is part of a larger
pronouncement supporting only heterosexual marriage and declaring
that children should obey their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting the statement on submission of women would be another
example of the extreme rightward swing of the 15.9 million-member
Southern Baptist Convention _ the nation's largest Protestant
group.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it would show the dramatic differences between moderates
and conservatives in the denomination. Not that the two factions
aren't already irrevocably split.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates, following their ouster from power in the 1980s,
have formed their own organization, called the Cooperative Baptist
Fellowship, which, in effect, already is a separate denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Moderates _ who claim they are the ``real'' Southern Baptists _
are becoming more open to having women in major leadership roles,
including deacon and senior pastor. But not all moderates agree on
that, either.
</P>
<P>
   Whether one is a conservative or a moderate, though, statements
about women submitting to their husbands likely will be a
controversial subject.
</P>
<P>
   One Bible verse cited by those drawing up the ``submission''
statement is Ephesians 5:22-25.
</P>
<P>
   It states: ``Wives be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord.
For the husband is head of the wife, as Christ is also head of the
church. ... Husbands love your wives just as Christ also loved the
Church.''
</P>
<P>
   The submission pronouncement is anti-feminist but not
``anti-woman,'' says conservative Baptist leader Paige Patterson,
who is a shoo-in to be elected president of the Southern Baptist
Convention next week.
</P>
<P>
   His election would also be an emphatic indication of how
conservative the Southern Baptist denomination has become.
Patterson spearheaded the conservative revolution of the 1980s and
now is president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in
Wake Forest, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Patterson's wife, Dorothy Patterson, is one of the
most powerful women in the denomination. She is an author, editor
of a popular Woman's Study Bible published by Thomas Nelson, and a
popular teacher and speaker throughout the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she says, she submits to her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for modern women to understand that,'' she said.
``And it's not always easy for me. But the final decisions in our
home are made by Paige.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all biblical, Dorothy Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the headship of the man even in Genesis,'' she said.
``Even before Eve was created, you have Adam, who is to provide for
the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Baptists, such as the Rev. Buckner Fanning of San
Antonio, said the statement on submission is another example of
``fundamentalists'' taking the Bible out of context.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Dilday of Fort Worth, a leading moderate and president
of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, which is separately
governed from the national convention, said the desire to add a
statement supporting families is commendable.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the view of submission of women to men and limiting their
places of service is not consistent with all the Scripture,'' said
Dilday, who is a professor at Baylor University's Truett
Theological Seminary. ``The Bible speaks of equal submission of
husbands and wives to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Baptist conservatives who insist on male leadership can take
some lessons from the Mormon leaders they will be visiting in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, like the most
conservative of Baptists, does not allow women to be pastors or
priests. None of the ruling hierarchy of Mormons is a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it was in the Savior's church,'' said Stephen
Posey, president of the Mormon mission governing young missionaries
in the Fort Worth area and West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons, conservative Baptists, and some Episcopalians and Roman
Catholics, for that matter, use the argument that because Jesus' 12
apostles were all males, priestly leaders of the church should all
be males.
</P>
<P>
   So conservative Baptists and Mormons, although at odds over many
theological matters, will be in agreement this week about keeping
women in their submissive places.

   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin finds himself in a country
which does not actually belong to or obey him any more.
</P>
<P>
   This is not only because it has become apparent that the Russian
president, as true of Mikhail Gorbachev once, feels much more
comfortable abroad than in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's popularity is down because Gen. Aleksandr I. Lebed's
is up.
</P>
<P>
   By winning the race for governor last month in the vast,
mineral-rich, southern Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, Lebed, the
48-year-old, high-profile, former paratroop general, also wins
himself a place in Russia's presidential elections in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   By now it seems that not merely Lebed won a new place in
Russia's national limelight. Another factor won: It is the new hope
which has won out. Should Lebed prove to be able to maintain this
hope until Russia's presidential elections, he will enter the
Kremlin, sweeping aside all the other candidates _ including the
beleaguered Yeltsin or any Yeltsin-backed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does not like Yeltsin any more. In Lebed, it has a new
magician now or, perhaps, a new trouble on its hands. But the fear
of possible trouble is outweighed by what is almost sacred for
Russia _ a hope, a new fairy tale. For with the Krasnoyarsk
victory, millions in Russia are prepared to believe in a new fairy
tale, in a new ``father of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, of course, this military man, as commander of the
14th army division, used his power and influence to finally put a
stop to the bloody Chechen war. For that, he earned not the
congratulations, but the enmity of Yeltsin, who saw in it the
ambition of a rival to be president. As such Yeltsin sacked Lebed
from his job as Russia's top national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, Yeltsin is still able to make a number of the
unpredictable moves characteristic of him. After all, this
president enjoys rights under a Constitution tailored to suit him
and he may once again choose to shake the world by some extravagant
escapade. But he won't accomplish anything of substance.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Lebed will have a seat on the Federation Council,
the upper house of Russia's Parliament. He holds a popular moral
authority _ indeed an immunity which Yeltsin himself used to enjoy
from any real or imagined accusations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, unless Lebed fails to learn anything from the mistakes
made by his former and present rivals, he is likely to enter the
Kremlin no matter what barricades are thrown up in his path.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes are rather obvious; the general must have memorized
them by now. Lebed will not try to play the role of a rowdy
politician like the ultra-nationalist Zhirinovsky. He will not
confuse people with statements about restoring Sevastopol and
Crimea to Russia like Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov does. He will not
get himself televised after midnight in saunas or houses of ill
repute. He will not hasten to write books and keep the profits. He
will not order from France pedigree cows or indulge himself in
finding new wives and lovers.
</P>
<P>
   By now, having secured for himself a serious chance to win the
presidency, Lebed is not going to make frequent trips abroad,
ingratiatingly holding ``friend Helmut Kohl'' by the waist or
jesting with Mr. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed has already established that his one and only love is
Russia. No one doubts this. With some talent, he has recruited to
his support all those ``insulted and humiliated,'' from Kaliningrad
to Nakhodka, who are disillusioned with and rejected by the
government and Yeltsin. This growing number of Russia's dejected
will vote for Lebed in 2000, or more accurately against any
candidate nominated by the government or, even worse, backed by
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   With all that has befallen Russia _ the collapsed economy, the
social decline, the unpaid salaries, the disappearance of public
services _ Yeltsin will not be helped out in the next elections by
the tricks that have worked in prior races: not the Moscow bankers'
money, nor the intellectual horror of the Moscow elite, nor the
Federation Council's gubernatorial jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   The most helpless one in this tussle will be President Yeltsin.
Even now, those surrounding Yeltsin, in their minds, have already
fled. As for the power structures and the military that Yeltsin has
in fact been leaning on since 1993, while trying to appear loyal to
him, they will try to coordinate their every move with every move
Lebed makes. The generals may wear the stars that Yeltsin pinned on
them, but they will serve him looking over their shoulder at the
other man.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also danger. The measure of confidence the newly
elected Krasnoyarsk governor is going to get if he wins the Russian
presidential elections will make people accept not just his
presidency, but also his dictatorship. Lebed will be saying that
his rule is a special brand of leadership _ a monarchy of the law,
conscience and order. Who will argue against it in Russia's current
poverty-stricken state?
</P>
<P>
   As for fascism, no one has proven yet that Russia is afraid of
fascism. Yeltsin has already laid a foundation of tolerance toward
limited fascism and, in many cases, the State Duma has openly
sabotaged the passing of antifascist legislation.
</P>
<P>
   As for the vaccination against fascism the people are said to
have received, this is a dangerous myth. Those who lived under
communism are not to be intimidated by fascism.
</P>
<P>
   Now about money.
</P>
<P>
   They say that despite an $80,000 limit on spending set by
Krasnoyarsk's regional law, Lebed's victory cost a fantastic sum of
money, and that should the ``oligarchs'' who in the past found it
in their interests to support Yeltsin, erect a strong political
obstacle for Lebed, the general would not be able to scrape up the
rubles to pay his fare to Moscow. But it is also reasonable to note
that a change of heart could see them voluntarily contributing to
the ``Lebed of Krasnoyarsk,'' so that he might become the ``Lebed
of Moscow'' _ with no gratitude guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if Lebed gains in popularity and scores further victories,
one of the chapters in future Russian history is likely to be
called ``oligarchs in the general's servants' room.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Lebed seems to be sure to win, unless something
extraordinary intervenes.

 JODY WILLIAMS and the EMBATTLED LANDMINE CAMPAIGN  
 By JAMES BANDLER  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    Jody Williams opened the door of her office and looked in at an
alarming scene.
 &HT;    Everything from the furniture to Rolodexes, Coke bottles, coffee
cups, and spoons was missing, and holes had been punched in the
walls and ceiling. It was November 1989, and rebel forces in El
Salvador had launched their most serious offensive on the capital
in 10 years of civil war.
 &HT;    Williams' San Salvador office at Medical Aid for El Salvador was
among several humanitarian agencies that were sacked and robbed.
 &HT;    Williams, an intense and determined Vermont native, had no doubt
about who was responsible for the looting. Government forces had
long suspected that humanitarian groups were sympathetic to the
rebel cause, and Williams believed they had used the rebel
offensive as an opportunity to search the offices for propaganda
and weapons. When the fighting in the capital eased, she drove to
the headquarters of the Salvadoran military's high command, a drab,
cement-block building atop a man-made hill, overlooking a
shantytown of cardboard shacks.
 &HT;    Escorted into a sparsely furnished room, she stood face to face
with six colonels in camouflage, the leaders of the armed forces in
El Salvador.
 &HT;    ``I remember clearly thinking that if they could kill me, then
and there, for what I represented or for what they believed I
represented, they would,'' Williams recalls.
 &HT;    Williams wanted restitution for the damages and a written
apology. She left without getting either, but a few days later, the
chief of staff of the Salvadoran defense forces, Col. Rene Emilio
Ponce, did the unthinkable: He wrote a letter of apology, in effect
admitting that the government had sacked the office and noting his
support for Medical Aid for El Salvador's work.
 &HT;    ``You have no idea how important that letter was to us,''
recalls Mario Velasquez, Williams' boss at Medical Aid. ``We used
to call it the Golden Letter. With this letter, we gained the
respect of the military, so they were no longer messing with us.''
No one else in El Salvador had the courage to confront the
colonels, Velasquez says. ``Jody Williams did.''
 &HT;    Since her days as a young girl, when she defended her deaf and
schizophrenic brother from the tin cans and taunts of neighborhood
kids, Williams has cast herself as a foe of bullies and a Lone
Ranger for peace.
 &HT;    For years, she toiled in obscurity: first, trying to alleviate
the suffering caused by the ``Reagan-Bush wars,'' as she called the
conflicts in the '80s in Central America; later, in the job that
would win her world renown, as a top organizer of an international
coalition dedicated to the elimination of land mines around the
world.
 &HT;    In six years, the coalition that Williams helped assemble grew
from a handful of humanitarian groups into a campaign that
encompassed more than 1,000 organizations. It enlisted the support
of mine victims and mine-clearance experts, peace and disarmament
groups, sympathetic politicians, diplomats, four-star generals and,
most famously, the late Princess Diana.
 &HT;    To recognize this extraordinary effort, the Nobel committee in
Oslo, Norway, bestowed its Peace Prize last year jointly on
Williams and on the coalition that she helped build, the
International Campaign to Ban Land Mines. Two months after the
prize announcement, 122 nations signed an international treaty in
Ottawa banning the production, sale and use of anti-personnel land
mines.
 &HT;    ``Jody acted as the nerve center of the campaign,'' says
Susannah Sirkin, of Physicians for Human Rights, in Boston, one of
the six founding organizations of the campaign. ``She was driven by
a single-minded focus to keep this thing going, literally staring
down those who would stand in the way.''
 &HT;    But the same character traits that catapulted the now
47-year-old Williams to Nobel glory _ her brashness, bluntness and
lone-wolf style of leadership _ have made her a lightning rod for
controversy.
 &HT;    She has been attacked in the press by former colleagues as an
imperious self-promoter and as an out-of-control employee who
hogged all of the credit and half of the prize money. She's been
accused of betraying the ideals of the land-mine campaign and
flouting the wishes of the campaign's steering committee by putting
herself forward for the peace prize.
 &HT;    At the center of this unhappy drama is Williams' rift with her
former employer, Robert O. Muller, the head of the Vietnam Veterans
of America Foundation, the Washington, D.C.-based group that hired
her to coordinate the land-mine campaign. Muller, whom Williams had
at one time described as her best friend and mentor, fired Williams
three days before the prize was announced. The dismissal was the
culmination of months of mounting tension between the activists.
 &HT;    ``Jody is the ultimate loner,'' Muller says. ``You can only go
so far by yourself. That's part of the problem. She doesn't work
well at all with a team.''
 &HT;    Williams, lashing back, accuses her former colleagues of
jealousy and sexism, because, as she told one reporter, ``girls do
all the work, boys want the recognition.''
 &HT;    One of the unspoken commandments of humanitarian and peace work
is: Thou shalt not seek celebrity. And if fame comes, renounce it
quickly. Otherwise, beware thy colleagues' wrath.
 &HT;    U.N. mediator Ralph Bunche understood the importance of humility
when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 for his efforts
to bring an end to the war between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. ``I
am one man working for the United Nations,'' he said, firmly
rebuffing suggestions that he was a hero. ``Without the U.N., I am
nothing.''
 &HT;    Williams, critics say, has failed the Bunche test miserably.
They say she drove to Vermont from her apartment in suburban
Virginia just before the Nobel recipients were announced, so that
she could greet the international press corps alone, far from her
Washington, D.C., colleagues. Williams, who notes that she'd been
fired three days before the Nobel announcement, says that she drove
to Vermont to celebrate her birthday.
 &HT;    Whatever her intentions, the choice of location made for
brilliant theater: She stood alone in her grassy yard near a beaver
pond, barefoot and wearing a black tank top, blasting the president
of the United States as a ``weenie'' for refusing to buck the
Pentagon and support a land-mine ban.
 &HT;    Many of the articles that ran in the next day's newspapers
portrayed Williams as a hard-charging, backwoods hero who, by
tapping into the Internet from her ``rustic farmhouse,'' had
single-handedly galvanized citizens to rise up against an insidious
weapon _ all in defiance of the United States, the world's sole
remaining superpower.
 &HT;    The story made good copy, but it was, at best, misleading. Many
people played critical roles in the success of the campaign,
including Thomas Gebauer, of the German group Medico International
and Muller, of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, who
conceived the idea; sympathetic politicians such as U.S. Sen.
Patrick Leahy, of Vermont and Lloyd Axworthy, the Canadian foreign
minister; Princess Diana, who focused international attention on
the cause; and hundreds of mine victims and mine-clearance experts
around the world.
 &HT;    But Williams _ who was an employee of Muller's foundation, which
paid her $70,000-a-year salary and travel expenses _ sees herself
as the key figure in the effort. ``It started with me,'' she
asserts, ``and five years later, there were 1,200 non-government
organizations in 60 countries involved.''
 &HT;    Williams also angered many colleagues by keeping her $500,000
share of the prize money, thereby violating another activists'
commandment: Thou shalt not get rich. And Williams' public
complaints about the $230,000 tax bill she faced struck a sour
note.
 &HT;    Critics say she could have donated her share of the prize to the
campaign or to land-mine victims. Instead, almost half of her prize
money will go to the U.S. Treasury and much of it will be spent by
the Pentagon, which has opposed the land-mine treaty from the
outset.
 &HT;    Muller, a former Marine lieutenant, who was determined to rid
the world of land mines, had been paralyzed below the waist in
1969, while shot through the chest, charging a hill in South
Vietnam. His anger and activist fire were forged during his
rehabilitation at the Veterans Administration medical center in the
Bronx, where he was appalled at the filthy conditions and despair.
 &HT;    He joined the antiwar movement and was thrown out of the 1972
Republican National Convention for attempting to shout down
President Richard M. Nixon. He led the campaign to secure financial
restitution for U.S. soldiers who were victims of Agent Orange and
headed the first delegation of American veterans to return to
Vietnam, in 1981.
 &HT;    He was the hero of the 1975 Vietnam documentary ``Hearts and
Minds'' and a real-life inspiration for the ``cool rockin' daddy''
of Bruce Springsteen's anthem, ``Born in the U.S.A.'' A man of
almost messianic charisma, Muller inspires fierce devotion among
his staff.
 &HT;    During visits to Cambodia in the 1980s, Muller was stunned by
the number of land-mine victims _ according to one recent estimate,
one out every 236 people in that country is an amputee _ and by the
appalling lack of care. Muller's organization, the Vietnam Veterans
of America Foundation, which he founded in 1980, set up a
prosthetics clinic in Cambodia, but the catastrophic toll exacted
by hidden mines convinced him that victim assistance was only a
Band-Aid for a problem that demanded much more.
 &HT;    All over the world, workers from humanitarian groups were
reaching similar conclusions. The Red Cross estimates that 24,000
people are killed or maimed by land mines each year, most of them
civilians and many of them children. According to the U.S. State
Department, there are between 80 million and 110 million land mines
buried in 71 countries around the world, most in developing
countries.
 &HT;    In October 1991, Muller and Thomas Gebauer, of the German aid
group Medico International, decided to try to unite numerous
humanitarian, development, and peace groups under the banner of an
international campaign. The goal, as framed by Muller and Gebauer,
was an international ban on antipersonnel land mines.
 &HT;    A month later, impressed by Williams' intensity and organizing
track record at Medical Aid for El Salvador, Muller asked her to
come on board as the campaign coordinator.
 &HT;    Within a year of the hiring of Williams, four other
non-governmental organizations _ Human Rights Watch, Handicap
International, the Mines Advisory Group and Physicians for Human
Rights _ joined the campaign. Together with Medico International
and Muller's veterans foundation, these organizations formed a
steering committee to provide direction to the effort to ban land
mines.
 &HT;    Volatile and self-assured, Williams had a famous exchange during
the Ottawa Conference, in 1996, a strategy session for banning land
mines that brought together representatives from 70 governments.
The head of the French delegation, Michel Declos, an Old
World-style diplomat, told the conference that France supported a
ban but reserved the right to use land mines when militarily
necessary.
 &HT;    Several delegates signaled for Williams to stand up and rebut
him. Leaning toward the microphone, Williams said that the
``distinguished representative'' of the French delegation could not
have it both ways: supporting a ban in peacetime but using mines in
wartime. His proposal, she said, was ``better than a stick in the
eye, but not much.''
 &HT;    It was an extraordinary moment: a member of a non-governmental
organization lecturing a diplomat. With Williams leading the
charge, other participants at the conference began denouncing the
French proposal. On the last day of the conference, Lloyd Axworthy,
the Canadian foreign minister, astonished everyone with a heady
challenge: He called on the nations of the world to return to
Ottawa in 14 months to sign an international treaty outlawing land
mines.
 &HT;    However, once close friends, Muller and Williams were barely
speaking during 1997, and the gulf between their strategies was
widening.
 &HT;    The two had very different world views. Muller believed that a
treaty to ban land mines would be a hollow victory without American
support, because the United States was the only country in the
world with the clout and credibility to persuade nations such as
Russia and China to sign on and to ensure adherence to the treaty.
Williams disagreed. The most important countries to have on board,
she believed, were nations that used mines: the Angolas and
Cambodias of the world. The United States could sign later if it
wanted.
 &HT;    The two also disagreed about tactics. Muller had hired a
lobbying team of pollsters and media experts, headed by former
White House aide Patrick Griffin. Williams called the group ``the
sleaze team.'' The campaign, she felt, was being cited as a new
model of diplomacy, one in which average citizens and
non-governmental organizations forced governments to agree to a
weapons ban. She did not think it needed a Beltway PR machine.
 &HT;    Muller thought Williams and her allies were naive about the way
Washington worked. Conservative members of Congress and Army
generals were not going to be swayed by grass-roots campaigning.
Still, he agreed that Griffin's work should be kept as low-profile
as possible.
 &HT;    On Oct. 7, 1997, Muller fired Williams officially. Three days
later, at 4 a.m., the phones at her Vermont home started ringing.
Williams and the campaign had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
In December, the historic Ottawa treaty was signed by 122 nations,
banning the use of antipersonnel land mines.
 &HT;    In May, in an important policy shift, the Clinton administration
announced that the United States will sign the Ottawa treaty as
soon as it finds alternatives to its mixed landmine systems. It has
set a goal of the year 2006.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, since the controversy over the landmine campaign and
the Nobel Prize hit the pages of the Los Angeles Times, the
Washington Post and The New York Times, Williams has been besieged
with requests for interviews. This is the last personal interview
she will be granting for a while, Williams promises; she will not
further indulge a ``media story gone amok.''
 &HT;    ``I'm not interested in talking about me,'' she says. ``Contrary
to what some in the campaign think, I'm not into being a famous
person.''
 &HT;    Williams says she will spend her time working as one of the
campaign's official unpaid ambassadors, formulating political
strategies and giving speeches to ensure that the treaty signed in
Ottawa is ratified, implemented and enforced.

RAZOR'S EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROYAL FORD  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    Watch Quania's eyes. Dark beneath her broad forehead and furrows
of braid, they reveal nothing. She keeps them distant.
 &HT;    As the bus called ``the 28'' rumbles along Blue Hill Avenue
toward Grove Hall, Quania looks straight ahead. She does not watch
the chattering groups of other teen-age girls, doesn't look at
anyone's clothes or face, certainly doesn't cast a glance at any
boy sitting with a girl.
 &HT;    Later at Grove Hall, where a building of squat shops curves
around a corner, two girls face each other in a darkened doorway,
their backs to the doorposts. Quania's glance in their direction is
too stealthy to be seen: ``I almost looked over at them, but I
looked right back away,'' she says, her tone almost apologetic.
 &HT;    At 15, Quania Daniel, a sophomore at Boston English High School,
already has learned the danger of a misinterpreted glance _ a
glance mistaken for superiority or haughtiness, for a sneer at
another girl's appearance or for flirting with someone's boyfriend.
 &HT;    Here in Grove Hall, behind the Beulah Holmes Holiness Center, a
girl pulled a knife on Quania one night a few months back. It was a
confrontation sparked by a glance Quania might have cast _ though
she doesn't remember it _ at the Chez Vous roller rink up the
avenue.
 &HT;    When the knife came out, she walked away. Chicken, some girls
called her. Smart, she calls herself.
 &HT;    But the next night, she happened to run into the girl again at
Grove Hall, and this time they did fight, fist-to-fist _ ``up and
up,'' as Quania says, distinguishing it from fights with weapons or
fights where a group of girls jumps a lone victim. ``I didn't lose
that fight'' is all she will say about it.
 &HT;    She was lucky to have a fight end so cleanly. One of her
friends, tied by rumor to another girl's boyfriend, had her face
slashed with a box cutter just a block down from Doyle's, the
Jamaica Plain tavern where warm friendships and conviviality
abound.
 &HT;    Until about 10 years ago, teen-age girls seldom fought each
other _ even with fists. They did not carry knives and razors and
box cutters. They did not form roaming packs and attack other
girls. They did not fight with sticks, bats, bricks.
 &HT;    Today they do. And that has made the world of many girls like
Quania a terrain of fear, a place where caution is essential. The
threat is not just in the cores of cities. It exists in
Massachusetts at the Quincy Center MBTA stop; at a trailer park in
Concord, N.H.; at a school in York, Maine.
 &HT;    Violence by teen-age girls is not yet a deluge, but its steady
escalation, even as overall crime rates in the nation are falling,
is troubling.
 &HT;    Consider these recent crimes by girls:
 &HT;    In Roxbury, Mass., two 15-year-olds use razors to slice the arms
and forehead of a 16-year-old girl.
 &HT;    In Concord, N.H., four girls surround a 14-year-old girl as she
gets off a school bus at the mobile-home park where she lives and
beat her with baseball bats.
 &HT;    In Revere, Mass., a state trooper is brought down by a
15-year-old girl who jumps him from behind after he stops her
father for a minor traffic violation.
 &HT;    In Cromwell, Conn., two 18-year-olds are charged with using box
cutters to slash the necks of two other teen-age girls.
 &HT;    In Rhode Island, a girl who was 13 at the time of the killing is
sentenced to 45 years in prison for the murder of a 23-year-old
single mother she shot in the head in a fight over a man.
 &HT;    And in Springfield, Mass., a teen-age girl holds up a young
mother at gunpoint, then beats her victim's 18-month-old child with
the pistol.
 &HT;    Kathleen M. O'Toole, the state's secretary of public safety,
recalls that when she was a Boston street cop in the 1970s and
'80s, girls were arrested rarely, and then only for nonviolent
crimes such as shoplifting. In the mid-1980s, however, that began
to change, and the rise in violence has been steady.
 &HT;    Since 1987, according to the FBI, the number of violent crimes
committed annually by boys under 18 has risen from 51,653 to 78,853
_ a 53 percent increase. But that is less than half the percentage
increase among girls during the same period: Violent crime by girls
under 18 climbed 118 percent, from 6,418 incidents to 13,995.
Aggravated assaults were up 124 percent; robberies, 117 percent.
 &HT;    Guns are rarely the weapon of choice for girls _ at least for
now. They opt for less deadly weapons, such as razors, box- and
carpet-cutting knives, sticks, bats, fists. Before teen-age boys
turned to guns, sometime in the mid-1980s, they too used knives and
razors, and that leaves open the question of whether girls will
also turn to guns as the taboo on violent female behavior fades.
 &HT;    Still, the total number of girls committing violent crimes is
small compared with boys. Meda Chesney-Lind, professor of women's
studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and co-author of the
recent book ``Girls, Delinquency, and Juvenile Justice,'' cautions
that the perceived increase in teen-age female violence may be
partly a result of greater attention to the problem by police and
the news media.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the shift has been perceptible enough that
educators, social workers, judges and police are worried that if
the trend continues, girls might achieve a perverse equality in
crime, an achievement nobody would cheer.
 &HT;    Now Quania is in a program trying to stay out of violence and
help other kids do the same. But she knows it's not easy.
 &HT;    Time was, a teen-age girl living in bad circumstances did one of
two things: She either retreated into herself, becoming the
hollow-eyed waif who said little in school and maybe even quit
altogether, walking through the days full of pain and
submissiveness; or she got pregnant, because pregnancy meant escape
and, with another life dependent on her, a vestige of power.
 &HT;    Today, girls have a third way to go wrong: by striking out in
violence.
 &HT;    The triggers can seem trivial. A girl might attack someone she
thinks looks down on her clothes, her hair, her family. Somebody
sizes up her boyfriend, maybe. Or somebody looks as if she wants to
rise above their shared lot, by dressing well, studying hard,
refusing to hang in the neighborhood or joyride on the streets or
country roads.
 &HT;    Most girls who turn to violence are reacting to the same
circumstances that have long been blamed for breeding violence
among boys. They come from dysfunctional families, learning at home
about abuse: of their bodies, of drugs and alcohol, of their own
esteem. What they don't learn there they pick up on the streets.
They form cliques that a decade ago might have been merely vocally
abusive but today are assault squads.
 &HT;    This generation of girls spends many hours after school without
parental supervision. But what is new is that they do it in the
company of boys, and as the equals of those boys. Just as some boys
and girls hang together today in positive ways, as groups of
friends, not couples, so others hang together in destructive
pursuits.
 &HT;    ``They're acting like they do because of the way the boys
behave. They don't want the boys to have one up on them,'' says Joe
Mascaritolo, the assistant director at Madison Park
Vocational-Technical High School, in Boston. ``You see it more in
groups of boys and girls all being together, all trying to be
equals.''
 &HT;    But there is irony in this, says Sibylle Artz, a professor of
children and youth care at the University of Victoria, in British
Columbia. The girls who become violent and so feel they are
achieving power do it not by becoming powerful young girls but by
stepping out of gender, by acting like violent young men.
 &HT;    Part of the influence on girls is the music that many listen to,
as well as the movies, television shows, fashion ads and news
programs that emphasize power and violence. Artz points
specifically to music videos, which entered the culture shortly
before the first increase in violence among girls was noted.
Perhaps significantly, many videos portray women as powerful by
virtue of their potential violence.
 &HT;    Complaints about the effects of pop culture are not new, but the
level of violence among girls is rising just as girls are tuning in
to this culture in record numbers. In 1997, for the first time,
more girls bought CDs, records and tapes than boys. Li'l Kim, the
rap singer, calls herself the Queen Bitch and sings of sex and
excess _ to the sound of a gun being cocked.
 &HT;    Quania recalls a number with the refrain ``slice you up'' and
marvels that one song she loved by Master P turned out, once she
got past the beat and heard the lyrics, to be a recipe for
producing crack cocaine.
 &HT;    ``These girls are not becoming violent out of thin air,'' says
Martha P. Grace, chief justice for the Massachusetts juvenile-court
system. They emerge from ``a constellation of parental neglect,'' a
world where they have ``either witnessed violence endlessly on TV,
in their home, or they have been violated by a parent or someone
else.''
 &HT;    ``Women judges may sometimes be the first women they encounter
who are not powerless,'' Grace notes. This is so even though women
today are more powerful than ever in business, medicine, the law,
the trades, sports and many other realms. Women in these roles
often exist beyond the ken of troubled teen-age girls. But a shadow
of that social shift has fallen across their world: Girls now see
they can rise in the world of violent crime.
 &HT;    Frenia learned most of her bad ways on the street, or in classes
where she wasn't always paying attention. Like Quania, she is
working hard to keep her own life in order and help others at the
same time.
 &HT;    To that end, eight teen-age girls are at ease, sitting around a
make-believe living room. Bone-Net, played by Charlene Johnson, has
invited her girlfriends in to watch TV, and they're finger-flicking
through the channels. The flashing images trigger memory and
reaction in each of the girls.
 &HT;    One by one, they rise on the makeshift stage in the cafeteria of
the Clarence R. Edwards Middle School, in Charlestown, Mass. Each
has a lesson in danger to present to an audience of her peers.
 &HT;    A young woman named Precious stands to tell of her dilemma: Her
friends Trisha and Toya are at each other, she says, and she is
worried that their vocal dispute will turn violently physical. Toya
has already threatened Trisha: ``You're that girl who was talking
bad trash about me,'' and ``I'm going to beat your behind,'' with
eight other girls to help.
 &HT;    Caught in the middle of impending violence between two friends,
Precious asks the audience what she should do. ``I don't want to
get cut up over nobody.''
 &HT;    Several hands shoot up immediately. Talk to your friends, one
student suggests. Tell them violence is no way to go, remind them
that they are friends. Get them to sit down and talk this out.
 &HT;    Precious's real name is La 'Toshia Leathers; she's a member of a
traveling troupe of high school students. The group puts on skits
illustrating some of the dangers teen-age girls face, then invites
the audience to talk about avoiding such pitfalls. Called teen-age
Girls InFormed, the troupe was put together by the Massachusetts
Prevention Center, at the Medical Foundation in Boston, and is
supported by the public school system.
 &HT;    A discussion such as this is one of several ways in which
schools and public officials are beginning to confront the problem
of escalating violence among adolescent girls. Some programs are
aimed specifically at them, while others that once targeted boys
have been expanded to include girls.
 &HT;    In some communities, teen-agers are recruited as peer leaders in
their schools; in others, officials have set up downtown drop-in
centers for troubled youths. Still other programs, such as teen-age
Girls InFormed, hope their cautionary tales will reach young people
before violence happens.
 &HT;    The audience on this afternoon, at least, appears to be engaged
in Precious' story. Later, other characters rise: Blue, whose real
name is Marilyn Jean, acts the part of a drunk, telling how she
forced a girl who didn't drink to slug down some liquor. ``It's not
my fault she choked on her vomit,'' she says. ``It's not my fault
she died.'' The audience groans in disapproval.
 &HT;    As the session continues, actors come forward to talk of date
rape, of more drinking, of more violence. They ask the audience to
respond: Who was at fault in the date rape? Should a drunken mother
be reported to the social service department? How do you stop
drinking? How do you stop fighting?
 &HT;    Today, Frenia is a peer leader for Teen Empowerment, a South
End-based outreach program with offices in three Boston high
schools: Madison Park, English and Dorchester. Peer leaders try to
help steer troubled youngsters away from violence by teaching them
to express their anger and frustrations in ways that are vocal, not
violent.
 &HT;    ``They learn violence at home,'' Frenia says. ``They aren't
respected and they end up not respecting themselves. And how are
you going to respect anybody else if you can't respect yourself?''
 &HT;    Teen Empowerment tries to teach self-respect by encouraging kids
to talk about what is troubling them, in casual gatherings after
school, without dictating solutions. Instead, a peer leader, such
as Frenia or Quania, uses her own experience to help peers work out
answers for themselves.
 &HT;    While programs such as these seem promising, no one is sure yet
what will work best. Yet the studies that Artz and others have
done, in both Canada and the United States, offer some clues to
what might work. It seems the skits presented by teen-age Girls
InFormed are useful because they present tangible problems, inspire
discussion and propose nonviolent options.
 &HT;    The issue is critical, because the question that logically
follows the surge in violence among girls is frightening: Will the
trend continue, mimicking the level of mayhem among boys?
 &HT;    Hopefully not. Moreover, girls appear to learn from one another
in ways that boys, long ingrained with the notion that
aggressiveness is natural, do not. Many are hoping this will be a
key to the battle.

FROM LAWN CUTTER TO MULTIMILLIONAIRE: THE BLUE-COLLAR MIRACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   For release: June 7 or thereafter  
 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    As a teen-ager growing up on Long Island in the 1970s, Robert
Bertuglia Jr. used to get bored fast.
 &HT;    ``Toys, cars, girls _ I'd go through one after another,'' he
says.
 &HT;    He barely graduated from Copiague High _ ``Basically I cheated
my way through.''
 &HT;    But what he loved, what he gave up the beach for, skipped school
for, quit sports for, what filled his free time and made his mind
race, what never, ever bored him was work.
 &HT;    ``I picked up my first lawn mower at 15,'' he says in a way that
makes you envision Mickey Mantle reaching for his first Louisville
Slugger. He started on neighbors' lawns. Then his mother, a
waitress, began driving him around town, the power mower sticking
out of the trunk of their Chevy.
 &HT;    He took $250 from his earnings and bought a '58 Studebaker
pickup to haul the mower. While still in high school he hired his
first workers and began doing landscaping for businesses too.
 &HT;    When he realized that the lawn of practically every office
building he wanted to cut had the same sign out front _ ``Property
of Racanelli Realty'' _ he paid a visit to the large real-estate
developer's headquarters.
 &HT;    On a Monday at 9 a.m., dressed in a clean T-shirt, the teen-ager
introduced himself to the receptionist. ``I'm here to discuss
landscaping,'' he said. She told him the Racanelli brothers would
be tied up all day. ``I'll wait,'' he replied.
 &HT;    Around 4, he overheard her say, ``Marty, this kid's still in the
lobby.''
 &HT;    Marty and Nick Racanelli were curious. ``I told them I wanted to
do the landscaping maintenance on all their buildings,'' Bertuglia
said. They laughed but gave him one building, as a lark. Then more.
 &HT;    He was still living at home, and there were days his corporate
clients phoned and his mother said, ``He's outside playing
football, who's calling?''
 &HT;    A few years later when the Racanellis were having trouble with
their cleaner, they asked Bertuglia to try. ``I said, `What do I
know about cleaning?''' he recalls. ``Marty says, `What's to
know?'''
 &HT;    He was 22, had eight people working for him and after cutting
grass all day, he cleaned the building himself at night. ``Money
wasn't the issue,'' he says. ``I needed to see if it was something
I could expand.''
 &HT;    The year 1981 was a golden time to start a cleaning company. The
Reagan revolution was fresh under way; the air-traffic controllers'
union had just been broken. Businesses and municipalities were
looking to cut costs by laying off in-house union crews and
outsourcing work to companies such as Bertuglia's that paid
cleaners pennies above minimum wage. One of his first big contracts
was the Nassau County court complex.
 &HT;    ``They wanted to get rid of _ I don't want to use `get rid of' _
phase out the union cleaners,'' Bertuglia says. ``We were low
bidder.''
 &HT;    And so began the rise of Robert Bertuglia Jr. Today Laro Service
Systems is one of the largest privately owned building-service
companies in New York, with 1,800 workers and $50 million in annual
revenue. It is the company that cleans the Port Authority Bus
Terminal in Manhattan, the international terminal at Kennedy
airport and Orlando airport.
 &HT;    Most famously, it is the company the Giuliani administration
hired in 1995 to do the unloading at Fulton fish market, after
organized-crime-related operators had been kicked out and were
threatening bloody murder and there was so much fear, no one except
Laro would bid the job.
 &HT;    Cleaning is, as they say, ``24-7'' _ 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week, and those are nearly the hours Bertuglia kept for two
decades. His first retail store was a Marshall's in 1983.
Bertuglia, his brother-in-law and Lou Vacca Jr., now the Laro vice
president, cleaned it themselves.
 &HT;    ``We'd never done a retail store,'' says Vacca. ``Robert sold
them a bill of goods to get us the job. ... We'd been working all
day, and did this at night _ we were so tired, Robert slept on the
floor for three hours.'' That led to getting all the Marshall's
stores on the Island, then Caldor, Kmart, J.C. Penney.
 &HT;    Often they bid low just to win a prestigious job, the goal being
to grow. ``It wasn't so much the money,'' Bertuglia says, ``it was
the action.''
 &HT;    They won the contract to clean Ellis Island, then the Statue of
Liberty. Bertuglia was figuring it out as he went, and there were
times in the 1980s when he didn't meet his payroll. His car was
repossessed, his phone shut off. He didn't pay his federal taxes,
and only after his brother-in-law Jimmy Latham and his neighbor
Bobby Vetter took second mortgages on their homes to lend him money
did he pay off the tax liens.
 &HT;    And still he pushed growth. ``You couldn't let down,'' he said.
``Another company could always take it away.'' He'd sleep four
hours. ``I came home, ate and slept, that was it. My wife was with
the kids. I didn't see my son growing up. I spent time, but not
quality time. I was always thinking about the next job, the next
problem, who was yelling at me on the phone.'' On weekend outings,
he'd take his three kids to see buildings Laro was cleaning.
 &HT;    By 1990, he was making real money and decided to move from the
ranch house he'd bought for $36,500 a decade earlier. He picked a
6,000-square-foot house for $650,000 on the water in a gated
community in Islip, then spent $600,000 renovating.
 &HT;    He could have lived anywhere, but he picked that gated community
because the first millionaire businessman he'd ever met, the
developer Martin Racanelli, lived there.
 &HT;    ``After we moved in, Marty invited me over to his house for
drinks _ cocktails _ and congratulated me,'' Bertuglia says. ``It
was a great moment, yeah. I used to do that man's lawn! I didn't
feel like the head porter any more. I'd become a company. I was in
a million-dollar house in a million-dollar neighborhood _ I had
doctors and lawyers for friends, for constituents, as they say.''
 &HT;    But he didn't get to savor it. ``About the time I finished
renovating, I moved out,'' he said. ``I'd worked so much, it
contributed to my divorce.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    If ever there was a metaphor for America's booming economy, it
is Laro Service Systems. There's great money to be made for the
people at the top and good money for the 200 middle-level managers
_ many with only high-school degrees. They are part of a new class
of service-industry entrepreneurs, the blue-collar rich.
 &HT;    In 1982, at the start of the Reagan revolution, there were
29,000 self-employed Americans making more than $100,000 in
industries such as cleaning, landscaping, food preparation,
warehousing; today there are 80,000 (with both years calculated in
1996 dollars). Since 1980, membership in the Building Service
Contractors Association has tripled, to 3,000 companies.
Competition is fierce; it is capitalism at its rawest.
 &HT;    Laro managers live in a world where victory goes to the lowest
bidder and where the standard cleaning contract has a 30-day
termination clause, meaning at any time your company can get knifed
in the back and dumped onto the street.
 &HT;    ``How do you do it cheaper?'' asked Vacca, the vice president,
who makes $80,000 a year. ``You take it out of the labor.''
 &HT;    In February, Laro beat out 10 bidders to win a $17 million
contract at Orlando airport. Laro had a month to hire 280 workers
in a state where it had never done a job. A team of Long Island
managers was rushed to Orlando and spent weeks working out of a
motel.
 &HT;    Even after the April start-up there was no rest _ their pay
scale was so low, they had 25 cleaners quitting every day and were
constantly hunting replacements. ``I worked three straight days
with no sleep, I slept six hours in five days,'' Vacca said.
 &HT;    Laro's hard-charging management style is good news for
taxpayers. The company's bid to clean the Port Authority terminal
was a million dollars less than the union contractor's it beat out.
 &HT;    Laro is good news for profit-hungry publicly held companies
looking to push up stock prices by cutting costs. In the midst of
this economic boom, Kmart, J.C. Penney and Bell Atlantic have all
demanded that Laro cut its rates _ or they'd find another company.
And Laro did. Laro is good news for the public. Commuters say that
the Port Authority Bus Terminal has never been cleaner.
 &HT;    Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro, who considers eliminating the Mafia
from Fulton fish market one of Giuliani's great feats, gets
rhapsodic about Laro, making Bertuglia sound like Errol Flynn, a
``true hero'' who ``stepped into the breach.''
 &HT;    But even Ken Fisher, a Democratic city councilman and no
Giuliani fan, says there's been great savings because of Laro.
 &HT;    About the only people Laro has not been good for is cleaners _
who account for 1,500 of Laro's 1,800 employees and typically earn
$5.80 to $7 an hour. They are economically worse off than cleaners
of a generation ago.
 &HT;    In 1980, says Michael Baratz of the Service Employees
International, union janitors in big cities earned $10 an hour. But
developers had overbuilt and went hunting ways to slash costs.
Building owners defied the union and by the mid-'80s, the heavily
minority work force was earning minimum wage in many places. They
have never recovered.
 &HT;    After a decadelong union campaign in Los Angeles, dubbed Justice
for Janitors, owners signed a union pact in 1995 _ for $6.80 an
hour.
 &HT;    Even in New York City, a union stronghold, where members in
service workers' locals average $32,000 a year, labor's might has
been eroded. Membership has fallen from 70,000 to 52,000 in recent
years as companies such as Laro make inroads. The union used to
wreak havoc by striking, but a walkout in 1996 was far less
effective as Laro and other cleaners provided 15,000 replacement
workers.
 &HT;    ``That strike was good,'' Bertuglia said. ``We picked up two new
buildings out of that _ I hope they strike again.''
 &HT;    Bertuglia went head to head over the bus-terminal contract with
the legendary president of New York's service workers, Gus Bevona
(the city's highest-paid union leader, with a salary of more than
$400,000). In January 1996, Laro took over the terminal, planning
to cut the work force 30 percent. Union cleaners put on new Laro
uniforms, and on the third day staged a surprise early-morning
walkout. Bertuglia was ready.
 &HT;    ``A union guy inside tipped me,'' he said. ``At 4 a.m. I got
beeped.'' He had interviewed 400 replacement workers and had their
phone numbers. By 4:30 a.m. the secretaries were at their desks in
Bay Shore. ``The girls in the office made the phone calls,''
Bertuglia says. ``By 9 we were up and running.''
 &HT;    The bus terminal is now a nonunion job. Since 1996, two pickets
holding signs saying Laro is unfair have stood daily outside the
Eighth Avenue entrance, squeezed between a police barricade and a
wall, invisible.
 &HT;    These last years, Bertuglia says, more companies are demanding
contract reopeners that reduce cleaning rates.
 &HT;    ``Everyone's making money but they want to make more,'' he says.
From Laro's $50 million in revenues, he expects a profit of 1.5
percent.
 &HT;    Some days Vacca feels as if his head is caught in a mop ringer.
Laro's sales force works on commission and bids low to win jobs;
then Vacca must figure out ways to squeeze the cleaners. When Laro
was taking jobs from union workers, it was easy to reduce labor
costs. But these days, bidding against other nonunion companies or
replacing low-paid in-house crews at retail stores, it's like
wringing blood from a stone.
 &HT;    One morning Vacca raced into a Wal-Mart to drop off a bid to
replace the in-house crew. How does Laro clean Wal-Mart cheaper
than Wal-Mart? ``I'll get as many part-timers as I can,'' Vacca
said. ``I don't have to pay the benefits, vacation, holidays.''
 &HT;    There are places where you cannot skimp. Laro was hired by
Schiphol, a Dutch company, to clean Kennedy airport's international
terminal. Schiphol has an office on the terminal's second floor.
Laro assigned its best janitor, Nelson Cardona, a Colombian
immigrant, to spend his entire eight-hour shift in the second-floor
men's room.
 &HT;    ``This is the bathroom Schiphol executives use,'' said Mike
Conlon, Laro's Kennedy manager. ``A strategic location. You should
hear them rave about this bathroom. They love Nelson; he owns this
bathroom.''
 &HT;    Indeed, I saw something I'd never seen in a restroom when I
walked in _ Cardona, dressed in Laro blue, was sponge-mopping the
walls.
 &HT;    When Cardona (who speaks little English) is asked how he likes
Laro, he says, Better than the previous cleaner. ``They paid me
$5.80. Now I make $7.''
 &HT;    Laro's Conlon added, ``When we saw how good Nelson was, we upped
him to the top rate _ didn't want to lose him.''
 &HT;    After getting the Kennedy contract last year, Bertuglia wanted
to show some gratitude to his new cleaners. At Thanksgiving he sent
a truck full of turkeys to the airport.
 &HT;    ``We've made a couple of bucks, no question about it,''
Bertuglia says. ``A lot of these guys work for $5, $6 an hour _ to
get a 20-pound turkey from the boss is something special.''

CALIFORNIA'S GLOW DIMS AS EVIL LAWS PASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the mid-'60s, and graduation day couldn't come soon
enough, especially for several of my classmates who knew exactly
what they would do after receiving their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Several of my friends had decided that right after high school,
they would leave town, headed for some place they felt would be
much better than their home of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rest of us knew that the would-be pilgrims were
serious about their plans to leave, most of us were amazed _
shocked even _ to learn they actually had boarded a Greyhound bus
for Los Angeles that very week.
</P>
<P>
   For them, California was the Promised Land, filled with
opportunities they thought they could only imagine in their home
town.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that after my first visit to Southern California
(the summer after completing third grade) the Golden State did seem
to have a special magic, and I'm not just talking about Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   So, I understood how my high school classmates could look upon
the state, with its palm-lined streets, beaches, mountains and
multicultural society as a place of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my friends were just finishing the first grade when the
Supreme Court declared that separate-but-equal schools are
``inherently unequal'' and therefore unconstitutional, and that we
should integrate ``with all deliberate speed.'' Still they, as I,
went through 11 more years of a segregated education because there
were people in our town, in Texas and throughout the South who felt
that little black boys and girls should not go to school with
little white boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   So, my young friends (thanks to God and Greyhound, as the
country song says), went west, convinced they would be able to see
new sights, dream new dreams and live new lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them enrolled in school, mostly at Los Angeles City
College, and others found work.
</P>
<P>
   They wrote home talking about how great California was, and how
they were especially happy in the Land of LA LA.
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't be long before some of us, who went off to
school and returned home to our various careers, realized that
while many of the California gang were doing OK, some (maybe most)
were simply existing.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Promised Land was practically barren as far as
they were concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Still, California for years held on to its special mystique,
thanks partly to Hollywood and partly to a population of
transplants who wrote to relatives back home singing its praises.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, California's mean streak has been showing
brighter than the reflection of the Golden Gate Bridge at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   There is an evilness that has engulfed the state, causing it to
turn on itself in the name of some deranged conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   It started 20 years ago this month with the passing of
Proposition 13, which limited property taxes and, in so doing,
terribly crippled California's once-fine public school system.
</P>
<P>
   There would be other mean-spirited selfish initiatives. The
state would pass term limits for the Legislature, mainly in an
attempt to get rid of powerful, and effective, Democrats like
former Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (another Texas transplant).
</P>
<P>
   More recently we've seen the move to take away social services
for illegal immigrants, the dismantling of affirmative action
programs and, just this week, the abolition of bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   California is definitely losing its glow. Perhaps that's what
the residents want _ to make the state so bad that it will be less
attractive to outsiders who might want to take up residence there.
If so, they're doing a terrific job.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my friends who were on that Greyhound bus over 30 years
ago have come home, proving Thomas Wolfe wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They have left behind a state that most definitely is not a
Promised Land. In fact, it is quickly turning into a land with
little promise.

RFK'S LEGACY ALREADY HAS OUTLIVED THAT OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He was the president's brother. He was his campaign
manager, his attorney general, his closest confidant in the
signature confrontations of the day _ with Nikita Khrushchev, who
planted missiles on Cuban soil and fear in American hearts, and
with Jim Crow, who held so much of America in his cruel grip.
</P>
<P>
   But now, 30 years after he was shot, Robert Francis Kennedy _
linked with his brother in the White House years, linked with him
in one of the tragic public deaths that helped define the Kennedy
decade _ finally is on his own in the pantheon of public memory.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable today is not that three decades have passed
since Bobby Kennedy won the California primary and then vowed to
fight on in Chicago, where the Democrats were planning their
national convention. What is remarkable today is the durability of
Bobby Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother's world and worries are gone, Camelot in a
time capsule. His own world and worries are right there, out the
front window, and right here, on the front page of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy's battles _ in Vietnam, in Laos, in the Congo _ are
over. Bobby Kennedy's battles _ in the cities, in the marketplace,
in the moral heart of the nation _ are still being fought.
</P>
<P>
   He was not a president, just a senator. He was not a party
nominee, just a candidate. He was not a party elder, just an
insurgent. And yet for all that, Bobby Kennedy remains a vivid
figure, a giant of his generation, a symbol of his time.
</P>
<P>
   RFK is, moreover, one of only five men in our history known by
his initials; the others, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, and Lyndon Baines Johnson, were
all presidents. Before the year is out, the Republican Congress
almost certainly will vote to name the Justice Department building
after Bobby Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three decades after he lay mortally wounded in the
kitchen of a Los Angeles hotel amid the last truly riveting
presidential nomination battle of the century, Bobby Kennedy seems
a distinctive part of the contemporary American landscape while his
brother, the first president born in this century, increasingly
seems like a figure from the historical past.
</P>
<P>
   Their deaths were only five years apart _ indeed, this November
marks the 35th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination in
Dallas _ but the two events now seem separated by ages.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy died amid the certainties of the Cold War. Robert
Kennedy died amid the uncertainties of America's role in the world.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy challenged Americans to bear all the burdens of
leadership. Bobby Kennedy challenged the nature of that leadership.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy wanted America to show toughness in the world.
Bobby Kennedy wanted ``to make gentle the life of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Kennedy's vision, his approach, his faith, his uncertainty
_ they are, every one of them, still here today.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't believe in the welfare system or the welfare culture.
He was skeptical of big-government solutions. He trusted in the
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have created a system of hand-outs, a second-rate set of
social services which damages and demeans its recipients, and
destroys any semblance of human dignity that they have managed to
retain through their adversity,'' Bobby Kennedy said. ``In the long
run, welfare payments solve nothing, for the giver or the
recipients; free Americans deserve the chance to be fully
self-supporting.''
</P>
<P>
   You can hear that kind of speech any time these days, in the
House Republican Conference _ or in the White House, where a
Democrat has lived for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Often, in his last campaign, for the presidency in 1968, Bobby
Kennedy would confront signs, hand-written, almost surely intended
to be cutting and cruel. They said something like: ``Bobby Ain't
Jack.'' He wasn't trying to be.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, President Clinton wrote a short foreword to an
evocative pictorial book on RFK's 1968 campaign. In it he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``He fought to close the chasm between working-class whites and
blacks while others sought political advantage in prying them
apart. He was skeptical about bureaucracies and programs _ as if
either could solve our problems without private and individual
efforts. He spoke plainly and passionately about hunger, about the
unequal distribution of wealth and power in America, about ending
apartheid in South Africa, and about the glories of citizens taking
responsibility for their own actions and their own behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The landmarks of Bobby Kennedy's passage _ his agony over the
problems he found in Mississippi and Africa, his worries about the
gap between rich and poor, his struggle with applying economic
solutions to social problems _ are part of the challenge, present
even in this time of tranquillity and prosperity, to build a
society that fosters both prosperity and justice, that is diverse
but united.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is discrimination in New York, apartheid in South
Africa, and serfdom in the mountains of Peru,'' he said during a
visit to South Africa. ``People starve in the streets of India;
intellectuals go to jail in Russia; thousands are slaughtered in
Indonesia; wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere. There are
differing evils, but they are the common works of man.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy governed a nation that had come to enjoy life lived
at an andante tempo, and was alternately inspired and chary of the
faster pace he promised. Bobby Kennedy spoke to a nation that was
marked with an agitato style, and was unsettled by war and
insurrection. John Kennedy was classical, Bobby Kennedy was
romantic. John Kennedy was consonant, Bobby Kennedy was dissonant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough to allow dissent,'' the younger brother said.
``We must demand it. For there is much to dissent from. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Kennedy was one of those who, as Keats wrote, ``feel the
giant agony of the world,'' one of the ``slaves to poor humanity''
who ``labor for mortal good.'' The quotation was one of RFK's
favorites, and he chose it for the opening of his chronicle of the
13 terrible days of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his death, Hallmark Cards Inc. published a little
hardcover collection of memorable inspirational quotations from
RFK. It bore a simple title, ``Robert F. Kennedy: Promises to
Keep.'' The promises he made _ for a more just society, for a
richer appreciation of our own diversity _ remain unfulfilled at
the precipice of a new century.
</P>
<P>
   For all his imitators, and in Washington they appear with more
regularity than Elvis impersonators, John Kennedy would be
incongruous in Washington today. His sense of style was rooted in
the verities and customs of the years preceding World War II. He
may have been the television president, but he was tied to the
old-time bosses. He may have portrayed himself as a rebel, but he
was bound by the old ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Kennedy knew no such bounds. They were broken by his
brother's assassination, and by the failure of the establishment to
give way to change in the mid-1960s, and by the pain of his own
loss, and by the anger of his countrymen, whether in the ghettos or
in the draft boards or in hippie communes or the everyday lives of
men and women who tried to keep their families together as their
country flew apart.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy's causes are gone, and so, for the most part, are
his men. Bobby Kennedy's causes live on, and so, to a remarkable
degree, do the men who surrounded him. You can see them every day,
on Capitol Hill, in law offices, in the capital's conversation.
Today they have a special presence in Washington, and a special
aura of moral power.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, in a funny way, does Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy was known as ``Jack,'' but say the name today _
make a casual reference to what ``Jack'' was thinking _ and no one
in the capital where he reigned for a thousand days will know for
sure whom you are talking about. But utter the two syllables of
Robert Kennedy's nickname _ just say the word ``Bobby'' in
McCormick and Schmick's downtown power-lunch restaurant, or in the
Speaker's Lobby of the House, or in the White House Mess _ and
everyone within earshot will know to whom you refer.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will know you are talking about Robert Francis Kennedy,
senator from New York, winner of the California primary, possible
nominee of the Democratic Party, shot in the pantry of the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, June 5, 1968, and pronounced dead
at 1:44 a.m., June 6, 1968. He was 42 years old.

A KOREAN ``COMFORT WOMAN'' TELLS HER STORY IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ She cannot wake up from a nightmare that started
almost 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She was only 14 when she was forced to leave her home in Korea
and become a ``comfort woman,'' a sex slave to Japanese soldiers
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Bok Dong, now 72, wants the world to know about the
suffering that she and an estimated 200,000 other comfort women
endured. She also wants Japan's government to apologize and provide
financial reparation.
</P>
<P>
   Kim told her story through an interpreter Thursday at a luncheon
sponsored by the Washington Coalition on Comfort Women Issues,
which earlier issued a plea for help from the United States to get
reparation from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition said 63 House members support a resolution that
says Congress believes Japan should apologize for the war crimes
committed by the Japanese military during World War II and pay
reparations.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has refused to compensate the women with
public funds, saying such claims were settled by postwar treaties.
Instead, Japan created a private fund that has offered to pay
$18,600 each to the former comfort women.
</P>
<P>
   However, the women insist that reparations should come directly
from the Japanese treasury.
</P>
<P>
   An exhibit illustrating the women's experiences, sponsored by
the coalition, the Human Rights Caucus, and the Women's Rights
Caucus, is on display through June 12 at the Cannon House Office
Building.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, wearing a pale green, silk han-bok, a traditional Korean
dress, described how the Japanese soldiers took her from her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese generals told our parents that we had to go work
for a military factory,'' she said. ``They said that we would make
uniforms and be able to save money, go home, and get married.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead she was taken to a comfort station, where the soldiers
raped her every day, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a young girl. I didn't even know what sex was,'' Kim
said. ``I was just captured, and these boys approached me like
wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although telling her story is painful, she said she and other
former comfort women must get the word out to bring justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our days are limited, but we have to do this for the second
and next generation,'' said Kim, who lives in a communal home
called the House of Sharing with seven other former comfort women.
``We have been liberated long ago, but we have yet to receive
reparation.''
</P>
<P>
   Losita Nacino, 70, a former comfort woman originally from the
Philippines, said that she, like Kim, was 14 when Japanese soldiers
robbed her of her childhood and her dignity.
</P>
<P>
   The comfort women resisted, she said, but were powerless to
escape. ``We had nothing that we could do,'' she said. ``We were
only women. They were men, and they had guns.''

IT'S HARSHBARGER'S RACE TO LOSE _ AND HE WON'T
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So Saturday is payback time for all those who love to hate Scott
Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   The earnest prosecutor with 16 years of playing cop under his
belt tries to make the leap to governor. And the Democratic State
Convention in Worcester offers the last best chance for those he's
crossed to get even.
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor, a plodder, and a Protestant, the former
Middlesex County DA (eight years) and attorney general (eight more)
has stood outside the State House zeitgeist and rubbed a lot of
Beacon Hill insiders the wrong way. The party regulars, the
in-crowd, the party lifers who never warmed to Harshbarger's
call-'em-by-the-book style in political prosecutions, can try
tomorrow to gang up on the Democratic front-runner in the
gubernatorial nomination roll call.
</P>
<P>
   From the day US Representative Joe Kennedy bailed out, this has
been Harshbarger's race to lose. And he won't. In polls, money,
delegates, endorsements by sitting legislators, he has a big
advantage over Patricia McGovern and Brian Donnelly.
</P>
<P>
   And in terms of profile, Harshbarger's claim on the nomination
dwarfs that of either the former state senator or the onetime
congressman. As AG, Harshbarger can make news any day he wishes. As
the only candidate in the diminished Democratic field who's run
statewide (twice for AG), Harshbarger is deeper in breadth, depth,
reach, and field organization.
</P>
<P>
   His policies place him squarely in the center of the Democrats'
urban-suburban matrix: pro-women, pro-education, pro-labor;
antigun, antitobacco, anticasino. Personality, not policy, is his
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Once he clears the convention tomorrow, Harshbarger can look
forward to clear blue water and easier sailing. The package he
offers primary voters, plus his advantages in money and name
recognition, should make him the nominee in September unless he
totally blows it.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern should easily clear the 15-percent hurdle for delegates
to make the primary, but Donnelly will probably need some help from
his friends. If any established Democrat thinks Donnelly is likely
to be the nominee, I have not met that person. And if the most
serious charge leveled against Harshbarger is that he hasn't
``taken off ... nailed it down ... taken this thing to the bank,''
then that goes double or triple for McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to see why some important Democratic insiders are
cool to Harshbarger. The AG's longstanding indifference to small
political courtesies and the backscratching to which insiders are
accustomed has cost him.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Tom Menino's bloc of Boston delegates will likely go to
McGovern. The mayor is still peeved that Harshbarger dug his
pitchfork into the City Hall Plaza tiff, and Hizzonor likes Acting
Governor Cellucci, the overall favorite still.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Tom Finneran's leadership team is all over the
map, some with McGovern, some with Harshbarger, and the speaker
himself, a friend expects, will vote for fellow Dorchester boyo
Donnelly.
</P>
<P>
   The hard fact for the Harshbarger operation is that both Menino
and Finneran would prefer to deal with a re-elected Republican
governor they already know and like than an off-putting fellow
Democrat with an independent streak wider than Beacon Street. So
they'll be busting no rocks, and no heads either, in the mayor's or
the speaker's office to make life easier, or vote tallies higher,
for Harshbarger. The curious lack of Democratic unity extends to
some in the congressional delegation, who seek revenge for
Harshbarger's probe of this pol or that one or who, like US
Representative Marty Meehan, seem to view Harshbarger as a threat
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a poor Protestant prosecutor with a long, spiffy
record to do in September to try to unify a party whose barons,
earls, and satraps see no need to help him win against a
make-no-waves incumbent flush with cash?
</P>
<P>
   One option is for Harshbarger to nationalize the governor's
race: Assume Cellucci will top Treasurer Joe Malone in the GOP
primary, begin now to link Cellucci to national GOP icons who are
unpopular hereabouts, and raise cain, hob, and holy hell with
Kenneth Starr, Newt Gingrich, Trent Lott, Jesse Helms, et al.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a stretch. Yes, it's a long shot. Yes, Cellucci is
ditching almost any position (save perhaps the death penalty?) that
smacks of the Bible Belt. But Cellucci has so much money he won't
be able to duck the congressional leadership's antipathy to reform.
The pieces can fit.
</P>
<P>
   And Gingrich and Lott are _ how to put it? _ enormously
unpopular here. Some of the national controversies you can count on
for debate are tobacco, campaign reform, and Starr's jihad against
Clinton. Harshbarger already has strong positions on the first two,
and after a bungled effort to get on both sides of the independent
counsel probe, Harshbarger is presumably cognizant that Democratic
voters don't want him lining up with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   By casting Cellucci as a stand-in for unpopular GOP figures and
policies, by running ads morphing the Acting Guv into Gingrich's
beady-eyed image, Harshbarger can run hard for November beginning
now. Democrats don't want to see him pounding either McGovern or
Donnelly; better he beats up on the GOP's Newt-niks.

UPLIFTING FRENCH HIT STRIKES A UNIVERSAL CHORD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIUS AND JEANNETTE &QC; 
Directed by: Robert Guediguian &QC; 
Screenplay by: Guediguian, Jean-Louis Milesi &QC; 
Starring: Ariane Ascaride, Gerard Meylan, Pascale Roberts, Jacques
Boudet, Frederique Bonnal, Jean-Pierre Darroussin, Laetitia
Pesenti, Miloud Nacer, Pierre Benderet &QC; 
Playing at: Coolidge Corner (in French with subtitles) &QC; 
Running time: 102 minutes &QC; 
Unrated &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Marius and Jeannette'' is a sunny and endearing throwback to
the physically cramped but spiritually expansive cinema of Marcel
Pagnol. Like Pagnol, filmmaker Robert Guediguian grew up in
Marseilles and says he wouldn't dream of making films anywhere
else. But the fact that ``Marius and Jeannette'' has become a huge
hit in its native France reminds us that it fills deeper needs than
those afforded by regional filmmaking. Although it's very specific
in its depiction and celebration of hardy working-class characters
leading a mutually nourishing communal existence in the shared
courtyard of their old tenement dwellings, it offers an embracing
vision of proletarian solidarity underpinning a modest but luminous
love story between a security guard and a single mother fired from
her supermarket checkout clerk job for complaining about working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   It's the easiest thing to sentimentalize everyday types, but
``Marius and Jeannette'' avoids the trap, partly by daring to
embrace a frankly retro belief in the dignity of workers struggling
to keep food on the table, partly by never allowing its highly
politicized passions to get in the way of its joie de vivre. Ariane
Ascaride's Jeannette meets Gerard Meylan's Marius when he discovers
her about to make off with two cans of paint salvaged from the
about-to-be-dismantled cement factory he's guarding in Day-Glo
coveralls as he brandishes a rifle with a telescopic sight.
Scarcely has Ascaride's scrappy Jeannette bawled him out for being
a class traitor by refusing to let her take the paint than he shows
up at her exfoliating quarters with paint and roller, ready to
pitch in and help.
</P>
<P>
   Ascaride, who won a French Cesar for this role and who is
Guediguian's wife and muse, is a firebrand when it comes to
sticking up for her rights, and a tender, concerned mother raising
two kids alone ever since the father of the younger one was killed
by a falling scaffold eight years ago. It helps that the children _
Laetitia Pesenti's Magali, who can't wait to be an investigative
journalist, and Milou Nacir's Malek, a precocious Koran scholar _
are not only nice kids, but star pupils who shine at school and
never add to their caring and hard-working mother's load. Meylan, a
friend of Guediguian's since childhood who has acted in all his
films but makes his living as a night nurse in a Marseilles
hospital, balances Ascaride's spontaneity with a sensitivity tinged
with gravity and reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In the virtually plotless film, which Guediguian freely admits
is resolutely rose-colored when it comes to the embattled working
class, the conflict that moves the romance forward does not escape
contrivance. But of more importance is the allure of the
characters' little patch of turf in L'Estaque, the northern port
district of Marseilles, immortalized by Cezanne and Gauguin in
paintings that now ironically hang in millionaires' homes. Marius
(whose name echoes that of one of the films in Pagnol's famous
Marseilles trilogy) finds himself bonding with Jeannette's extended
family of neighbors as well as with her and the children. It's been
a long time since any film has been so animated by benevolent and
passionate energies _ the reason, no doubt, for the film's surprise
success in an otherwise pervasive Western social and cultural
vacuum. ``Marius and Jeannette'' harks back to the
solidarity-driven films of the great Jean Renoir, reminding us that
art says more than speeches ever can when it speaks from the heart
and not from theory.
</P>
<P>
   The film's benevolent spirits include Pascale Roberts's
concentration camp survivor who places a high value on life,
Jacques Boudet's retired teacher who patiently enlightens the
neighborhood kids while romancing Roberts in his halting way,
Jean-Pierre Darroussin's laborer whose wife won't let him live down
the fact that he once voted for the right-wing National Front, and
Frederique Bonnai, as the activist wife who reminds him that
everything becomes a political act, right down to choosing which
brand of beer to order. The film opens with a wonderful image _ an
inflated plastic globe, turned upside down, bobbing along a
waterway until it gently bumps to a stop at the cement steps of the
cracking, weed-ridden neighborhood at which we're about to
disembark. As the characters mix their aioli communally in a stone
bowl, ``Marius and Jeannette'' offers a simple human alternative of
neighborliness to the alienation that keeps workers (and would-be
workers) fragmented. Charmingly, it asserts that finding the
courage to love, and in doing so reclaiming your life, is a
political act, too. ``Marius and Jeannette'' is a radiant little
proletarian fairy tale.

RIVEN TO DESPAIR BY THE GOLDEN DOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I've been stuck at the same place in Riven for
almost a month. How do I get into the golden dome?
</P>
<P>
   _ Frustrated
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FRUS: Just follow the fine example set by presidents, major
corporations, millions of taxpayers and my last six wives: Cheat
your rear end off.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe you have that pride thing going, but get a grip. Are
you going to spend the next two years of your bleak little life
staring slack-jawed and red-eyed at a cruelly mocking computer
screen, coming up with even more and more improbable, incorrect
solutions to your little quandary? Or are you going to rejoin us
here on Earth? It's just a game! You lost!
</P>
<P>
   By the way, I've been inside the dome. Nothing there but more
impossible-to-solve puzzles that will drive you crazy and your wife
to a divorce lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   You've given it a fair shot. It's time to take it like a French
soldier and run up the white flag. Fortunately, for cheats and cads
like us, there is a whole subculture of gamers more than willing to
help.
</P>
<P>
   From the instant a new game hits the shelves, it's as if there's
a contest to see who can finish it first and post the solution on
the Internet. Sure, the game manufacturers may try to bleed another
20 bucks out of you for an official hint book, but you can get the
same stuff for free if you know where to surf.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, try doing a Yahoo! or Excite search with this
phrase: ``Riven and cheat or walkthrough.'' You'll discover entire
Web sites devoted to cheating your way through life. Second, if
you're still foolishly clinging to that bizarre concept of honesty
and morality, try checking out news groups, those bulletin boards
of badinage, banter and bull. Subscribe to some of the gaming
groups. You'll find ones devoted to Riven and Myst, its
predecessor. Here, you can trade hints back and forth, and you only
have to spoil as much of the thrill of conquest as you need to
maintain your sanity.
</P>
<P>
   And, last, if you were so worried about ethics, you wouldn't
have claimed your computer room as home office space on your tax
return, especially not since you just admitted to the whole world
that all you do is play games there. Don't worry, the IRS doesn't
read this column. Well, not very often, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I use the Internet regularly, although just to
access Web sites. I never use chat rooms, etc. Do I need anti-virus
software?
</P>
<P>
   _ Mr. Clean
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CLEAN: Venturing anywhere on the Internet without a virus
scanner is as dangerous as using a bus-station toilet. There are
just too many acne-faced, prepubertal dweebs with no life who think
that messing with your computer makes them elite hackers instead of
pitiful wastes of skin.
</P>
<P>
   Go to www.tucows.com and check out the wide selection of
scanners. Some are shareware, others are trial versions, but please
snag something. Look for one that monitors your system continually
and automatically checks new files you download. It's not just
programs you have to watch out for, though. The little geeks have
even found ways to spread their electronic mayhem though
word-processing documents and Web page coding.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you're reading this column on the Internet without
anti-virus software, you may be susceptible to Bombay Booboo, the
dreaded virus that suddenly causes text on your screen to garble
and krelmar yo radney glitzdorf. .MDBU/.MDNM/ (Noted
computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay offers occasionally accurate
advice about most things electronic. He can be reached on Internet

   ``It's a phase!'' Gena Rowlands snaps at the notion that she may
be at height of her 50-year acting career. She's lived through
enough ups and downs to know better than to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's a phase,'' she adds, smiling drolly. ``I see most
things happening in 10- to 12-year increments. And when you've been
around as long as I have, you begin to see things more clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in her mid-60s, Rowlands is a legend in the film world. But
as a woman she's not so easy to classify.
</P>
<P>
   Well-bred, worldly and streetwise at the same time, she manages
to be both a lady and a real broad _ an American Jeanne Moreau. In
fact, Rowlands has long been a popular icon in Europe, while she's
had more of a cult following at home.
</P>
<P>
   But even if her current renaissance is just a phase, it looks
like it will be a long one. She filmed three movies this year, a
thick pile of scripts arrives at her home every day _ and Sharon
Stone pays the questionable tribute of remaking ``Gloria,'' one of
the best films Rowlands made with her late husband, writer-director
John Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   Cassavetes (who died of liver cancer in 1989) had a bit of a
revival of his own last fall, when his last unproduced script,
``She's So Lovely,'' was directed by the couple's son, Nick
Cassavetes.
</P>
<P>
   Nick also directed his mother two years ago in ``Unhook The
Stars,'' a movie he wrote for her.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing an orange and claret Todd Oldham velvet robe and tightly
clutching her first coffee of the morning, Rowlands pads out of her
bedroom in the same Hollywood Hills home where Cassavetes shot the
movies ``Faces'' (1968), ``Opening Night'' (1977) and ``Love
Streams'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, her longtime makeup artist sits ready to
transform her for a photo shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' she says, reiterating one of her oft-quoted lines, ``I
do look like a goldfish without my makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   With her live-in boyfriend, Bob Forrest, standing close by,
Rowlands immediately begins reminiscing about Cassavetes, the man
whom she credits for her success as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``My late husband made a lot of great pictures,'' she says. ``It
was a very creative time we were working in. That was followed by a
not-so-creative time, which I think we're still in. So people look
back with nostalgia. I think some of the magic of that time rubbed
off on me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the makeup artist works, Rowlands' thin red mouth becomes
more pronounced, her platinum bob gains a healthy pouf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glamour was never my game,'' says the actress, who still
possesses her famously cool looks. ``I just hate that thing about
beauty. There's always someone out there better looking or worse
looking. Beauty and glamour are not real things. To depend on them
is very hard for anyone, but particularly hard for attractive
girls.''
</P>
<P>
   After finishing the photo session, Rowlands brings out pictures
that were taken on the set of ``Paulie,'' the film in which she
plays a woman who forms a bond with a talking parrot.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen different birds were used to play Paulie, as well as
several animatronic copies created by special-effects wizard Stan
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animated bird was very dear,'' Rowlands says. ``You forget
he's animated. But there was one live bird they used primarily _
and, well, I fell in love. It was unrequited, of course, but that
doesn't make it any less passionate!''
</P>
<P>
   In her most recent film ``Hope Floats,'' Rowlands plays a
taxidermist who's a constant source of embarrassment to her young
daughter, Sandra Bullock. Harry Connick Jr. plays Bullock's
boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a studio picture, but it reads like an independent
picture because it's an examination of love,'' Rowlands says.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls dancing with Connick between takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we had tornadoes in Austin and some terrible
weather,'' she says, ``it might have been the happiest set I've
ever been on.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is not something one generally associates with Gena
Rowlands _ at least not onscreen. In most of her movies, she has
specialized in melancholy or madness, or something in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I've had terrifying times of unhappiness,'' she
says. ``After John died, there were years of crippling insanity. I
couldn't work. But I've finally reconciled by realizing I had him
through all the good years. Nobody has everything all the time.
Yes, it's nine years ago this week that he died. And I have to say
I'm very happy. I adore my three children _ Nick, 39, and daughters
Alexandra and Zoe, both in their 20s. I have a lot of friends and a
lot of work.'' (Her third upcoming film is ``The Mighty,'' which
costars Sharon Stone.)
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands grew up in a small Wisconsin town, where her father was
a liberal politician. Her childhood wasn't entirely idyllic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a grandmother who didn't like me much,'' she says. ``I
only stopped blaming that on myself when I figured out she didn't
like my mother much, either. Nothing I did pleased her. And I was a
sickly kid, so that compounded things.''
</P>
<P>
   She decided early in her teens that she wanted to be an actress.
But after high school, she tried to put that goal aside and had a
brief, dispiriting stint at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little breakdown, actually,'' she says. ``Now they'd
call it a `depression.' But we didn't have that word then. My
parents immediately understood _ they knew I was just in the wrong
place. So my mother took me to New York when I was 20 so I could
try to become an actress.''
</P>
<P>
   As a young adult, Rowlands says, she was ``terribly, terribly
serious _ as you can only be at that age. That's the nice thing
about getting older; you get somewhat lighter. We should all be
born old and finally return to our mother's wombs.''
</P>
<P>
   When she enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in
Manhattan, Rowland immediately noticed the brooding, intensely
handsome John Cassavetes _ but she did her best to avoid him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I left Wisconsin, all I knew was that I didn't want to
get married or have children,'' she remembers. ``I assumed it
ruined your career. So I was desperate not to fall in love. I said
all the things people say _ only I meant them! Then one day I saw
John talking to someone and I thought _ `Oh, no!' And whenever I
saw him, I'd head the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   But when she performed in a production of Archibald MacLeish's
``Dangerous Corners,'' Cassavetes came backstage to seek her out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have a very beautiful red dress on,'' Rowlands recalls
wistfully. ``I resisted him as long as I could.'' Which wasn't very
long: They married several months later.
</P>
<P>
   While Rowlands worked in the theater in the evenings, Cassavetes
formed an improvisational group with some fellow actors and began
working on what became his first film, ``Shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   While his films are considered classics now, Cassavetes and his
troupe were vilified at the time for dealing so directly with such
subjects as alcoholism, infidelity and mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People attacked us wildly,'' Rowlands says. ``They were not
used to having their emotions so engaged or seeing anything so
intimate on screen. John's films weren't particularly sexual _ they
were all about love. People felt exposed. But years later, women
started coming up to me crying about ``A Woman Under the
Influence.'' They said it was a catharsis for them. And men
admitted it was something they'd never understood.
</P>
<P>
   Rowlands is still close with many of the actors who appeared in
Cassavetes' films, including Peter Falk, Ben Gazzara and Seymour
Cassell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not real sociable,'' she says. ``I never have been. But we
revealed ourselves through acting, and we often made fools of
ourselves. That created bonds. Acting is endlessly fascinating _ if
you expose yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Rowlands admits that she can still wake up profoundly
depressed _ ``I have great variations in moods,'' is how she puts
it _ but she tries to channel it all into her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, `What'll it be today? Let's do something with this.'
For me, acting heals. To put one foot in front of another when
you're in an awful mood _ that kind of pressure is so good. I never
found acting scary. I found it an immense relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has now worked with many other directors _ Woody
Allen on ``Another Woman,'' Lasse Halstrom on ``Once Around'' and
``Something to Talk About'' _ it's clear that she'll always
consider her partnership with Cassavetes to be her most precious
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she's not the type to retreat into a nostalgic haze. In
fact, the older she gets, the more she feels the need to reinvent
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you new energy and keeps life exciting _ and most of
all, bearable,'' she says. ``I realized that after John died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a chance to change your baggage and your opinion
of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain age,'' she adds, ``you realize that you must be
reincarnated throughout your life. You certainly don't have to wait
until you die.''

ranging from soaps to face creams, shampoo, healing salves and even
lip balm.

   Hemp seeds can be pressed to produce a protein-rich oil that is
particularly well suited to dry skin.
</P>
<P>
   Using cannabis-based cosmetics may bring to mind substance
abuse, but in fact the plant used to make beauty products _
industrial hemp _ is altogether different from the smokable kind.
It's virtually drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that the two plants are different varieties of
the same species, industrial hemp is cultivated for its seeds and
stalks, which are used to make everything from textiles and paint
to margarine and paper products.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, in addition to being incredibly versatile, hemp
saves trees, prompting such eco-correct celebrities as Peter Fonda
and Woody Harrelson to sing the herb's praises.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson is regularly spotted wearing hemp outfits. Last year
he even commissioned Giorgio Armani to design a deluxe hemp tux for
the Golden Globes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make anything out of this stuff,'' raved the actor.
``And it's non-psychoactive.''
</P>
<P>
   The only hitch is that the Controlled Substances Act, passed in
1970, made it illegal to grow marijuana in the United States, and
hemp companies are forced to source the fiber overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in recent years, a bumper crop of hemp beauty
brands has sprouted around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The earth-friendly products are sold in alternative fashion
boutiques, environmental stores and hemp shops, such as Planet Hemp
in New York's SoHo district, Frankel Bros. Hemp Outfitters in San
Francisco and Hemp in the Hollow in Laguna Beach.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to make a meal of it, The Galaxy Global
Eatery in New York stocks a cabinet of hemp cosmetics and a full
menu of hemp delicacies (including hemp burgers, which actually
taste better than they sound).
</P>
<P>
   Most hemp beauty lines have heady, aromatic fragrances _ not
recommended for those who dislike perfume. The packaging often has
a homemade feel, with boxes made of hemp or bamboo paper.
</P>
<P>
   Body Dope, a provocatively named line of shampoos, conditioners,
soaps, massage oils and lip balms from the Berkeley-based Two Star
Dog, is one of the best sellers at Planet Hemp, according to John
Powell, the store's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are worried about the name,'' he says, ``their
resistance is overcome when they try the products.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many excellent handmade hemp soaps, such as Hempola's
hand-cut bars and All Around The World's cleansing soaps, which
contain high levels of essential oils.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a strange dark brown soap from Virgin Body Care
called Dirty Dan's that gently exfoliates skin with a blend of corn
meal, pumice and crushed hemp seed.
</P>
<P>
   Parched hands will benefit from an application of Sun Dog's hand
cake, a superstrength emollient packaged in a metal tin.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of hair care, Alterna has a new line called Enzyme
therapy that is sold only in salons. The products are formulated
with hemp seed oil and each is packaged with a tiny packet of seeds
roped to its neck. Sterilized hemp seeds, that is.
</P>

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

<P>
   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and
global warming.

   An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

   Taxol, the potent breast cancer drug, was discovered in yew tree
bark. Powerful antibiotics have been derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud. So why
care about protecting endangered species around the world? Because
no one knows where the next scientific breakthrough will be found
... and inadvertently destroying Earth's species might mean it will
never be found. A fascinating report by Andrew C. Revkin, a New
York Times reporter who has written books on rain forests and

   An economist in the rain forest? How will that help preserve our
planet's biodiversity? Well, it couldn't hurt, reports Peter
Passell, who writes about economics for The New York Times. For
example, economists can help people to think seriously about how to
provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.

   &UR; LUSH LIFE: BUT AS SPECIES VANISH, WHAT WILL WE LOSE? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WILLIAM K. STEVENS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may be more kinds of creatures living on Earth now than
ever before in the planet's 4.6-billion-year history. Or at least
there were that many before human beings appeared and began
changing the rules. Homo sapiens have become so powerful an
influence on the biosphere that many experts fear they are
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a major extinction. William K. Stevens,
who covers environmental sciences for The New York Times, reports.

</P>
<P>
   The Endangered Species Act is a law evolving so rapidly that it
almost resembles a new species. In the old days, it was mostly used
to block development and preserve the habitat of a species close to
extinction. Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious
and subtler, as the government and landowners design management
plans to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of
private land, but at the same time not block development. John H.
Cushman Jr., The Times' environmental correspondent in Washington,
reports.

   In 1991, reporter Keith Schneider and his wife became the proud
owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in Manistee
County, Mich. ``I finally understood why Adam was so enticed by
Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through our
orchard,'' he writes. One of first tasks was to learn more about
the apple orchards that lay before him _ and the abundant, juicy
fruit. In this feature, Schneider, the executive director of the
Michigan Land Use Institute and a former environmental reporter for
The Times, describes what he discovered. ``Preserving a diversity
of strains may be part of a global solution,'' he writes. ``But for
us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures that we can't
find them anywhere else.''

<P>
   It is difficult to know for sure, but there may be more kinds of
creatures living on Earth now than ever before in the planet's
4.6-billion-year history. Or at least there were that many before
human beings appeared very late in the game and began changing the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   At first, life consisted of microscopic, single-cell balls, rods
and filaments. For perhaps 3 billion years, these microbes were all
the life there was on this wet, stark and rocky world.
</P>
<P>
   Not until about 600 million years ago, after the Earth emerged
from its deepest ice age ever, did bigger species evolve. Then
life's variety exploded.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of biological variety has been on an upward curve
since then. From sequoias and nematodes to fungi and elephants,
millions of species populate the world.
</P>
<P>
   The curve has not been a smooth one. At least five times in the
last 600 million years, planetwide environmental cataclysms, like
drastic climatic change and colliding asteroids, have wiped out
whole families of organisms. Such events have threatened to erase
life, but succeeded only in partly clearing the stage for new and
different families.
</P>
<P>
   Between extinction spasms, in the background hum of evolution,
single species winked out here and there to be replaced by new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this continuous turnover, scientists believe, more
than 95 percent of all species that have ever existed are extinct
today.
</P>
<P>
   Now one species, Homo sapiens, has become so powerful an
influence on the rest of the biosphere that many experts fear it is
perpetrating, willy-nilly, a sixth major extinction.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is happening simply because people are acting
naturally _ harvesting wild species to burn, eat or sell;
expropriating and destroying wild habitat to make way for human
works like farms, cities and suburbs; moving plants and animals
around the globe in a mix-and-match game in which a relatively few,
superadaptable plant and animal species are crowding out a larger
number of less hardy ones.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is likely to intensify as the Earth's human
population, now about 6 billion, approaches a doubling before
leveling off in perhaps a century.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the numbers is magnified greatly by technology's
power to shape the landscape and exploit the oceans.
</P>
<P>
   This combination has been especially worrisome for the rain
forests, where most of the world's species are found and
large-scale clearing is under way.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many species live on Earth. About 1.4
million have been described and named, but biologists believe there
are at least 10 times that many.
</P>
<P>
   And no one can put precise numbers on the rate of present-day
extinction, although several scientists have made rough stabs.
</P>
<P>
   One relatively conservative estimate says that for some species
found only in one locality, the rate may be 100 to 1,000 times the
normal ``background'' rate between mass extinctions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Few scientists who study the situation doubt that humans are
driving other creatures toward extinction at a growing rate.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever extent they are doing so, people are reducing the
variety of life on Earth _ what conservation biologists now call
biological diversity, or just biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   Biodiversity is not merely a matter of different kinds of
species. It applies to many layers of nature on different scales.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is expressed by the number of genetic
variations within a species, the raw material of evolution; destroy
the wrong genes, and the species might not be able to adapt and
survive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, biodiversity is expressed in the bewildering
variety of types of ecosystems, the tightly interwoven communities
of plants, animals and microbes that are nature's working units.
</P>
<P>
   Forests, wetlands and grasslands are examples of one level of
ecosystem variety, and each comprises numerous interconnected
subunits, right down to the microscopic. It is these interconnected
communities that constitute the fabric of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree human activity is narrowing the variety of
life, scientists say, it is doing so on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Why does this matter? Conservationists and biologists offer a
number of answers. On the practical level, wild species provide the
raw material for medicine and food. Who knows what undiscovered
plant might provide a cure for our era's killer diseases?
</P>
<P>
   Acting together, wild species support the human economy by
providing an array of services like water purification, soil
formation, pollination, flood control and, in our age, outdoor
recreation.
</P>
<P>
   On a more fundamental level, they support human life: Without
humans, the biosphere would not miss a beat. But without insects
and microbes, humans would disappear quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say natural systems are intrinsic to psychological
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many conservationists assert a moral imperative: It is
simply wrong to destroy large slices of creation.
</P>
<P>
   Moral arguments aside, are all species equally valuable?
Scientists believe that in many ecosystems, a few keystone species
hold everything together, and that if they are removed, the system
will collapse and all the other species in it will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in most instances, no one is sure which are
the crucial species.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, scientists have found, the greater the variety of
plant species in an ecosystem, the more productive it is over all.
</P>
<P>
   So, conservationists argue, it is necessary to save as many
species as possible. They have their work cut out for them, since
the catalogue of imperilment is long.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the World Conservation Union, in Gland, Switzerland,
added nearly 34,000 plant species _ one of every eight known plant
species in the world, and nearly one of three in the United States
_ to its growing ``red list'' of imperiled organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In possibly an even more important gauge of overall biological
vitality, an earlier assessment, by United States Federal
Government scientists, found that vast stretches of the natural
landscape, amounting to at least half the area of the contiguous 48
states, had declined to the point of endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   This report, the first ever done on the state of health of the
nation's individual ecosystems, found that 30 of them, some of
which dominated vast regions before the arrival of Europeans, have
been destroyed or degraded by 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the trackless ocean is immune. Overfishing has pushed
some marine species _ the cod and the blue-fin tuna, for example _
to the brink of commercial extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs in some parts of the world are under severe assault;
in parts of Asia, fishermen squirt sodium cyanide into the water to
stun fish, in doses strong enough to kill the corals that maintain
the reef ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The abundant evidence for the threat to biodiversity should not
be overinterpreted. The recent red-listing of plants includes many
simply because they are rare. While many may be vulnerable, humans
do not threaten them just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The red list of plants can be read another way, too: While one
in eight plants was judged imperiled, almost 90 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   On the action front, there are bright spots. Over the last
century, a worldwide conservation movement has struggled to stem
the human assault on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Endangered Species Act is regarded as the
strongest protection law in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, more than 160 countries, not including
the United States, have ratified a treaty obligating governments to
protect plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
   But victories are scattered or overturned. Recently, a federal
court, for instance, invalidated the Yellowstone wolf restoration
project, and a legal battle is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, habitat continues to disappear at an
``unprecedented'' rate, according to the United Nations. The
magnitude of the sixth extinction, if that is what is occurring,
will become clear in time.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century may reveal whether the clever brain bequeathed
to Homo sapiens by the evolution of biological diversity can be
used to save diversity as well as destroy it.

_ to its growing ``red list'' of imperiled organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In possibly an even more important gauge of overall biological
vitality, an earlier assessment, by United States Federal
Government scientists, found that vast stretches of the natural
landscape, amounting to at least half the area of the contiguous 48
states, had declined to the point of endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   This report, the first ever done on the state of health of the
nation's individual ecosystems, found that 30 of them, some of
which dominated vast regions before the arrival of Europeans, have
been destroyed or degraded by 98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the trackless ocean is immune. Overfishing has pushed
some marine species _ the cod and the blue-fin tuna, for example _
to the brink of commercial extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Coral reefs in some parts of the world are under severe assault;
in parts of Asia, fishermen squirt sodium cyanide into the water to
stun fish, in doses strong enough to kill the corals that maintain
the reef ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   The abundant evidence for the threat to biodiversity should not
be overinterpreted. The recent red-listing of plants includes many
simply because they are rare. While many may be vulnerable, humans
do not threaten them just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The red list of plants can be read another way, too: While one
in eight plants was judged imperiled, almost 90 percent were not.
</P>
<P>
   On the action front, there are bright spots. Over the last
century, a worldwide conservation movement has struggled to stem
the human assault on nature.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' Endangered Species Act is regarded as the
strongest protection law in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six years, more than 160 countries, not including
the United States, have ratified a treaty obligating governments to
protect plant and animal species.
</P>
<P>
   But victories are scattered or overturned. Recently, a federal
court, for instance, invalidated the Yellowstone wolf restoration
project, and a legal battle is under way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, habitat continues to disappear at an
``unprecedented'' rate, according to the United Nations. The
magnitude of the sixth extinction, if that is what is occurring,
will become clear in time.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century may reveal whether the clever brain bequeathed
to Homo sapiens by the evolution of biological diversity can be
used to save diversity as well as destroy it.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been more than 20 years since advocates of
saving the snail darter, a minnow-sized fish believed to be on the
brink of oblivion, blocked the mighty Tennessee Valley Authority
from building the $137 million Tellico Dam.
</P>
<P>
   That case went to the Supreme Court, which sided with the fish,
and only when Congress intervened did the dam go forward.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Weyerhauser Corp. is negotiating a voluntary
plan to protect dozens of species on hundreds of thousands of acres
of rich forest habitat in Oregon over several decades, during which
development of the land will be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   These cases are strikingly different manifestations of the
Endangered Species Act, a law evolving so rapidly that it almost
resembles a new species itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the law was mostly used to block development
and preserve the habitat of a species close to extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the law's enforcement is both more ambitious and
subtler, as the government and landowners design management plans
to protect habitats of many species across large tracts of private
land, but at the same time not block development.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fundamental change in how the law should work. It also
reflects the realization that the Endangered Species Act's true aim
is to protect healthy and biologically diverse habitats, and not
just one imperiled species after another.
</P>
<P>
   That cannot be done without the involvement of private
landowners. So Congress and the Clinton administration are trying
to give developers a bigger role in protecting the nation's
biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the Endangered Species Act was under attack
by business groups, the Clinton administration began to
aggressively encourage the use of ``habitat conservation plans,''
or HCPs, on private lands, which are estimated to provide habitat
to 80 percent of all protected species.
</P>
<P>
   HCPs are binding, voluntary agreements in which a landowner
adopts conservation measures, sometimes going beyond what the law
strictly requires, in exchange for permission to develop some
property even if endangered wildlife and habitat are hurt in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   A landowner might agree to leave some forest untouched to
protect wetlands from sediment and stream banks from erosion and to
preserve natural corridors for animals. Otherwise, homes can be
built, sewers trenched and driveways paved.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat conservation plans were authorized by Congress in 1982.
But before 1994, there were only about 20 such active arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, by the end of last year there were more than 200;
hundreds of more are coming. And their size is increasing from
fewer than 1,000 acres at the outset to tens or even hundreds of
thousands of acres in recent cases.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, advocates said, would reassure property owners
and provide incentives to protect the diversity of life on their
land.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration credits the new arrangements for
helping to ensure the recovery of hundreds of species. But it is an
approach that creates suspicion and even hostility among some
environmentalists and conservation biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under many HCPs, development is permitted and habitat is
destroyed despite great uncertainty about whether the landowners
have provided enough mitigation to sustain species in the long
run,'' said the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife in a
report written by Laura Hood, a biologist, and published in
February. Hood examined 24 such plans.
</P>
<P>
   The critics' fire is particularly directed at a part of the plan
that has proved crucial to winning acceptance by property owners:
the guarantee of ``no surprises'' to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises clause tells the landowner whose plan includes
permission to harm some of the species or habitat during
development _ a so-called incidental take permit _ that the
government will place no additional restrictions on how the land is
used during the plan's life, usually several decades.
</P>
<P>
   The promise holds even if unforeseen circumstances arise, which
may demand further steps to preserve species.
</P>
<P>
   If the landowner agrees and the federal government picks up the
costs, additional conservation measures can be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landowners with private or commercial land have a legitimate
concern,'' said Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of Interior. ``They
want some assurance that once they agree to be a party to an HCP
and to mitigate the effects of their activities on listed species,
we won't come back later for a second bite from the apple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A deal is a deal,'' Babbitt added.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem, some skeptical scientists say, is that nature
is full of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is great uncertainty in natural systems, but HCPs and
no-surprises agreements act as though that is not the case,'' said
Dr. Gary K. Meffe, a professor of biology at the University of
Florida and the editor of the journal Conservation Biology.
</P>
<P>
   The no-surprises policy is at the heart of a bill offered by the
Republican Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and Dirk A.
Kempthorne of Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The administration supports the bill, as do many Senate
Democrats. But so far, sponsors have been unable to bring it to the
Senate floor, partly over disputes about how to pay the
government's costs in the future, when surprises arise and
no-surprises clauses trigger federal payments to landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Kempthorne's proposal, supported by Senator Pete V.
Domenici of Arizona, the budget committee chairman, to pay these
costs by selling big tracts of publicly owned land, caused an
immediate uproar among conservation advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Most major environmental groups oppose the Chafee-Kempthorne
bill and instead favor a proposal written by Representative George
Miller, a California Democrat, for consideration by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says his bill would better ensure that endangered species
can actually begin to recover by setting aside critical habitat for
them and by restricting the use of the no-surprises guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller's bill is very unlikely to win approval this year,
and the prospects for rewriting the law before Congress adjourns
for the November elections appear dim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, conservation groups are fighting some proposed HCPs
by enlisting scientists to challenge the no-surprises provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society in Portland, Ore., for example, assembled
scientists to review Weyerhauser's proposed HCP for tracts of its
Oregon property.
</P>
<P>
   Weyerhauser and federal agencies are negotiating a complex plan
for species conservation and ecosystem management on approximately
400,000 acres of land in the Willamette Valley, foothills of the
central Cascade mountains and the Oregon coast ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would be implemented for 40 years with up to four
additional 10-year extensions.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would cover not only northern spotted owls (there are
about 160 owl sites on the land) but many other species, including
marbled murrelets, Umpqua River cutthroat trout, American peregrine
falcons, Columbian white-tailed deer, bald eagles, Aleutian Canada
geese and Oregon chubs.
</P>
<P>
   But in exchange for incidental take permits, which allows
Weyerhauser to damage the habitat of some of these species during
logging operations, the company agrees to accept detailed
prescriptions on how to manage the logging.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 40 percent of the land at a time will be reduced to
seedlings, and less than 60 percent at a time to seedlings and
saplings combined.
</P>
<P>
   The company will keep buffers around streams and leave behind
snags, large trees and big logs, all imperative to wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Wininger, a timber manager at Weyerhauser, said that
the plan includes flexibility to change practices along the way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the water in streams is not within prescribed
temperature ranges, the company must change the amount of forest
left to shade the streams. But that is not enough to satisfy some
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel has several concerns with freezing a management
program in place for the 40- to 80-year term of the HCP,'' the
Audubon scientists' report said. ``The next 40 years of scientific
research will certainly produce new data and insights. One need
only consider the change in science's understanding of spotted owls
and other species affected by the proposed HCP in the last 40
years.''

   THOMPSONVILLE, Mich. _ I Finally understood why Adam was so
enticed by Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through
our orchard near the northern coast of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 apple trees _ some gnarled and thick at the trunk
like an old ash, others mere saplings _ stood scattered on a sandy
ridge between the maple forest and a dun-colored meadow.
</P>
<P>
   It was September 1991, weeks before the fruit fully matured.
Still, the orchard's scent was sweet and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A dry summer had produced unblemished apples that hung from the
limbs in a wondrous display of variety and color. Big, red round
apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree, and they
had a light, candy taste.
</P>
<P>
   There were large green apples, a kind that had probably been
stored during the winter in straw-lined pits to be eaten in spring.
</P>
<P>
   And there were smaller green apples with brown patches that
might have originated from the old Roxbury Russet varieties popular
in northwestern Michigan around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist who covered farming and wrote about modern
agriculture's shrinking genetic resources, I was struck by the
number of varieties, none of which could be found at the markets in
the towns of Benzonia or Frankfort nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '70s, plant breeders have worried that the
abundance of the world's food supply is balanced on a narrowing
supply of wild and domestic plant genes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a handful of varieties bred for peak production
make up the bulk of the world's rice harvest. Meanwhile,
irreplaceable genetic traits that enabled old varieties of rice to
grow in harsh conditions have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is playing out for wheat, corn, barley,
tomatoes and most other major food plants. Homogenization in the
market is one result. Hunger can be another. The Irish potato
famine was caused by a plant disease that raced through crops
containing no genetic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As the new owners of 89 acres of forest, meadow and orchards in
Manistee County, Mich., my wife and I wanted to know more about the
place we had just bought and who had preceded us.
</P>
<P>
   Although historical records are incomplete, sometime during the
1880s, Hiram Hier moved to the township and built a plain two-story
home for his wife and two children on a rise above Nurnberger Road.
</P>
<P>
   Like other homesteaders, he planted different varieties of apple
trees _ in his case, three neat rows down the south-facing slope of
the widest ridge on his land.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 19th century, American farmers were encouraged
to spread seeds and see what came up. Hier almost surely followed
the protocol, as did his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Long growing seasons moderated by Lake Michigan, well-drained
soils and high ridges, which kept untimely frosts at bay, had
already distinguished Michigan's west side as one of the nation's
prime fruit-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 20th century, the fruit belt of northwest and
western Michigan was producing more than 50 commercial varieties of
apples, authorities say. Among the old favorites, some of them
recognizable in my orchard, are Snow apples, which are pure white
to the bite; the Wolf River, a big, round baking apple; Maiden's
Blush, an early ripening yellow apple with a bewitching dark-pink
patch on the side that receives the most sunlight; and Golden
Russet, with skin the color of brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, apple varieties were so diverse, it was just
like human beings,'' said John Kilcherman, a farmer in Northport,
Mich., who cultivates 240 heirloom varieties for his thriving
mail-order business. ``There were as many apples as there were
tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, I walked our land and tried to count the number
of varieties, concluding there were at least 14.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a simple task. The old trees that Hier had planted
were mostly dead, and a forest of maple and ash had grown up around
them. Hier's son, Lee, was the last to farm the place, and when he
died in the 1960s, deer began spreading the seeds. Young
fruit-bearing trees are now growing throughout the property.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the number, I was certain there were more varieties
available than in almost any commercial supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Even along the Lake Michigan coast, the center of a $100 million
apple-growing industry, the nation's fourth largest, the markets
offer paltry pickings. Red Delicious, Jonathan and McIntosh are
Michigan's big three. Northern Spy, an old variety, is still grown
widely for use in pies and to make cider.
</P>
<P>
   Shelf life, texture, uniform ripening and disease resistance are
the most sought-after traits. Distinctive taste is barely in the
first tier of breeding goals.
</P>
<P>
   Growers, moreover, are reluctant to experiment by introducing
unfamiliar varieties. Production costs are too high and profit
margins too slim, and tearing out a productive orchard to test an
unknown is too big a leap for most growers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, apples have not descended to the level of the
modern tomato. Cornell University keeps a well-stocked germ-plasm
repository in Geneva, N.Y., which is collecting wild seeds from the
Caspian Sea region and from Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   Wild apple trees are still so prevalent in this so-called center
of diversity that they constitute 40 percent of the native forest,
said James Luby, an apple breeder and a professor of horticulture
at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are 6,000 known commercial apple varieties in
the world, a deep reservoir of genetic material for the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, I'm more interested in apples developed in the
last century. In mid-May, the blossoms open and our trees look as
if they are covered in snow.
</P>
<P>
   In October, friends come to pick apples and haul them to
Swanson's mill three miles away to be pressed into the most
delicious tart cider.
</P>
<P>
   We have baked our apples into crisps and pies, eaten them
straight from the trees and stored some of the harder green ones
into the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving a diversity of strains may be part of a global
solution. But for us the trees are a source of tastes and pleasures
that are all the more precious because we can't find them anywhere
else.

<P>
   THOMPSONVILLE, Mich. _ I Finally understood why Adam was so
enticed by Eden's apples when we walked for the first time through
our orchard near the northern coast of Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 apple trees _ some gnarled and thick at the trunk
like an old ash, others mere saplings _ stood scattered on a sandy
ridge between the maple forest and a dun-colored meadow.
</P>
<P>
   It was September 1991, weeks before the fruit fully matured.
Still, the orchard's scent was sweet and inviting.
</P>
<P>
   A dry summer had produced unblemished apples that hung from the
limbs in a wondrous display of variety and color. Big, red round
apples almost as large as grapefruits were on one tree, and they
had a light, candy taste.
</P>
<P>
   There were large green apples, a kind that had probably been
stored during the winter in straw-lined pits to be eaten in spring.
</P>
<P>
   And there were smaller green apples with brown patches that
might have originated from the old Roxbury Russet varieties popular
in northwestern Michigan around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist who covered farming and wrote about modern
agriculture's shrinking genetic resources, I was struck by the
number of varieties, none of which could be found at the markets in
the towns of Benzonia or Frankfort nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early '70s, plant breeders have worried that the
abundance of the world's food supply is balanced on a narrowing
supply of wild and domestic plant genes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a handful of varieties bred for peak production
make up the bulk of the world's rice harvest. Meanwhile,
irreplaceable genetic traits that enabled old varieties of rice to
grow in harsh conditions have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The same scenario is playing out for wheat, corn, barley,
tomatoes and most other major food plants. Homogenization in the
market is one result. Hunger can be another. The Irish potato
famine was caused by a plant disease that raced through crops
containing no genetic resistance.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Ten years ago, two botanists from the New York Botanical Garden
eagerly hiked up a hill in Haiti to examine what would prove to be
one of only seven known remaining specimens of Attalea
crassispatha, a very rare palm tree.
</P>
<P>
   To the scientists, the palm, with its unusual flowers and
soaring trunk, was a special, splendid thing. But to the farmer
about to cut it down, it was blocking his plans to expand his
sparse field of stunted corn stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A polite discussion ensued, recalled Dr. Michael Balick, one of
the botanists. With a Haitian colleague translating, he tried his
best to persuade the farmer to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about his children and grandchildren, about the
global value of maintaining biological diversity,'' Balick
explained. ``He said, `But what value is it to me today?'''
</P>
<P>
   Balick said the hilltop debate in the shadow of the palm was a
turning point, marking when he began to realize that efforts to
preserve the diversity of life cannot rely on abstract arguments,
but must be grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he said, he has tailored arguments for preservation
to fit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Haitian palm tree, only a cash payment for
seeds, from the local forester, changed the farmer's plans. The
farmer agreed to keep the tree and started harvesting its nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convinced to begin to preserve it, not only as a source
of nuts, but also for income derived through the sale of the seeds
so the tree could be grown elsewhere,'' Balick said.
</P>
<P>
   Balick, like most biologists these days, is quick to unreel
stories like this as he advocates actions to protect endangered
species around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In every field of study, parables have emerged to justify
preservation. Scientists talk of Taxol, the potent breast cancer
drug, found in yew tree bark during a random search of chemicals
extracted from plants of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   They point to parasitic wasps, the size of pepper flecks, that
are now used instead of insecticides to kill a host of crop pests,
preventing more than $1 billion a year in agricultural losses.
</P>
<P>
   And they mention powerful antibiotics derived from the skin of
African clawed frogs and from microbes in New Jersey mud.
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists focus not so much on the direct payoff from
maintaining a lode of species, but on the indirect benefits, like
the pollution-filtering properties of marshes or the ability of a
healthy forest to prevent erosion on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific advocate exists for almost every living thing, even
those that most people loathe.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Terry Erwin, an entomologist at the Smithsonian
Institution, is perhaps the world's staunchest booster of beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin has spent two decades studying the dizzying arrays of
beetles that often inhabit trees in the tropics. His record is
about 1,700 species found in one tree in Peru _ just beetles, just
one tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our everyday experience, insects are usually problems _
mosquitoes, roaches, that kind of thing,'' Erwin said. ``But,
really, 98 percent of all insect species provide ecological
services that keep the environment going.''
</P>
<P>
   An important service is taking out the garbage, with fly maggots
and dung beetles recycling rotting meat or feces into useful
fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
   And without the thousands of bees, beetles and other insects
that pollinate flowering plants, Erwin said, ``we'd all be eating
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say the downside of tampering with an ecosystem
is as critical as the benefits of preserving it.
</P>
<P>
   As species are removed or a habitat becomes fragmented, the
structure of a richly interlaced community of plants and animals is
more likely to collapse. And when humans invade and transform
landscapes, biologists say, it seems that these degraded areas are
more likely to unleash harmful pests or diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and
fabric of our own lives,'' Klemens said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with people he has encountered on both
continents, he has found that ``if given a choice, people in Africa
and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of
their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Balick said: ``It's still very important to talk about its
importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some
of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic
benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to
small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal
plants for some part of primary health care,'' he noted. ``You'd
think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful,''
he said. ``And that puts great pressure on ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's a goner,'' Henderson said.

   Some scientists, when pushed, fall back on the esthetic values
that lie in untrammeled nature and the moral imperative of treading
lightly on the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   One such voice is that of Dr. Michael W. Klemens, a biologist at
the Wildlife Conservation Society who has studied the imperiled
reptiles and amphibians of both Tanzania and the New York suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A balance and richness of species adds to the richness and
fabric of our own lives,'' Klemens said.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with people he has encountered on both
continents, he has found that ``if given a choice, people in Africa
and New York say they would like to have wildlife remain a part of
their existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, many scientists point to the enormity of the unknowns,
emphasizing that we are destroying thousands of square miles of
rain forest or wetlands before we have even catalogued or named the
resident species, let alone understood their relationships or
possible value.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the arguments that are least useful on the ground
in the tropics, where much of the destruction is taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Balick said: ``It's still very important to talk about its
importance for the spirit and soul, for the environment. But some
of our effort must be focused on making a case for direct economic
benefits, to everyone from policy makers ranging right down to
small farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to make a case for preservation based on local
economics, he said, but nothing is as simple as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three and a half billion people on the planet use medicinal
plants for some part of primary health care,'' he noted. ``You'd
think if your health depends on something, you'd want to preserve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he said, is that in most places medicinal plants
are still harvested in the wilderness, not grown on farms or on
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild-harvested plants are usually considered more powerful,''
he said. ``And that puts great pressure on ecosystems.''
</P>
<P>
   Some countries are recognizing the potential value and potential
threat, he said, pointing out that Belize created a medicinal plant
preserve in 1993 and that India has set aside more than 100 such
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the hardest challenge, biologists say, is to ensure that
a species preserved one year is not imperiled the next.
</P>
<P>
   The rare Haitian palm tree, for instance, was left standing for
a while. It was already fairly old and has probably died, said Dr.
Andrew Henderson, the other botanist who traveled with Balick to
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 26 specimens were located on Haiti, but the trees,
which are isolated and therefore not pollinated, has left the
species essentially extinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, it's a goner,'' Henderson said.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In the big picture and in the long run, it's true: To paraphrase
Yosemite Sam, there is biological gold in them thar rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The active ingredient in roughly one in four prescription drugs
comes from plants. And biotechnology companies are eager to gain
access to exotic environments containing tens of millions of plant
and animal species that have yet to be scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   In the most visible deal, Merck, the giant pharmaceutical maker,
is paying Costa Rica cash plus royalties to preserve the country's
fragile tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
   But economists speak with virtually one voice in warning that
biodiversity is not going to pay for itself. The creation of
property rights in the wilderness can play only a minor role in
protecting endangered habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential return to bioprospecting has been greatly
exaggerated,'' argued David Simpson, a senior fellow at Resources
for the Future, an environmental research organization in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the major contribution of economics in the
biodiversity debate will likely be the forcing of policy makers to
deal more realistically with intangible, nonuse values. That is the
kind of thing usually left to philosophers. And since such
intangibles are more immediately interesting to the citizens of
affluent countries than to the largely poor custodians of tropical
``hot spots'' of biodiversity, the lesson's starting point is that
there are no free rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, species preservation comes down to tradeoffs _ in
deciding how much we are willing to sacrifice in the name of
preserving natural habitats,'' concluded Martin Weitzman, an
economist at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, economists assume that the keys to
everything, from more effective drugs to more nutritious,
disease-resistant crops, are secreted in tropical forests. Why,
then, isn't the repository for these natural wonders valued
accordingly?
</P>
<P>
   What counts, Simpson said, is scarcity. And while there may be
millions of potentially useful species, there is also vast
biochemical redundancy in the environment. Thus the value of any
acre is limited by the fact that an identical species probably
grows on thousands of other acres, and that many of the useful
chemicals will show up in hundreds or even thousands of species.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution decreed, after all, that both coffee and tea contain
caffeine as a defense against predators. And where naturally
occurring chemicals are extremely rare, the value of looking for
them is offset by the high cost of such a task.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and Roger Sedjo and John Reid, his colleagues at
Resources for the Future, estimated the potential value of
preservation in 18 biodiversity hot spots around the world. And
while their figures are necessarily crude _ extrapolating from
useful new chemicals found in exotic environments and the cost of
developing drugs from them _ they are deliberately designed to err
on the high side.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate value of undiscovered species might be,
the three researchers calculate that the current bioprospecting
rights for pharmaceuticals are worth a maximum of $8 an acre in
western Ecuador to $2 an acre in the Philippines to a mere 40 cents
an acre in the eastern Himalayas. That may be enough to justify
biosurveys, but hardly counters pressure for other uses like
grazing or gathering firewood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' Simpson said, ``exaggerated claims of the
pharmaceutical companies' willingness to pay to preserve exotic
environments has been counterproductive,'' as poor countries balk
at what they view as efforts to claim their natural treasures for a
song.
</P>
<P>
   In the stalemate, rain forests continue to be destroyed by
farmers and prospectors seeking short-term gains.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean biodiversity has little value, said Robert
Stavins, an environmental economist at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard. But it implies that ``the lion's share of
the value is intangible,'' Stavins said.
</P>
<P>
   That said, what can economists contribute to the debate? For
one, they can help a society sort through its priorities by looking
at what people are willing to pay to support those values. The
evidence is that public policy toward endangered species reflects
only the narrowest of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In research to be published this summer in the Journal of
Economic Perspectives, Weitzman and Andrew Metrick, a Harvard
colleague, look for the priorities reflected by the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service's spending to protect 142 invertebrate
species that are listed as endangered.
</P>
<P>
   You would expect that the biological distinctiveness of a
species would increase its standing. So ought the probability that
intervention would preserve the species. Last but hardly least is
cost: With limited funds, priorities should reflect the resources
needed to keep the species intact.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Metrick-Weitzman analysis shows that the more
endangered a species is, the less money is spent to preserve it.
And the higher the cost of preserving a species in terms of
dislocating economic activities, the higher the priority the
species gets.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic uniqueness seems to play little or no role in priority.
Think of the northern spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to count most in determining spending priorities are
size (the bigger the better) and taxonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Mammals and birds, which economists dub ``charismatic
megafauna,'' are popular with preservationists, while amphibians
and fish go to the rear of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Stavins put it more plainly. The species we defend most
aggressively, he said, are ``warm and cuddly.''
</P>
<P>
   That may worry biologists who are concerned about the potential
disappearance of broad categories of plants and smaller animals
that help knit healthy ecosystems. But the focus on fur balls may
or may not bother taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have no business telling people what they should
value, Weitzman argued, but they have plenty to contribute on the
subject of rationality.
</P>
<P>
   If we are committed to biodiversity, economists can help make
the cost-benefit calculations critical to obtaining the most bang
for a buck. And they can help people to think seriously about how
to provide the financial incentives to poor countries to preserve
habitats that matter little to peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' Mr. Weitzman said, ``then we should be honest about
our desire to have charismatic megafauna effects dominate our
decisions.''

<P>
   Here are capsule reviews of the latest video releases and
weekend movies scheduled for the three major premium cable
services.
</P>
<P>
   In video stores this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar and Lucinda'' As few period films do, this Gillian
Armstrong production comes to life magically, powered by Ralph
Fiennes and Cate Blanchett. They play eccentric gamblers who meet
on a ship from London to Australia and enkindle in each other a
wildly romantic dream _ building a glass church held together with
steel struts and floating it on a barge from Sydney to a remote
corner of New South Wales. His shame-drenched missionary and her
strong-willed glass-factory owner are memorable. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' Clint Eastwood's
film of John Berendt's bestseller doesn't come together as a whole,
but still has juicy stuff to savor. Savannah eccentrics buzz around
the murder trial of an antiques dealer (Kevin Spacey, purring
indolently) who shot his bisexual lover. John Cusack is a
bright-eyed outsider; Alison Eastwood (Clint's daughter) needs no
nepotism to convince as a warm, sexy love interest; and the film is
stolen by the sassy, cross-dressing Lady Chablis, playing herself
as only she can. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Locusts'' Period piece about a sensitive, virile drifter
and a man-eating widow who runs the symbolic feedlot in her corner
of Kansas. Nicely textured, with Vince Vaughn's maverick and Kate
Capshaw's boss lady holding the screen easily until the film
collapses under the weight of all the killings and castrations that
pile up at the end. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ufdots &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On premium cable Friday and Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 ``Father Hood'' Patrick Swayze, as the wayward father of two
kids, snatches them and hits the road, one step ahead of the law.
He and the juves are appealing, but they're sunk by prefab writing
that confines them to the level of TV sitcom, never letting them
really break out. (PG-13) On HBO Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turbulence'' Silly thriller about a serial killer (Ray Liotta)
loose on a jumbo jet bound from New York to Los Angeles in a storm.
He toys sadistically with Lauren Holly's flight attendant, who'd
rather take over the plane's controls and land it since everybody
else on board seems to be dead. (R) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Independence Day''  &LR; It plays like an entire movie studio
dropped on your head. Aliens in massive flying saucers aim to
clobber us, and President Bill Pullman must lead the resistance,
which includes scientist Jeff Goldblum and fighter pilot Will
Smith. Imagine Cecil B. DeMille directing ``War of the Worlds,''
and you've got the picture. (PG-13) On HBO Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Men in Black'' &LR;  Hugely funny, deadpan spoof in which Tommy
Lee Jones and Will Smith don Blues Brothers garb and keep the world
safe from aliens who obviously landed long ago. Director Barry
Sonnenfeld gave it enough wit and self-confidence to make
sophisticated mass entertainment with some moments of real
pop-culture brilliance. (PG-13) On HBO Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Friday &UR; ``Fools Rush In''  &LR; Matthew Perry's Manhattan WASP and
Salma Hayek's Las Vegas Latina are attractive in this would-be
romantic comedy of cultural collision, but there's not much impulse
or antic spark to be found in its sitcom moves. (PG-13) On Cinemax
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   (CT)(CT) &UR; ``The Devil's Own''  &LR; Intelligent but murky and
slow-moving attempt to put character into the thriller. Idealistic
New York cop Harrison Ford unwittingly shelters fugitive Irish
terrorist Brad Pitt, whose attempt to get his hands on a shipment
of missiles is downplayed as he's transformed into a romantic hero.
(R) On Cinemax Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Protocol'' The US State Department wants to swap Goldie Hawn
to an oil emir for a military base, but she gives them a lesson in
patriotism. (PG) On Cinemax Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Against All Odds'' Remake of a film noir about an unemployed
football player who's sent down to Mexico to retrieve a gangster's
girlfriend, finds her, and falls for her, with dire consequences.
But there's no real heat between Jeff Bridges and Rachel Ward, so
their love among the ruins goes limp. The film's depiction of Los
Angeles as a barren game board of corruption isn't bad, but the
only thing worth seeing is Jane Greer, who played the femme fatale
in the original and is riveting as a pillar of the evil,
land-grabbing rich. (R) On Cinemax Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   FridaySaturday ``Race the Sun'' After being inspired overnight
by their new teacher, a class of underachieving students in Hawaii
enters an international competition for solar-powered cars. The
cars are cool, but the go-team story is deeply cliche-ridden. Halle
Berry is on cruise control as the idealistic teacher. (PG) (Matthew
Gilbert) On Showtime Saturday night. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Housesitter'' Not the most original of screwball comedies, but
a sweet, user-friendly one, with ingratiating performances by
Goldie Hawn as a one-night stand who moves in on architect Steve
Martin, who can't keep up with her whoppers _ especially the one
that they're married. (PG) On Showtime Saturday night.

for International Development Director Brian Atwood said a ``full
assessment'' will be done of how Mexico, Central America and the
United States can better respond to fires in the future. Mexico and
the United States have a fire-fighting training relationship that
dates back 30 years, but no agreement requiring mutual aid to deal
with emergencies. The U.S. officials said the United States should
help with reforestation efforts after Mexico's fires are put out
and contribute more to an international effort to reduce
slash-and-burn agriculture, which caused many of this year's forest
fires. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

<P>
   Oscar Wilde is back in a big way. His plays are being staged
with increasing frequency, and plays about him are thriving too.
``Wilde,'' directed by Brian Gilbert and starring Stephen Fry, not
only adds to the growing list of films on the brilliant Irish
author whose life and career crashed and burned and who died broken
at 46 in 1900 after his homosexuality _ then illegal in England _
landed him in prison. It is quite the best film about Wilde,
rescuing him not only from gay-icon status, but from portrayals
that emphasized his epigrammatic wit and fey style at the expense
of his other qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Like Richard Ellmann's biography, from which this biofilm is
drawn, ``Wilde'' achieves a balance almost unheard of in depictions
of the elegant maverick who disconcerted and entertained fin de
siecle London. Apart from being the closest thing to a dead ringer
in the several films about Wilde, Fry convinces us he enjoys
inhabiting Wilde, even when the writer's melancholy side takes
over. Moreover, Fry compels us to share his obviously heartfelt
admiration not only for Wilde's talent, but for his sensitivity,
generosity, and bravery.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Fry's Wilde is his way of making us realize
that Wilde spent more time feeling than talking. He may have
exhibited a self-destructive streak in stubbornly chasing after the
wild, petulant, and emotionally and intellectually pinched Lord
Alfred Douglas, but Fry's reaction shots make a good case for the
fact that he was a steadfast and caring friend. That caring also
extended to his loyal and loving wife, even if he subordinated her
happiness and well-being, and that of his two children, to his
pursuit of young Douglas, nicknamed Bosie.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the film flinch from depicting, although not unendingly
or leeringly, a few convincing homosexual sex scenes. It was the
testimony of several so-called rent boys, after all, that sank
Wilde in his ill-advised suit against Bosie's vicious and
vindictive father, the marquess of Queensberry (the same man who,
ironically, invented the rules said to have civilized boxing). As
no other Wilde before him has done, Fry conveys with his eyes a
certainty that his arrogant and capricious young lover is going to
be bad news, and an equal certainty that he will pursue Bosie all
the same, even though it cost him everything.
</P>
<P>
   Fry and director Brian Gilbert's biggest accomplishment is to
portray Wilde with dignity, even as he seems more than a little
ridiculous playing the fop. Jude Law moves a promising career yet
another step forward as the unscrupulous Bosie, utterly convincing
as a shallow but dangerous brat. Jennifer Ehle is another plus as
Wilde's wife, the aptly named Constance, who stood by her errant
husband. Michael Sheen is sympathetic as Wilde's first male lover,
the Canadian Robbie Ross, who returned Wilde's love. For a worldly
man, Fry's Wilde proceeds with prodigious blindness to the
consequences of thumbing his nose at the establishment, which stood
for it in his plays, but drew the line when in real life he
challenged its hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Wilde's loyalty and bravery were misplaced, at great
cost to himself and those who loved him. As both Irishman and
homosexual, Wilde was doubly an outsider, and Fry subtly but
tellingly projects Wilde's sense of growing isolation. He may be a
foolish iconoclast, but he's never an unfeeling one. Fry captures
him sympathetically, and in all his contradictions, in a film that
brings the period to life with vivid immediacy. His refined
sensibility and quick wit are released with an amusingly studied
carelessness from his tall, pudgy body by Fry's empathetic and, we
are convinced, fully inhabited and sensitively faceted Wilde.
Stylish, sad, opulent, brilliant, and clear-eyed, ``Wilde'' does
justice to its complex subject. It should stand as the definitive
biofilm for years to come.

LOOK WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HARVARD NAMES THE WRONG MAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Local bicycle historian David Herlihy was a bit surprised to
receive a letter from Jack Reardon, executive director of the
Harvard Alumni Association, inviting him to join the HAA board.
It's not that Herlihy wasn't worthy. He's active in local bicycle
causes and has spent a decade researching a definitive history of
the invention of the ``bipedaliferous wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Herlihy just doesn't fit the profile of the usual HAA
glad-hander. He can't remember making a donation since he graduated
from the World's Greatest University in 1980, and he thinks he may
be the first board member to have spent his Harvard years in the
once-radical Dudley Co-ops, off-campus cooperative housing in North
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Herlihy was to begin his two-year term, HAA boss
Reardon phoned him in a tizzy. You're the wrong David Herlihy,
Reardon gasped. We meant to appoint David Herlihy of Hyannis, a
retired executive who spent 37 years at IBM. Ooops. Our David
Herlihy went to the first meeting anyway, met the real David
Herlihy, and _ surprise, surprise _ got the feeling that he wasn't
really wanted.
</P>
<P>
   After the first meeting, Herlihy realized he wasn't receiving
briefing materials for the next gathering. After initially blowing
him off, Reardon agreed to a lunch. Thenceforward, this story has a
(relatively) happy ending. Reardon suggested that Herlihy work with
Professional Connections, an HAA-based career counseling service
that had been languishing from inattention. ``Today,'' reports our
David Herlihy, ``thanks in large part to my subcommittee, the
service has been completely reorganized and is showing strong signs
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Special message for David Herlihy, former singer-guitarist for
the rock band O Positive: The next David Herlihy item is yours.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I can dig it
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Boston historian Susan Wilson promises plenty of ``good dirt''
in her just-published history of Forest Hills cemetery, called
``Garden of Memories.'' And indeed, she delivers.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Hills, possibly the most beautiful open area in Boston,
was consecrated in 1848 to complement existing ``garden
cemeteries,'' like Cambridge's Mt. Auburn. The latter was and is
private. Forest Hills was a public cemetery, with large tracts
reserved for veterans and Boston firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Hollowed cheek by withered jowl with hoi polloi, however, one
also finds no shortage of Welds, Minots, Plimptons, and Shaws at
Forest Hills. ``The most migratory corpse'' of Joseph Warren, hero
of Bunker Hill, ended up at Forest Hills, after two previous
interments (a fitting end for a man who robbed many a grave in
dubious ``medical'' pursuits). Former Boston mayor Andrew Peters is
there, though his mistress of 11 years _ I don't mean for 11 years,
I mean 11 years old _ is not.
</P>
<P>
   Lit'ry dust abounds. Playwright Eugene O'Neill, late of the
Hotel Shelton (famous last words: ``Born in a hotel room and died
in a hotel room, dammit!''), lies there, not far from e.e.
cummings, whose headstone is engraved in capital letters, EDWARD
ESTLIN CUMMINGS. Also sited: The poet Anne Sexton and historian
Frederick Lewis Allen. Restaurateur Jacob Wirth sleeps in Forest
Hills, as does Boston Celtic star Reggie Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson reports that Lewis's funeral procession was topped only
once at Forest Hills, by the 200,000-person ``Walk of Sorrow'' that
accompanied the bodies of Sacco and Vanzetti to the Forest Hills
crematorium (``Nobody else would touch them,'' Wilson explains) in
1928. Elizabeth Glendower Evans, the Beacon Hill socialite who
tried to rally world opinion to save the two Italian immigrants, is
also in Forest Hills. The two men's ashes now repose partly in
Italy, and partly in the special collections room of the Boston
Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's book is available from Forest Hills (617-524-0703), or
you could pick it up at the cemetery's 150th-anniversary
celebration and sculpture exhibition during the afternoon of
Sunday, June 14. Read a good book, stroll among examples of
contemporary art ... ``You go there and it's a real picnic,'' as
Kahlil Gibran once said of Forest Hills. No, not Kahlil Gibran, the
mystical poet! I mean his nephew, the artist, who lived on Harrison
Avenue in Chinatown. These names are so confusing.

Editor's note: Web addresses are not included because of the
explicit nature of some of the sites. 
 
By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the Eugene, Ore., couple known in cyberspace as Hubby
and Wifey had a little secret _ they liked to take video and still
pictures of each other when they made love.
</P>
<P>
   But their private pastime became public about a year ago when
Hubby, on a lark, posted a Polaroid of a topless Wifey on an
Internet discussion group.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're making money at it.
</P>
<P>
   The couple regularly posts explicit photos in several forums,
and each posting casually mentions that ``videos are available.''
</P>
<P>
   They've been selling a lot of those videos at about $40 to $50
each. They don't want to say how much money they've made, but it's
a large sum _ enough that they worry that revealing it would hurt
their image as earnest amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey _ who don't want their real names used _ are
among hundreds, maybe thousands of individuals who post nude and
sexually explicit images of themselves online.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't professionals. These aren't porn stars or topless
dancers. They are everyday people who like to show off, and like
Hubby and Wifey, some of them are making good money doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey, who met in high school, are now both 33 years
old. He owns a distribution business; she's a stay-at-home mom with
three young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really just kind of plain-jane plain-Jane people,''
said Wifey. ``If you ever saw us on the street, you wouldn't
recognize us. I look just like a suburban housewife; I'm not very
glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   These provocative images appear in one of two places.
</P>
<P>
   One is in Usenet news groups, thousands of individual discussion
forums on the Internet, each devoted to a specific topic. Some of
the groups are set up exclusively for the posting of erotic
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The other area is the World Wide Web, the part of the Internet
that combines graphics, text, sound and video. There, a growing
number of people who don't consider themselves part of the sex
business are setting up Web sites that feature photos of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sex on the Web is big business, one of the few on the Internet
to turn a tidy profit. Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass.-based
market research firm, estimates that sex Web sites will rake in
$137 million this year, a figure that will jump to $296 million in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that, said Forrester analyst Seema Williams, ``will come
from smaller players. Big name brands don't mean that much in this
business. The brand name doesn't necessarily dictate the type of
product you are going to be getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web is the perfect delivery system for pornography, because
it's very private, said Williams. ``No one is going to see you
walking into an adult video store.''
</P>
<P>
   Pornography on the Net has been largely unregulated since the
U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down as unconstitutional the
Communications Decency Act. That law, crafted as part of
telecommunications reform in 1996, made it illegal to place
``indecent'' material on the Web in a way that it could be
regularly accessible to minors. Since the ruling, several
replacement bills have begun making their way through the
legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of pornographic material on the Internet raises
tempers on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough issue, because it's a free speech issue,'' said
Steven Carr, general manager for Clearsail Communications, a
Houston-based Internet service provider that filters out
pornographic Web sites and news groups on behalf of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Carr, like many who oppose pornography on the Web, said its
open availability is just morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is where the money is made, but it is Usenet where most
of the amateurs begin. Much like Wifey and Hubby, it is usually
through an expression of exhibitionism that generates positive
feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Wifey, who happily admits to an exhibitionist streak, wasn't
upset when Hubby first posted those topless Polaroids. And she was
particularly gratified at the e-mail that poured in from people
wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting 100 to 200 e-mails every day,'' said Hubby.
``It became a kind of game for us _ let's try to guess how many
e-mails we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey gladly obliged and gave the regulars in the
Usenet news groups what they wanted _ extremely explicit photos of
the couple having sex, including still pictures from a high-quality
video camera.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the couple began offering to sell videotapes,
and orders began pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main issue right now is time,'' said Hubby. ``It takes a
lot of time to process all these orders, box up the videos and take
them to the post office.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth it financially _ enough that the couple has paid
an experienced Web site design firm to create Wifey's World, which
will be used to sell their videos in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Web site, we can take credit cards _ that should cut
back on the amount of time we have to spend processing orders,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple speculate that one of the reasons their pictures and
videos are so popular is that ``people are turned on by the fact
that we are monogamous,'' Wifey said. ``I'm madly in love with my
husband, and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Danni Ashe, former topless dancer and soft-core porn film star,
was one of the first professionals to launch a sex Web site back in
1995. Danni's Hard Drive has grown dramatically from the days when
she was designing the site herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I have 17 employees,'' she said. ``We made $3 million
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular venue for online exhibitionists are Web-cams _
live video cameras that show either the intimate details of
someone's life or planned strip shows.
</P>
<P>
   Billy DaMota, a Hollywood casting director, maintains a
tongue-in-cheek directory on the Web of sites that feature women
who take their clothes off in front of a Web-cam and charge money
for it. Customers pay a monthly fee to have access to the cams,
enticed by a free area up front that shows past scenes.
</P>
<P>
   DaMota said his listing began as a parody of another site, but
he soon began getting requests from women who wanted him to include
them on his pages.
</P>
<P>
   DaMota said there are now businesses that set up shop and hire a
stable of women to pose for Web-cams. ``They take half the girls'
money,'' he said, ``just like pimps.''
</P>
<P>
   For many amateurs who want to show off, the Internet is a kind
of safe underground where they can do so without being seen by the
mainstream _ including their relatives, friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   A Maine man who goes by the online name of F1guru began posting
pictures of his girlfriend Tobi late last year. The first shots
were ``very plain _ bathing suits and workout stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobi didn't know about it, but soon found out,'' F1guru said
in an e-mail interview. ``She was positive, but apprehensive at the
same time. I convinced her to let me post a topless picture after
getting a lot of mail asking for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobi became an online sensation, with Usenet regulars clamoring
for more. The couple set up a Web site earlier this year, charging
visitors $14.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two months, we made a couple thousand dollars,'' he said.
``We got about 3,200 hits a day.'' Hits represent people viewing
their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But then, a boyfriend of Tobi's cousin spotted her pictures on
Usenet. Her cousin then told the rest of Tobi's family, who accused
F1guru of taking advantage of her.
</P>
<P>
   After her family confronted her, Tobi asked that the site be
taken down.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey keep their Internet activities away from their
children. And Wifey worries that her religious parents will find
out. If that happens, she said, her days of flaunting it on the Net
will likely be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what bothers me about this _ the children,'' said Carr
of Clearsail Communications. ``What if her children find out? What
if she's in the grocery store one day with her kids and someone
recognizes her and says, `Hey, I know you!'''

employment gain was revised upward to 302,000 from the initial

RENT-A-DOG HELPS LICK PET-ADOPTION PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Want to meet that cute bachelor in the next
building who walks his bulldog in the morning? Got a yen to play
Frisbee on the beach with a high-jumping hound? Or jog in the park
with a glad-to-be-with-you canine?
</P>
<P>
   Camp Happy Dog's Rent-A-Dog program may be just the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the program _ which offers all-day and all-night
visits with abused and abandoned dogs who have been rescued and are
being resocialized for adoption _ is misnamed. There's no rental
involved, no fee for taking a dog out.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be dog-sitters just have to convince animal rescuer June
Roberts they're ``responsible and dog-smart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The nicest thing somebody could do is to come by and pick up a
dog who's been here a long time and take it to the dog park or take
it to the beach,'' said Roberts, a Studio City screenwriter who
heads the nonprofit Neva Foundation, which finds new homes for
abandoned and abused dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have them sleep over, some take them to barbecues
where they can socialize with people.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-month-old enterprise was the brainchild of Roberts and
Camp Happy Dog owners Deborah Nabb and Nick Deleo. Nabb and Deleo
had opened their Sherman Oaks day-care center for dogs about five
months earlier and had begun to look for ways to become involved in
pet rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   That was about the same time Roberts was looking for a place to
socialize and showcase dogs up for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they came up with the idea for the Rent-A-Dog program.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts brings two to six Neva dogs _ many of them roly-poly
puppies _ to Camp Happy Dog every day. People who ``rent'' a dog
for a day include those who are thinking about owning a dog but
need some convincing, people actively looking for a dog to adopt or
just dog lovers who don't live in a place where they can have a dog
``and need a dog fix once in awhile,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Rent-A-Dog program began, more than a dozen Neva dogs
have found new homes, either with people who've ``rented'' them for
the day, their friends or dog owners who've seen the dogs when they
come to pick up their own pooches from day care.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dogs the Neva Foundation rescues come from dire
situations and are fortunate to find good homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get most of our dogs from dumpsters _ sometimes only 2 or 3
hours old. People just throw them away,'' Roberts said. ``And a lot
of people just move and leave the dog locked in the garden.
Sometimes it's a month before a Realtor finds them, and by then
they're not even ambulatory. It takes months to nurse them back to
health.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical success story involves a golden retriever puppy who
had been badly abused. He played during the day with the camp dogs
and went home at night with one of the trainers. ``He was so shy,
so scared,'' Roberts said. ``One week later, he was adopted into a
really loving home with three cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone, a fuzzy-faced abandoned pup with a Benji-like appeal,
immediately caught Nabb's eye. She called her friend, Dana Weinberg
of Encino, and urged her to adopt the little fellow _ even though
Weinberg wasn't sure she wanted to take in a second dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``She walked in the door and said, `He's perfect','' Nabb said.
``Tyrone had a home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just too many dogs that don't have homes and that
are going to be put to sleep,'' Weinberg said, rubbing Tyrone's
belly. ``I couldn't imagine this one not having a life. Now, I go
home and my kids are screaming and yelling, but the dogs are
licking me and loving me. It's unconditional love _ and it's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a major success story to come out of the adoption
program, it's Sam, a mixed-breed dog with ears like a donkey's. His
owner moved and gave Sam up; it took six months to find him a new
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he'd need lots of room to run around, but his new
owner has a 58-foot trimaran,'' Deleo said. ``Sam stands on the
front with the wind in his face, and he's a happy dog. Sam is a
sailor, and life is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing we learned from that is there is a dog for
every person and a person for every dog.''!end! &QL;

DAY-CARE CENTER WITH A TAIL-WAGGING DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's midmorning _ and it's playtime.
</P>
<P>
   There's a tug-of-war game going on and a furious game of chase.
And over in the corner, one exhausted player has curled up for an
impromptu nap.
</P>
<P>
   Just like any day-care center.
</P>
<P>
   Except this one's for dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides helping find homes for abused animals, the two
dog-loving owners of Camp Happy Dog in Sherman Oaks capitalize on
local folks' desire to be good ``parents'' to their dogs despite
the time demands of jobs, kids' school and soccer games and dance
classes, errands and the other things that fill their lives.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of leaving Butch or Fido alone at home, owners bring
their pooches to spend the day with other latchkey canines under
the watchful eye of dog trainers who referee tussles, play ball,
take them for walks, groom them, put them through obedience
training and just generally act as surrogate parents for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owners say they feel guilty leaving their dog alone all day
while they work, and to some extent, they !ital!should!off! feel a
little guilty,'' said Nick Deleo, who with Deborah Nabb owns Camp
Happy Dog. ``Dogs are very socialized animals. They just love to be
with you. Just talk to them and goof with them. They love the
voices, the touches.''
</P>
<P>
   Day care costs $20 per pooch per day and includes all the games
a dog can play before collapsing in exhaustion. About a dozen
customers' dogs come to play each day, joining the handful of dogs
that have been rescued and are up for adoption. Day-care dogs must
have proof of up-to-date immunizations; dogs for adoption have had
their shots, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in the afternoon, I'll say to Nick, `Listen. It's so
quiet.' And we'll go look and they're all napping at the same
time,'' said Nabb. ``It's a half-hour of pure peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They play so hard all day ... that customers tell us the dogs
are snoring in the back seat of the car on the way home, they're so
tired,'' Deleo said.
</P>
<P>
   In the storefront shop on busy Ventura Boulevard, Camp Happy Dog
is nearly filled with a corral formed from sections of 5-foot-tall
movable wooden fence. Inside the enclosure is a small doghouse, a
basket of dog toys and a full water dish. In the winter, it's warm
inside; in the heat of summer, the air conditioning keeps the
pooches cool.
</P>
<P>
   Most owners drop off their dogs on the way to work and pick them
up on the way home. But Deleo also picks up and delivers, takes
dogs to veterinary appointments and even arranges after-hours
dog-sitting for customers, like those in the TV and film industry,
who work odd schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nabb and Deleo came by their love of dogs naturally. His
father trained dogs for the U.S. Army; her grandfather bred
Labradors. Before opening the shop, Deborah was a dog trainer; Nick
was a financial manager who also had worked as a dog trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to find something we could work at every day and
enjoy,'' Nabb said. ``I can't imagine a better way to spend your
day than playing with dogs.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In the upcoming movie ``Armageddon,'' an asteroid
the size of Texas heads directly toward Earth at 2,000 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It could happen. And it could be a giant ball of chocolate, such
as Nestle's new Armageddon Asteroid, a hollow chocolate ball filled
with tangy red and black meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   For more sci-fi action, give Nestle's Nuclear Chocolate Chain
Reaction bar a taste test. It's a milk chocolate bar with crisped
rice (like a Nestle's Crunch bar) that also has popping candy
particles that explode in your mouth. It may be too dangerous for
your child, so, in the ultimate parental sacrifice, be sure to test
its safety by eating one first. The candy costs 99 cents at candy
counters everywhere and comes with a limited-edition ``Armageddon''
trading card created by Upper Deck.

TALES OF GAY LIFE IN SAN FRANCISCO IN THE YEARS BEFORE AIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALES OF THE CITY &QC; 
Starring: Laura Linney, Paul Hopkins, Colin Ferguson, Bill
Campbell, Olympia Dukakis, Swoosie Kurtz, Jackie Burroughs, Thomas
Gibson, Barbara Garick &QC; 
Directed by: Pierre Gang &QC; 
On: Showtime &QC; 
Time: Sunday and Monday nights, 9 p.m. &QC; 
Rated: TVMA (nudity, drug use) &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that it aired on the generally high-minded PBS
in 1994, and that it was quickly elevated into an arts cause when
right-wing groups began whining about the gay content and drug use,
``Tales of the City'' was just a lot of good fun. It was a wry,
sentimental, and heavily plotted soap opera, and it was dressed up
in Day-Glo 1970s kitsch and the wonderfully sunny surfaces of San
Francisco. While themes of identity and personal liberation managed
to keep the rare goings-on at 28 Barbary Lane from sheer
weightlessness, still the miniseries was six hours of light
amusement and mystery. ``Brideshead Revisited'' it was not.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday and Monday nights on Showtime, ``More Tales of the
City'' arrives with its own arts-world stigma, since PBS is said to
have bowed to right-wing censorship when it bowed out of this
sequel. But like its highly rated predecessor, ``More Tales of the
City'' is nothing more or less than six hours of fully outrageous
coincidence, 1970s visual wit, and nostalgia for the years before
AIDS put a hole in the world. It's an addictive stretch of
television that picks up six weeks after ``Tales'' left off,
successfully bringing back the same characters and plot lines and
apartments, and adding a few newer ones such as Mother Mucca, the
elderly madam of a brothel in the Nevada desert. Many of the
original actors also return, with the notable exceptions of Chloe
Webb as Mona, Marcus D'Amico as Michael, and Paul Gross as Brian,
who have been replaced without much disruption by Nina Siemaszko,
Paul Hopkins, and Whip Hubley, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``More Tales'' is primarily divided between the plot turns of
two sets of characters _ turns that I will not spoil here.
Basically, Mona Ramsey learns that her magical landlady, Mrs.
Madrigal, is actually her father (after a sex-change operation),
and she receives even more family information at Mother Mucca's
whorehouse, where she has become the receptionist. Meanwhile, the
less innocent Mary Ann Singleton and the romantic Michael Tolliver
take a cruise ship to Mexico, where Mary Ann falls for a handsome
new character named Burke Andrews. Burke isn't gay, as Mary Ann
fears, but he does come with some pretty bizarre baggage. And
Michael runs into his former lover, Jon Fielding, with whom he
attempts a more mature relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Because Armistead Maupin's fiction, on which ``Tales'' and
``More Tales'' are based, is both episodic and intricately
designed, it continues to lend itself beautifully to the extended
time afforded by television. (The books began in serial form in the
San Francisco Chronicle.) As with Dickens, ``More Tales'' has the
right balance of minor characters and subplots mixed into the
sprawl to provide a welcome detour from the major doings. The less
visible include Beauchamp and DeDe Day, whose marriage takes a
disastrous turn, and DeDe's recently widowed mother, Frannie, who
is inducted into a sex club for women over 60 called Pinus. Also on
the periphery is Brian Hawkins, who begins a strangely anonymous
sexual relationship, and Swoosie Kurtz as Mona's vengeful mother.
</P>
<P>
   It's all engaging and charming, although ``More Tales'' does
lack some of the giddy and revelatory energy of ``Tales.'' The
problem is not sequel-itis, that dashed-off cashing-in quality that
infects many returns to the well; it's just that the sexual and
personal liberations of Maupin's world are more familiar and less
mind-bending the second time around. And much of the plot activity
involves the dusting up of fallout from the ``Tales'' narrative,
making it feel less inventive and fresh. Also, the 1970s have been
mined so relentlessly in recent years that it's not as much of a
tickle in 1998 to find clips from ``The Sonny &AMP; Cher Comedy Hour''
or references to Patty Hearst and Angie Dickinson as it was in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are uniformly good, with Laura Linney once
again delightful as Mary Ann, the Cleveland naif. Hopkins manages
to make Michael's moodiness and heroism appealing, and Siemaszko is
fine as Mona, though not as dynamic as Webb was. It's fun to see
Thomas Gibson, most visible these days for his mild-mannered comedy
on ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' playing an out-and-out villain, and Bill
Campbell is natural and gentle as Jon. Olympia Dukakis is in the
most difficult role of all, of course, as the transgendered Mrs.
Madrigal. She's a strong mother to her tenant ``children,'' but
she's a fountain of melancholy, too, noting about her love for pot
that ``some people drink to forget; I smoke to remember.'' To make
such an unusual character so sympathetic, to present her entirely
without judgment or preachiness, may be the biggest achievement of
the ``Tales'' series, both for Dukakis and for Maupin.

CRUDE, MONEYED HEARTLESSNESS SPLASHED ACROSS THE SCREEN

<P>
   A PERFECT MURDER &QC; 
Directed by: Andrew Davis &QC; 
Screenplay by: Patrick Smith Kelly, based on Frederick Knott's
play, ``Dial M for Murder'' &QC; 
Starring: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortensen, David
Suchet, Sarita Choudhury, Michael P. Moran, Novella Nelson,
Constance Towers &QC; 
Playing at: Cheri, suburbs &QC; 
Running time: 107 minutes &QC; 
Rated: R (violence, sexuality and language) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When Alfred Hitchcock filmed ``Dial M for Murder,'' its
perversity and malevolence _ the qualities that attracted Hitchcock
_ were couched in what seemed a cerebral puzzle. It very much
seemed stagebound, a filmed play. ``A Perfect Murder,'' Andrew
Davis's remake, predictably takes the story outside and even hurls
it tempestuously through the streets of New York. Yet it's much
darker and twistier than the original, not only more physically
violent, but more psychically violent. Unlike the original, where
at least Grace Kelly's intended victim was adulterous but
sympathetic, this new version spares nobody. Its inner world is one
of brutal lovelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Lies and greed are its twin motors, and it sweeps you along in
its steady descent like a Jacobean revenge tragedy. As soon as
Michael Douglas's predatory millionaire looks at his trophy wife,
Gwyneth Paltrow, raises a flute of champagne, and says, in what
she's sure is a sadistic double entendre, ``Here's to stolen
moments,'' the nonstop dread begins. Paltrow's Silk Stocking
District trust-fund princess, who wears an air of entitlement with
the same swanlike poise as she wears a ball gown, has been having
an affair with a rough-edged painter in his Brooklyn loft, and
she's sure her powerful, if hitherto inattentive, husband knows. A
lot of white starts showing beneath the pupils of her eyes. They
suggest poached eggs.
</P>
<P>
   What we've got here is a triangle, and the underrated Viggo
Mortensen, as the artist who's romancing the married woman, is more
than adequate to the task of holding up his quota of the venality
and danger hemming Paltrow's anxious woman in. The screenplay is
smart enough to make sure Paltrow is handed more than a victim
role. Still, it amounts to a square-off between Douglas's raging
but outwardly controlled husband and Mortensen's smooth barbarian
at the gates. The trouble at home is exacerbated by the
wheeler-dealer's business troubles. His wife's trust fund, in fact,
would help him cover some reckless financial overextensions.
</P>
<P>
   So the plot is hatched. Douglas, using moral outrage like a
baton, suggests Gordon Gekko under pressure, who has perhaps lost a
little off his fastball. In this film where everybody has at least
one guilty secret and nobody's hands are clean, Douglas projects
instincts as basic as any. Getting the edge on the painter by
looking into the latter's past, he blackmails him into murdering
his wife, sets up the killing, and retreats into an airtight alibi
at his club. Naturally, the murder doesn't go as planned. That's
when the improvisation _ and the guignol-based entertainment _
begins, enlivened by glimpses of a multi-culti New York,
personified by Sarita Choudhury's pal to Paltrow at the United
Nations, where both work as translators, and by David Suchet's
Arabic-American cop, as unnervingly competent-seeming as the sleuth
Suchet plays on TV, Hercule Poirot.
</P>
<P>
   Without giving anything away, it can be said that the film ends
with a death, and involves a couple more along the way. They're
staged for shock value, and achieve it. The film works as a series
of skilled and cynical hammerstrokes executed in a pervasive
darkness that makes the route between Wall Street and the Upper
East Side seem a tunnel to hell.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas is, as usual, all fire and ice, clenched and furious.
Paltrow becomes interesting when she abandons her usual air of cool
self-possession and allows her features to blur with the stress
she's feeling as she simmers in her bad choice of men. Mortensen
holds the screen against them both as the far from romantic
psychopath, whose role is expanded most beyond the original, and
who takes it to career-propelling realms of silken creepiness.
</P>
<P>
   While successfully steeping the story in its fast-paced,
soulless, art-saturated, money-soaked world, ``A Perfect Murder''
denies audiences the usual moral certainties, even if it proffers
the usual soothing masscult consolations of beauty and power being
equated with moral corruption. Nobody is entirely sympathetic in
this successful updating to a jangly contemporaneity. You won't
necessarily develop a rooting interest in any of them, or
necessarily even like them. So enthusiastically, and with such
Hogarthian vigor, is the film's world of sleek, crude,
steamrolling, moneyed heartlessness splashed across the screen that
you half expect Donald Trump to be revealed as the murderer. You
may not like where ``A Perfect Murder'' is going, but once aboard,
you won't want to leave until you get there.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the Oregon couple known in cyberspace as Hubby and
Wifey had a little secret _ they liked to take video and still
pictures of each other when they made love.
</P>
<P>
   But their private pastime became public about a year ago when
Hubby, on a lark, posted a Polaroid of a topless Wifey on an
Internet discussion group.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're making money at it.
</P>
<P>
   The couple regularly posts explicit photos in several forums,
and each posting casually mentions that ``videos are available.''
</P>
<P>
   They've been selling a lot of those videos at about $40 to $50
each. They don't want to say how much money they've made, but it's
a large sum _ enough that they worry that revealing it would hurt
their image as earnest amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey _ who don't want their real names used _ are
among hundreds, maybe thousands of individuals who post nude and
sexually explicit images of themselves online.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't professionals. These aren't porn stars or topless
dancers. They are everyday people who like to show off, and like
Hubby and Wifey, some of them are making good money doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey, who met in high school, are now both 33 years
old. He owns a distribution business; she's a stay-at-home mom with
three young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really just kind of plain-jane plain-Jane people,''
said Wifey. ``If you ever saw us on the street, you wouldn't
recognize us. I look just like a suburban housewife; I'm not very
glamorous.''
</P>
<P>
   These provocative images appear in one of two places.
</P>
<P>
   One is in Usenet news groups, thousands of individual discussion
forums on the Internet, each devoted to a specific topic. Some of
the groups are set up exclusively for the posting of erotic
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The other area is the World Wide Web, the part of the Internet
that combines graphics, text, sound and video. There, a growing
number of people who don't consider themselves part of the sex
business are setting up Web sites that feature photos of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sex on the Web is big business, one of the few on the Internet
to turn a tidy profit. Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass.-based
market research firm, estimates that sex Web sites will rake in
$137 million this year, a figure that will jump to $296 million in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that, said Forrester analyst Seema Williams, ``will come
from smaller players. Big name brands don't mean that much in this
business. The brand name doesn't necessarily dictate the type of
product you are going to be getting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web is the perfect delivery system for pornography, because
it's very private, said Williams. ``No one is going to see you
walking into an adult video store.''
</P>
<P>
   Pornography on the Net has been largely unregulated since the
U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down as unconstitutional the
Communications Decency Act. That law, crafted as part of
telecommunications reform in 1996, made it illegal to place
``indecent'' material on the Web in a way that it could be
regularly accessible to minors. Since the ruling, several
replacement bills have begun making their way through the
legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of pornographic material on the Internet raises
tempers on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough issue, because it's a free speech issue,'' said
Steven Carr, general manager for Clearsail Communications, a
Houston-based Internet service provider that filters out
pornographic Web sites and news groups on behalf of its customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Carr, like many who oppose pornography on the Web, said its
open availability is just morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is where the money is made, but it is Usenet where most
of the amateurs begin. Much like Wifey and Hubby, it is usually
through an expression of exhibitionism that generates positive
feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Wifey, who happily admits to an exhibitionist streak, wasn't
upset when Hubby first posted those topless Polaroids. And she was
particularly gratified at the e-mail that poured in from people
wanting more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting 100 to 200 e-mails every day,'' said Hubby.
``It became a kind of game for us _ let's try to guess how many
e-mails we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey gladly obliged and gave the regulars in the
Usenet news groups what they wanted _ extremely explicit photos of
the couple having sex, including still pictures from a high-quality
video camera.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the couple began offering to sell videotapes,
and orders began pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main issue right now is time,'' said Hubby. ``It takes a
lot of time to process all these orders, box up the videos and take
them to the post office.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's worth it financially _ enough that the couple has paid
an experienced Web site design firm to create Wifey's World, which
will be used to sell their videos in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Web site, we can take credit cards _ that should cut
back on the amount of time we have to spend processing orders,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple speculate that one of the reasons their pictures and
videos are so popular is that ``people are turned on by the fact
that we are monogamous,'' Wifey said. ``I'm madly in love with my
husband, and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Danni Ashe, former topless dancer and soft-core porn film star,
was one of the first professionals to launch a sex Web site back in
1995. Danni's Hard Drive has grown dramatically from the days when
she was designing the site herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I have 17 employees,'' she said. ``We made $3 million
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Another popular venue for online exhibitionists are Web-cams _
live video cameras that show either the intimate details of
someone's life or planned strip shows.
</P>
<P>
   Billy DaMota, a Hollywood casting director, maintains a
tongue-in-cheek directory on the Web of sites that feature women
who take their clothes off in front of a Web-cam and charge money
for it. Customers pay a monthly fee to have access to the cams,
enticed by a free area up front that shows past scenes.
</P>
<P>
   DaMota said his listing began as a parody of another site, but
he soon began getting requests from women who wanted him to include
them on his pages.
</P>
<P>
   DaMota said there are now businesses that set up shop and hire a
stable of women to pose for Web-cams. ``They take half the girls'
money,'' he said, ``just like pimps.''
</P>
<P>
   For many amateurs who want to show off, the Internet is a kind
of safe underground where they can do so without being seen by the
mainstream _ including their relatives, friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   A Maine man who goes by the online name of F1guru began posting
pictures of his girlfriend Tobi late last year. The first shots
were ``very plain _ bathing suits and workout stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobi didn't know about it, but soon found out,'' F1guru said
in an e-mail interview. ``She was positive, but apprehensive at the
same time. I convinced her to let me post a topless picture after
getting a lot of mail asking for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobi became an online sensation, with Usenet regulars clamoring
for more. The couple set up a Web site earlier this year, charging
visitors $14.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two months, we made a couple thousand dollars,'' he said.
``We got about 3,200 hits a day.'' Hits represent people viewing
their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But then, a boyfriend of Tobi's cousin spotted her pictures on
Usenet. Her cousin then told the rest of Tobi's family, who accused
F1guru of taking advantage of her.
</P>
<P>
   After her family confronted her, Tobi asked that the site be
taken down.
</P>
<P>
   Hubby and Wifey keep their Internet activities away from their
children. And Wifey worries that her religious parents will find
out. If that happens, she said, her days of flaunting it on the Net
will likely be over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what bothers me about this _ the children,'' said Carr
of Clearsail Communications. ``What if her children find out? What
if she's in the grocery store one day with her kids and someone
recognizes her and says, `Hey, I know you!'''

   THE TRUMAN SHOW &QC; 
Directed by: Peter Weir &QC; 
Screenplay by: Andrew Niccol &QC; 
Starring: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha
McElhone, Holland Taylor, Ed Harris &QC; 
Playing at: Cheri, suburbs &QC; 
Running time: 104 minutes &QC; 
Rated: PG (thematic elements and mild language) &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey did a better job than he was given credit for when he
linked TV and dysfunction in ``The Cable Guy.'' But nothing in that
film, or in any of his previous films, prepares us for the
mind-bending dazzle of ``The Truman Show.'' It's not enough to say
that there's nothing dumb or dumber in it. It's more than comedy,
more than satire. It's the kind of huge instant pop culture myth
that comes into being when Hollywood gets the big bang theory right
by throwing together a popular star ready to push the envelope and
a bold, powerful, reverberant fantasy that nails the Zeitgeist with
enough thematic richness to carry us into and beyond the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' pushes off from the fact that TV is
voracious, swallowing material endlessly, seldom chewing it. Once
it served us. Now we serve it. TV's synthetic reality has become
our model for ``real life.'' Carrey's Truman Burbank is the only
real thing in ``The Truman Show.'' It's the world's longest-running
documentary soap opera, watched by millions. Truman has no idea he
has been its unwitting star for 30 years, never once dreaming he
was acquired as a baby by the network and plunked into the world's
biggest set under a massive man-made dome. He thinks he's living in
an oceanside community called Seahaven. Everyone in his life _ his
wife, his mother, his beer-drinking best buddy _ is an actor. The
show's creator, Ed Harris's Christof, watches from above: godlike,
remote, bringing sinister new meaning to the terms ``planned
community'' and ``control room.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Christof control the weather; he also controls the
aggressive cheer level in this film that neatly turns the tables on
so-called reality-based TV as it follows the logic of turning lives
into programming. What does reality become when all it wants to do
is copy TV? Truman is the only thing that's unscripted, or rather
the innocence of his reactions is. His innocence and his privacy
are the real subjects of the show-within-the-movie, not the daily
banalities he has been conditioned to believe constitute reality in
his blindingly sunny world of greeting-card platitudes, shimmering
so surrealistically. The brave new world of Shakespeare and Aldous
Huxley has been supplanted by a ratings-driven world. Cannon fodder
has been replaced by camera fodder. Five thousand hidden cameras
are ever ready to capture Truman's every move and flicker through
Seahaven's beachfront world of Victorian replicas and white picket
fences.
</P>
<P>
   He's the postmodern equivalent of 18th-century castrati,
mutilated in order to ensure ongoing entertainment value. Truman,
an adventurer at heart, is functionally lobotomized, made afraid to
attempt the voyage that would bring him bumping up against the
outer wall of the set he thinks is the horizon, because his
make-believe mother convinced him his father died in a boating
accident. ``You belong here with me,'' Christof's voice tells him
from above; ``in my world you have nothing to fear.'' But when an
actress playing a girl he meets feels sorry for him, breaks
character, and tells him what's really going on before she's
discovered and banished by the network Nazis, Carrey slips into his
postmodern Jimmy Stewart mode, sputtering with anger, gathering
steam slowly, like a locomotive.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey's screen persona has until now been an extension of his
wacky unguided-missile characters from TV's ``In Living Color'' _
brighter-than-bright, heightened, stylized. But here he tones down
the physical comedy, abandons the Astaire-on-acid shtick for
vulnerability. He moves from anesthetized to desperate to indignant
as he confronts the truth of his situation and resolves literally
to break through the fourth wall and reclaim his life. ``The Truman
Show'' becomes a rebellion against the synthetic, the prefab, the
inauthentic. Truman's enemy is TV's falsifying of experience, its
stifling of any urges it thinks it can't control.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's appeal is rooted in Carrey's ability to project a
childlike acceptance of everything at _ what better for TV? _ face
value. He only dimly suspects that everybody around him is
different. He isn't paranoiac, but should be. Yet director Peter
Weir and screenwriter Andrew Niccol shrewdly allow Truman to feel
the cocoonlike comfort of his squeaky-clean box, the life he only
now realizes has been the centerpiece in a massive falsifying of
experience. Truman's anger, revved into action as he realizes his
theme-park world is a cage he must escape, must blast through the
passive urge to let TV keep doling out cues.
</P>
<P>
   Doing less than usual physically, Carrey accomplishes more than
he ever has. ``The Truman Show'' is not without glitches and even
shortfall. In addition to starting slowly, it ends too abruptly,
without a feeling of closure, of arriving at a sense of emotional
destination. But Carrey's muted yet feelingful clowning is
brilliant and touching, and Weir's direction plugs us seductively
and then disquietingly into the virtual unreality of Truman's
Playskool jungle, where the only thing weirder than the blurring of
the line between life and TV is the audience's need to watch it.
``The Truman Show'' shows us more than Truman. Not since the
flip-flopping of high and low culture in ``Quiz Show'' has an
ambitious take on our culture _ in this case TV's bludgeoning of
America into the stupidity that feeds conformity _ been so vividly
folded into a film.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The economy added more jobs than
expected in May, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at a
28-year low of 4.3 percent. Payrolls expanded by 296,000 people
last month, exceeding forecasts of a gain of about 220,000. April's
employment gain was revised upward to 302,000 from the initial
estimate of 262,000. Workers' average hourly earnings, a gauge of
labor costs, rose 0.3 percent, or 4 cents, in May, slower than
April's increase of half a percent. By Sylvia Nasar.

envied as Goldman, is not clear-cut, and estimates range from as

Viagra and Monica Lewinsky appears to have accelerated a change in
the way many Americans speak about a subject that some would prefer

THIS ACTION DOESN'T AFFIRM WHAT IS RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ward Connerly has made quite a name for himself, his caramel
brown face now synonymous with the fight to end racial and gender
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   And how does he want to be remembered?
</P>
<P>
   ``As an ordinary American who saw something he considered wrong
and had the conviction to pursue a solution,'' Connerly was quoted
as saying in last Sunday's Parade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   I turn the 58-year-old Connerly's words over in my mind and
think he's either asleep or mad.
</P>
<P>
   What reasonable man can deny _ based on declining minority
enrollment at both Texas and California universities _ that
admissions based solely on test scores exclude most minority
students?
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Connerly won his fight to ban affirmative action at the
University of California. A year later, voters even supported him
when he headed the Proposition 209 initiative to end the practice
in all state and local government programs in California.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the time to eliminate the one tool we have to
help level the playing field for many minority youths. Luckily,
politicians elsewhere _ like U.S. Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla. _ have
recognized this and have backed away from such proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, a University of California regent and businessman,
seems nice enough. He has worked hard to get where he is, once
working for 65 cents an hour to help keep a roof over his head.
</P>
<P>
   But Connerly's contention that there is no greater insult than
to be accepted into college or given a job because of one's skin
color is wrong. The greater insult would be to not be given the
job, to not be admitted to college at all, because of your color.
</P>
<P>
   Because of preferences, minorities like Connerly _ and, I should
also add, white women _ have been afforded opportunities they would
not have otherwise had.
</P>
<P>
   What hasn't changed is the fact that too many minorities are all
too willing to be used by white racists to obscure mean and
socially harmful agendas. That allows them a program that would
otherwise be characterized as bald racism were it not decorated
with a self-loathing black face.
</P>
<P>
   It was true in the past, throughout slavery and the civil rights
movement. It is true now. And I suspect, sadly, it will always be
true.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that escape me, minorities have always been this
way, operating like crabs in a barrel. A decent one will rise to a
position of power, where he is able to help those less fortunate,
only to then refuse in order to score points with his white boss
or, in some cases, just because he sees tokenism as job security.
</P>
<P>
   I'm reminded of the politician my church pastor spoke of
recently, who courted the black vote only to forget his black
constituents once elected to office. And the black reporters I've
seen who are unwilling to tell ``black'' stories for fear white
editors will perceive them as ``pro-black.'' They so need approval
from whites, they are willing to deny themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That mindset has to change. Something terrible afflicts a people
who are unable or unwilling to help, to advocate on behalf of those
who are unable to do their own bidding.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't mean that you're anti-white; it simply means you're
willing to put other's needs before your own, that you're willing
to give up something big for something good.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1994 when Connerly said he learned that colleges were
advertising jobs by race. ``I had never seen advertising of racial
engineering,'' he said. ``It was preference, pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Connerly is kidding. Or maybe he just doesn't know that
this is precisely the way opponents of affirmative action would
have him think.

A MORE SERIOUS JIM CARREY, TRAPPED IN THE THEATER OF TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' may star Jim Carrey, but it isn't a Jim
Carrey movie. It contains no butt-talking, no bizarro rubber-face
behavior (not much, anyway), no scatological fixation or creepy,
overarching mania.
</P>
<P>
   It boasts, instead, plentiful reason to marvel at director Peter
Weir's subversive masterpiece, the most sophisticated, artfully
disquieting commentary on identity and the evils of television
since Sidney Lumet's ``Network.''
</P>
<P>
   That landmark 1976 film, an eerily prescient satire, starred
William Holden and Faye Dunaway as Machiavellian network executives
who exploit the insanity of a news anchor (Peter Finch) in their
quest for higher ratings. Finch's character is an unwitting tool in
the network's plan, a human pawn whose individuality is abused, and
subsumed, by the media that bore him. He's trapped in the theater
of television.
</P>
<P>
   So is Truman Burbank. Truman (Carrey) is the star of a show he
doesn't even know about ``The Truman Show,'' a live, globally
popular broadcast that has tracked every motion and moment of his
life (except sex; it's a family show) since the day he was born.
Every aspect of his world is artificial, every conversation false:
His island hometown is a soundstage, his wife (Laura Linney) and
best friend (Noah Emmerich) are actors, and his kitchen is stocked
with brand-name products placed for commercial sponsors (check out
that Chef's Pal).
</P>
<P>
   The stars in the sky are stagelights in the film's first scene,
one of them crashes at Truman's foot.
</P>
<P>
   The genius of the film, the reason it intoxicates and horrifies,
is the audience's own culpability in the hoax. The onus is on us.
Like another film about television and celebrity, Hal Ashby's
``Being There,'' ``The Truman Show'' is all about watching who
watches whom, and why.
</P>
<P>
   Truman's escapades are intercut with shots of Joe Sixpacks
nesting in front of the tube: zaftig ladies on a couch, night
watchmen, tipsy bar patrons, a guy bobbing in a bathtub. They watch
Truman; we watch Truman; we watch them watching Truman.
</P>
<P>
   They watch because they're lured by the mundane dramas of his
life, and by television's seductive powers to hold them. We watch
because we're seduced as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the film becomes most unnerving when Truman starts watching
us, when he finally realizes he's the object of unseen, cunning
eyes. It's not a sudden epiphany Weir's movie unspools gradually,
establishing the artifice of Truman's world before breaking it down
entirely. He, and we, see clues to the trickery around him: a tear
in the sky, a cloudburst that rains on him alone, a wedding
photograph in which his wife is crossing her fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm being set up for something,'' Truman tells best pal,
Marlon, during a heart-to-heart on the beach. Marlon calms his
friend by gesturing to the horizon. ``Look at that sunset,
Truman,'' he says. ``It's perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is. It's too perfect, too radiant with gold and
magenta shafts of light. Everything in ``The Truman Show'' is
exaggerated to the point of spookiness. Smiles are wide, voices are
syrupy and colors throb with the false light of a postcard. When
Truman climbs past painted clouds along the wall of a bright blue
sky, the image has the surrealist artistry of a figure by Magritte.
It awes.
</P>
<P>
   Carrey is an ideal match for Truman, because his raging comic
sensibility has always carried with it a hint of innocence there's
a childlike purity to his talent, a foolish abandon that recalls
Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp. And although he never meets his
maker, a cool media magnate played by Ed Harris, Truman is very
much a son in the biblical mold. He's Adam, maybe Isaac, possibly
Jesus. He is the created in a dance with his creator.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Weir's earlier films (``Dead Poets Society,''
``Witness,'' ``Green Card'') have illumined the outsider in a
foreign or confusing environment, but this time it's the insider
who has to force his way out of maze; Truman isn't so much a
stranger in his own home as the terrified inhabitant of a strange
home. He's the one authentic presence in a universe built on lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' asks whether a human life can be scripted,
start to finish. It asks whether television drains us of privacy
and numbs us to reality. It asks us, in the end, to look at the
looker to stare Truman in the eye, and see ourselves reflected.

WE'RE ASKING DAN QUISENBERRY TO BEAR OUR BURDENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When 30,000-plus people, including me,
gathered here recently for no other reason than to cheer a famous
man who is dying, I had trouble at first imagining what drew us to
this spectacle. &QL; 
Did we really care about Dan Quisenberry, once a fabulous relief
pitcher for the Kansas City Royals, now a middle-aged man most of
the people there had never met in person? Were we there just to
thank him for all the games he saved more than a decade ago now
that the team finally was inducting him into its Hall of Fame? &QL; 
Were we there to encourage him as he battles the loose, wandering
fire of cancer that has rooted its evil self in his remarkably
creative brain? Were we simply curious to see a once-strapping
athlete now stripped mostly bald by the treatments marshaled to
bludgeon his run-amok cells? &QL; 
Did we gather to thank him for reminding us in clever and funny
ways that sport _ even at the highest professional level _ is not
to be taken with full-bore seriousness? &QL; 
No doubt we were there for all those reasons, and more, including
Dan's being a civic and giving spirit. But many of us had another
motive for coming. &QL; 
We were there, I think, because we understood in some silent,
primal part of our being that death terrifies and mystifies us, so
we have deputized Dan Quisenberry to die for us. Which is to say,
we want him to give us the nerve to face our own end. &QL; 
Dan, after all, has borne other burdens for us. He saved crucial
games to allow our baseball team to become world champion, giving
Kansas City a reason for pride and community spirit. Did we ever
feel better about ourselves than when the Royals won the 1985 World
Series? &QL; 
Dan has knee-capped the dragon of boredom for us, the dispiriting
mood that destroys the balance wheel of eternal perspective. (Who
else grew the best tomatoes in the bull pen? Who else, on hot
Sunday afternoons at the ball park, thought to get out the hose and
spray down baking fans in the bleachers? Who else told gullible
sports writers after a game that his final pitch was an overhand
curve?) &QL; 
Through his own writing he has grappled with the terror of
incomprehensible poetry for us, creating verse at once lovely and
accessible. And he has been a charitable volunteer for us, as well
as a man committed to marriage, family and religious faith. &QL; 
So it's no surprise that now we would ask him to die for us. I
don't mean that we have ever said that to him. And probably Dan
himself _ who hopes not to die at all for a long time _ does not
see things in quite the way I've described. &QL; 
But the more I think about why we were all standing there cheering
through our tears, the more I'm convinced that we hope Dan can at
least distract death for a time so it won't find us. &QL; 
As I get older, I understand in increasingly profound ways that
until we understand our death we cannot hope to understand our
life. &QL; 
The mainline Christian faith tradition that Dan Quisenberry and I
share rejects the astonishingly popular old Greek idea of the
immortality of the soul. Rather, our faith tells us that no part of
us is in any way able to survive death. Resurrection, in which we
believe with so much certainty and hope, has nothing to do with who
we are but everything to do with who God is. &QL; 
The miracle of resurrection is not that we have an eternal soul but
that a loving and sovereign God can choose to give us the gift of
eternal life despite our death. That ever-lasting life, in a
critical sense, comes out of our death, and no words can fully
exhaust the meaning of this mystery. &QL; 
But however we think of death, we remain frightened children
staring into a dark, terrifying cave. We say to each other, ``You
first.'' &QL; 
That's what we are saying to Dan Quisenberry. You first, Dan. And
if you can die with the dignity, humor and grace you've always
shown, maybe we can too. &QL; 
If Dan were writing this, he'd almost certainly now say something
light and witty, like his wonderfully famous line, ``I have seen
the future, and it's much like the present, only longer.'' &QL; 
Well, we all know that our individual futures may not be long at
all. That's what cheering Dan causes us to remember. So our hope is
that Dan will look into that uncertain black hole for us and offer
something like this version: ``I have seen the future, and it's
much like the present, only better.'' &QL; 
We are asking Dan Quisenberry, after years of saving big games for
us, to save that hope for us. It is, of course, a hugely unfair,
ridiculous request. But it's what we expect our few remaining
heroes to do for us. And it's because Dan is doing it so well that
we cheer and cry for him _ as well as for ourselves. &QL;

ANTIMATTER SEEMS A LOT LIKE SOME CELEBRITY MARRIAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1928, the year Herbert Hoover whipped Al Smith for president
and made the world safe for Depression, an English physicist named
Paul A.M. (no doubt a morning-type of fellow) Dirac predicted the
existence of antimatter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For each particle of ordinary matter in the cosmos, he said,
like your electron and your proton and so forth, there is an
antiparticle with the same mass but with an opposite charge. (This
probably won't even make sense later, so don't worry about it
making sense now.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be specific, Dirac said if there's an electron (which _ as
you surely remember from grammar school subatomic physics class _
carries a negative charge), the world's symmetry almost screams for
there to be a positively charged electron somewhere, which we now
know as a positron. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reason we know it as a positron now is that scientists have
produced it in laboratories (which makes you wonder what else
they're doing in there). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, all these antimatter particles, in theory, could form
antimatter versions of visible matter. Which would mean antistars
(like Sean Penn?), antiplanets and even antihumans, several of
whom, I swear, are drive-through window clerks at some of the
fast-food restaurants I patronize. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists theorize that there may be whole antigalaxies in
distant space. And that from these antigalaxies (or, anyway, from
some antiwhere) a few antimatter particles may get flung at Earth
from time to time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So they've sent up high-altitude balloons bearing detectors to
find them. And these detectors have turned up a few antiprotons
coming from cosmic rays. But, on the whole, the search has been
sort of disappointing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, a three-ton antimatter detector called the Alpha
Magnetic Spectrometer (its friends call it AMS, though had it been
up to me I'd have jiggled the letters so it could be SAM) is on a
shakedown cruise, preparing to spend 2002 to 2005 connected to the
new International Space Station. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Discovery recently carried the AMS into orbit,
and for a few more days the AMS is supposed to hang around the
shuttle's payload bay, trying to detect any antimatter particles
that may dance by. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An international team of scientists from 37 research
institutions collaborated on the AMS, led by Samuel C.C. Ting, a
physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Paul A.M. Dirac, Samuel C.C. Ting. There's some kind of strange
double middle initial thing going on with antimatter scientists.
Perhaps some linguists and scientists will obtain a huge government
grant to study the phenomenon. I so-so hope.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Charged particles, which may or may not be antimatter
nuclei,'' says Ting, ``have never been explored in space with
equipment at this level of precision.'' The new AMS device, he
says, ``will for the first time provide precise measurements of the
mass of charged particles in space.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems in trying to study antimatter is that it
doesn't seem to exist for very long. Anytime it gets close to
matter, both the matter and the antimatter annihilate themselves
and, in turn, produce huge amounts of energy. It's a process that
reminds me of some celebrity marriages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You have been quite patient until now not to demand to know
whether antimatter is the same as dark matter, which is what
scientists call all the unseen (so far) mass in the universe. Well,
no. They are not the same thing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But if dark matter has the symmetry to consist of both matter
and antimatter, as it may, scientists hope the AMS will help them
understand dark matter better. And speaking of the exquisite
balance of symmetry, please notice that I began this column with
the Depression and ended it with dark matter. Am I good or what? &QL;

AAA MAP'N'GO 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger

<TEXT>
<P>
   DeLorme's AAA Map'n'Go 4.0 has a new interface and offers users
the American Automobile Association's popular TourBook travel
listings on its latest CD-ROM trip-planning software.
</P>
<P>
   The new version (Windows; about $35-$40) goes beyond being just
another program that picks the route and spits out maps. It has
some interesting features not found in other programs.
</P>
<P>
   For those with 3Com's popular PalmPilot handheld computer, the
program allows users to send directions from the software directly
to the PalmPilot. It also allows users to place photographs on a
map _ a handy feature if you want to indicate landmarks for turning
points.
</P>
<P>
   It is also compatible with DeLorme's
global-positioning-by-satellite receiver, which can be hooked to a
laptop computer. The program's GPS voice navigation feature lets
the software ``speak'' the directions and alert the driver to
upcoming turns.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a scanner or digital camera, the program's ``slide
show'' program can be used to assemble favorite pictures into an
album that is displayed on the computer screen in slide-show
fashion. The production can include text and audio, and the
finished product can be printed out or e-mailed to friends.
</P>
<P>
   The program uses updated AAA travel information with listings
for more than 68,000 lodges, restaurants, campgrounds and
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Parents might appreciate a section of kids' travel activities
and games.
</P>

WHERE'S MY PET ROCK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday June 8)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On balance, I'd have to say that the fads of today aren't nearly
as annoying as the fads of years past.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, the sight of a sullen, 21-year-old convenience store
clerk fingering his eyebrow rings is almost enough to make my
rethink my opposition to mandatory sterilization. And the way some
men my age and older pull what few remaining hairs they have left
back into those pathetic little ponytails makes me think that we
might save everyone a lot of time and trouble if we forget about
Social Security reform and, instead, just have us leap off a high
cliff once we turn 40 or buy our first toupee, whichever comes
first.
</P>
<P>
   So, no, today's fads are nothing to brag about. But are they
more irritating than earlier fads? I'm inclined to say no. Take,
for instance, the ``Baby on Board'' signs. This is a perfect
example of how a gentle, well-intentioned idea (a yellow sticker
alerting other drivers to be extra-careful) can metastasize into a
huge, bloated spinoff industry of window and bumper stickers that
runs the gamut from crude to inane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby on Board'' was followed by ``Grandma on Board,'' which
was followed by ``I (heart) My (breed of yappy) Dog,'' which was
followed by ``How's My Driving? Call 1-800-EAT (bad word).''
</P>
<P>
   Flagpole sitting and goldfish swallowing were fads that had the
common courtesy to die out quickly. Bumper stickers show no sign of
going away soon, and we can blame it all on a few well-intentioned
parents in 1985 who thought they were promoting highway safety.
(You can bet we won't make that mistake again!)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of highway safety, do you remember the citizens band
radio craze of the mid-'70s? Do you want to? Of course, you don't.
That's because for three or four years, the infernal things
dominated the popular culture, assuming one can use the word
``culture'' to describe something that happened in the '70s, which
I personally think you cannot. CB radios were introduced in 1947,
but it took the Arab oil embargo of 1974 to turn them into a fad.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers and ordinary drivers yakked back and forth to each
other to find out which gas stations were open and selling gas.
(Ah, the good old days.) It wouldn't have been so bad if that was
all there was to it, but, of course, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   True CBers had to master a second language. Cops were
``Smokeys,'' Volkswagens were ``pregnant roller skates'' and if
everything was OK it was ``a big 10-4.''
</P>
<P>
   The CB craze died out thanks to cell phones (don't get me
started on them and, unwittingly, thanks to Betty Ford. Mrs. Ford
was a CB fan and even had her own handle, ``First Mama.'') Once
people learned of the connection between CBs and the Ford
administration, they quickly found other ways to waste their time.
Such as collecting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
</P>
<P>
   The comic books were bad, the TV show was worse and the movies
made ``Mr. Magoo'' seem like ``Gone With the Wind.'' I should know.
We've still got the action figures, party wagon, blimps, lunchboxes
and Halloween costumes stashed away somewhere in the attic. It's up
there with the Rubik's cubes, pet rocks, Ouija board, lava lamps
and Hula Hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's some of the dumbest, shoddiest, most useless junk
ever to defile our planet but, heck, it might be worth something
someday. Especially if any of those things ever become popular
again. Think about that.

FURS BY JOHN GALLIANO, WITH A DEEP BOW TO CASANOVA

 (JT)  
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Outside the Metropolitan Club on East 60th Street the
other day, a line of tan and entitled-looking guests waited to be
admitted to a showing of John Galliano's first fur collection.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, impeccably dressed and speaking Italian, French and
Fashionese, they looked like sitting ducks for animal-rights
advocates. Yet, no disturbances ensued, in part because the staff
of Christian Dior (Galliano is Dior's designer) had not delivered
invitations announcing the location until the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Given the buzz (both Madonna and the artist formerly known as
Prince had requested tickets, though neither appeared), the scene
at the door was relatively serene. In addition to buyers, editors,
investors and the social types one associates with Dior and with
fur (including Jocelyne Wildenstein), many young fashion followers
were at hand, egged on, perhaps, by the media's current fur frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fur is the warmest thing to wear in the winter,'' said Vincent
Gallo, the ubiquitous hipster-actor-director. ``It's also
long-lasting, so you don't have to contribute to pollution by
throwing it away. I think the animal-rights people are missing the
point. To create beautiful objects should be the goal of life on
this planet.''
</P>
<P>
   After 300 guests passed by security guards who pawed through
their bags, they stood around in the club's monumental marble
entrance hall (completed by Stanford White in 1894) waiting to go
upstairs. Since it was the first time Galliano was bringing his
flamboyant style of fashion show and his Mediterranean sense of
time to New York, the crowd didn't seem to mind waiting for an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   To amuse and sedate them, there was wine, heaping piles of
fruit, trays of canapes, and a harpsichordist under the vaulted
ceiling. There was also Anna Wintour, fur's big champion, looking
down at the crowd in her sunglasses, like some kind of master
puppeteer, from atop a grand marble staircase. And if that wasn't
enough, several nearly naked, androgynous male models were
lounging, Casanova-style, on banisters and benches. One was
lounging on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're allowed to roll around half naked,'' said Grace
Coddington, the creative director of Vogue, ``but the members of
this club have to wear a jacket and tie.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the guests waited downstairs, two immense banquet rooms
upstairs, once used by Vanderbilts, Whitneys and Roosevelts, were
being readied for seating. They had been artfully trashed to create
a Casanova-has-been-here look _ with period furniture strewn with
flower petals, talcum powder, costume jewelry, and dirty wine
glasses. There was a canopied bed festooned with wreaths of flowers
and one long banquet table that looked as if it had just been
vacated by Madame de Pompadour, Rousseau, Louis XV and other
members of Casanova's coterie. One male model was lying on top of
the table, biding his time by eating grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had worse jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After everyone was seated, the show (inspired, of course, by
Casanova) began, and it was worth the wait. Galliano's standouts,
produced for Dior by Stallion Inc., included sheared minks in black
and white inlaid geometric patterns; silk kimono coats with silver
fox collars and cuffs, Poiret-inspired sable day coats lined with
handmade silk roses; pastel-colored chinchilla wraps, and broadtail
lamb wasp-waisted suits. In the new tradition of fur for the
fashion-forward, many were casual and light enough to wear when
chasing fur protesters or paparazzi down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the coats, which Galliano said he designed to reflect
romance, not wealth, were worn over lingerie. As usual with a
Galliano show, half the fun was in the presentation. To show the
coats, models passed through, fanned themselves and flounced about,
taking tipsy, uncertain steps, as if they were in an absinthe
stupor. They didn't seem to be straining for effect. Neither did
the male models who traipsed around caressing both the furs and
women and occasionally licking frosting off their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow,'' said a very pregnant editor, who covered her belly with
her program.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was enough to make you feel transgressive just for
watching.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the guests left looking slightly punch-drunk from the
excess. One well-heeled matron grabbed an armload of grapes to take

``Oh, come on,'' she said as she stuffed one into his mouth, ``sin

MEXICO COVETS ROLE IN THE REBIRTH OF VW'S NEW BEETLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 7)   (EDs: Photos available on Wieck database)

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUEBLA, Mexico _ For 40 years, the ``people's car'' of Mexico
has been made in this colonial city by a German automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Workers will build 55,000 old-style Volkswagen Beetles here this
year. All are for the domestic market, where they are the backbone
of motoring for Mexico's middle-class.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition to building the old Mexican staple, Puebla's
Volkswagen plant is building VW's popular new Beetle for the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
   The new Beetle, Volkswagen's 1998 version of its trademark Bug,
was designed to recapture the automaker's market in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Clever ad campaigns capitalize on the nostalgia with an ironic
wink. ``If you sold your soul in the '80s, now you can buy it
back,'' teases one.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen has succeeded in raising the level of emotion around
its product. Auto dealers can't get the round little autos in their
shops fast enough to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Here on the assembly line, that means 16-hour days for Everardo
Rodriguez, a team leader overseeing quality control. Being a part
of Beetle history is worth it, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel proud that we in Mexico are making a car for the whole
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The factory has boosted production by 13 percent since May,
pumping out 450 new Beetles per day. Sportier models with heated
seats and computerized maps for the European market are next on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Top Volkswagen executives are banking on the new Beetle to turn
around years of lackluster sales in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fad car, and they know it,'' said Sam Fiorani, an
automotive sales analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's research unit.
``It's a great draw. It's selling great right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 of the 50,000 new Beetles destined for the U.S.
market this year have been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wijers, a spokesman for Volkswagen of Mexico, said the
company needed to rebuild its name in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't checking on the quality around the world. They
forgot about Asia. They forgot about the U.S.,'' Wijers said. ``The
car would rattle and shake. Spare parts were hard to get and
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen closed its last U.S. production plant, in
Westmoreland, Pa., in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker's U.S. sales hit bottom in 1993, selling just
44,000 units because of slow production in the Puebla factory,
Fiorani said. It was a far cry from 1968, when the Beetle alone
sold 423,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   Response to the new Beetle concept car at the 1994 Detroit trade
fair was enthusiastic. The question: Where to build this car with
so much riding on it?
</P>
<P>
   Proximity to the American market made Puebla, with a plant east
of Mexico City that employs 15,800 workers, the sensible choice
logistically. In addition, the New Beetle is built on the same auto
platform as the VW Jetta and the Golf, which also are made in
Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   And Fiorani said Puebla has become one of the top producing auto
factories on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Wijers said VW executives chose Puebla from among 10 possible
plants because quality standards were high.
</P>
<P>
   Costs, given Mexico's low wages, would be as much as 15 percent
lower than in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The average wage for a basic-level line worker is about $93 a
week for a six-day, 48-hour workweek in Mexico, compared to $632 at
Volkswagen-Germany's 29-hour, four-day workweek.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen officials point to the much higher tax rate German
workers must pay, plus the disparity in living costs in a highly
industrialized economy versus those in a developing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Wijers touted the benefits package that accompanies the wage,
the on-campus cafeterias that serve food at a discount, and the 40
buses that shuttle workers to and from their jobs at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Puebla city leaders say having Volkswagen here helps curb the
phenomenon endemic in a nation where half the population lives
below the poverty level, and whose citizens must trek to the border
or Mexico City to seek work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a problem. We knew there had to be another way,'' said
Sergio Montano, spokesman for Puebla's City Hall. ``Volkswagen is
giving good opportunities to Mexicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen invested $1 billion to expand its plant to produce
the new Beetle. Some 26 suppliers, half of them international
companies, are located in an industrial park nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Montano estimated wages paid and related economic impact make up
between 12 percent to 15 percent of the city's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said workers are learning more advanced skills than
the traditional Beetle ever demanded of them.
</P>
<P>
   The profile of the new Beetle is born when workers press sheets
of steel into the distinctively curvaceous profile.
</P>
<P>
   On the manufacturing line, workers gingerly guide an
octopus-like spot-welder to tack some of the 3,000 welds that go
into the car.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish line, an army of new Beetles in brilliant red,
yellow, blue and silver colors inch forward silently on nearly
motionless conveyer belts.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one of the few places women workers are seen, touching
up the lacquer on the trunk locks with paintbrushes.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a nearby building on the 30,000-acre Volkswagen campus, the
traditional Beetle is still built _ 80 percent of the work done by
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the new Beetle workshop to that of the old
model is stark.
</P>
<P>
   The din is tremendous. Salsa music blares. Hammers clang against
metal.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow auto platform fitted with an engine is placed in
position before the body of the Love Bug goes over top.
</P>
<P>
   A company official said the plant is the only one in the world
where body and chassis are built separately and then attached.
</P>
<P>
   This handcrafted little car, seen as a campy anachronism north
of the border, powers Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At about $7,500, with government subsidized tax-relief on 20
percent of the car's value, the traditional Beetle is the most
affordable new car in the Mexican market. The wee air-cooled engine
is attached to the Bug's caboose with four simple bolts, making
maintenance easy.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Beetles produced here this year will be exported.
Instead, they will serve across the country as taxicabs, first cars
for middle-class boys, family autos for working-class parents, and
company vehicles for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the VW Bug is basic transportation. But, as Wijers
said, it's also a deeply ingrained feature of Mexican cultural
history.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans fondly call their Beetles ``vochos,'' an Indian word
meaning little kid. At least three glossy magazines devoted to the
subject populate Mexican newsstands. Among them, ``Vochomania''
just increased its publication to twice monthly.
</P>
<P>
   Beetle sales last year in Mexico fell to 35,000. It may have
been the effects of the 1995 peso crisis, but Wijers theorized that
would-be Beetle buyers were waiting to see if the new model would
be in their price range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were our own competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the $17,500 retail price of the new Beetle puts it
way out of the price range for most Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   North of the Rio Grande, too, the Beetle is not about affordable
transportation but about a lifestyle choice.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorani referred to it as a ``boutique car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a selling piece. The bigger trick will be to bring people
in for the other Volkswagen models,'' he said. ``It's made a
splash. But you can only make a splash once.''

 INDIA CHANTS LOUDER TO THE AMERICAN PSYCHE   (For release Sun.,
June 7)   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a sunny morning last week, Bonnie Pressman sat in
her office on the 10th floor of a gleaming Fifth Avenue tower. The
black-matte telephone on her desk looked big enough to route the
calls of a small city, and it wouldn't stop beeping and mewling.
Two assistants hovered by the door, impatient to escort her to a
meeting, while the noise of a jackhammer rose from the street.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Pressman, the executive vice president and fashion
director of Barneys New York, ignored the phone, asked an assistant
to shut the door and stalled the waiting suits in a conference
room.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ms. Pressman _ calm as a yogi _ was talking about how
India changed her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started about three years ago,'' she said, a forelock
of blond hair dangling over one eye. She had been diagnosed with
breast cancer and decided to visit an ayurvedic spa in Colorado.
``It was time to make some changes,'' she said. She learned to
meditate, became fascinated with Indian spiritualism and went on to
take her first trip to India this year. ``It restored my sense of
peace,'' she said of her Indian sojourn. ``If not every year, at
least every other year for the rest of my life, I will go to
India.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pressman belongs to the growing number of trendsetters on
the East and West Coasts _ high-profile people from the worlds of
fashion, entertainment and society _ who have taken passages to
India, following to their source the popular interest in yoga, the
writings of Deepak Chopra and the blissed-out look in fashion and
cosmetics. Although Ms. Pressman discovered India through a medical
emergency, many others seem simply to be carried on the winds of
the latest trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always wanted to go to India,'' said Nina Griscom, a
former host on the Food Network and a peripatetic figure on
Manhattan's social landscape, who visited India for the first time
in March. ``I have a lot of Indian friends, and I'd been reading a
lot of Indian literature. I can't really pinpoint why, but I just
felt it was finally time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marie-Anne Oudejans, the designer who founded the fashion
house Tocca, abruptly resigned two months ago, surprising the
fashion world and leaving no forwarding number, it was to Udaipur
that she disappeared for 10 days. The junior jet setter Lulu de
Kwiatkowski visited India in the spring, and Stephan de
Kwiatkowski, her brother, goes once a year. The models Kate Moss
and Naomi Campbell stored up reserves of equanimity in Rajasthan
for the hectic ready-to-wear shows in March. Ms. Campbell was
accompanied by Didier Fernandez, a booker who until recently worked
at Elite.
</P>
<P>
   But the beautiful people are not alone. Tourism by Americans
visiting India reached its highest last year, 244,329, up about 70
percent from four years ago, said Ronjon Lahiri, the assistant
director of the India Tourist Office. ``We've been very lucky this
year,'' Lahiri said. ``In the '60s and '70s, there was the large
influx of the so-called hippie movement. And we're seeing something
similar to that again. We've cornered the cultural market.''
</P>
<P>
   From cosmetics to clothing, India has permeated American pop
culture for years. Chopra, the best-selling spiritual author, has
attracted followers like Donna Karan and Demi Moore. New cosmetics
lines by Aveda and Origins have grown popular by emphasizing a
mystical connection. Flip open any magazine _ Vogue, Harper's
Bazaar, even People _ and you'll find a page of starlets in
Indian-inspired clothing with a block-that-pun headline like
``Who's Sari Now?''
</P>
<P>
   Walk into a bookstore and witness the boomlet of literature by
young Indian authors _ Kiran Desai, Vikram Chandra, Sanjay Nigam,
Arundhati Roy _ who have published well-publicized novels in the
last year. Turn on MTV and see Madonna's ``Frozen,'' an elaborate
video evocative of India, in which the former Material Girl shows
off her hands, patterned with the painstaking henna designs popular
with Indian women.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Western fascination with Indian culture has gone in
cycles for a long time. Ever since Alexander the Great marched into
northern India in 326 B.C. to persuade a yogi to return to Greece
with him (the yogi declined, preferring instead to immolate himself
on a funeral pyre), Westerners have periodically sought yogic
counsel. The potential threat of nuclear jousting between Pakistan
and India does not seem to have dimmed the latest cultural
infatuation.
</P>
<P>
   The most hard-core recent visitors _ Sting, the director Andre
Gregory, the actors Meg Ryan and Betty Buckley, the Hong Kong
clothing impresario Joyce Ma and the social figure Anne Dexter
Jones _ are devotees not only of India, but also of the ashram
experience.
</P>
<P>
   At Indian ashrams, ``you see increasing numbers of Americans,''
said Anne Cushman, co-author of ``From Here to Nirvana: The Yoga
Journal Guide to Spiritual India'' (Riverhead Books, 1998).
Comparing the ashrams she has visited, she said, ``There are
certainly places that are more Westernized _ wealthier ashrams
associated with gurus who have followings in the United States.''
There's Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh's commune at Poona, for example,
which remains large and popular with Westerners despite the infamy
of its deceased founder, who was deported from the United States in
the 1980s after pleading guilty to violations of the immigration
law at his commune in Oregon. Today, Indians take guided tours
there to behold the Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to India now, you see gurus with cell phones and
ashrams with e-mail,'' said Jerry Jones, Ms. Cushman's co-author,
who has visited more than 60 ashrams. ``India is popular with
everyone now, but we also have to realize when we _ Americans and
Indians _ are overstepping each other's boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashram'' is a term for a community of seekers that grows up
around a spiritual leader. ``It can be anything from a couple of
caves in a mountainside with cots, and you trek in with your own
food, or it can be a quite comfortable building in the heart of a
large city, almost like a hotel,'' Ms. Cushman said. Visits can
vary from a day to years, and prices are just as wide ranging: from
$1.50 a day to as much as $250 a day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the ashrams particularly popular with Americans is one
outside Bombay in Ganeshpuri founded by Swami Muktananda, who was
influential among the Eastern teachers who came to the United
States in the 1960s and '70s. The ashram is now run by Gurumayi
Chidvilasananda, known to her followers simply as Gurumayi.
</P>
<P>
   Her affiliated ashram in South Fallsburg, N.Y., the SYDA
Foundation (the acronym stands for Siddha Yoga Dham of America),
has attracted Meg Ryan, the hair stylist John Frieda and the
Manhattan socialite Mica Ertegun. Gurumayi's high profile is
further insured by the encouragement of visitors to her ashram to
carry her beatific portrait; it comes in a handy wallet size.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very charismatic and glamorous,'' Jones said. ``She
looks like a movie star. It can't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Dexter Jones, the style editor of Hamptons Country
magazine, who is married to Mick Jones of the '70s rock band
Foreigner, said that she had noticed her own interest in the ashram
experience, and in India, picking up recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in my teens, it was trendy _ you know, back in the
old Sai Baba days,'' she said, referring to the popular guru, who
died in 1982 but whose meditation technique, as taught by
disciples, still attracts thousands of Americans. ``Then I came
across a fair number of charlatans, and I became a little
disillusioned. But now it's attractive to me again.'' Ms. Jones has
taken her five children to Gurumayi's ashram in South Fallsburg,
N.Y., which during its summer peak attracts thousands of visitors
daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more children understand and respect other religions and
ways of thinking, the less likely they are to be fearful, and the
more likely they are to be more respectful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Tuck, a Los Angeles actress, is planning her first visit
to an ashram. She studies meditation at the Los Angeles Baba
Center, which is named for Sai Baba, and is planning to go to Sai
Baba's ashram in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, people get hooked up with ashrams because they're
connected to some kind of yogi in the United States,'' Ms. Tuck
said. ``I've spent so much of my life looking for happiness outside
of myself that, without sounding too `Kumbaya,' it had made me look
inside myself for happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   At the ashram in Poona, the popular ``mystic rose'' course is a
three-week class in which participants laugh for three hours a day
for the first week, cry for three hours a day during the second
week and remain silent for three hours a day during the final week.
(Visitors are also encouraged to use the ``Zennis'' courts,
lagoon-shape swimming pool and beauty salon.)
</P>
<P>
   Ashrams are not without their controversy. At Poona, for
example, the commune has been proclaimed an ``AIDS-free zone'' and
the policy of requiring every guest to have an AIDS test _ provided
by the center's own testing center _ has raised eyebrows among
visitors and added to a swinging-singles profile. And the seemingly
redoubtable Gurumayi was the subject of a New Yorker profile in
1994, in which the author raised questions about her fund-raising
and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite those issues, ashrams are popular now, for a lot of
different factors,'' Ms. Cushman said. ``Boomers are getting older.
They've achieved a lot of the material goals they thought were
going to make them so happy. They've discovered that they're not as
blissful as they should be with that house, that car and that
second marriage. And we have a tremendous amount of information
about these things now, so you're not just stuck with the spiritual
traditions of your ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Buckley, the actress and longtime Gurumayi devotee, who is
spending Sunday meditating in preparation for her performance at
the Tony Awards Monday night, sees it another way: ``We've become
more of a youth-worshiping culture than ever, a culture that lives
fast and hard, and we have impossible standards. I think that's one
of the reasons we're reaching out now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pressman meditates twice a day. She says she is in good
health. Her peaches-and-cream complexion puts peaches and cream to
shame. She has given up eating meat, smoking cigarettes and
drinking coffee. Barneys is planning to introduce the opulent,
Indian-inspired design collection of Colette Dinnigan in the fall,
and the photographs of runway models in bolts of bright fabric
littered Ms. Pressman's Yugo-size desk.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pressman has long-term plans. She paused in the doorway on
the way to her postponed meeting and, as the unanswered telephone
rang repeatedly, she said: ``I know where I'm going to retire. I'd
like to retire in India.''

WORLD CUP ORGANIZERS FEAR TERRORISTS WILL TARGET EVENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, June 7) 
 
By JOHN P. LOPEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a rarely publicized multinational coalition of security
forces in Europe called The Vigipirate.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-terrorism consortium formed in 1978, it is such a
far-reaching, massive association that in 20 years, the Vigipirate
has felt the need to go into action only three times.
</P>
<P>
   The first operation was in early 1991 at the outbreak of the
Persian Gulf War. The second came in September 1995, following a
series of bombings and a bloody attack on a Jewish school in
southern France.
</P>
<P>
   The third operation is in effect now _ for the 1998 World Cup of
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nothing better illustrates security concerns regarding
the upcoming worldwide soccer extravaganza than the lengths to
which French and neighboring European leaders are going in an
attempt to avoid disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Vigipirate took part in synchronized pre-dawn
raids at 10 locations across France, arresting 88 suspected
terrorists, said to represent the Algerian Armed Islamic Group, who
officials believe were targeting the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officers from France, Belgium, Italy, Germany
and Switzerland participated in the arrests. Confiscated in the
raids were false passports, fundamentalist propaganda, training
videos and ``materials,'' according to police.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the arrests, one might ask, ``What is the world
coming to?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, it is the ultimate quadrennial championship of
the world's favorite game, a five-week showcase of spectacular
athleticism, color and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 World Cup, which is expected to draw nearly 2.5 million
people to France and attract a cumulative television audience of
more than 30 billion, begins Tuesday and concludes with the
championship game July 12 in Saint Denis, a quaint city just north
of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   There will be 64 matches in 10 French cities involving 32
nations, 10,000 members of the media, every form of mass transport,
countless open-air parties and hundreds of organized events for
fans. Numerous world figures will attend, from heads of state to
international royalty to television and movie personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, concern about potential security problems for the World
Cup goes far beyond the typical drunkenness and soccer hooliganism.
World Cup organizers are bracing for the unknown _ up to and
including terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our biggest security concern this year, undoubtedly
terrorism,'' said Walter Gagg, head of security for the World Cup.
``The terrorists know there is no bigger platform for them than the
World Cup. We have mounted a major operation.''
</P>
<P>
   France, with its easy access from every border, might prove to
be an irresistible target.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when the World Cup was held in the United
States, simple geography aided security forces. It was difficult
for much of the world to arrive in the United States by anything
but airplane. Since airport security forces easily dispatched or
arrested known thugs or terrorist sympathizers as they tried to
enter the country, problems were held to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   For the entire tournament four years ago, barely more than 100
Cup-related arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   But in France, the estimated 2.5 million people expected to
watch the event will be arriving en masse from every direction,
using planes, ships, trains and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 French army personnel will guard airports,
railway stations and ports. Another 800 officers will be deployed
to what are considered ``sensitive points'' in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Each national team participating in the tournament will be
protected by the elite French RAID police. Many teams, including
the U.S. team, will bring their own security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   There also will be more than 5,000 plainclothes members of the
French security force roaming venues and cities. On game days, the
French Interior Ministry will deploy up to 6,000 police officers to
stadium sites.
</P>
<P>
   Even magistrates will be deployed to makeshift courts at various
venues for what the French are calling ``fast track'' justice,
allowing suspected criminals to be tried and sentenced within 48
hours of their offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will go into this World Cup knowing that we have done
everything possible to handle the event,'' coordinating security
officer Rene-Georges Querry said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Querry admitted, ``Threats have not yet disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   World Cup security officials hope that efforts such as last
month's pre-emptive strike against the Algerian Armed Islamic Group
will avert potential terrorism by sending a signal that terrorist
groups are being monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the most common threat at international soccer
matches, fan violence, security leaders appear to be happy with
their strategy but unhappy with World Cup ticketing and other
policies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the system for ticket sales might even encourage
rowdiness, some believe. Nearly 90 percent of all tickets for the
Cup were sold to the French. The idea was to simultaneously give
the home team an edge while limiting the number of tickets to
potential troublemakers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the world criticized France's ticketing policy from the
moment it was implemented. The exceptions were ticket brokers and
scalpers. Already, brokers reportedly have sold more than 20,000
tickets to English fans alone, at prices up to 40 times their face
value. Fans from Italy, Germany, The Netherlands and Spain are
scooping up scalped tickets at a record pace, too.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be that instead of fans being grouped by
nationality at events, they will be mixed together, potentially an
explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
   Security personnel also are lamenting the organizers' decision
to send each team to three different cities for first-round
matches. Usually, each team plays a pair of matches in one city and
a third elsewhere, which encourages fans to establish a home base
of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, with fans from rival countries mixing daily at
train stations and airports, more dangerous clashes could occur.
</P>
<P>
   Another controversial decision by organizers was to set up
fences around both the Toulouse and Lens stadiums, where the
English will play. In the past, ugly scenes have occurred when fans
were ``caged'' away from the field, including riots and fans being
crushed against fences.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers defend the decision, saying that escape hatches have
been constructed in the fencing should dangerous situations arise.
</P>
<P>
   Most every security decision at stadiums clearly was made with
the most notorious offenders in mind _ the English and Dutch. The
English federation is expected to bring a large group of British
police to every game, with each officer carrying portfolios on
ringleaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some English and Dutch matches also will not be shown on giant
screens erected outside of stadiums, which will be the norm
elsewhere, in an effort to discourage ticketless thugs from showing
up in an area where there is sure to be stifling heat and cheap
wine in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Cup is the greatest event there is,'' Gagg said.
``It is supposed to be a great party for everyone. We want to make
sure that that is what it will be.''

WEST'S INTERVENTION IN LATEST BALKANS CRISIS IS A NONSTARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The effort by the international community, including the
United States, to lean on Serbia over its harsh treatment of the
ethnic Albanians in its province of Kosovo is ill-advised and
probably has made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic isn't exactly the world's
political pinup, and Serbia's behavior since the breakup of the old
Yugoslavia in the early 1990s has been reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo isn't Bosnia, where Serbian military intervention had
the clear marks of aggression from the outside. Kosovo has been an
integral part of Serbia for centuries. Indeed, Serbs regard it as
the historic core of their nation even though these days Kosovo's
population is mainly composed of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Kosovo is complex. Where in the Balkans isn't
it? But it is almost possible to sympathize with the thuggish
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Were he to yield to the Kosovo liberation movement, which seeks
independence as a step toward absorption by neighboring Albania, or
even grant autonomy to the province, he might as well pack his
suitcase and flee the country. He would trigger a national uprising
with many of his supposedly pro-democracy critics at home loudest
in their denunciation of him.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic could abandon the Bosnian Serbs as he did when he
signed the Dayton, Ohio, peace accord in November 1995 because his
own Serbs had turned sour on the Bosnian conflict following the
imposition of international economic sanctions against them. But
there's no sign of them buckling under to sanctions over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, their resolve is stiffened every time a Western
official condemns their oppression of the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that under the communist regime of the late Josef Broz
Tito, Kosovo possessed autonomy of sorts. But Tito had nothing to
fear. He ruled all Yugoslavia with unquestioned authority, and the
Kosovo separatists knew they didn't stand a chance of gaining
independence. An uprising in the Tito era would have been
unanimously condemned by the international community as increasing
the risk of a broader war.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Milosevic rules a rump Yugoslavia consisting only of
Serbia and tiny Montenegro. In recent elections, even the
Montenegrins challenged his power.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder the Serbs view the Albanians' defiance and the
outside world's support for the rebels as tantamount to an attempt
to atomize Serbia itself.
</P>
<P>
   Short of armed intervention by the United States and other
powers, it is hard to envisage the Serbs ever giving in. And, of
course, military intervention is unthinkable. Serbia is a sovereign
state of which Kosovo forms a part. Western indignation can produce
little practical result.
</P>
<P>
   There is an irony in the crisis that is seldom mentioned: The
Albanians of Kosovo insist they want much closer ties with their
ethnic brothers and sisters of Albania.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of Albania's own citizens have fled to the West in
recent years, fed up with desperately impoverished living
conditions. Closer relations with fellow ethnics is just about the
last thing on the Albanian refugees' minds.

GOLDWATER: A POOR CANDIDATE BUT ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Release Sunday, June 7)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Oh, thank you, Mr. Thompson,'' exclaimed the
woman from northern New Jersey. ``You're the first one who ever
made me feel good about voting for Senator Goldwater.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred several years ago after a speech I made to
a women's organization in Ridgewood. I had just recalled an evening
toward the end of the acrimonious 1964 political showdown when
Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential nominee, took a
respite from campaigning to present his delightful collection of
Hopi Kachina dolls to a museum in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The mellow candidate who appeared before his fellow Arizonans
that evening bore very little resemblance to the shoot-from-the-lip
conservative whose public utterances and presidential nomination
had fractured the Republican Party and scared the daylights out of
many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In a short time, he had managed to alienate millions of people
who viewed him as something of a mad bomber who would ignite
nuclear war. He also lost the support of millions who depended on
Social Security, the Tennessee Valley Authority, recently-enacted
civil rights laws and other federal policies that he had attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The woman from Ridgewood was not alone among loyal Republicans
who voted for Barry Goldwater with trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   In the endless pageant of individuals questing for the
presidency, he occupies an unusual place. He was a living paradox _
a colorful, outspoken westerner who was at once one of the 20th
century's worst candidates and one of its most memorable also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   Like other defeated candidates such as Alf Landon in 1936,
George McGovern in 1972, and Michael Dukakis in 1988, Goldwater ran
a poor campaign. But like Wendell Willkie in 1940, Adlai Stevenson
in 1852 and 1956 and Hubert Humphrey in 1968, he voiced opinions
and defined issues that left a lasting imprint on the republic.
</P>
<P>
   When the votes were counted in 1964, Goldwater had carried only
Arizona and five states of the Deep South. Lyndon Johnson prevailed
in the other 44 states and carried nearly two thirds of the popular
vote while the Republicans were losing 38 seats in the House and
two in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives contend that Goldwater was simply ahead of his
time, and there may be some truth to that argument. But the larger
truth is that he was out of step with public sentiment in the
mid-1960s when a majority of Americans supported legislative
efforts to end legalized racial segregation and wanted to use their
government as an instrument to improve conditions for the poor, the
young and the aged.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no question, however, that Goldwater was the
godfather of the modern conservatism that eventually landed Ronald
Reagan in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Young Americans for Freedom who flocked to Goldwater's
rallies in the 1960s were adult voters and campaign workers by the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But Goldwater did not share their enthusiasm for the agenda of
today's apostles of the religious right who would outlaw abortion,
install organized prayer in public schools and refuse to grant gays
the rights enjoyed by heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   A rugged man of the West who prized independence and freedom, he
could not march to the beat tapped out by Jerry Falwell, Pat
Robertson and their brethren who would have government dictate
private conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater once said in an interview that among the men who had
served in the White House during his years in politics he most
admired Harry Truman. Although they differed drastically on the
role government should play in the lives of the people, he liked
Truman's honesty and integrity and the way he spoke his mind.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, he regarded his sometime friend and political
ally Richard Nixon as the ``most dishonest'' man he had ever known.
</P>
<P>
   In the contentious summer of 1974, it was Goldwater who was
chosen by his fellow Republicans to inform Nixon that if he did not
resign, he would be convicted in the Senate of impeachment charges
voted by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was a staunch Republican, he prized his friendship
with John Kennedy, Hubert Humphrey and other Democrats in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   I recall Goldwater and Humphrey greeting each other with genuine
warmth when their paths crossed at the national plowing contest in
South Dakota in the autumn of 1964. Although one was the GOP
nominee for president and the other the Democratic nominee for vice
president, Goldwater told reporters, ``We're good friends and visit
each other's homes. There's no reason why this campaign should
interfere with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of us who covered his campaign wondered if Goldwater really
wanted to be president. He did and said so many things that a man
lusting for the Oval Office would not do and say.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a stubborn old desert rat who was determined to be
candid with the voters even if him cost him the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, a far smoother politician than Goldwater, talked about
getting government ``off the backs'' of the people but made no
effort to end popular programs that benefited them. He was
brilliant at compromising his position while claiming that he stood
firmly on principle.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater, as president, probably would have tried to abolish
many of the New Deal reforms that people had come to cherish and
depend on. And he would have failed.

RESEARCHERS ENCOUNTER FLAK IN TRYING TO FIGHT GULF SYNDROME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DON FINLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. _ Inside the laboratory of Drs. Garth
and Nancy Nicolson, a freezer is cracked open and a cloud of frosty
vapor slowly dissolves to reveal row after row of metal boxes, the
boxes filled with vials, the vials in turn filled with the blood of
Gulf War veterans and their families.
</P>
<P>
   A few of those vials are being shipped to laboratories in an
attempt to support or debunk one of the most controversial theories
of Gulf War illness.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Nicolsons have argued that the vague and
frustrating symptoms that make up the disorder _ estimated to
afflict some 70,000 veterans _ are in many cases caused by an
infection known as ``mycoplasma fermentans.''
</P>
<P>
   They have treated a number of veterans, their families and their
own daughter with long-term antibiotic therapy.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, because of their work, the Department of
Veterans Affairs began planning a large, multicity study looking at
the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicolsons' theory of Gulf War illness has attracted fervent
supporters among some veterans and their families, and, until
recently, skepticism and even scorn from the military and many in
the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have hypothesized this is a war agent,'' Garth Nicolson
said in an interview at his laboratory, a small, plain building
within an industrial park in this Orange County suburb southeast of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In many of the soldiers, the mycoplasma appear to be genetically
engineered to include a gene from HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
Nicolson said. He believes that particular gene, called GP-120,
could make it easier for the mycoplasma to target cells important
to the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the soldiers, we find principally one mycoplasma _
`mycoplasma fermentans.' It's also called `incognitus' because it
burrows deep in the cells. Everyone who is very, very sick has this
one species.''
</P>
<P>
   Military researchers are doubtful, saying standard blood tests
to detect mycoplasma have failed to confirm the Nicolsons' claims.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nicolsons argue this infection hides deep in cells,
rather than floating free in blood. A test developed by Nancy
Nicolson, called nuclear gene tracking, coupled with a technique
called forensic polymerase chain reaction, sniffs out the genetic
code of the mycoplasma infection, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Two civilian labs in California _ one private, another
associated with the University of California at Irvine _ have
reported finding high levels of mycoplasma in Gulf War vets, as
well as in civilian patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and
fibromyalgia, two other conditions with similar vague and multiple
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   It might have ended there, but Nicolson's claims were heard by
some members of Congress, particularly Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash.,
and Rep. Norman D. Dicks, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   At their urging, the Department of Defense agreed last year to
train researchers at four laboratories in the Nicolsons' precise
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has caught Congress' attention, that all these people are
sick and if we just give them some antibiotics they'll get better
and stop complaining,'' said Navy Capt. Michael Kilpatrick with the
Office of the Special Assistant for Gulf War Illness. ``We in the
medical side _ the DOD and the VA _ are very willing to work with
the political side, but we need to do it in a way that we're not
putting people in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers flew to Huntington Beach in January. The group
included Dr. Joel Baseman, an internationally recognized mycoplasma
expert and chairman of microbiology at the University of Texas
Health Science Center, and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important for the DOD to do this right, and
they recognize this,'' Baseman said.
</P>
<P>
   Baseman said the Nicolsons' techniques ``make sense.'' He said
the fact that all the participating laboratories have now been
trained to duplicate their methods, and that all will use identical
materials from the same commercial suppliers, will resolve the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Baseman said trying to identify the cause of Gulf War illness
seven years after the war is an extraordinary challenge _
particularly given the growing list of possible exposures soldiers
faced, such as chemical agents, sand storms, oil fires and anthrax
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best thing that could have happened, from my point
of view, at this late date. There's been a lot of anxious moments,
a lot of debate, challenges among different laboratory groups and
politicians. And now we're saying, all right, let's do some
science.''

</P>
<P>
   Mycoplasma are unique among infectious organisms. They are among
the smallest of bacteria, and are unusual in that they lack a cell
wall and depend on a host organism _ either plant or animal _ to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mycoplasmas are extremely unusual,'' Baseman said. ``They are
stealth-like, they can invade cells, establish some sort of
residency. These are microorganisms that could establish these
chronic infections ...''
</P>
<P>
   Mycoplasma strains were first linked to human infections in the
1930s and 1940s. They are a major cause of atypical pneumonia, and
have been isolated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia,
urinary tract infections and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Nicolson is a respected cancer researcher, who until 1996
was the David Bruton Jr. Chair in Cancer Research at the University
of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. His wife, Nancy,
was an instructor in biophysics at Baylor College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Their journey began in 1991, when Garth Nicolson's daughter,
Sharron, returned from the Persian Gulf with health problems. She
had been a staff sergeant and crew chief of a Blackhawk helicopter
with the Army's 101st Airborne Division, and was completing pilot
training when she became ill.
</P>
<P>
   Her symptoms were typical of Gulf War illness. Among them:
fatigue, intermittent fever, joint and muscle pain and impairments
in short-term memory.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nicolson found those symptoms familiar. She had suffered a
similar illness in 1987 while working at Baylor, she said. At that
time, she and her husband experimented with antibiotic treatment
that eventually cured her illness.
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting their daughter suffered from the same problem, they
successfully repeated the treatment on her.
</P>
<P>
   As other veterans began reporting similar complaints, they
started searching for a possible cause. They eventually focused on
mycoplasma.

HAS KAY GRANGER STEPPED ON PRO-CHOICE FORCES' TOES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some pro-choice groups want to make Rep. Kay Granger of Texas
face the music, claiming she ain't dancing with them what brung her
to the big party in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters for her challenger in November, Democrat Tom Hall,
are trying to use the Republican congresswoman's voting record to
paint her as anti-choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A surprising and disappointing fact about Congresswoman Kay
Granger has become evident,'' begins a May mailing by Women for
Choice, Women for Tom Hall. ``Kay Granger is anti-choice. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Granger has become another cog in the Right-Wing Republican
plan to eliminate a woman's right to choose,'' says the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The communique goes on to cite Granger's legislative scorecard
as rated by National Right to Life and the National Abortion Rights
Action League. According to the letter, Granger voted ``100 percent
in favor of the Republican Anti-Choice Agenda'' and ``scored a
paltry 3 percent,'' according to NARAL.
</P>
<P>
   Her detractors, including Hall, the Fort Worth attorney who
faces her in the general election, point to that record as evidence
of her kowtowing to Republican bigwigs inside the Texas delegation
and out, rather than doing right by her moderately conservative
district.
</P>
<P>
   Balderdash, says Granger.
</P>
<P>
   ``My position is always going to be one that doesn't satisfy
some people,'' Granger said this week in a phone interview from her
Washington office. ``I am a pro-choice person with exceptions. And
those exceptions occur when the issue is taxpayer-funded abortions
or abortion lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it clear in the campaign, and that has been the way I
have voted.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the former Fort Worth mayor has learned some
fancy footwork that usually takes new members of Congress longer to
master. She sashayed up to House Speaker Newt Gingrich quicker than
you can say Cotton-Eyed Joe, and it paid off in powerful
appointments and opportunities normally not bestowed on lowly
freshmen. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee was
a coup for a rookie, as was her appointment to the House Budget
Committee, where she fought hard to limit defense spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Her voting record can't be argued. According to Congressional
Quarterly, Granger voted 95 percent of the time with her GOP
colleagues on party-line issues. That should put to rest the
concerns by GOP leaders prior to her 1996 election that she might
not be loyal to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Granger contends she has a realistic grasp on the moderate
leanings of the 12th Congressional District _ a district that
faithfully supported Pete Geren, a Democrat who on some issues
could out-conservative the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my position is reflective of the people in my
district,'' Granger said. ``This issue is between a woman, her
physician and God. The decision should be made there. But it is one
thing to hold personal feelings about choice, and another to vote
on how taxpayer dollars are spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Granger points to two votes that are exceptions to her overall
pro-choice leanings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted to ban the partial-birth abortion procedure unless it
is needed to save the life of the mother,'' Granger said. ``Prior
to that vote, I talked with doctors; even the American Medical
Association endorsed the ban. There are options to that really
gruesome procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   The other exception was voting in favor of requiring parental
notification before prescribing contraceptives for minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hard time with that vote,'' Granger admitted. ``There
is always a situation in which parental notification could be a
problem _ what if the minor is the victim of incest? But look at
the situation we have with schools. We say that you have to have
parental consent to give an aspirin in school. I think it's fair to
require parental notification on contraceptives.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall has some complicated footwork ahead of him if he thinks he
can bump the immensely popular Granger from the floor. His
supporters are obviously hoping to woo pro-choice Republicans away
from her dance card.
</P>
<P>
   ``If folks are disappointed or surprised, I'm sorry, but they
shouldn't have been,'' Granger said. ``I'm exactly where I said I
would be. It would be legitimate to be upset if I had promised one
thing, then voted differently, but that is not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Granger's ready to dance with them what brung her, all right, as
long as they remember there are some steps she won't do.

 HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif.: focused on mycoplasma.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We just went through the medical literature saying, `What
could it be (to cause) a chronic, kind of smoldering disease, a
multi-organ process that is manifested in different ways in
different patients, that is in part immunosuppressive?''' Garth
Nicolson said. ``All of these things start to point in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Their research connected them with Baseman, who had been
studying mycoplasma for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first met in 1994,'' Baseman said. ``They submitted a
contract with the Army to do this study. They're not mycoplasma
experts, they're tumor cancer experts. They asked if I would
provide the expertise and strains and DNA for them to do the
study.''
</P>
<P>
   They also connected with the network of other Gulf War veterans
who had become ill. In a study of 170 patients with Gulf War
illness, they found 76 with signs of mycoplasmal infections. They
published their findings in occupational medicine journals and
described it in testimony before Congress and investigative panels.
</P>
<P>
   The fact their work had not been published in more recognized,
peer-reviewed scientific journals has been criticized by some
medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the veterans who sought them out was Dannie Wolf of
Lawton, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just ate up my insides, whatever it was,'' Wolf said. ``The
chronic fatigue was overwhelming. I had an accounting degree in
business. Now I can't even add.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who served with the Army Reserve's 920th transportation
unit in Saudi Arabia, tested positive for mycoplasma infection, as
did his 12-year-old daughter. He has undergone several cycles of
antibiotic treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps while I'm on the treatment. I've been on it for a
year now, with antibiotics 45 days at a time, then I'm off for a
couple of weeks. I start relapsing and I have to go back on it.''
</P>
<P>
   While their work attracted supporters, it was often obscured by
plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   When a mysterious cluster of illnesses was reported by residents
of Huntsville, Texas, the Nicolsons charged that DOD researchers
had tested biologic agents containing mycoplasmas on Texas
prisoners _ experiments that also sickened guards and local
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nicolson was quoted in articles charging that U.S.
operatives had broken into their lab and had tried to kill them on
multiple occasions. They left Houston after Nicolson was stripped
of his chairmanship at M.D. Anderson, and set up their private
laboratory in California.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the government prepared to take a serious look at
their claims, the couple steers the conversation away from
conspiracy theories.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments in Huntsville are ``no longer a burning issue
for me. When I was in Texas, it was a burning issue because they
were trying to use that issue to fire me, so they could stop the
research that we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will serve no useful purpose at this point for anyone to
point fingers,'' Nancy Nicolson said. ``We've put aside
professional and political differences because it's a kind of war
that nobody wins unless you team up.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are satisfied by the cooperation they're getting from
the military, particularly since Army Gen. Hugh Shelton became
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Shelton, a Green Beret who
was an assistant division commander during the Gulf War, has been
supportive of their work, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicolsons say that 75 percent of Gulf War veterans who test
positive for mycoplasma infection recover on long-term antibiotic
treatment. They also recommend nutrition therapy and other methods
to boost the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Kilpatrick, an infectious disease specialist who is the DOD's
point man for Gulf War illness, remains doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Garth Nicolson) said that with six weeks of treatment he
had a lot of people who became well and got sick again. Then he
said, well, they need six more weeks. Now he's talking about a year
of treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Although dioxicycline, the antibiotic used by the Nicolsons, is
a relatively benign one, such treatments can cause problems over
time, including gastrointestinal illness, painful mouth sores and
vaginitis, Kilpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't done any kind of standardized control (studies)
looking at non-symptomatic Gulf War veterans, non-deployed
veterans, civilians who were never in the military,'' Kilpatrick
said. ``He is saying, well, DOD isn't interested in doing that. We
are very interested in doing that. And we contracted with him to
teach his technique to two different DOD labs, and two civilian
labs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicolson, who first submitted grant proposals to the DOD four
years ago, says he hasn't had the funds to conduct that kind of
research. The couple took out a second mortgage on their home and
are $450,000 in debt. They have more than 600 frozen samples from
Gulf vets they say they haven't been able to test because they
can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   With some 20,000 U.S. troops assigned to the Persian Gulf today,
Nicolson said the question of Gulf War illness is more important
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've been trying to do recently is prepare ourselves for
a lot of new patients we're going to see if these things get
released again,'' he said.

AT NEW DISNEY PARK, A TRIP ON THE WILD SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHELLE F. SOLOMON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ ``Over there, the hippopotamus. And
over there, black and white, white and black, zebras. Watch _ keep
an eye out _ for crocodile and baboons.''
</P>
<P>
   Video cameras roll, throwaway and sturdy Nikon cameras point
from one side to the other side of our open-air vehicle, here
called a lollie. Our guide and driver Clifford speaks in a clipped
African accent like the click, click, click of the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``And look, over there, our two most famous residents? You see
them?'' Clifford wipes his sweaty brow and points to a mother and
baby elephant walking along the wide-open savanna.
</P>
<P>
   We are driving through the Harambe Wildlife Preserve. It's hot.
Desert hot. Perfect for a jungle safari. Clifford pushes the
accelerator of Simba One to the floor so that we can get through a
deep murky river that has spilled over from the waterfall in the
distance and out onto the road. We and the other 32 passengers
bounce up and down over rocky terrain. Every once in a while drum
and mbira _ a little figure piano _ play over small speakers
installed on the ceiling of the open-air vehicle. This occurs when
a mammoth giraffe appears off in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't by chance, this perfect orchestration of sight and
sound. And although it is delivering the excitement of an African
adventure, we are actually on a Kilimanjaro Safari in Disney
World's newest theme park, Animal Kingdom. This Kingdom is 500
Central Florida acres reconfigured into deep green jungles, forests
and savanna and strikingly what one might expect to see at an
animal reserve in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The animals we have mentioned so far are not animatronic,
typical to theme parks and typical to Disney's others here, at
least not on this particular ``ride.'' They are a segment of 1,000
live animals in Animal Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   The Kilimanjaro Safari is definitely the highlight of the park.
Include it at the beginning of your trip. It's the one with the
longest line. Our wait was short compared with other busy days. It
was a 30-minute wait for the 22-minute ride. And Disney has taken
long waits into consideration and orchestrated that here, too.
</P>
<P>
   As you wind through line, probably about a mile hike from where
you begin, there are some entertaining sights along the way. At one
point, after you zig-zag around the bamboo railings, you enter into
the safari office. An antique telephone and front desk sign says,
``We'll return shortly, please proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   And a little later, under a thatched hut, rows of
close-captioned TVs show a video, produced by the Harambe Wildlife
Preserve, a primer on safari wildlife with a built-in plea to help
protect all wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   There are no visible barriers between you and the animals as you
take your ride through the Harambe Preserve, but signs posted
throughout the park ask that you not feed the animals or drop trash
that might injure them.
</P>
<P>
   Disney did, in fact, have a few animals die en route to Animal
Kingdom and some when they arrived. According to Time magazine,
among the casualties were four cheetah cubs, two hippos and two
rhinos. Two otters also died, one after gorging itself on seeds
from loquat trees. Disney uprooted the trees and removed them from
the Preserve. Two African crown cranes also died, one after darting
out in front of one of the Safari lollies. According to Time,
they've since moved the cranes to a walking trail and installed
more mirrors on the vehicles so drivers have better sight lines.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Bill Warren told Time that what the park is
experiencing is ``what you can't plan for in many cases, that is
the unknowns in dealing with exotic animals.'' But the
unpredictability of the live animals is exactly what is so
captivating here.
</P>
<P>
   If you can tolerate standing in line again, experts say to take
the trip two or three times, since you never know which animals
will appear at any given time or what they'll be doing once you see
them. A good example of this occurred after our Kilimanjaro ride.
We followed, on foot, the path to the Gorilla Falls Exploration
Trail, where a mother and her 6-month-old baby were being viewed by
a huge group gathered behind glass.
</P>
<P>
   One of the park's ``conservationists,'' wearing a headset
microphone and seated on a high chair, tracked the mother's moves.
``If we are very quiet, maybe she'll stick around for a while,''
said the guide.
</P>
<P>
   But here is where this impromptu stage works its magic. Gorilla
Mom decided her baby was getting too precocious. He had climbed a
tree and was acting too sure of himself. She plucked him from the
tree, looked directly our way, then scampered off with the baby
latched onto her arm, the same way he had hugged the tree limb.
</P>
<P>
   The guide recanted. ``She's probably taking him back to her
nest. When the weather is this hot, their activity is quite low.''
We had a lot of terrain to cover anyway, so we headed out. We
ventured back to Safari Village, near the Tree of Life, the first
stop when we entered the park. Near the Tree of Life is a message
board and one of Disney's strategically placed guides who can help
you find your way. The board is invaluable.
</P>
<P>
   Written in chalk, it is updated frequently and offers tips on
how long you can expect to wait for a particular ride. It also will
tell you what might be the next, best thing to do at that
particular time based on crowd size and weather elements. And you
can always bide some time, as we did, back at the Tree of Life.
This is the park's centerpiece that towers 145 feet in the air
(that's about 14 stories) and has 325 images of animals, including
birds, reptiles, amphibians and insects. The man-made tree evokes
the same kind of game you might play with your family on a long car
ride when trying to figure out images in clouds.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear others standing around you saying, ``See if you look
up by that branch and near the trunk, you can see a bear.'' Or,
``Look to your left, it's a lizard.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the tree's trunk is an oddball 3-D movie, ``It's Tough to
be a Bug,'' and although the film is a bit lightweight, getting to
the movie is half the fun. Once again, this pathway is created to
help pass the time and give you an up-close and personal view of
the tree from every angle. The artistry of the tree, according to
Disney, from the carvings to every detail of its composition,
required 20 artists led by Zsolt Hormay, the tree's chief sculptor
and senior production designer.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the trunk, you'll be given bug-eyed 3-D glasses. The
movie takes you inside the world of insects and it's complete with
many effects, including the sights, sounds and even smells (watch
out for this one) of the bug world. We had multiday Disney passes
and lofty ideas about maybe hitting the Magic Kingdom later in the
afternoon, but Animal Kingdom is vast. We discovered midway through
our travels that you should plan on spending the entire day at this
park. It's also best to get an early start. The park opens at 7
a.m. It closes at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We broke up the heavy-duty walking of Animal Kingdom by doing
some activities that required short stands in line or some of the
live shows where you can sit under cover. ``The Festival of the
Lion King'' is one of those shows but it shouldn't be missed
anyway. Get over there about a half-hour before showtime to get a
good place in line for a good seat.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat difficult to maneuver Animal Kingdom and we spent
a lot of our time using the map and trying to figure out how to get
from point A to point B. The landscape of this park is more winding
and hilly.
</P>
<P>
   We stumbled upon Camp Mickey-Minnie. The idea here is that the
Disney characters are vacationing in the Adirondacks and you can
visit with them for an autograph or a photo shoot. Some walk the
grounds while others are at little campgrounds where a short stay
in line can get you an autograph or a photo op. Although we didn't
have any small children with us, we decided it was worth the stand
in line to get a snapshot with Winnie the Pooh and Mickey Mouse
dressed in hiking gear.
</P>
<P>
   Our final stop, and appropriately so, was Dinoland, where
piped-in music had been humorously selected _ ``It's the End of the
World (As We Know It''), by REM, and ``I Fall to Pieces,'' by Patsy
Cline. We bypassed the paleontological dig, The Boneyard, and went
directly to Countdown to Extinction. I got queasy when I saw the
sign warning against motion sickness (I'm not one for roller
coasters, either) but this ride is less than typical.
</P>
<P>
   Here you are a scientist given the assignment of saving the last
animatronic dinosaur from extinction when the crash of a fiery
asteroid threatens Earth. The vehicle twists and turns. Watch out
for that pterodactyl, we've narrowly missed the carnotaurus, we've
got to save the iguanodon.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we were safer near the real animals on the Kilimanjaro.

SECURITY COMPANY SETTLES LAWSUIT OVER INTERVIEW PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A security company that asked its applicants a
series of questions about their political beliefs settled a
class-action lawsuit for up to $2.1 million, a case that could
change the way corporations around the country screen job
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, will pay up to 8,000 job applicants as much as $1,250 as
part of an agreement reached between the American Civil Liberties
Union and Burns International Security Services, a subsidiary of
Borg-Warner Protective Services Corporation, the nation's largest
security company.
</P>
<P>
   Questions to which applicants were to reply ``yes'' or ``no''
included: ``The drinking age should be lowered,'' ``The government
has no right to interfere with a person who chooses drugs if it
doesn't hurt anyone'' and ``Illegal use of marijuana is worse than
drinking liquor.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on their answers, applicants were ranked as high-, medium-
or low-risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pre-employment honesty tests are very common but this one went
over the line,'' said lead attorney Brad Seligman, a Berkeley civil
rights attorney associated with the ACLU. ``The (grading) manual
made it clear that one of the purposes of the test was to identify
people with anti-establishment or free-enterprise ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Borg-Warner said the company denied all
liability in the lawsuit and follows all state and federal
employment laws.
</P>
<P>
   Lead plaintiff Mel Thompson, 38, said he took the test at the
company's San Francisco office in 1993 and was offended by the
questions and refused to answer many of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were questioning me on my political beliefs,'' said
Thompson, who works for another security company in San Francisco.
``When I realized that, I felt terribly invaded and afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he voiced objections to the supervisor who gave
him the test when he realized he would be disqualified because of
his answers.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the settlement, Thompson and other applicants who
were disqualified based on their test answers will receive up to
$1,250 while those applicants who were hired can receive up to
$500.

SOLOMON ASSESSES HIS RECORD AS CHAIRMAN OF HOUSE RULES PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon took over three years
ago as the first Republican chairman of the House Rules Committee
since 1954, he said his goal was to be a ``fair'' chairman of the
powerful behind-the-scenes panel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he contemplates his record in the job _ and his
retirement at year-end _ Solomon says he believes he has attained
his ``private and public goal to be more fair to (the Democrats)
then they were to us.''
</P>
<P>
   That self-assessment was sharply disputed by Democrats on the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, R-N.Y., an ex-Marine with a hurried but genial manner,
said he set his fairness target because ``I had suffered in the
minority for 16 years and was persecuted'' by the majority
Democrats. They were ``high handed and arrogant'' when they
controlled the House Rules panel, he contended.
</P>
<P>
   The Rules Committee is the management apparatus that the
majority party uses to run the business of the unruly 435-member
House. The 13-member committee can quickly doom a bill by
determining how it will be treated when it reaches the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   One fairness goal that Solomon set was to increase the number of
bills that the Rules Committee sent to the floor with an ``open
rule'' _ one that would allow members of either party to amend or
alter the legislation. Otherwise, bills head to the floor under
``closed'' or ``structured'' rules that limit or ban floor
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged that 70 percent of the legislation the panel sent to
the House floor would go there under an open rule.
</P>
<P>
   His record to date: 58 percent of House bills in his first two
years had open rules and 53 percent of bill so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging this shortcoming, Solomon insists that he is
being more fair than the Democrats were.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon also says he has made other changes in the name of
fairness, such as:
</P>
<P>
   __ Allowing members of the minority party to have the last
chance before a vote to offer their own version of a bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means they always have the last bite of the apple,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   __ Eliminating the ``King of the Hill'' rule that allowed the
last standing version of a bill to prevail, rather than the one
with the most votes, which allowed the majority to put their
version in last and win.
</P>
<P>
   __ Ending proxy voting in House committees, thereby forcing
members to attend. He also worked to allow TV cameras to cover all
committee testimony and cut the number of committee staffers in the
House by almost one-third.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's stint as chairman gets a less-glowing report card from
his predecessor, Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., committee chairman from
1989 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman has been ``far from fair,'' Moakley said in an
interview. ``The truth of the matter is, the Republicans are
tougher than we were. These people froze us out most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   By Moakley's count, Solomon sent legislation to the floor with
open rules just 43 percent of the time in his first two years and
just 33 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley argues that this isn't much better than his own record
of 30 percent in his last two years as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solomon came in on this big white horse saying we're going to
be fair,'' Moakley said. ``Jerry Solomon is my friend. But if he
wants to be known for fairness, he needs to take someone else's
record.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon ``did the job he was supposed to do _ he carried out the
will of (House Speaker) Newt Gingrich... What I am saying is, as
chairman of the Rules Committee, you have to do your party's
bidding,'' said Moakley.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans never join the Democrats on a vote
``because they are in lockstep with the leader... Gingrich is a
very dictatorial-type person and he demands loyalty. You don't mess
with Newt,'' Moakley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat knows from experience that the chairman of the
Rules Committee takes orders from the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   When Moakley chaired the panel, he also ``had to act like a
soldier'' to carry out the agenda of his leader, then-Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., according to Steven S. Smith, a
University of Minnesota political scientist who has written books
on House floor procedure.
</P>
<P>
   However, Foley was ``more laid back'' and allowed Moakley ``to
take the initiative'' and define the floor agenda much of the time.
Gingrich, on the other hand, attempts to direct the course of every
piece of legislation, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the prime qualifications for membership on the
Rules Committee is fierce loyalty to the party leader, either
Speaker Gingrich or Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the House Democratic
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Both Solomon and the man who will succeed him next year if the
Republicans remain in control, Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., are
known as Gingrich disciples.
</P>
<P>
   Dreier, 45, a smooth, dapper Southern Californian with a
penchant for pinball, says the speaker calls the shots in the final
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   That's why all 13 members of the rules panel come from ``safe
seats,'' making them politically secure in their home districts so
they can freely pursue their leadership's agenda in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, a conservative who worships Ronald Reagan, was
appointed to the post by Gingrich, who named all nine Republicans
to the committee. The four Democrats, picked by Gephardt, are
outnumbered more than 2-to-1, assuring that the speaker's desires
will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   When Solomon announced his retirement plans in April, Gingrich
praised his loyal lieutenant as ``a conservative's conservative and
a legislator's legislator. The wisdom of Solomon will be sorely
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What endows the Rules Committee with its huge clout is the fact
that every House member pushing legislation has to win the panel's
approval before the bill can go to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, virtually every House committee chairman and
subcommittee chairman attends a Rules Committee meeting in the
course of a session to ask the panel's blessing on particular
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee meets three or four times a week in an intimate
Capitol hearing room under three chandeliers. The beseeching member
sits at a small table, peering up at Solomon who looks down at the
witness from his perch atop a tall semi-circular dais.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, in an interview, gave this an example of his power: ``I
can put a bill in my back pocket and go to the Adirondack mountains
and no one can go ahead with it. That's the kind of power I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Solomon has carried out the speaker's will by using
House rules to assure that the House won't approve campaign finance
legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Louise McIntosh Slaughter, D-N.Y., says Solomon effectively
killed the legislation by sending the bill to the House floor under
a rule that allows 12 different versions of the bill to be debated
and amended. This will require so much debate that there won't be
enough time to finish action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be debating this until Labor Day,'' fumes Slaughter.
``It's a colossal time waster.''
</P>
<P>
   While the strategy Solomon used is considered fair play under
House rules, Slaughter says ``it's stupid,'' and it takes away from
the seriousness of the legislation. Gingrich and Solomon ``are
playing games,'' she said. ``They can do anything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have also shown mastery at manipulating House rules
when they are in the majority.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 1960s, then-rules chairman Howard Smith, D-Va.,
would block civil rights legislation by simply disappearing or
arranging for other committee members to be absent so that a quorum
wouldn't be present. Absent a quorum, the panel would adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   The committee applies 51 standing House rules that are found in
a 4-inch-thick black book with gold letters, which includes a
manual by Thomas Jefferson with his anecdotes and thoughts on how
the House should be run.
</P>
<P>
   The rules book gets fatter every two years when members of every
new Congress update it, usually with footnotes. One rule,
stipulating that all amendments to a bill must be germane, is just
25 words long, but 26 pages of footnotes have been added to explain
how the rule is applied.
</P>
<P>
   When he leaves Congress at the end of the year, Solomon, 67,
will have finished just four years in his six year-term as rules
chairman, after serving 16 years in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   That's why his late April retirement announcement left many of
his friends and colleagues baffled. Dreier, 45, says he was one who
wasn't surprised. He said that when he was pondering leaving the
House to run for the Senate two years ago, Solomon discouraged him,
saying the chairmanship of rules would open up soon.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said he realized that after taking just five vacation
days in 20 years, he owed it to his wife, Freda, to spend more time
with her, his children and grandchildren. He also said he wanted to
make more money. He's paid $136,700.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two guilty feelings,'' Solomon said. ``One is guilt
about not having enough time with family, another is guilt about
giving up this kind of power.''
</P>
<P>
   But Solomon said bouts of prostate and bladder cancer a couple
years ago, which he says he is now clear of, gave him ``a wake up
call that you might not be around forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said he ``would like to be chairman of the Rules
Committee forever'' because it enables him to influence every major
piece of legislation moving through Congress. He said he especially
enjoys melding together bills from different panels into one
version for the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very philosophical person,'' Solomon said. ``My heart

</P>
<P>
   Solomon insists his exit was not prompted by the fact that he
has only two years remaining in his chairmanship under a 1994
Republican caucus rule limiting committee chairmen to six years.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republican chairmen have questioned the wisdom of
term limits, Solomon stands by them, saying they prevent House
members from developing ``little fiefdoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said he is confident that he could have become chairman
of another panel if he had finished his term as chairman of the
rules panel. For example, he might have taken over the helm of the
Veterans' Affairs Committee, Solomon says.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he adds: ``I might have become the majority leader, I might
have been the speaker.''

   The spread of sex-change chemicals in the environment could soon
be tracked with a test that uses tadpoles and liver cells of frogs.
The test, developed in Germany, takes only two days to work.
</P>
<P>
   The sex-changing chemicals, which mimic female hormones such as
estrogen, are present in many pesticides and plastics. They are
causing increasing concern because they have been implicated in
breast cancer and declining sperm counts, and may also interfere
with fetal development.
</P>
<P>
   The new test, developed by Werner Kloas and his colleagues at
Karlsruhe University, involves exposing cultures of liver cells
from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis to the chemical in
question.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is then checked for vitellogenin-mRNA, the first in
a series of compounds produced after an estrogen receptor in a
liver cell has been activated. To make this possible, the
researchers first use the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, which
can make millions of copies of a single piece of DNA or RNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``PCR is what makes the method so fast,'' Kloas says. It is more
sensitive than other tests because less RNA is needed, and it is
also faster because researchers do not have to wait until
vitellogenin itself is manufactured within the cells.
</P>
<P>
   But Kloas warns that it is often difficult to tell to what
extent chemicals that mimic estrogen will disrupt sexual
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of them simply bind to hormone receptors and don't
trigger a response. But it's crucial to find out whether they
induce biological activity,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So his test involves a further stage in which xenopus tadpoles
are immersed in the chemical to see how it affects their sexual
development. If an unusually high proportion of the tadpoles
develop female characteristics, this indicates a strong estrogenic
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have suggested that estrogen-type chemicals
have reduced the proportion of male amphibians in the wild, and
that this is one reason why amphibian populations around the world
have declined. &QL;

THE DAEWOO'S NOT HERE YET, BUT THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE A LUXURY CAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a car of surprises. At first glance, it reminds this
columnist of something British from the 1960s. It's from the other
end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It looks entirely different to some other folks _ ``What's this,
a Lexus?'' was a question asked by four different viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It's slick, sleek, outfitted to the nines, and it exhibits very
fine road manners; it is a much better car than I would have
expected from a company called Daewoo. I had never seen a luxury
car from Daewoo _ nor do I remember a true luxury automobile from
any Korean manufacturer. At least, I had never driven one. Frankly,
I had expected a lot less than this Daewoo Laganza delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The minimal expectations do not spring from any antipathy to
things Korean but from earlier experience with a Daewoo automobile
_ a tinny little bucket dubbed Pontiac LeMans. Daewoo early on had
a partnership of sorts with General Motors, and it was a Daewoo of
small virtue that inherited the muscle car moniker during one of
GM's many product reshufflings. It was at best a very bad joke.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo has moved away from GM and looked toward a Porsche
executive, Ulrich Bez, for design expertise; Laganza, therefore, is
no joke but a fairly accurate Korean quotation of a European car.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of other surprises, too. Although the price
of Laganza has not been set as of this writing, it may be a bargain
in today's market. The Americans in Daewoo want to price it around
$17,000; the Koreans see $20K as more reasonable an asking price.
Somewhere in the middle, would still be low for a nicely styled
five-passenger sedan with air conditioning, power everything, and
other amenities. The tested Laganza came with leather and a CD
player; perhaps those are meant to be options, perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the other surprise _ or disappointment: The
columnist is roadtesting a vehicle that isn't yet available. In
fact, the first New England dealership isn't open yet. The car is
expected to go on sale around Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be worth serious consideration when it arrives.
Daewoo, while not exactly a household word around here, has been
making cars for enough years to have a track record. The company is
well established in Australia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo has two other cars in the lineup, an entry-level dubbed
Lanos, about the size of a Ford Escort, expected to bear a price
``under $9,000,'' according to Daewoo, and the Contour-sized
Nubira, for under $10,000. The Lanos, says Daewoo, will be aimed at
college students, and the company is looking to recruit collegians
as sales aides.
</P>
<P>
   The Daewoo Laganza test car was so fresh off the factory boat
that it didn't even have a license plate, just a temporary sticker
in the back window issued in California. Nor did it have much on
the odometer _ essentially the mileage from where the truck dropped
it to my digs. For this assessment, since Daewoo is looking toward
youth for sales potential, I turned to daughter of Auto Writer, who
at 29 no longer considers herself youthful _ which comment always
elicits a guffaw from Daddy Gray Hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a run up to Owls Head?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I get to drive?'' came a question by way of answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You drive back,'' I offered. Deal.
</P>
<P>
   We pulled onto Route 202 heading for Biddeford and the Maine
Turnpike via Sanford, discovering along the way that the
2.198-liter (134.1 CID) four-cylinder had some guts. Good, but not
flashy off the line, it offered some reserve for passing _ you
don't have much room for that on Maine's rural roads. The engine,
however, whines loudly when you demand passing power.
</P>
<P>
   A five-speed manual is available, but the test vehicle came with
a four-speed automatic, a smooth shifter that, while it sapped a
bit of performance from the little engine, didn't overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioning had an automatic mode but seemed to offer
only two genuine settings: too cool or too warm. We agreed on the
cooler choice.
</P>
<P>
   The radio sounds fine, but the controls are from hell, small
with markings that can only be described as bizarre. Why, for
example, is the AM/FM selector switch disguised as a matchhead
daintily etched with ``RAD.'' Another button that might have been a
volume control wasn't; it added reverberation, making the
newscaster sound as if he were broadcasting from inside a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Window switches of the convenient push/pull type favored by the
Japanese makers were mounted on the doors. A power mirror switch is
on the left end of the dash. The glove box is small, but door bins,
a small covered bin between the seats, and pockets in the seat
backs helped with storage. A lid in front of the bin covers two
cupholders. The trunk is good _ got the acid test with a bookcase _
but the rear seats do not fold down to add cargo room. Legroom and
headroom are good front and rear, despite a sunroof with a sliding
inner panel _ opening that inner door brightened up the interior
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   The ride up the coast was pleasant, the tour of Owls Head
Transportation Museum delightful _ although planes were being
taxied toward cover as rain threatened. The rain arrived and
thundered on the roof for a few minutes, ending in a burst of
sunlight. The ride back down the coast was pleasantly uneventful.
We stopped for dinner in Wiscasset, sadly eyeing the last remnants
of the abandoned schooners Hesper and Luther Little being uprooted
from the harbor bottom.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, daughter got the interesting part of the drive;
traffic increased, rain drops fell from a lowering sky that
blackened omniously as we crossed into Massachusetts heading for
her digs in Lowell. A grand display of lightning danced across the
horizon. ``I suppose I'll have no lights when I get back,'' she
said, as the skies opened, turning Route 495 into a raging river.
</P>
<P>
   She slowed appropriately; the Daewoo splashed along. The AC had
achieved something of a comfort equilibrium. She had never needed
the antilock brakes; I used them later _ gratefully. She had lights
at home.
</P>
<P>
   The storm passed as we hit Lowell, but I hit it again on my
return to the New Hampshire den I inhabit _ torrential rain, more
heavenly fireworks, and, finally, the sudden need for ABS because
someone else had proven ... unwise.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage was good; for 556.5 miles measured, the Laganza
delivered 26.5 miles per gallon overall.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will prove it, but the Daewoo looks like serious
competition. Daughter _ I can't call her the kid anymore _ is
checking the budget to see if, maybe .... Wait a year, kid.

   The gaping wounds and ``die-back'' of skin caused by poisonous
snakebites could be drastically reduced with the help of a
miniature vacuum cleaner, says an Australian plastic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The small suction device draws off the fluid _ which often
contains toxins and bacteria _ generated by an inflammatory trauma
response within the wound. It is this fluid which blocks key blood
vessels and leads to necrosis _ the death of surrounding tissue.
Until now, repairing necrotic skin would have meant expensive
plastic surgery and a long stay in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes have been raised in Australia after doctors
successfully treated a 42-year-old woman for a wound caused by a
tiger snake's bite.
</P>
<P>
   With a vacuum technique normally used for treating wounds caused
by accidents or gunshots, Ian Holten, a plastic surgeon from the
Geelong Hospital near Melbourne, extracted half a liter of fluid
from the victim's wound in 24 hours. As a result, blood was able to
flow normally again, promoting the growth of healthy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Holten reported the tiger snake case in May at the Annual
Scientific Congress of the Royal Australian College of Surgeons in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the newly developed vacuum-assisted closure
(VAC) device, has been used to reduce the often devastating
aftereffects of a snakebite.
</P>
<P>
   Invented by Louis Argenta, a plastic surgeon from the Bowman
Gray School of Medicine at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem,
N.C., the VAC wound system is being made by a Texas-based company,
Kinetic Concepts. Argenta says that by getting rid of fluid, the
VAC can make wounds heal four times faster than they would
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The tiger snake victim had been bitten on the foot. Although her
life was saved by an antivenin injection, a hole 3 centimeters
square opened up around the bite, and her foot swelled and became
painful. Holten put a foam dressing in the hole then used a thin
plastic film to seal the area. Then, using the vacuum pump, which
was attached to a tube embedded in the foam, he sucked off the
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Holten wants to test the technique on a patient whose leg
has ulcerated from toe to knee after being bitten by Australia's
venomous white-tailed spider.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Winkel from the Australian Venom Research Unit at the
University of Melbourne says it is far too early to know if the
technique will become a commonplace way to deal with the effects of
bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trials are needed,'' he said. ``You can't say too much based
on one or two isolated cases.'' &QL;

<P>
   A Japanese company has developed superthin videotape that boosts
the recording capacity of digital-camcorder cassettes by 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita's manufacturing process evaporates pure cobalt at
high temperature in a vacuum and deposits it on the tape. The thin
``metal-evaporated'' tape is then strengthened by a material that
Matsushita calls ``diamondlike carbon,'' or DLC.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita and its rivals Sony and TDK have been developing
metal-evaporated tape for 20 years, but it has only been used for
broadcast-quality digital recording because it is so expensive. ME
tape is very thin, allowing more video to be stored in a small
cassette. But this makes it inefficient for recording analogue
signals, which require a thick magnetic layer to capture low
frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   The latest consumer video format, digital video, records both
sound and vision as high-frequency digital code, which can be
faithfully captured in a very thin magnetic coating.
</P>
<P>
   Matsushita thinks DV users will pay a premium for cassettes that
increase recording time from 80 to 120 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Previous ME tapes have needed a backing 7 micrometers thick to
withstand the strain of traveling through a video recorder. This
has limited tape length in the cassette to 80 minutes. With the DLC
backing, Matsushita can make do with 4.8 micrometres, creating tape
which is only 5.5 micrometres thick in total. &QL;

   It is easy to dump waste in deep-ocean trenches _ far harder to
check that it hasn't seeped from its containers into the sea. Now,
though, colonies of glowing bacteria offer hope. When they sense
pollution in the water around them, they get dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea is that it's like a deep-sea canary,'' says William
Jones, head of the team developing the biosensor at the University
of Maryland Biotechnology Institute in College Park. ``If light
starts to drop, it would trigger neighboring samplers into
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with colleagues at the institute and at the U.S. Naval
Research Laboratory in Washington D.C., Jones has screened 10
species of luminous bacteria from fish and marine mammals. One of
the most promising is Photobacterium phosphoreum HE-1a, isolated
from the deep-sea fish Paratrachichthys prosthemius. In a
laboratory pressure chamber, the bacteria survived pressures of up
to 31 megapascals _ more than 300 times atmospheric pressure _
equivalent to a depth of around 3,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that P. phosphoreum HE-1a glowed up to 50
percent less brightly when exposed to a variety of potential
pollutants. These included heavy metals such as zinc, copper and
cobalt, as well as chemical pollutants, including pesticides,
polychlorinated biphenyls and polyaromatic hydrocarbons typically
found in oily wastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``HE-1a seemed to be the most robust and to respond to almost
everything,'' Jones says. It would not distinguish one pollutant
from the other, however. Its task would be simply to issue an
``alarm call'' that would trigger more sophisticated sensors
stationed nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and collaborators at the university's Center of Marine
Biotechnology have built a prototype cell that exposes a living
colony of the bacteria to seawater samples filtered through a
semipermeable membrane. A digital camera monitors the intensity of
light coming from the colony. When the cell is deployed on the
seafloor, any dimming of the usual signal can alert neighboring
sensors or samplers. The signals could be monitored remotely on
land or on a ship or rig.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the colony alive, the bacteria will need to be fed from
a buoy or platform on the surface, from which nutrients could be
pumped down at a constant rate. Dead or aging bacteria would be
continuously jettisoned to keep the colony fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chemostat that keeps the bugs alive,'' Jones says.
``You could keep it going for years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the sentinel could provide a useful tool for evaluating
whether proposals for deep-sea dumping would be as environmentally
benign as their advocates claim.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and his colleagues presented their preliminary findings
last month in Atlanta at the annual meeting of the American Society
for Microbiology. Their development highlights growing interest in
the use of light-emitting bacteria as sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, researchers at Britain's chemical and biological
defense laboratory at Porton Down, Wiltshire, reported that glowing
bacteria could be used to detect the use of chemical weapons. &QL;

THE OTHER PORTFOLIO RISK: FOUNDERING IN A SEA OF ILLIQUIDITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 7)  
 (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bull market in stocks has been long and lovely, but even
unsophisticated mutual fund investors understand the nature of
market risk. If the prices of many stocks in a fund's portfolio
drop, fund holders will lose, too.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding a fund's exposure to liquidity risk, however, is
quite another matter. Liquidity risk is the possibility that the
price of a stock will drop, and therefore may push down the fund's
net asset value, when a manager tries to sell a large position. Or
that the price will climb, forcing a manager to pay too much when
buying a large chunk.
</P>
<P>
   Unless investors have examined a fund's holdings in each stock
and compared them with the total shares outstanding in the company,
it is tough to fathom such risk for a particular fund.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not much of a concern in large-cap stock funds,
liquidity risk can wreak real havoc in micro-cap funds, which
invest in fledgling companies with market values of $250 million or
less. Positions in such companies are much harder to get in and out
of without roiling the market.
</P>
<P>
   How damaging can illiquid stocks be to a portfolio? Plenty, as
shareholders in two Dreyfus small-cap stock funds, Premier
Aggressive Growth A, with $264 million in assets, and Aggressive
Growth, at $77 million, are finding out.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these two funds are textbook examples of the perils of
illiquidity. So far this year, through Thursday, shareholders in
Premier Aggressive Growth have lost 13.5 percent; those in
Aggressive Growth are down 18 percent. As a benchmark, the Wilshire
Small-Cap index is up 10.8 percent. Last year, Premier Aggressive
Growth was down 13 percent; Aggressive Growth lost almost 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive, yes. Growth, no.
</P>
<P>
   Performance like this may explain the April news that the funds'
manager since August 1995, Michael L. Schonberg, was being joined
by Paul A. LaRocco, late of Founders Asset Management in Denver,
who was named the primary manager. Mellon Bank Corp. owns both the
Founders and Dreyfus fund companies.
</P>
<P>
   For the two and a half years that Schonberg ran the fund alone,
he bought speculative technology or biotechnology companies with
few shares outstanding. He even borrowed money to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
   LaRocco takes a different tack, favoring bigger-name stocks with
$1 billion to $5 billion in market value. In an interview, he said
he is still running the funds as aggressive-growth vehicles. ``But
we will broaden the funds' holdings out a little,'' he said.
``Mid-cap stocks are a good place to be here. As earnings growth
among large-cap stocks slows, investors will move down the
market-cap range.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus did not make Schonberg available for an interview last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Even if LaRocco is a brilliant stock-picker, the beleaguered
Dreyfus fund holders are not likely to recoup their losses any time
soon. That is because escaping a portfolio of illiquid stocks is
like exiting a crowded theater after somebody has yelled ``Fire!''
</P>
<P>
   How illiquid are some of the holdings? Frighteningly so.
According to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, the
median market capitalization of the larger of the two funds,
Premier Aggressive Growth, is a Lilliputian $157 million. Across
the micro-cap fund category, only 20 percent of funds have a median
market capitalization this small or smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The median market cap of Aggressive Growth is even smaller, at
$87 million. Only 10 percent of micro-cap funds in Morningstar's
universe have median market values that tiny.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 percent of Premier Aggressive Growth's assets are
in stocks that trade at $5 a share or less. In the Aggressive
Growth fund, 20 percent fall in that range.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure of both funds' high risk levels can be found in
the concentration of fund holdings. As of April, Premier Aggressive
Growth held 70 stocks; each of the top six holdings accounted for
between 4 percent and 7 percent of the fund's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive Growth was even more concentrated, at 54 stocks. Its
No. 1 holding, a cosmetics and medical technology concern called
Chromatics Color Science International, accounted for almost 13
percent of the fund's assets. That's staggering, given that a top
holding in a fund typically accounts for 2 percent to 3 percent of
assets.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus is making a big bet on Chromatics Color Science, a
company that was brought public in 1993 by Investors Associates, a
brokerage firm that closed last year after a number of state
securities regulators revoked its license. Chromatics Color Science
trades around $11.50, down from $17.25 in March. Dreyfus owned 1.5
million shares as of March, more than 10 percent of the company's
shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The bet on Chromatics is not the only big gamble fund holders
have made. Almost 30 percent of the assets in Premier Aggressive
Growth are stocks of obscure companies in which Dreyfus owns more
than 5 percent of the shares outstanding. In the Aggressive Growth
fund, 67 percent of the assets are stocks of companies in which
Dreyfus owns more than 5 percent of shares.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in March, Dreyfus owned 23 percent of Atlantic
Pharmaceuticals, a development-stage biotechnology company trading
at around $6.25 that has no sales and lost $14 million since 1994..
Dreyfus also owned 16.4 percent of Oncormed Inc., another
money-losing biotechnology concern, trading at 75 cents a share.
Then there's Advanced Photonix, which says it manufactures
``proprietary solid-state large-area avalanche photodiodes.'' Some
14 percent of the stock, trading at a recent $1, was owned by
Dreyfus as of March.
</P>
<P>
   This concentration in illiquid stocks is fine when the fund
manager is buying. As the buying wave rises, so does the stock's
price. This in turn raises the fund's net asset value, making the
bet look smart.
</P>
<P>
   But when the buying dries up, trouble begins. If the stock does
not have positive earnings or other good news to support it, the
price begins to flag. The bigger the position, the harder it is to
get out. Which is precisely the predicament that LaRocco finds
himself in at Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Hale, an equity fund analyst at Morningstar who follows
Dreyfus funds, said: ``This portfolio is not something you can
change that quickly. He will rotate as he can out of most of the
micro-cap stuff as the market lets him.''
</P>
<P>
   LaRocco has two choices. He can unload the positions he
inherited en masse and start fresh. Or he can hope that a surge in
investor ardor for micro-cap stocks will allow him to sell his
positions piecemeal without scorching the market. He has already
started to sell some. This may explain why Premier Aggressive
Growth is down 13 percent since early April, when LaRocco took
over, and Aggressive Growth has lost 15 percent. ``The sooner these
funds have restructured their portfolios,'' Hale said, ``the better
their risk-return profile will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the funds sell many stocks at a loss, any gains
going forward under their new manager may be offset. That is the
only silver lining to the liquidity cloud hanging over these mutual
funds.

AN OLD WIVES' TALE ABOUT PAINT AND RUSTING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON 
c.1998 The Boston Globe

 &UR; UFcolumnist &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PETER HOTTON
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HDmlc,15p6,28 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Use chair glides,
</P>
<P>
   or rug, on any floor
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to put a Pergo floor, the laminated plastic, in my
kitchen, but I am concerned as to what the table and chairs will do
to it, such as scratching. And, is a Pergo floor too slippery when
wet?
</P>
<P>
   CHARLIE, from Norwood
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. While the Pergo is guaranteed for 15 years (not long for a
floor), any floor surface except a rug will be scratched, or at
least is likely to be scratched by a moving chair, especially if
one tiny grain of sand gets between leg and floor. And that goes
for Pergo, varnished wood, linoleum, sheet vinyl, resilient tile,
and ceramic tile. Of course, some, such as glazed tile, are more
resistant to scratching than others.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope: Put a glide at the ends of the table and
chair legs. It can be felt, which works well but wears out quickly,
but better is a nylon glide that can be nailed into the ends of
legs. A more permanent cure is to put area rugs under tables and
chairs. Simple, but logical.
</P>
<P>
   As for slipperiness, any smooth, hard, shiny surface is slippery
when wet, but Pergo is not necessarily slipperier than any other
surface. It is a matter of staying off a newly-washed floor until
it dries, and to wipe up liquid spills quickly (any spills, really)
before someone trips, slips and falls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having the clapboards of my old (1834) Greek Revival
house painted. I want white, but the painter said to paint it
yellow or blue to prevent nails from rusting. Do I really have to
make it yellow or blue?
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA DAHLBERG, Medford
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Now, there is an old wives' tale to beat all old wives'
tales. If nails are rusting, color makes no difference; the rust
will come right through any paint. The only cure for rusting nails
is to pull each one and replace it with a stainless steel siding
nail, which, incidentally, will hold better than the old nails
anyway. Even dabbing a bit of metal primer over each nail will not
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the nails are countersunk and filled with a filler of
some sort (and the rust is showing through the filter), the
condition is incurable except by replacing the nails. And because
the clapboards are only about 1/4 inch thick, the nails cannot be
deeply countersunk (or they'll go all the way through), and wood
filler will not hold very well in such a shallow hole.
</P>
<P>
   Stick to your desire for white, but have the nails replaced.
Actually, yellow is a traditional color for a Greek Revival house,
with white trim. But blue? The only good thing about a blue house
is that its owners can tell visitors how to get to it easily.
``It's the only blue house in sight!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My small house is on a slab, with heat and air conditioning
coming from ducts in the ceiling. The paint is peeling on the
ceiling around the duct openings. How can I prevent that?
</P>
<P>
   PAT LYONS, Natick
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. What is happening: Moist air in the ducts is condensing right
at the opening of the duct, which is cool, and spreading to the
ceiling, where the dampness is causing the peeling. So, check the
insulation on the attic floor to make sure it is snug against the
ducts, and make sure the ducts themselves are well insulated, with
no gaps. If the insulation seems flimsy (an inch or so thick), add
another layer of duct insulation and make sure all seams and holes
in the insulation are covered with duct tape or a similar tape that
will keep them sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Then sand the peeling paint smooth and apply two thin coats of
latex ceiling paint. You may have to repaint the entire ceiling.
The paint also might have peeled because it was applied too
thickly, and that is why two thin coats will perform better and
resist peeling better than one or two thick coats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a house built in New Hampshire, and I would like
two-inch-wide louvered strips in the soffits, the full length of
the soffits. Where can I find such strips?
</P>
<P>
   J.A., Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I know of no building supply store or lumber store that does
not carry them. They are common, because such strips are the state
of the art for attic ventilation, in conjunction with ridge vents.
Such soffit strips are two inches wide and 10 feet long, and fit
easily into a two-inch-wide opening in the soffit. They are better
than an occasional louver, say 8 by 12 inches or 4 by 12 inches or
so, and are a lot better than the round louvers. The strips are
insect-proof, and are also better looking than any other louvered
device. They come in white and other colors. A black strip would
look good.
</P>
<P>
   Another good soffit vent is a simple two- or three-inch-wide
opening, the full length of the soffit, screened with black
screening. The screening can go on the back of the soffit or on its
face. If it is applied to the face, a small molding trim should be
applied to cover the raw edges of the screen and to hold it in
place. Such a black screened vent will give the eaves an extra
architectural look. Addition of square or rectangular vents, or
worse yet, round louvers, will look like a jury rig.

 (For release Sunday, June 7.)  
 (js)  
 By PHOEBE HOBAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's Betsey, her hair in gravity-defying Raggedy
Ann orange pigtails, dressed for success in a bra-revealing
bustier, tightly laced over a teeny flowered minidress worn over
black leggings and, for comic relief, striped socks and sparkly
blue platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Lulu in a simple black cardigan, her blond hair
hanging down her back, her long, slim legs encased in black
boot-cut pants. The only thing they seem to have in common is
matching tattoos _ a lightning bolt over the left breast.
</P>
<P>
   These careful studies in fashion-victim contrast could be the
stars of a sitcom along the lines of ``Absolutely Fabulous,'' but
the wacky mother-daughter team are the real-life stars of the
Betsey Johnson company, which recently doubled its showroom space
at 498 Seventh Ave. (37th Street), opened a store on Wooster Street
in SoHo and opened its first overseas outlet, in London.
</P>
<P>
   If Betsey Johnson, 55, isn't exactly growing up _ she ended her
latest Bryant Park fashion show with a trademark cartwheel _ her
daughter, Lulu, 23, who is in charge of the designer's Ultra line,
has definitely brought a new level of sophistication to her
mother's fashion carnival.
</P>
<P>
   What do you do when you're a baby-boomer fashion designer
creating clothes for people half your age? Get a muse _ or turn to
the one you've borne and raised. Donna Karan has her daughter Gaby,
Diane Von Furstenberg has her daughter-in-law Alexandra. And Betsey
Johnson has the daughter she calls ``my Donatella,'' in reference
to Gianni Versace's designer sister. ``I really feel that Donatella
was Versace's everything in a way, and I have the same sort of
thing with Lulu,'' Betsey Johnson said. ``I can call her up at 3 in
the morning, and bore her with design stuff over dinner. It's
abusive sometimes, but there's nobody else you can do that with.
It's just so perfect that in this chunk of older years between your
40s and 50s, you do have your kids in this teen-age, young-20s,
perfect-customer period.''
</P>
<P>
   Lulu Johnson added, ``If anything, Betsey's vision is even
younger than mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsey Johnson picks her daughter up every morning for work.
They share an office space with desks that face each other. They
giggle, constantly interrupt each other, complete each other's
sentences and generally act like joined-at-the-hip best friends _
without ever losing sight of the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The Betsey Johnson company, which was founded in 1978 by Ms.
Johnson and a partner, Chantal Bacon, now has 23 outlets and had
revenues of $38 million last year, Ms. Bacon said. In 1995, the
company introduced the pricier Ultra line, which is aimed at the
designer-label buyer and Ms. Johnson's celebrity clients, including
Jenn
</P>
<P>
   Lulu earned her fashion stripes working as a runway model in her
mother's shows, and as a salesgirl in the company's stores during
summer vacations. After high school, she went to work full time for
the company. Her biggest contribution may be that she represents
the company's target demographic. She keeps her mother abreast of
the club scene, the latest videos, the hottest new models.
</P>
<P>
   But Lulu's fashion sense is at the other end of the spectrum
from her mother's punk, sex-kitten style. The clothes Lulu designs
for the Ultra line include slinky, hand-beaded slip dresses, tiny
cardigans, fake fur-trimmed embroidered satin coats and cashmere
separates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lulu's real design strength and what she made all of us see
was severely great business was her formula of the slip dress and
the cardigan and the boot-cut pants,'' Betsey Johnson said. ``It's
a known fact in the industry that those three items are all you
need in life right now. ''
</P>
<P>
   The Ultra line, whose prices range from $300 to $2,500 _ more
expensive than the original Betsey Johnson line _ is the most
obvious effort to give the company legs. It tends to appeal to a
more sophisticated customer than the typical buyer of Betsey
Johnson's signature clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultra was established to upgrade my designer image,'' Betsey
Johnson said. ``That's very important for the company now as we
grow. I hate to say it, but the truth is that the upscale line is
where I get respect as a designer. The higher the price range, the
higher the respect level from the industry, even though it's much
easier to make a great $500 dress than a great $100 dress. Lulu is
very Prada-Gucci.''
</P>
<P>
   The line has proved popular at upscale department stores. ``The
Ultra line has done extremely well for us,'' said Ed Burstell, the
general merchandise manager at Henri Bendel. ``It is feminine,
slightly vintage, definitely luxe. There's a cashmere cardigan and
camisole which sold extremely well. I would call it conservative
for Betsey Johnson, but it is for someone who really likes the
finer things in life.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days before Fashion Week, everybody t the Betsey Johnson
showroom was engaged in the same activity _ frantically nailing
rhinestones to skimpy garments for the designer's show. Manning
their stud guns, dozens of assistants looked like Santa's elves, if
Santa were based in Las Vegas. Paper-doll thin Irene Wright, the
company's fitting model, sidled in in a gold lame dress.
</P>
<P>
   Betsey and Lulu set to work adjusting the dress, which fastened
up the front with hooks and eyes that reveal a gold-lace bra.
Betsey pinned the garment until it was skin-tight, then decided it
should be shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, make it longer,'' Lulu suggested, in a role reversal of
the usual mother-daughter hem discussion. They went back and forth
on the length until ultimately Lulu prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in my old age, the place for me in the company is a
more frivolous, carefree, inspired place,'' Betsey Johnson said,
her mouth bristling with pins. ``A good use for me is to let me go
away with my sewing machine and come back with some really new
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   She let Lulu have the last word. ``And when you come back with
these really out-there things, we'll work on minimalizing it, and
cleaning it up, and making it strong,'' she said.

FOUR SHORT, QUIRKY FILMS CELEBRATE WOMEN DIRECTORS ON LIFETIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a cinematic climate where size really does matter, Lifetime
has some nerve. For the second consecutive year, the niche cable
channel offers ``Lifetime Women's Film Festival,'' a collection of
small, quaint, independent films written and directed by
up-and-coming female filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours, four films, four directors you've probably never
heard of but certainly will again if they can keep this sort of
honesty and integrity weaving throughout their respective works. To
say ``if'' doesn't diminish their abilities, either. It's not easy
to stay the creative course in an industry where the box office
rules and where small, heartfelt productions are merely tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   With each film running 30 minutes max, there's not a
``Godzilla'' in the bunch, and for that, we should be grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the four films, starting at 8 p.m. CDT Tuesday, are
touching and funny, insightful and quirky, sharp and even a little
odd. All carry the independent's stamp of risk, individuality and
freshness that comes from filmmakers with nothing to lose and
everything to gain, like a trip to Sundance or, heck, Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Icebergs,'' for instance, Nicola Hart directs a Madeleine
Hall script chronicling a weekend reunion between a mother and her
two grown daughters. To explain how the refrigerator's
temperamental condition mimics the conflict among the women in the
film is fruitless. It's better digested by sight and sound.
</P>
<P>
   In the marvelous ``Seed,'' a tough cop with a ticking biological
clock decides to have a baby through artificial insemination only
to learn that the donor may be a suspect in one of her cases. Shot
to display a moody, almost dreamlike atmosphere, ``Seed'' is shot
by TV commercial and music video producer Paula Walker. It pulls
off the tricky feat of ending in predictable sentimentality without
zapping the character of her dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rituals'' plays around with the frailty of lifelong love, as a
woman suspecting her husband of creeping out on her turns to a love
potion of sorts to help her get his mind off the other lady and
back on her. The results are surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``World Upon Her Shoulder'' is the bittersweet tale of a young
girl's unconditional love for her mentally ill mother, who begins
the film pushing a shopping cart down a grocery store aisle and
stuffing it with pancake syrup and boxes of detergent.
</P>
<P>
   Top-notch performances come from all those involved,
particularly Kashmir Jones, who plays the young girl who narrates
but doesn't speak until the end, and Karen Young, playing her
bewildered mother. This is rare in such low-budget films.
</P>
<P>
   So is getting any kind of familiar face. Joely Fisher
(''Ellen'') is one of the sisters in ``Icebergs,'' while Regina
King (''Jerry McGuire''), Jenifer Lewis (''The Preacher's Wife'')
and Isaiah Washington (''Soul Food'') team up for ``Rituals.''
</P>
<P>
   We even get to learn a thing or two about the filmmakers. They
appear with host Penny Marshall to answer her sometimes silly,
sometimes serious questions about their craft.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Minnick, a recent graduate of the American Film Institute
Directing Program and director of the well-crafted ``World Upon Her
Shoulder,'' talked of beginning her career as an actress but
learning that ``creating is what I really wanted to do.'' She has
produced several films, including ``Lily,'' based on a Jane Smiley
short story.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Mayes, who directed ``Rituals,'' also graduated from the
American Film Institute. She's a former associate producer for
``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart is based in London. According to her bio, her projects
range from studio features to documentaries for the BBC. She shares
the story of becoming a filmmaker after tiring of being an agent
and baby sitter for writers and directors.

SURROUNDED BY DEATH, DOCTOR REVELS IN HIS WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The thousands of pale, lifeless faces he has
gazed upon over four decades don't haunt him. Most of the names are
a blur. It's the images of the organs _ abnormal or lacerated,
poisoned or punctured _ that remain with Dr. Michael Baden.
</P>
<P>
   Baden's career by the numbers is vast: 20,000 autopsies
conducted. One hundred thousand case files reviewed. Hundreds, if
not thousands, of walks to the court witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   The corpses Baden has examined through the years _ the heroin
overdoses and motor vehicle fatalities and victims of drug deals
gone bad among them _ never made the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But Baden is best known for being a key figure in examining some
of the most spectacular deaths of this and other generations, from
the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and civil rights leaders Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr. and Medgar Evers, to the deaths of comedian
John Belushi and Czar Nicholas of Russia, to the autopsies of
victims of Trans World Airlines Flight 800.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight on this coroner-cum-celebrity pathologist reached
its zenith during the O.J. Simpson trial, when he testified on
behalf of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   While Baden isn't shy about talking about his accomplishments,
he explains away some of the high-profile cases as a result of a
shortage of board-certified forensic pathologists in the country _
less than 300 by his count, with none found in 12 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting called in a case like Medgar Evers and knowing I'm
part of history makes my job very worthwhile,'' Baden said. ``I
like doing something that I think if I weren't there to do it, it's
unlikely it would have been done as well by somebody else. But
that's because there are so few people who have my kind of training
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigeonholing Baden is elusive. He is not a cop, although he
works for the New York State Police. He is not just a forensic
pathologist, even though he is probably the nation's foremost
medical examiner. ``Expert-for-hire'' works, but only to a point.
</P>
<P>
   Baden, 63, said the word that best encapsulates him in both his
job and his life is more descriptive than defining: interloper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a cop,'' said the co-director of the State Police
Medicolegal Investigation Unit (formerly the Forensic Sciences
Unit). ``We don't have a commonality in background and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt like an outsider,'' he said. ``I always felt
like an outsider because I was Jewish ... because I had very few
friends ... because I went to reform school.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Baden is often called by the defense, some police
officers and prosecutors have tagged another label on him: Whore.
If you have Baden's fee of $2,500 a day plus expenses, you have
yourself a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``State Police have gotten calls from prosecutors in many other
states saying, `How can you let Baden testify against us?''' Baden
acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   Baden, who testifies primarily for the prosecution in New York
state, said people don't know of the many cases in which he is
retained _ but not called to testify _ by the defense because his
conclusions don't help a client. But that doesn't stop the enmity
of police who view him as undermining their brethren elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's not there, it is the appearance of a conflict,''
said State Police Lt. Kevin Costello, who works with, and has a
general affection for, the pathologist. ``That's what people are
concerned about here.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Bronx in 1934, Baden was what was then commonly
called a hellion _ one wild child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a juvenile delinquent,'' he said. ``Apparently I was a
sufficient a problem that around age 6 I was sent to reform
school.'' He is sketchy on the details.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wildness to Baden that lingers today, from his
longish, hair to his shirttail that struggles to free itself to a
fondness for sloppy-but-casual attire. A hulking figure, he first
appears to be a younger man worn down too quickly, until you learn
his age. Then his dominant feature emerges _ a boundless energy
that has co-workers scrambling to ensure Baden is not scheduling
himself to be three places at once.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Baden was released from reform school at age 9, the
family had moved to the Fort Green housing projects in Brooklyn,
where his dad worked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Baden said he and
his brother were the only Jews in the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by a mother who, reform school or not, envisioned her
son a doctor, Baden went on to City College, and then New York
University School of Medicine, before serving as an intern, then
resident at Bellevue Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked very much the patient contact, explaining things to a
patient,'' Baden recalled. ``My initial goal was to be the world's
best internist and diagnostician.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in Bellevue was the New York City Medical Examiner's
Office. Baden was drawn there not just because of its proximity,
but also out of a desire to learn the human body from the inside
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a detective aspect to it and the ability to get an
answer right away,'' Baden said. ``There is an aspect of instant
gratification. You go right to the organs.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1961-86, Baden worked in the New York City Medical
Examiner's Office, serving as chief medical examiner from 1978 to
1979 before a rift resulted in his demotion by Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a team player,'' Baden said sarcastically of himself. In
1986, when the State Police opened its own forensic unit, Baden
took the job _ with the provision he could retain his outside
consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   Baden took a lot of heat from the State Police and elsewhere for
his testimony for the defense in the Simpson case. Baden's theory
is there was more than one assailant and the attack took more than
10 minutes, damaging prosecution claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had been asked by the prosecutor if there was evidence
that excludes O.J., I would have said no,'' Baden said. ``They
never asked the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Baden said the O.J. juries reached the correct, if
different, verdicts. ``It is the job of the prosecution to prove
someone is guilty. Clearly, the prosecution did not prove he was
guilty,'' he said.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The man who embraces death is against the death penalty. Baden
said his opposition to capital punishment is not rooted in
philosophical or theological reasoning, but rather the fact that
authorities sometimes arrest the wrong person.
</P>
<P>
   Baden, who has courted the news media throughout his career, is
colorful and upfront with his responses (too upfront for some
colleagues).
</P>
<P>
   He pops up in many high-profile cases, and makes a lucrative
side living in addition to his ``part-time'' State Police job,
which pays about $40,000 per year and takes him from his New York
City home to Albany at least twice a week. This omnipresence has
resulted in resentment in some quarters, with Baden being called a
shameless self-promoter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that anytime a person who is well known as an expert
becomes a celebrity, there is going to be criticism,'' said Dr.
John Pless, president of the National Association of Medical
Examiners. ``That happens with all of us who function as medical
examiners, because we get our names in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Pless, who is also a professor at the Indiana University School
of Medicine, said that despite concerns of some, he doesn't buy the
notion that Baden is a hired gun willing to testify to anything to
suit a client.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard any substantial arguments about his opinion
being subject to major question,'' he said. ``My observations are
he gives an opinion, the same opinion, no matter what side.''
</P>
<P>
   Baden confronted death more starkly than he ever has before two
years ago when his 32-year-old son, Jud, was killed in a motorcycle
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Baden said only the deaths of children, ``true innocents,''
affect him deeply.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, death has treated Baden well. He is famous
and paid handsomely, an outsider who has been on the inside of
high-profile cases coast to coast. To him, death and demise are not
synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at death as being bad,'' he said. ``Death is part
of life.''

   Similarly, Walker, who oversees ``Seed,'' was making a
comfortable living producing videos for Tina Turner, Babyface and
Vanessa L. Williams before taking a shot at filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Stuffed between the films and Marshall's quickie interviews are
brief insights from more-established filmmakers like Amy Heckerling
``(Clueless)'' and Jocelyn Moorhouse ``(How to Make an American
Quilt)'' who says, ``Being tough does not mean mouthing off to your

   Kasi Lemmons, who wrote and directed the fine ``Eve's Bayou,''
tells aspiring filmmakers to take stock in the positives of the
work, to not look at difficulties of getting a film made but the
miracles of getting the film made.

<P>
   She knows. Just last year, Lemmons' film was considered one of
the up-and-comers as part of ``Lifetime's Women's Film Festival.''
``Look at her now,'' beams Marshall.

   Elsewhere this week:
</P>
<P>
   CBS has a film festival of its own. Trying to lure viewers to
reruns by repackaging them, CBS on Monday will show four
consecutive episodes of ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' the funny
comedy that deserves a much wider audience. ``Ray Day'' (this is
CBS' promotional title, not mine) begins at 7 p.m. CDT and includes
some pretty hilarious episodes, including the Christmas show where
Ray (Ray Romano) is in full lust after his wife, Debra, played by
Patricia Heaton. (This episode peeved some TV advocacy groups who
felt married characters shouldn't talk about having sex.)...
</P>
<P>
   Expect a slew of programming on Robert Kennedy, who was
assassinated 30 years ago. So far, the best comes from the
Discovery Channel. ``Robert F. Kennedy: A Memoir'' (7 p.m. CDT
Sunday) is part historical biography, part memoir, all engaging.
Based on journalist Jack Newfield's book of the same name, the
program traces Kennedy's journey in fine detail and, perhaps, with
the least amount of hero worship...
</P>
<P>
   HBO returns ``Arli$$'' for a third season with Richard Wuhl as
the scruple-less sports agent. The season's first new batch of
half-hour episodes debuts at 8:30 p.m. CDT Sunday, followed by 12
more episodes on subsequent Sundays. Sunday night's episode has a
little more substance and wit than the previous ``Arli$$'' season,
which routinely floundered in its attempts to do a weekly ``Jerry
McGuire'' with teeth. Let's hope this is the start of something
good...
</P>
<P>
   Preceding ``Arli$$'' at 8 p.m. CDT Sunday is HBO's ``Sex and the
City,'' billed as a candid, comic view of sex and relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jessica Parker is Carrie Bradshaw, the thirtysomething sex
columnist navigating and writing about relationships in New York.
Darren Star, who created ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' and ``Melrose
Place,'' has made a half-hour comedic romp based on what Bradshaw
has seen and done.
</P>
<P>
   The initial thought after watching the first three episodes is:
Who cares about yet another batch of whiny New Yorkers? I've had
enough. Besides, I think Star has merely brought a ``Melrose
Place'' with nudity to the place where he could get away with it _
cable...
</P>
<P>
   For anyone wondering what happened to Sean Young, she's on the
Family Channel. Young turns up at 7 p.m. CDT Sunday in ``The Cowboy
and the Movie Star,'' a weak, dreary love story. Young is the
pampered movie star ready for a change, Perry King the cowboy
looking for love. You're the viewer yawning over the film's
predictability.

MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING, BUT YOU'RE OFF TO A GOOD START
</HEADLINE>

 By KENNETH HOOKER 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 38, and my current investments include a 401(k) plan of
$30,269, almost evenly divided between Vanguard Index 500 and PIMCo
Stocks Plus funds, to which I have been adding $5,000 a year and
which is fully matched by my employer. I also have been investing
$2,400 a year in American Century Value fund, where the current
balance is $12,433, and $600 a year in Putnam New Opportunities
fund, where the balance is $5,552. Finally, I have a $12,718 IRA to
which I am no longer contributing in American Century Value. I
would like to leave my current job at the beginning of the year
2001 to work at a lower-paying, less stressful company or perhaps
to begin a career in a new field. In that case, I probably would
cut my investments to a rate of $2,000 a year. How do you suggest I
maximize my investments over the next few years, and how should I
invest the additional $2,000 a year I would be saving until
retirement? I realize if I stay with my current employer until
retirement I stand to gain financially, but I am just as interested
in living a life that is rich in personal fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; C.C., Costa Mesa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, money isn't everything. And since you've made a solid
start on retirement savings at a fairly young age, you should end
up with a pretty substantial nest egg at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming average 10 percent annual portfolio returns in all
these calculations, if you continue saving at the current rate for
the next 30 months you would have accumulated $114,470 by the time
of your contemplated career change. If you then slowed down to
$2,000 annual contributions for the next 24 1/2 years, the pool
would be $1,379,410 at age 65.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with those tidy calculations is inflation, an
unknown of massive importance. Over the course of 27 years,
inflation can take an awful bite out of the buying power of a nest
egg.
</P>
<P>
   You might begin by examining what kind of income stream
$1,379,410 might produce. If it were invested to yield an average
6.5 percent, it would bring in $89,661 a year, which at first seems
a tidy sum. But if inflation runs at 4 percent during those 27
years, that $89,661 comes to $31,095 in today's money; if inflation
is only 3 percent, that would give you $40,364 a year in current
buying power.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to decide if you are comfortable with those
numbers _ or would rather try to develop a second career that's
less stressful than your current one, yet that would still allow
you to save more than $2,000 a year toward retirement.
</P>
<P>
   As for the portfolio itself, I think it's a little top-heavy.
Your two primary vehicles _ Vanguard Index 500 and PIMCo Stocks
Plus _ are very similar, investing in a blend of growth and value
large-cap issues. In the mid-cap arena, you achieve much the same
balance, opposing the mid-cap value-oriented American Century Value
with the mid-cap growth-oriented Putnam New Dimensions. But why not
diversify further?
</P>
<P>
   First, I would suggest a solid small-cap fund such as Vanguard
Small-Cap Stock Index or Fidelity Low-Priced Stock. Second, I would
add a health care fund. The latter should be a solid and fairly
conservative health care fund _ conservative in that it gives only
modest weight to biotech or HMO issues; examples, among others,
would be Fidelity Select Health Care and Vanguard Specialized
Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest moving 10 percent of the portfolio to each of these
sectors, giving the portfolio better diversification and reducing
reliance on the large-cap area.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you couldn't make such a move unless your 401(k)
offers small-cap and/or health care options, but you could make the
move after you change careers and move the 401(k) funds into an
IRA. With such a long time until retirement, those 2 1/2 years
shouldn't have a big effect on the long-term numbers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 62 and retired. My income is $70,000 a year, coming from
a government pension, Social Security, and dividends. My portfolio
is entirely with Vanguard, consisting of $158,000 in the California
Tax-Free Money Market fund, $173,000 in the California Tax-Free
Insured Long Term Bond fund, $136,000 in Vanguard Index 500,
$63,000 in Vanguard GNMA, and $195,000 in Vanguard Wellington (of
which $61,000 is in an IRA account). Does this mix of assets make
sense, and do you think staying exclusively with Vanguard is risky?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; R.K., Carlsbad, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the portfolio is pretty conservative, but you don't
give me many hints about your appetite for risk, or how that
$70,000 of income relates to your needs.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating 65 percent of your Vanguard Wellington positions as
stocks and then adding in the Index 500 holding, I come up with a
bit more than 36 percent of the portfolio in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I realize this number represents a pretty typical equity holding
for a retiree, but I believe relatively early retirees, and those
who have amassed significant savings pools, might look to a
somewhat higher number.
</P>
<P>
   Early retirees want more stock because they can anticipate more
years during which inflation will be attacking the value of their
income stream, and affluent retirees look to a heavier stock
allocation because they usually can afford to ride out market
bumps.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to shift the IRA money that's now in Vanguard
Wellington to a conservative all-stock fund such as Vanguard Index
Value, it would boost the equity side of the portfolio to a little
more than 39 percent, and would not have a terribly significant
effect on the yield from the holding _ a reduction of $1,059 at
current rates.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether it's risky to have all your portfolio with
Vanguard, I think you have very little to worry about. Each of the
separate funds is its own business entity, with its assets held
apart from those of the parent company or other funds in the
family.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever might happen to any one fund, or to the parent company
itself, would have no effect on the financial stability of any
other fund. And second, given Vanguard's fundamental conservatism
and stingy habits when it comes to spending money, I see very
little prospect of any trouble ahead.

THIS TIME AROUND, KIM EXPECTS A WARM WELCOME IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Fourteen years ago, Kim Dae-jung was a
pro-democracy activist living in exile in Washington, struggling
with his English and with American officials who saw him as a pest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an irritant that the State Department and the president
wanted to do without,'' Kim wrote about the Reagan administration
in his unpublished autobiography. ``The White House consistently
rebuffed my direct approaches and my request for a meeting with the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   When President Kim of South Korea returns to the United States
for a nine-day state visit beginning Saturday, he will get better
treatment. This time he is to stay in Washington at Blair House,
the American government's official guest residence, and address a
joint session of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, the onetime dissident who became South Korea's president in
February, will also get a state dinner at the White House, receive
a human rights award and pick up an honorary degree at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, asked if he was tempted to pick up the telephone at Blair
House and place an ``I told you so'' call to some of the former
gate-keepers who used to fend him off, Kim paused only a moment to
savor the idea. He grinned and demurred, but he said he did draw
some lessons from his reversal of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to live long,'' he said with a sparkle in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has indeed lived long _ he is 74 _ and he credits his
survival in part to American intervention when Korean dictators
planned to kill him. That makes his state visit an especially
poignant moment, diplomats and Korean officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kim in some ways trumpets what are often called
American values even more than Americans do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the United States so frequently speaks out on
human rights issues in other countries, sometimes to the
disadvantage of its own national interests, that is what makes the
United States great, that is what makes it earn respect from around
the world,'' Kim said in an hourlong interview this week in Blue
House, the presidential mansion in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kim acknowledged that in some respects he is now in the
position of the officials who fended him off when he was a
dissident. Asked if he sometimes faces a choice between his moral
principles and the dictates of statecraft, when he ponders whether
to speak out on issues like human rights in China, Kim nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am faced with that dilemma,'' he said. ``And certainly I
cannot say at this point whether I will or will not make a public
statement about that. But I do have a great deal of personal
interest in what happens in China'' and Burma.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Kim has emerged to some extent as a spokesman for
the region and not just his country. The state visit to America
will add to his stature and to this regional leadership role, a
role that he seems to relish.
</P>
<P>
   ``As painful as the current situation is, we wish to use it as
much as we can to push through economic reforms, to make our
democracy stronger, so that we will be a model for the Asian
region, a model that says that you have to promote democracy and
the free market in parallel, and that the future of Asia lies in
this model,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for Kim to sustain his role as a model for the region, he
will first have to overcome South Korea's economic crisis. And that
too is a reason for the state visit: Kim will begin his visit in
the financial capital of New York, not the political capital of
Washington, and he will emphasize South Korea's efforts to
restructure its economy and woo foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is of utmost importance that we win foreign investment,''
Kim said. ``With the capital that comes in with foreign investment,
we can pay back our debts. With the foreign capital will come new
ways of management, making our management more rational and
breathing new life into our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in New York on Saturday and helping open the
Korea Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and speaking to
several organizations, Kim is to go to Washington on Monday for a
meeting with President Clinton and his speech to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he will travel to California and deliver a speech
at Stanford University and visit Silicon Valley, whose
entrepreneurial spirit Kim greatly admires. On June 12 he will go
on to Los Angeles, a center for Korean-Americans, and will leave
for home the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The visit is also likely to buoy Kim politically at home.
Initially he was hailed as virtually a national savior when he took
office, even as he lectured his nation on the need to accept the
pain of layoffs and restructuring. But in recent weeks, some Korean
business analysts have said the steam has gone out of his
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Kim disagrees. He said he is concerned about
rising unemployment but still confident that South Korea is on the
right track to recreate itself as a more open and market-oriented
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gives me hope is that we are probably over the worst
phase of the foreign currency crunch,'' he said, adding that
foreign exchange reserves have risen from $3.8 billion last
December to $34 billion today. Interest rates have dropped and a
trade deficit has turned into a substantial surplus, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   One major concern for foreign investors has been the militancy
of South Korean labor unions, which have been hostile to layoffs
and have turned to strikes and sometimes violence to resist
restructuring. The unions have agreed to postpone strikes until
Kim's return from the United States, however, and Kim argues that
the worst is over for the labor unrest.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissident days, Kim was closely allied with labor groups,
but now he seems concerned that they will frighten investors and
block his efforts to create a more flexible market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently seeking to reassure foreigners that the unions have
not gained the upper hand in Korea, he said in the interview that
he will use the full authority of the government to crack down on
unions that violate the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will respond very forcefully,'' he said, ``to any unlawful
action or to any resort to violence on their part.'' &QL;

`ROBERT F. KENNEDY: A MEMOIR': A LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review. Time,
channel are for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(th) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The career of Robert F. Kennedy was made for legend: the
youthful privilege giving way to early sorrow, the transformation
from bare-knuckled political operative to compassionate spokesman
for the underdog, the life cut short as its climax seemed within
reach.
</P>
<P>
   A three-hour memoir, which arrives soon after the 30th
anniversary of his assassination, taps the affections of those who
knew him well and can only burnish the image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert F. Kennedy: A Memoir,'' based on Jack Newfield's book
and with interviews by Newfield, concentrates on the emotions that
the man stirred in associates, family members and others who
traveled with him on his short journey.
</P>
<P>
   Memory may have softened reality and added a glow, but the
television audience can still learn much from the likes of Arthur
Schlesinger Jr., Rep. John Lewis and Richard Goodwin about the
hopes he aroused and the causes in which he enlisted.
</P>
<P>
   Newsreels carry the story from the young man's brief association
with Sen. Joseph McCarthy through his zealous attacks on mobsters
and corrupt labor leaders like James Hoffa; from his tough-minded
services to his brother John as campaigner, attorney general and
intimate adviser through his emergence as a moral force as senator
from New York and in his campaign for the 1968 Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's accomplishments never matched the promise that his
admirers detected in him, but that only adds to the sorrow for the
young knight felled prematurely and for what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Newfield speaks for the admirers in an interview to publicize
the program when he says: ``Had he lived, America might well have
had a president who would have united the black and white poor into
a new majority for change, begun a second war on poverty and
brought peace to Vietnam several years sooner. Instead, America
experienced Nixon, Watergate, Agnew, Kent State and Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the legacy being advanced by this memoir. How realistic
that assessment is must be left to more objective scholars, but at
the least they will have to take such prospects or dreams into
their own cooler accounts.

SMALL DWARF SHRUBS COMPLETE A GARDEN TAPESTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 7)  
 (JT)  
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I moved to a quarter-acre property in central New Jersey 20
years ago, I wasn't interested in shrubs. I thought that they were
all overwhelming in size and that their lack of color, fragrance
and seasonal change made them unsuitable for my small beds.
</P>
<P>
   It took me a while, however, to realize how wrong I had been. In
the beginning, as many other gardeners have done, I concentrated on
perennials and bulbs so that I could have a flowing tapestry of
color from spring through fall in my long, narrow borders.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years, though, I knew something was still missing. In
winter, the beds were bare and boring. In spring, emerging
perennials provided little variation in height. By summer, my
packed flowers needed a solid, stable block of form to tie together
their many elements. And in fall, it would have been nice to have a
stalwart architectural presence instead of a waning heap of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Just at this time _ 1988 _ the Pennsylvania Horticultural
Society introduced its Gold Medal Award, singling out commercially
available woody ornamentals that are beautiful, low-maintenance,
hardy and underutilized. Each year, the winners are described in
the society's magazine, Green Scene.
</P>
<P>
   One in particular caught my eye. It was Virginia sweetspire
(Itea virginica ``Henry's Garnet''), a short shrub that was said to
grow no more than four feet high. I read that it provided color,
fragrance and seasonal change with scented white flowers in late
June and wine red to scarlet foliage in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   I went to my local garden center, chose a sweetspire, and tucked
it into a shady corner at the back of my house. Its open, arching
branches look lovely as they shelter spring-blooming bulbs and
ground covers below and add form and structure in a small garden
area the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   With that success, I decided to explore the delights of smaller
shrubs, bushes two to four feet tall. The sweetspire was followed
by two more Gold Medal winners. Blue Mist fothergilla (F. gardenii
``Blue Mist'') features white, bottlebrush-shaped flowers in spring
and handsome blue-green foliage in other seasons. Hummingbird, a
dwarf cultivar of the native sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia),
emits an intoxicating, intensely fragrant scent from its white,
full-size flower clusters during August's heat. In fall, its
foliage turns a brilliant yellow to orange, and in winter the dried
flower heads spray over bare stems to form a mounded, airy fountain
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   When I finished adding Hummingbird, I wanted more beautiful,
carefree garden workhorses like it in my small spaces. That meant I
had to explore mail-order catalogs because most of these plants
have yet to reach garden centers.
</P>
<P>
   One of my first searches was for Rhodora (Rhododendron
canadense). Among the most cold-tolerant of the genus, this
deciduous plant had been recommended to me for its ease of care by
an officer of the American Rhododendron Society.
</P>
<P>
   Thriving in either sun or shade, Rhodora bursts forth with large
rosy purple or white flowers in early spring. In fall, the foliage
turns a rather attractive yellow-brown. Though most literature says
Rhodora must be grown in moist conditions (it is native to bogs and
wet hillsides), my plant is in a raised bed and requires only a
weekly watering during dry spells.
</P>
<P>
   It took quite a while to track down dwarf blueberries (Vaccinium
angustifolium hybrids ``North Blue'' and ``North Country'') but I
finally found them in the Hartmann's Plants catalog. They have
amply repaid me for my effort. In spring, creamy white flowers
dangle from their airy stems; in summer, edible blue fruits cover
the plants; in fall, the foliage is a handsome scarlet, and in
winter, the red-tinged stems and stalks gleam in cold sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   It was this hint of red in the winter landscape that convinced
me I needed more color in my winter garden. This spring, I planted
dwarf winterberries (Ilex verticillata ``Red Sprite''), which I
hope will live up to their reputation of being covered with large
red fruit. They joined the three dwarf redtwig dogwoods (Cornus
sericea ``Kelseyi'') I planted last fall. These feature white
spring flowers, blue late-summer fruits, dark red fall foliage and,
of course, bright red, bare winter stems.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, the dogwood stems were not as colorful over the
winter as I had hoped, and I have read that the leaves are
susceptible to disease and early drop. If this is true, Kelseyi
will disappear from my garden. That will not be a disaster. Unlike
in trials with large bushes, mistakes in experimenting with smaller
shrubs do not leave big, ugly spaces in borders.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Given all the 20th-century icons who have been
resurrected and paid homage to in the name of fashion, nothing is
more curious than the pedestal erected for that hapless bungler of
television fame Gilligan.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it would appear from last summer's vogue for the fishing
hat, which Bob Denver almost never took off his head in the three
years that ``Gilligan's Island'' ruled the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Gilligan is the apotheosis of simple chic compared
with those other castaways _ the movie star, the millionaire and
his wife _ who packed an astounding amount of clothes for a
three-hour tour. And Gilligan had the right idea: in tropical
weather, a hat protects the head and neck from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, given the natural impulse to dress down for summer in
a lightweight jacket, polo shirt and khakis, a good hat adds a
crucial bit of personality and polish to an otherwise lackluster
outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no reason the Gilligan hat has to go into
reruns this summer. Even if one does not want to step out in a
dandified straw boater, there are any number of summer hats less
dowdy than our hero's.
</P>
<P>
   At Barneys New York, a jaunty black straw hat made in England by
Fred Bare, $60, is neat and crisp enough to wear with a suit, yet
equally apropos of a short-sleeve shirt and shorts.
</P>
<P>
   A black striped straw hat by Rod Keenan, $265, also at Barneys,
is less versatile but much more stylish. Made of a finer weave, it
is also more comfortable and durable.
</P>
<P>
   At Agnes B., on Greene Street in Soho, a narrow-brim hat, $83,
has an old-fashioned shape, but made in black leather, it has a
sharp, rakish cool.
</P>
<P>
   At the venerable milliner Worth &AMP; Worth, on Madison Avenue at
43rd Street, summer hat styles range from a simple, smart cotton
driving cap, $30, to a panoply of Panama hats in varying weaves,
styles and prices. A Baku straw snap-brim is $145, while Panama
Montecristi hats can cost up to $1,000, depending on the fineness
of the weave and of the jipijapa, the straw from which Panamas are
made.
</P>
<P>
   At Bergdorf Goodman, the finest Panama hat is $495 and can be
squashed in a suitcase, within reason, and still snap back into
shape. A cowboy-style Panama with a leather hatband is $195 and has
a novel charm.
</P>
<P>
   For those who still cling to the Gilligan ideal but want to
upgrade, Paul Stuart, on Madison Avenue at 45th Street, has a
waterproof fishing hat in a sleek black oiled cotton, $27.50. And
Prada sells a fishing-style hat in black or brown nylon for $214 _
perfect for those who feel marooned without a designer label.

THE DAEWOO'S NOT HERE YET, BUT THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE A LUXURY CAR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a car of surprises. At first glance, it reminds this
columnist of something British from the 1960s. It's from the other
end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   It looks entirely different to some other folks _ ``What's this,
a Lexus?'' was a question asked by four different viewers.
</P>
<P>
   It's slick, sleek, outfitted to the nines, and it exhibits very
fine road manners; it is a much better car than I would have
expected from a company called Daewoo. I had never seen a luxury
car from Daewoo _ nor do I remember a true luxury automobile from
any Korean manufacturer. At least, I had never driven one. Frankly,
I had expected a lot less than this Daewoo Laganza delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The minimal expectations do not spring from any antipathy to
things Korean but from earlier experience with a Daewoo automobile
_ a tinny little bucket dubbed Pontiac LeMans. Daewoo early on had
a partnership of sorts with General Motors, and it was a Daewoo of
small virtue that inherited the muscle car moniker during one of
GM's many product reshufflings. It was at best a very bad joke.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo has moved away from GM and looked toward a Porsche
executive, Ulrich Bez, for design expertise; Laganza, therefore, is
no joke but a fairly accurate Korean quotation of a European car.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of other surprises, too. Although the price
of Laganza has not been set as of this writing, it may be a bargain
in today's market. The Americans in Daewoo want to price it around
$17,000; the Koreans see $20K as more reasonable an asking price.
Somewhere in the middle, would still be low for a nicely styled
five-passenger sedan with air conditioning, power everything, and
other amenities. The tested Laganza came with leather and a CD
player; perhaps those are meant to be options, perhaps not.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the other surprise _ or disappointment: The
columnist is roadtesting a vehicle that isn't yet available. In
fact, the first New England dealership isn't open yet. The car is
expected to go on sale around Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be worth serious consideration when it arrives.
Daewoo, while not exactly a household word around here, has been
making cars for enough years to have a track record. The company is
well established in Australia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo has two other cars in the lineup, an entry-level dubbed
Lanos, about the size of a Ford Escort, expected to bear a price
``under $9,000,'' according to Daewoo, and the Contour-sized
Nubira, for under $10,000. The Lanos, says Daewoo, will be aimed at
college students, and the company is looking to recruit collegians
as sales aides.
</P>
<P>
   The Daewoo Laganza test car was so fresh off the factory boat
that it didn't even have a license plate, just a temporary sticker
in the back window issued in California. Nor did it have much on
the odometer _ essentially the mileage from where the truck dropped
it to my digs. For this assessment, since Daewoo is looking toward
youth for sales potential, I turned to daughter of Auto Writer, who
at 29 no longer considers herself youthful _ which comment always
elicits a guffaw from Daddy Gray Hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about a run up to Owls Head?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I get to drive?'' came a question by way of answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You drive back,'' I offered. Deal.
</P>
<P>
   We pulled onto Route 202 heading for Biddeford and the Maine
Turnpike via Sanford, discovering along the way that the
2.198-liter (134.1 CID) four-cylinder had some guts. Good, but not
flashy off the line, it offered some reserve for passing _ you
don't have much room for that on Maine's rural roads. The engine,
however, whines loudly when you demand passing power.
</P>
<P>
   A five-speed manual is available, but the test vehicle came with
a four-speed automatic, a smooth shifter that, while it sapped a
bit of performance from the little engine, didn't overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   The air conditioning had an automatic mode but seemed to offer
only two genuine settings: too cool or too warm. We agreed on the
cooler choice.
</P>
<P>
   The radio sounds fine, but the controls are from hell, small
with markings that can only be described as bizarre. Why, for
example, is the AM/FM selector switch disguised as a matchhead
daintily etched with ``RAD.'' Another button that might have been a
volume control wasn't; it added reverberation, making the
newscaster sound as if he were broadcasting from inside a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Window switches of the convenient push/pull type favored by the
Japanese makers were mounted on the doors. A power mirror switch is
on the left end of the dash. The glove box is small, but door bins,
a small covered bin between the seats, and pockets in the seat
backs helped with storage. A lid in front of the bin covers two
cupholders. The trunk is good _ got the acid test with a bookcase _
but the rear seats do not fold down to add cargo room. Legroom and
headroom are good front and rear, despite a sunroof with a sliding
inner panel _ opening that inner door brightened up the interior
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   The ride up the coast was pleasant, the tour of Owls Head
Transportation Museum delightful _ although planes were being
taxied toward cover as rain threatened. The rain arrived and
thundered on the roof for a few minutes, ending in a burst of
sunlight. The ride back down the coast was pleasantly uneventful.
We stopped for dinner in Wiscasset, sadly eyeing the last remnants
of the abandoned schooners Hesper and Luther Little being uprooted
from the harbor bottom.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, daughter got the interesting part of the drive;
traffic increased, rain drops fell from a lowering sky that
blackened omniously as we crossed into Massachusetts heading for
her digs in Lowell. A grand display of lightning danced across the
horizon. ``I suppose I'll have no lights when I get back,'' she
said, as the skies opened, turning Route 495 into a raging river.
</P>
<P>
   She slowed appropriately; the Daewoo splashed along. The AC had
achieved something of a comfort equilibrium. She had never needed
the antilock brakes; I used them later _ gratefully. She had lights
at home.
</P>
<P>
   The storm passed as we hit Lowell, but I hit it again on my
return to the New Hampshire den I inhabit _ torrential rain, more
heavenly fireworks, and, finally, the sudden need for ABS because
someone else had proven ... unwise.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage was good; for 556.5 miles measured, the Laganza
delivered 26.5 miles per gallon overall.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will prove it, but the Daewoo looks like serious
competition. Daughter _ I can't call her the kid anymore _ is
checking the budget to see if, maybe .... Wait a year, kid.

AIRPORT EXPANSION COULD SPARK ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco International Airport has
announced it will seek to expand its runways, a job that could
entail filling part of the San Francisco Bay. And that could cause
a landslide of environmental opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials say chronic flight delays, the increasing
popularity of air travel and the introduction of larger planes make
it essential to upgrade the 60-year-old runways soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a fundamental problem with delays,'' said Airport
Director John Martin, who has watched the airport's on-time figures
drop to the worst in the nation, partly due to weather. ``Often
passengers face up to two-hour delays. It's not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials said the possibilities range from filling the
Bay for extra space to building floating runways or raising them
out of the water like bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But Will Travis, director of the Bay Area Conservation and
Development Commission, the agency that decides whether to issue
permits for Bay construction, said he believed the airport was
acting prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a problem at the airport,'' he said. ``But the first
solution we look at should not be filling in the Bay. We should
look at whether there are other ways to handle it first. Do we have
enough capacity at other airports?''
</P>
<P>
   The airport's parallel runways are only 750 feet apart. While
planes can land side by side in good weather, all it takes is a few
clouds to force the airport to use only one runway, cutting in half
the number of planes that can land.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again this year, this reduction in the airport's
landing capacity has created a logjam of stranded planes at other
airports and caused hundreds of delays and cancellations in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he was looking for a solution that would improve the
runways' ability to function in bad weather and handle large
planes, while at the same time reducing noise problems and
improving the Bay's overall environmental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly realize we would have to do massive environmental
mitigation,'' said Martin, ``maybe on a scale never before done in
the Bay area.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1800s many thousands of acres of the Bay have been
filled in to build space for military bases, ports and airports,
industrial complexes, even cities.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the fill has already endangered fish and
wildlife, disrupted the food chain and destroyed more than 90
percent of the wetlands in the region.
</P>
<P>
   They say that to meet the demand for runway space, the airport
would most likely have to fill in part of the Bay, creating a host
of potential wildlife disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're terribly concerned,'' said Will Burns, director of Save
the Bay, a group organized in the 1960s for the express purpose of
stopping the in-filling. ``This would be the largest landfill
project in decades. It would affect fish migration, feeding cycles
and the tidal patterns. We oppose it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To make a long story short, I'm the bee's knees.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really. But I am the 50-something guy you may have
seen in summertime Manhattan going about his business clad in coat
and tie, dressy loafers (no socks) and what used to be called
Bermuda shorts. I didn't set out to become an ensign of men's
style, but one I seem to have become, recognized uptown and down by
my . . . knees. From Park Avenue to Broadway, Columbus Circle to
Wall Street, customarily blase New Yorkers see me coming and step
aside, not quite sure whether to shun me as a trampler of the
proprieties or salute me as a breeze of sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   It all started one steamy Monday morning seven or eight years
ago. Fed up with swimming in my own juices and paying a cleaner to
dry me out, I said to myself, All right, I'll go to dress-code
perdition! So after putting on the ever-proper top half of the
business uniform, I put on a pair of khaki shorts. My Bedford Hills
train-platform comrades in their 14-piece suits stared, catcalled
(or what passes for catcalling in Bedford Hills) and wondered if I
was going formal to a company picnic. At work, the reaction was
just as derisive, only more up close and personal. But that night,
my by-now-wilted brethren were gargling a different tune. ``I wish
I could get away with that,'' said Mark the investment adviser,
considerably more humble than in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   One day followed another, and then the years after that, and
suddenly I was ``the man in the shorts,'' known to strangers all
over town. Like crocuses or allergies, my legs became harbingers of
summer. All it took was one of those addled days when the weather
got ahead of itself, and someone I didn't know would stop me in
some mind-your-own-business place _ train, street or elevator _ and
ask when I was going to start wearing them. (This year, a new
record was established: on Jan. 9, when the temperature hit 63,
three strangers braced me about my lack of shorts. They may have
been kidding.)
</P>
<P>
   The answer was, and is, Not before Memorial Day. There are
standards. And to be perfectly honest about it, when the shorts go
on, the pants go off for the duration, and Memorial Day has proved
a fairly safe cutoff date. There are no standards at the end of the
cycle, however. The pants come back when it seems foolish still to
be in shorts (last year, on Sept. 26).
</P>
<P>
   Before I climb too high a self-constructed pedestal, I should
confess that I'm essentially a buttoned-down, cuffs-on-his-trousers
kind of gent, and though I wish I didn't, I do care what others
(some of them, anyway) see of me. It's just that long before
``casual'' Fridays and institutionalized nonchalance, I decided I
cared more about comfort than codes. Judging from the reactions I
provoke, most people seem to agree. Almost everybody smiles, and
some even rupture the New York canon of indifference with a
comment, almost always complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, the gentleman (at least he was dressed
like one) who paused at 56th Street and Third Avenue one day last
June and simply said, ``Way to go!'' And there was the woman
standing next to me at the light at 43rd and Madison who
tentatively touched my arm and said: ``I see you almost every day.
You look terrific.'' And the firefighter outside Engine Company 65
on 43rd Street who two weeks ago admonished me for being late with
the knees. And this, boomed down three days ago from the staging
where the new Conde Nast tower is rising in Times Square: ``Say,
brother. You look gooood.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is my homeless friend John, who always manages to find
me in midtown, hails me by name and stokes my ego with lines like:
``Wowee, you are something. I want your clothes. I want your
legs.'' Flattery will get you everything, and in John's case,
that's a buck. (To his credit, he won't accept a ``donation'' two
days in a row.)
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is quite so mellow. A couple of years
ago, I was invited to lunch with friends at the Yale Club. I wore
an appropriately blue-and-white seersucker suit, truncated. We met
in the second-floor lounge for drinks before proceeding to the
21st-floor terrace. But I didn't get to proceed. When the waiter
came to take a second drink order, he suggested in a tone brooking
no dissent that I would be happier having another club soda and a
fillet of whatever elsewhere. A Member has complained, sir.
</P>
<P>
   What I wanted to say to that hidebound Member was that shorts,
or something approximating them, have been with us longer than
trousers. That empires have been won, defended and lost in them.
And that in many civilized places _ Bermuda, naturally, which isn't
even tropical, as well as innumerable other hot-weather dens of
respectability _ short pants are de rigueur business attire. But I
didn't. I left, walking out as arrogantly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   That I have become a symbol of sartorial liberation says less
about me than about what wimps corporate men have turned into as
they don their dry-cleaned dungarees, Missoni sweaters and $200
sneakers to proclaim their dressed-down sang-froid. Men on the go
wear shorts _ firemen, mailmen, deliverymen, to name a few _ so why
not men on the sit? Once in a while I do encounter a fellow
coat-and-tied shorts wearer, but he usually ends up being a
salesman in SoHo rather than a captain, or even a noncom, of
industry. When it comes to having the power of their convictions
about easygoing clothes, businessmen apparently have neither power
nor convictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My boss won't go for it,'' people whine. Or ``my legs are
lousy.'' Your boss doesn't sweat (or perspire or glow)? Doesn't
complain about the stick of summer? Every woman in a skirt or
tights has great legs? The sun stews potentate and peon in equal
measure; humidity is an equal-opportunity oppressor. Comfort should
respect comfort, not punish it, and dressing for success should
open the wardrobe of the mind, not the dressing room of
Grandfather's haberdasher.
</P>
<P>
   (Fashionwise, which isn't really the point but certainly is a
point, I like pleated cotton shorts in solid colors, with a seven-
or eight-inch inseam. Since mine is a weather-driven conceit, I
don't wear socks. Knee socks may look great in Bermuda, but for my
glands, wrapping the lower legs in anything defeats the purpose.
And esthetically speaking, the sight of shorts anchored in dark
ankle-length socks is enough to make me think about putting long
pants back on.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that I've been wearing shorts long enough to be cranky about
those who don't and won't, and long enough to have been evicted
from the Yale Club, consider this a call to knees, an invitation to
join me in casting aside the legs of convention.
</P>
<P>
   As a Speed Graphics messenger shouted at me a few days after I
hung up my shorts for the fall a few years back, ``Your outfit
don't make it _ without the short pants!''

CONGRESS VOWS HEARINGS ON MARINE SHOOTING OF TEXAS MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of a House immigration panel said
Friday he would hold a hearing next month into the shooting death
of a young Texan by a Marine anti-drug patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting near the Rio Grande River last year prompted the
Defense Department to temporarily suspend the use of soldiers in
counter-narcotics surveillance operations along the U.S.-Mexico
border.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, voiced frustration at the slow
response from the Justice and Defense departments on his requests
for information and documents about the death on May 20, 1997, of
Esequiel Hernandez, 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to have public accountability and a public
accounting, and the most obvious forum for a public accounting is a
hearing,'' said Smith, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee
on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wants transcripts of radio conversations among the
Marines, Border Patrol and other federal agencies when the four-man
patrol was given the order to shoot Hernandez. The Marines were
working in conjunction with the Border Patrol at the time of the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also is asking for records on training and supervision of
armed military patrols that served on anti-drug patrols along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Marines were not acting as independent operators,'' Smith
said. ``They didn't make a move without getting permission.''
</P>
<P>
   State and federal grand juries that investigated the shooting
did not indict Marine Cpl. Clemente Banuelos, who admitted to
shooting Hernandez with an M-16 rifle after the civilian fired his
.22-caliber rifle at the four camouflaged Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred at dusk, several miles from the Rio Grande
and near the border town of Redford, in a rugged border corridor
that attracts smugglers. Hernandez was herding his family's goats
at the time of the shooting, and family members have said he
normally carried a gun for protection.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration subcommittee has subpoenaed documents presented
to the grand juries, as well as policy directives and position
statements from the Justice and Defense departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made numerous requests that have been ignored,'' said
Smith, who said he was frustrated by the two departments' inaction.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman agreed to push back a Friday deadline for the
information from the Defense Department after Navy Secretary John
Dalton pledged full cooperation with the lawmaker's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also accused the Justice Department of failing to produce
documents sought by the committee for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I haven't heard any good responses for their lack of
responsiveness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswomen for Justice and Defense said their departments would
comply with Smith's requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have a right to know; Congress has a right to
know,'' Smith said.

SIDELINED JACK RUSSELLS, ARTFUL MINGLING, BIKES AND BINOCULARS

<P>
   Every dog may have its day, but if you're a short-legged Jack
Russell terrier you'll have to wait. The American Kennel Club, the
arbiter of who's in in canine society, ruled in January that only
Jack Russells with legs 12 to 14 inches long are standard for the
breed. This leaves many shorter-legged Jack Russells out in the
cold. Owners of the trendy breed include Prince Charles, Dr.
Frasier Crane and the mother of David Cone, the Yankee pitcher
sidelined with a nipped hand.
</P>

   Owners of long-legged Jack Russells are gloating, while fans of
the short-legged cousins, known as Puds, are feeling snubbed. ``If
they want to start their own club, they can,'' said Pat Wilcox, the
vice president of the Jack Russell Terrier Association, in Old
Lyme, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of owners were unhappy about the long-sought
acceptance, fearing it will lead to over-breeding. So, some owners
of short-legged Jack Russells are happy to be blackballed. They
include Christopher Walling , a jewelry designer who takes his
short-legged Jack Russell, Jack, everywhere. ``Because I live in
the city, I have a small dog,'' he said. ``Anyone that knows Jack
Russells knows they are little dogs that don't think they are.''

   Up on the Roof
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even the impending thunderstorms a couple of Fridays
ago couldn't keep the droves away from the Roof Garden at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, a spot where youthful culture seekers
go to meet and mingle. Laura Marino, a 37-year-old broadcast
producer for Bravo, dropped by and was surprised at how easy it was
to meet people. ``I haven't done the singles scene in a while and
this was unintimidating,'' she said. The museum's rooftop has
turned into a happy hour of sorts on Fridays and Saturdays, with
drinks served to as many as 1,600 until 8:45, when the museum
closes.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the line for the bar snakes around the sculptures.
``The people there have an interest in art or museums,'' Ms. Marino
said. ``It takes it up a notch from the bar scene.'' When the first
few raindrops hit, guards ushered everyone off the premises _ but
not before many had hurriedly exchanged business cards. Down below,
as guests were turned away at the elevator because of the rain, a
young woman vowed to return. ``We have the entire summer ahead of
us to check out the new installation,'' she said. ``And the men.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedaling Back
</P>
<P>
   The reintroduction of Schwinn's 1968 Orange Krate is good news
for nostalgic grown-ups like Andrew Mer. The 35-year-old Manhattan
lawyer remembers receiving a Grey Ghost (part of the Krate family)
for his 8th birthday. ``The one day I lent it to my younger
brother, the bike was stolen and stripped,'' he said ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Orange Krate, retooled from the original, which flew
out of stores as sales peaked in the early 1970s, will roll out in
July. The redesign celebrates Schwinn's improved fortunes: the
company entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1992, but is back on its
feet. (One trade group lists it as No. 1 for the $200-to-$400
bicycle market.)
</P>
<P>
   Greg Bagney, Schwinn's vice president for marketing, said,
``Younger kids will want the bike because of their love for
anything retro, and the older group will be interested because they
owned one the first time around and they're going to want another
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The bikes will sell for $350 to $500 at bicycle stores
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Skirts to Match
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ People are literally ordering the clothes off Paige
Novick's back. ``I had a friend stitch up a skirt to go with one of
my bags for the Seventh on Sixth party, and that night I had people
ordering it off my body,'' said Ms. Novick, 31, explaining how her
company, Frou by Paige Novick, expanded to women's wear last
November. It started as a hair-accessory business four years ago
and grew to include handbags two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really design around my handbags,'' Ms. Novick said. ``I
look at the skirts as accessories and the handbags as the focal
point.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress Julianne Moore wears the black satin skirt with the
pink embroidered flowers, as have the hostesses and waitresses at
Moomba since the designer was spotted wearing one in the
restaurant. The skirts cost between $235 and $250, and the bags are
about $200. Among the stores that carry them are Barneys and
Calypso in New York and Fred Siegal in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A Wide View
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're a sports fan stuck in the nose-bleed seats or a
summer concertgoer without the energy to push to the front,
Bushnell's Xtra-Wide binoculars may be the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you the amount of people that ask about them at
games,'' said Luther Jones, an engineer, who regularly takes his
three children to Yankee Stadium. ``I can't afford the primo seats,
and the binoculars make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   At $100 they are cheaper than most models designed for bird
watching, and they offer a wider view _ up to three times wider
than regular binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   George Egon, Bushnell's vice president for marketing, says it's
like having a wide-screen television set at the game.
</P>
<P>
   For stores that sell the binoculars: (800) 423-3537.

MORE, BIGGER SLAPS IN REDEEMING SHARES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MAGGIE TOPKIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors who skip blithely from fund to fund, beware. More
funds are imposing redemption fees to trip up those who are fleet
of foot, fund experts say, and the fees are carrying nastier
stings.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike back-end loads, or deferred sales charges _ typically
used to pay brokers _ redemption fees are returned to the fund's
asset base. They average 1 percent of the assets being redeemed and
are intended to discourage short-term players, like market timers
or those who simply change their minds a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The fees, however, are usually not imposed for long. According
to Lipper Analytical Services, a research firm based in Summit,
N.J., the average redemption fee is in effect for about seven
months from the date of purchase. After that, investors can get out
without paying a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Why are more funds considering redemption fees? Talk to Mark
Coffelt, manager of the high-flying Texas Capital Value and Growth
fund. Last October, fair-weather investors yanked 20 percent of his
fund's assets in just three days. That forced him to sell stocks,
many at a profit, resulting in capital gains on which the remaining
shareholders had to pay unexpected taxes. ``They got whacked,''
Coffelt said.
</P>
<P>
   Even those holding funds in tax-deferred accounts can be hurt in
such circumstances because the manager can be forced to sell into a
market that does not want to buy. ``The timers cash out just as the
liquidity in the market is drying up,'' said Coffelt, who is now
considering imposing a redemption fee. ``They are roaches in the
kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the fund companies that are upping the redemption ante is
Fidelity Investments, the industry giant. A number of Fidelity
funds already carry redemption fees of up to 1.5 percent, typically
for redemptions within 90 days of purchase. But the new Fidelity
Small Cap Stock fund charges 3 percent _ and the fee is levied if
an investor skips within the first three years.
</P>
<P>
   Does that sound like a long time to stick around? Consider the
five-year tenure required by tax-managed funds from the Vanguard
Group, which impose a redemption fee that slides from 2 percent to
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And some funds are imposing fees regardless how long investors
stay. The Oberweis Micro-Cap and Oberweis Mid-Cap funds charge a
modest 0.25 percent fee whenever an investor redeems shares.
</P>
<P>
   Oberweis Asset Management president James Oberweis said he
fights ``a constant battle'' to keep market-timers out of the
company's Emerging Growth fund, too, and has considered applying a
fee there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rules are a mite tricky. At Bridgeway Capital
Management, both Bridgeway Ultra-Large 35 Index and Bridgeway
Ultra-Small Index come with permanent redemption fees, but with a
twist: The 2 percent toll will be assessed, at the fund's
discretion, only if an investor sells after the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index has fallen by 5 percent in the five previous
trading days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the right to redeem your shares,'' said Bridgeway
president John N.R. Montgomery. ``But if you're pulling your money
out just at the time when it will be most painful for shareholders
who remain in the fund, well, we don't want you to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Permanent fees are perhaps most common among emerging-markets
funds, more than 20 percent of which have a redemption fee of some
kind, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher. With these funds, the fees serve a dual purpose. They
discourage timers and compensate other shareholders for what
Vanguard spokesman Brian Mattes called ``extraordinarily high costs
of trading in these markets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are taxes, stamp fees, often really huge bid/ask spreads
_ it can be very expensive when new money comes into the
portfolio,'' Mattes said.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that expense, some funds with high trading costs but
without redemption fees hit you up on the front end. Five Vanguard
funds, for example, charge ``purchase fees'' that range between 0.5
and 1 percent. Charles Schwab now charges a flat fee of at least
$39 in its One Source program for sales of shares held less than 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   Fickle investors take note: One way or another you're going to
pay to play.

HAMAS LEADER REPRESENTS CHALLENGE TO ARAFAT'S RULE, ANALYSTS SAY 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, June 7) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ For three months, Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat has watched warily while a political rival, Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the militant Hamas movement,
has been received almost like a head of state by nearly a dozen
Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of months without progress in peace talks with Israel, the
Islamic nations are signaling their dissatisfaction with the
hard-line policies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by
boosting the prestige of the Palestinian militant in a way that
plays to their own grumbling opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that the warm reception Yassin has received
represents a fresh challenge to Arafat's rule. And the timing
couldn't be worse for the Palestinian leader's sagging popularity.
Months of stalled peace negotiations and a stagnant economy have
helped tug Arafat's approval rating down to less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to these difficulties, Yassin, a 61-year-old paraplegic
who is nearly blind and suffers from lung ailments, has been
touring hard-line Arab states such as Syria and Iran and moderate
states such as Saudi Arabia with a message likely to rankle Arafat
even more: No peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The danger to Arafat has not been lost on the government he
heads, the Palestinian Authority. Officials in Gaza try to downplay
the threat Yassin's whirlwind tour poses to Arafat's rule by
spinning the high-profile visits as a warning to Netnayahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arab states are telling Netanyahu, `If you destroy the
Palestinian Authority and the peace agreements, we will support
Hamas,''' said Ahmed Abdel Rahman, the authority's secretary
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear, and this is a good answer to Netanyahu,''
said Abdel Rahman. ``If he is smart, he will listen.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a move that reflected Arafat's concern, the Palestinian
government asked Jordan, home to about 3 million Palestinians, not
to grant Yassin entry. So far, Jordan, Lebanon and South Africa
have refused to allow the sheikh an entry visa, according to a
Hamas leader in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Yassin's trip began with a low-key request by the sheikh to
visit Egypt for medical treatment. In April, Israel gave him
permission to leave Gaza on a diplomatic passport issued by the
Palestinian Authority, and Hamas leaders expect Israel to allow him
to return to Gaza without incident. Israeli security services have
been debating whether or not to let him return.
</P>
<P>
   From Egypt, Yassin went to Saudi Arabia to attend the annual
pilgrimage to Mecca, which every Muslim is obligated to make at
least once in his or her lifetime. But something unusual occurred.
When the Hamas leader arrived in Saudi Arabia, its leaders, King
Fahd, and Prince Abdallah, asked to see him. Within weeks, Qatar,
the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Yemen also extended invitations.
In each country, Yassin was received by kings, princes and
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the sheikh traveled to Kuwait, Syria and the Sudan, whose
Islamic president, Mazjoub Khalifa, suggested setting up a charity
to aid the Palestinians. Hamas officials say they were even trying
to set up a meeting between Yassin and Saddam Hussein in Iraq. From
there, the Hamas leader may go to Pakistan, the first Islamic
nation to detonate a nuclear device, and Malaysia, the most
populous Islamic country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yassin's tour comes as relations between the Palestinian
Authority and Hamas remain at their lowest level since last fall,
when the Hamas leader was let out of an Israeli prison, part of a
swap with Jordan for captured Israeli intelligence agents who had
botched an attempt to assassinate a Hamas official in Amman.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Arafat blamed the mysterious slaying of Hamas
bomb-maker Mohiedin Sharif on an internal Hamas dispute. Most
Palestinians believe Israel masterminded the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, apparently concerned that Hamas would take revenge by
setting off another suicide bomb and blow away his chance to wrest
territory from Netanyahu, found evidence implicating another Hamas
militant in Sharif's death. Then Arafat silenced the Hamas leaders
who claimed otherwise by throwing them all into jail.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his tour, Yassin has been careful to avoid open
conflict with Arafat. Instead he has talked about Israeli
aggression. He has pronounced as dead the 1993 and 1995 Oslo
agreements that form the basis for the peace process. He has
reiterated the need to liberate ``all of Palestine.`` And he has
predicted Israel's destruction would come in the first half of the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   He also has obliquely directed barbs against the Palestinian
Authority, which were not lost on Arab audiences. In the Syrian
capital of Damascus, for instance, Yassin told reporters that
``those who abandon their people's rights are distancing themselves
from their people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the attention on Yassin has boosted Hamas' standing, both at
home and abroad. Usually supported by no more than 10 percent of
the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, the most recent poll
taken by a Jerusalem-based Palestinian think tank shows that about
one of every four Palestinians now sympathizes with Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yassin's visits are definitely a challenge to the Palestinian
Authority,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst
who directs the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center. ``It
reflects the growing weight of the Hamas here and the displeasure
with the peace process in the Arab world.``
</P>
<P>
   Some of the countries that received Yassin were likely motivated
by animosity toward Arafat. There is little good will from Syrian
President Hafez Assad toward the Palestinian leader. And Kuwait's
princes still have not forgiven Arafat for supporting Iraq during
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But the motivation of other states that receive Yassin is far
more complex. Most of the leaders who welcomed Yassin are battling
Islamic fundamentalist opposition groups. The strategy in these
countries has been to appease and thereby contain them. One theory
is that they are doing the same with Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a revolutionary organization or a terrorist organization
starts to be part of regional politics, it cannot continue to be
revolutionary,'' said Khatib, the Palestinian political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   For Hamas to play along may signal the beginning of the
organization's slow transformation from a militant movement
responsible for suicide bombings to an open political party, said
Khatib.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that Hamas is trying to become a political player in
the region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Hamas is usually an accurate barometer for
Palestinian support for the peace process. When negotiations go
well, support for Hamas plummets. Conversely, when negotiations
fail, as they have done for 15 months, support for Hamas increases.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Hamas is reading both the newfound support in the
Palestinian street, and the grand welcomes Yassin has received
abroad, as approval for its strategy of violent resistance rather
than a measure of popular displeasure with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamas is pleased,'' said Ismail Abu Shanab, one of the Hamas
leaders in Gaza. ``Sheikh Ahmed Yassin is a symbol of resistance
and holy war.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been invited by those countries,'' he said. ``This
means they give support and legitimacy to this path, which is the
only path that can stop Netanyahu's aggression and bring back
stolen Arab land.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's midnight on a Saturday and a battle is on in the
Bronx. Tammy Keo, 12, is squared against Marcos Oquendo, 19.
Despite the David-and-Goliath mismatch _ Tammy, known as Lady Love
Bug, stands 4 foot 10, and Oquendo, known as 2 Sweet, is 6 foot 2 _
there's no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   The young challenger stuffs her ponytails under a knitted cap
and reties the fat shoelaces of her Adidas sneakers. Her opponent
tucks his sleeveless jersey into his boxers. Both are ready for the
three-minute round before 300 spectators at the Hunt's Point
Community Center. In this arena, skill isn't determined by one's
left hook or right jab. The rules are as they've always been: May
the fanciest footwork win.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes were common 15 years ago, when no street corner or
subway platform was safe from bandanna-wearing breakdancers and
their behemoth boom boxes. The pulsating street theater indigenous
to New York and its spoken accompaniment _ rap _ were at the
forefront of the cultural flowering called hip-hop. Hollywood made
movies about breakdancing, dancers performed at the White House and
the sky seemed the limit.
</P>
<P>
   But as rap grew into a major influence on pop culture,
breakdancing was left in the dust. Until now, when breakdancers are
once again performing head spins and other gyrations in music
videos, clubs and arenas, often to the beat of ``old school'' rap
by the likes of Erik B and Rakim and cheered on by audiences in
retro styles like track suits. The return seems an inner-city
counterpart to the 1980s nostalgia on view in recent hit films like
``The Wedding Singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Breakdancers have popped up recently in videos for Mariah
Carey's ``The Roof,'' Madonna's ``Ray of Light'' and Jason Nevin's
remake of Run-DMC's 1983 classic ``It's Like That.'' Under the
slogan ``Khakis Groove,'' the Gap has a commercial featuring
multiracial breakdancing couples. B-boys _ or breakdance boys _
have been spotted in Coca-Cola and Sprite advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are definitely waking back up to it,'' said
Rocafella, 26, a B-girl who tours with ``Jam on the Groove,'' a
musical production sponsored by Calvin Klein.
</P>
<P>
   When Bam, a well-known dancer, and Fred Berry, who played the
portly Rerun on the 1970s sitcom ``What's Happening!,'' recently
offered classes at a dance studio in Manhattan, they had a waiting
list before the class started.
</P>
<P>
   The art form has its roots in African dance and capoeira, an
Afro-Brazilian martial art, but it originated in the black and
Hispanic communities of the Bronx during the mid-'70s. DJ's would
spin soul and funk hits and extend the ``break'' (the percussion
section of the song). A spectator might grab the microphone and
improvise a rhyme, while others danced. Over time, dance partners
evolved into alliances or ``crews,'' and competitions or
``battles'' became the highlight of barbecues and block parties.
</P>
<P>
   Breakdancing, along with tagging (graffiti writing), emceeing
and deejaying _ the pillars of hip-hop culture _ grew into a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``B-boying, that was my way of being loud, that was my voice,''
said Crazy Legs, 32, president of the Rock Steady Crew, an elite
group of about 60 dancers. He has been dancing for 21 years and
claims to have invented the back spin, the windmill and the 1990.
``We weren't in it for the money, it was all about being a ghetto
celebrity,'' he said. ``We didn't have the means for sports so we
created our own ghetto games.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 1987 the ghetto game that had turned into an
international fad had been milked for every backspin it was worth.
``The media really exploited breakdancing and made people sick of
it,'' Rocafella said.
</P>
<P>
   It never disappeared entirely _ ``it just went back
underground,'' she said. Now, around the city at clubs like Vinyl
and Soundlab, B-boys and B-girls with street names like Crazy Boy
and Kid Flex are diving onto hardwood floors and twisting
themselves into complex contortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing is like a drug,'' said 2 Sweet, a student from the
Lower East Side. ``When I'm out there in the middle of the floor I
zone out and feel like I'm the only one in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   One source of the comeback is Britain's rave scene. At the huge
parties, young people started breakdancing to the low-on-lyrics,
heavy-on-the-bass beats of techno, drum-'n'-bass and house music.
``A lot of people dance to house because it sounds like old break
beats,'' explained K-Mel, 18, a dancer from the Bronx. Raves
crossed the Atlantic in the early '90s and landed in American
suburbs, introducing many white youth to breakdancing.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike inner-city breakdancers _ who tend to wear the
traditional uniform of ``swooshies'' (Adidas warm-up suits),
shell-top sneakers and Kangol hats, and to affiliate themselves
with crews _ ravers are more likely to be found with body piercings
and wide-leg jeans. Because dancing at raves is fueled by drugs
like Ecstasy instead of the inner-city incentive of gaining street
fame, it lacks the competitive spirit that dominates its urban
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   The retro-'80s vibe that is behind breakdancing's return in the
inner city can be traced back in part to a nostalgia for a more
innocent period of hip-hop. There is a backlash against the
excessive violence and materialism that has been extolled by
gangsta rap for the last decade, culminating in the murders of
Tupak Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. B-boys and B-girls say that their
dance style represents a return to times when people could compete
and live to tell about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the day we had our Kangol hats, Lee jeans and
two-finger rings, it was different,'' said Fever, 27, a B-boy from
Seattle. ``Nobody was following the next man. It was all about
originality in your clothes, style and moves. We've got to get back
to that before it's gone.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some habits are hard to break. From the late
1960s to the early 1990s, the Grateful Dead were on the road almost
every year, playing down-home improvisational rock for twirling,
tie-dyed Dead Heads.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the death of Jerry Garcia, his fellow members
of the Grateful Dead are back together as the core of a new band,
the Other Ones, that sets out to resurrect and extend the Dead's
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Jerry would want us to play, not to sit around
and mourn forever,'' said band percussionist Mickey Hart in a
backstage interview. ``We all have enough money in the bank so we
don't have to do this. But it's in our veins, and it still seems
like a natural thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The band made a triumphant hometown debut in San Francisco on
Thursday night at the Warfield Theater for a sold-out house of
2,400 people who arrived with loyal but guarded expectations and
left the concert jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones include Hart, Bob Weir on guitar and Phil Lesh on
bass, Dead members since the 1960s, and Bruce Hornsby on keyboards,
who toured with the Dead in the 1990s. Mark Karan and Steve Kimock
on guitars, Dave Ellis on saxophones and John Molo on drums
complete the new band. Drummer Bill Kreutzmann, the other surviving
founder of the Dead, has retired.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the new band is to headline the third Furthur
Festival, an annual package tour of Dead-related bands. It goes to
the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on June 29
and the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., on June 30. Hart said
the Other Ones had made no plans beyond the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones' debut was a benefit, raising more than $200,000
for the Rain Forest Action Network. Like a smaller-scale version of
the scene outside the Dead's last stadium tours, gray-bearded fans
from the 1960s and college students filed in while long-haired fans
stood outside with index fingers held up, hoping for a miraculous
last-minute ticket. ``It's like church,'' said Robyn Caywood, a
25-year-old fan who got a seat. ``And the music just pulls you like
puppet strings.''
</P>
<P>
   For their debut, the Other Ones had two things that the Grateful
Dead did not: nearly a month of daily rehearsals (including a
change of guitarist in the last week) and a set list that was
chosen before the band appeared onstage. But like the Dead, the
Other Ones rely on the chemistry of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The band's first few songs were tentative, with the two new
guitarists sounding unduly reticent; recent material like ``Easy
Answers'' (which appears on Rob Wasserman's album ``Trios'')
struggled to find a groove. But with the old blues ``Going Down the
Road Feeling Bad'' the music opened up, and suddenly the Other Ones
recaptured the effervescence of the Dead in its glory days.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead brought the security of American roots music _ country,
blues, Appalachian music, rhythm-and-blues, even touches of Latin
rhythm _ to psychedelic wanderings; they made good-timey excursions
out of songs haunted by death and uncertainty. The two sets by the
Other Ones became both a reminder of what the Dead accomplished and
a glimpse of new prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The band still plays some Garcia songs, and it kept many of the
Dead's old arrangements. Some were familiar from the Dead's stadium
era in the 1980s and '90s; others, like the brilliant, elaborately
constructed ``St. Stephen,'' had dropped out of the repertory. And
with Hornsby and Ellis, the music could detour into jazz harmonies
and swinging rhythms that the Dead rarely attempted. ``Space,'' a
free-form jam, wandered from scintillating Minimalistic patterns to
a new song, ``Banyan Tree'' (with lyrics by the Dead's longtime
collaborator Robert Hunter), to quick quotes of the Miles Davis
tune ``So What.''
</P>
<P>
   Molo has taken up Kreutzmann's role as the steady timekeeper
while Hart knocks out accents and cross-rhythms on an international
assortment of instruments. Hart's fondness for odd meters turned up
in a new arrangement of ``Fire on the Mountain'' and in a 1960s
Dead song, ``The Eleven'' (which is in 11/4 time).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, Karan and Kimock's guitars echo the Garcia
sound, bell-toned and perpetually inquiring; Garcia's style is
embedded in the Dead's songs.
</P>
<P>
   The two guitarists revived tell-tale Garcia phrases, like his
calmly ambling blues lines, his floating downward slides and his
light-fingered bluegrass runs. But with two lead guitarists (and
sometimes three when Weir switches from rhythm guitar to lead), the
Other Ones can toss around more bits of melody. They grew more
playful as the sets progressed, teasing each other with overlapping
scales or little tendrils of tunes like ``Scarlet Begonias'' and
``China Cat Sunflower.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than three hours of music, the Other Ones celebrated the
Dead with the Dead's own limber, open-ended curiosity, bolstered by
the kind of thorough practice and rejuvenated energy that the
latter-day Dead had lost.
</P>
<P>
   There was nostalgia in hearing the reconstituted band, but there
was also a renewed sense of possibility. As Weir sang in ``The
Eleven,'' ``This is the season of what now?''

CRASH INVESTIGATORS FOCUS ON BROKEN WHEEL; DEATH TOLL STANDS AT
96 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany _ With rescue efforts virtually ended after
Germany's worst rail crash in more than 50 years, officials said
Friday that the death toll stood at 96. The accident was so
gruesome that most of the bodies were mutilated beyond
identification.
</P>
<P>
   The train, Inter-City-Express 884, slammed into a
steel-reinforced concrete overpass at 125 mph on Wednesday in the
northern German town of Eschede. Rescue officials said Friday that
there was an increasing belief among investigators that a broken
wheel flung the train from the tracks as it passed over a switch
just before it hit the road overpass.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday investigators found damage to the tracks about
three and a half miles south of the crash, suggesting that the
wheel broke at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue officials in Eschede said Friday that only 19 of the dead
had been formally identified. Even traditional methods of
identification, like using dental records, were proving impossible
because of extensive head injuries. Police say they want to spare
relatives from seeing the mangled bodies until authorities are sure
of their identities.
</P>
<P>
   German authorities withdrew 60 of the 104 high-speed
Inter-City-Express trains from service Thursday so that they could
be inspected for fatigue in their undercarriages. Ten of them
returned to service Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal of the trains left Germany's vaunted rail service
in chaos, with some trains canceled altogether and others facing
delays. German Rail took out full-page advertisements in newspapers
Friday saying, ``We mourn the dead in Eschede and we wish to extend
our most profound sympathies to the injured and relatives of the
victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Hamburg _ the scheduled destination of Inter-City
884 from Munich _ and in Hanover, 35 miles south of the wreck,
placed flowers next to the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Veit Steinle, a spokesman for the Transport Ministry in Bonn,
said that investigators had discovered debris along the track
before the overpass and that there was evidence that the train had
finally swayed out of control some 300 yards before Eschede.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said it could take weeks or months before an
official inquiry reported on the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Wurster, a rail expert from Technical University in
Berlin, told German television that the failure in the wheel was
``completely inexplicable'' because the rolling-gear of the
Inter-City-Express trains is routinely checked by ultrasound
examination every four days. The stricken train had been inspected
the day before it crashed, railway officials said. &QL;

PROBLEMS IN RUSSIA'S OIL INDUSTRY ADD TO TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 7)  
(lb) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Political gyrations, economic turmoil, crashing stock markets,
embattled currency, collapsing tax revenue. In such troubled times,
Russia might be forgiven for leaning hard on the one thing it can
count on: oil and natural-gas exports, paid for in dollars. Some
investors worry that a sorely pressed government might flood the
already glutted world oil market and depress prices further.
</P>
<P>
   So why doesn't Moscow just turn up the spigot to solve its
economic and financial problems?
</P>
<P>
   ``They wish they could, but they can't,'' said Ann-Louise
Hittle, who follows oil markets as a director of Cambridge Energy
Associates, a consulting group in Boston. ``They're producing as
much as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from ramping up production, the Russian oil industry has had
to cut output by about 60,000 barrels a day because low prices _
about $11 a barrel for Russian exports, down from $18 a year ago _
and high production costs have made some wells uneconomical, Ms.
Hittle said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer, after Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela, with a big domestic industry and vast
reserves, and it has a long history of using its output for its own
political and economic purposes, ignoring the efforts of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries _ of which it is not
a member _ to manage world supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Russia's ability to squeeze more income from oil
depends on whether OPEC can agree to raise prices by cutting
production at its next meeting, later this month in Vienna,
Austria. Russia plans to send a representative to the meeting, and
is considering joining OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the meeting, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela agreed on
Thursday with Mexico, which is not a member, to cut their
production by 450,000 barrels a day. Those three nations led a
coalition that managed to win agreement for production cuts last
March, temporarily buoying prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's energy minister, Sergei Generalov, has said Russia
cannot help OPEC by making further cuts of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to raise cash, the government has sought to privatize
some of the industry. But prices for domestic oil companies proved
just as disappointing as the price of oil. The government tried to
get $2.1 billion for RAO Rosneft, a huge energy company, but found
no interested buyers; it recently had to drop the asking price to
$1.6 billion to attract bids.
</P>
<P>
   Russian oil-industry executives, who were flexing political
muscles at home and in neighboring nations a year or two ago when
oil fetched $18 to $20 a barrel, are on the defensive, pleading for
government help with tax cuts and lower pipeline fees.
</P>
<P>
   They are in a bind. Antiquated equipment at the wellhead makes
trimming production a one-way proposition at many wells; once they
are shut down, it would be very expensive to restart them. But at
current oil prices, many of the same wells lose money on every
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Unless OPEC and other major producers can agree to make another
production cut, like one agreed upon in March, many analysts say
oil prices may fall further, adding to the burdens of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Russia exports about 25 percent of its output of about 6.2
million barrels a day, yielding 45 percent of the country's
foreign-currency income. Production peaked in 1988, when most
Eastern European countries were still captive customers, at 11.4
million barrels a day, but in the collapse of communism the next
year, output fell by nearly half.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Domestic energy prices in Russia are still somewhat shielded
from world market trends, so the Russian oil industry has begun
looking more toward domestic markets to help ride out the downturn.
But ruble sales don't help refill government coffers with hard
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ebel, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a research group in Washington, said Russian
production increased slightly last year, mostly because of
increasing investment by Western oil companies. But a lack of legal
guarantees for foreigners has restricted the amounts that Western
companies have been willing to commit to expand production further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely that oil production in Russia will increase
noticeably over the near term,'' Ebel said. ``They have to make it
attractive for Western companies to come in and invest.'' And
without such investment, he said: ``Russia is just about at its
limit of what it can export. The pipelines are basically full.''

THE GRAN SCENA OPERA COMPANY: A GALA OF OPERA TRANSFORMED INTO
COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (js)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nothing in the classical music world offers as much
room for parody as opera. The repertory itself, packed as it is
with implausible plots and peculiar characters, offers ample
material, and there is even more to skewer in the practical side of
the business, where the grandiose egos of divas, directors and
conductors _ to say nothing of the fervent partisanship of their
fans _ can be mistaken for parody by dispassionate outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Turning these quirks into true comedy demands a deep knowledge
and a sincere love of the form as well as a high level of
musicianship and vocal agility. One can only parody great
performers, after all, if one can approximate their strengths while
exaggerating their weaknesses. The Gran Scena Opera Company _ a
troupe of male singers who dress and act as divas, sing in falsetto
and perform under comic stage names (Gabriella
Tonnoziti-Casseruola, for example) _ has made a specialty of this
specialized brand of comedy since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The group performed at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday evening for
an audience that was enthusiastic enough to make an actual diva
jealous.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Scena's preferred format is that of the opera gala, the
regularly televised affairs in which starry singers trot out for
arias and scenes from diverse operas. Joe Simmons, as Sylvia Bills
(``America's most beloved retired diva,'' with mannerisms uncannily
like those of Beverly Sills), provided introductions and commentary
between selections, in a show written by the group's founder and
artistic director, Ira Siff.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about Those Three Tenors,'' Ms. Bills began, stifling a
yawn. ``Or I should say Four Tenors _ we musn't forget Aretha,''
she added, referring to Aretha Franklin's substitution for Luciano
Pavarotti at the Grammy Awards. From there, she and the other
performers took few prisoners. Barbs were aimed with extraordinary
precision at the Met, operatic crossover recordings, the Alagnas,
Franco Zeffirelli's stagings, Cecilia Bartoli (``last year she was
arrested on stage for mugging,'' Ms. Bills said) and Montserrat
Caballe, as well as Wagner and Verdi.
</P>
<P>
   The musical performances often relied on slapstick, which wore
thin by the end of the three-hour show. But when it worked, it was
brilliant. In a version of the ``Ride of the Valkyries,'' the
singers ambled and posed and pointed their spears enigmatically, in
the style of the Met's current production, eventually abandoning
their forced sobriety to upstage one another and exchange Nazi
salutes. Keith Jurosko's impersonation of an aging diva in a duet
from ``La Boheme'' was stunning, and there were some wonderful
moments in Siff's centerpiece as the Russian diva Vera
Galupe-Borszkh, a send-up of the second act of ``Tosca.''
</P>
<P>
   Much sport was made of the vocal weaknesses one hears on the
opera stage, but now and then there was some fine singing as well.
Most notably Kyle Church Cheseborough, as Kavatina Turner, produced
a beautifully rounded soprano timbre in a duet from ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Sisley, as Maestro Lorenzo Costalotta-Denaro, provided
suitably dramatic accompaniments at the piano.

REMEMBERING 1898, A TURNING POINT IN AMERICAN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain, Philippines)  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY EGAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Centennials usually call for a lot of clanking celebration, a
period souvenir or two and perhaps some minor historical
revisionism. The 1898 observation, now under way in Spain, Cuba,
the Philippines and the United States, is a tough one. So much was
set in motion that it is difficult to contemplate how we got from
there to here.
</P>
<P>
   Four months of fighting dispatched the remnants of a Spanish
empire dating to the landing of Columbus and gave rise to an
American empire and century, with entanglements, entitlements and
expectations yet to be fully sorted out.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of books, parades, symposiums and museum shows are
trying to push 1898 from the fringes of public awareness. New York
has eight exhibitions and programs this year, the biggest of which
is probably ``A War in Perspective, 1898-1998: Public Appeals,
Memory, and the Spanish-American Conflict,'' running through Aug.
29 at the New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of historians, whether second-guessers or those in
the academic mainstream, is that 1898 marked the death of one age
and the start of another.
</P>
<P>
   ``During 12 months of rich confusion, wild contradiction and
violent change, the United States of 1898 advanced from being
viewed as a country of sharp-dealing businessmen with a second-rate
military and little international influence to acknowledgment as a
respected member of the imperialists' club,'' David Traxel writes
in ``1898: The Birth of the American Century,'' just published by
Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the United States at the start of that year. Geronimo
had surrendered, but his haunts of New Mexico and Arizona were
still territories and considered foreign land to many on the East
Coast. Americans commuted to work by bicycle. Though the shift from
rural to urban was well under way, the United States still thought
of itself as a nation of farmers and of Anglo-Saxons. Foreign wars
were for Europeans, the detested monarchs of the Old World.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, the United States would have an empire
that reached 6,000 miles across the Pacific and would be accepting
lessons from the British in how to live with a ``white man's
burden,'' in Rudyard Kipling's words. In less than 20 years the
nation would be deeply involved in a horrific global war in the
name of making the world safe for American-style democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A ``deluge of wonders,'' as one observer put it, many from the
brain of Thomas Alva Edison, were about to transform society. A
deluge of immigrants was already at hand. The Irish had come in
waves since the famine of the early 1850s, followed by Italians,
Scandinavians, Germans, Greeks and Russians. The Chinese were first
drawn by California gold, then banned under various exclusion acts.
By 1898, half a million Jews, almost one-third of the Jewish
population of Europe, had moved to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The city strutted its new muscle. In 1898, by incorporating the
outer boroughs, New York City grew from 39 square miles to 320,
becoming the second biggest metropolis in the world, with a
population of 3.4 million. Only London was bigger.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the United States had learned to shop, passing
Britain as the world's leading consumer society. With wealth,
unparalleled population growth, physical space and technology, all
it lacked was a place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   That would be taken care of in part by the mysterious explosion
of the battleship Maine in Havana harbor on the evening of Feb. 15,
1898, which killed 266 American servicemen. The ship was in Cuba
ostensibly to protect American interests while rebels tried to
remove the hand of Spain from the island. These rebels had been
depicted at first as modern-day Jeffersons and Washingtons.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish helped rescue nearly a hundred Americans from the
burning ship, but they were portrayed from the start as the
instigators. ``The Warship Maine Split in Two by an Enemy's Secret
Infernal Machine'' was one of the headlines in Hearst's Journal.
Pulitzer, now associated with the highest awards in journalism, was
not to be outdone. ``The whole country thrills with war fever,''
wrote Pulitzer's World, even providing a slogan in headline form:
``Remember the Maine! To Hell With Spain!''
</P>
<P>
   The daily journals, using cartoons and color to broad effect,
had gone from being ``beggar and blackmailer and became one of the
major industries of every little town,'' Traxel notes. New York had
15 dailies, the loudest of which were Joseph Pulitzer's World and
William Randolph Hearst's Journal. Yellow was the color of their
comics, but it became the pejorative term for bad journalism.
</P>
<P>
   It did not matter that there was little proof of Spanish
complicity in the explosion. Hearst, in perhaps his most famous
statement, told one of the illustrators he sent to Cuba, ``You
provide the pictures and I'll provide the war.'' One of the more
exhaustive studies of the explosion, the 1976 investigation by Adm.
Hyman Rickover, concluded that the sinking of the Maine was most
likely an accident, a fire in the ship's hold where gunpowder was
stored.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming serial propagandists for the Spanish-American War misses
a larger point, some scholars now believe. ``This was the age of
National Geographic, of the first film footage, of world fairs, and
so it was a time when the United States started to see the world as
being available for expansion,'' said Amy Kaplan, a professor of
literature and American studies at Mount Holyoke College who has
been writing and lecturing on the centennial. ``Expansion was
portrayed as an extension of American values, not as conquering
other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1875 to 1905, Britain added 5 million square miles to its
empire; France added 3 million. The United States stretched from
one ocean to the other, but it was for the first time without a
frontier. European expansion, long condemned, provided an excuse
for emulation. How the United States could go from condemning
European colonialism to trying to rule the 7,100 islands of the
distant Philippines is one of the driving questions.

 UNDATED: driving questions. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In declaring war on Spain, which had lost most of its vast
holdings in the Americas, the United States made much of the idea
that foreign powers should not be in the same hemisphere. One year
earlier, President McKinley had vowed that the country would not
engage in ``wars of conquest.'' Yet in this war an American
president sent troops outside the hemisphere for the first time.
Once this line was crossed, there would be no return.
</P>
<P>
   As for justification, one reason was purely military. A lot of
empires were prowling the oceans on the eve of the 20th century,
and the United States needed strategic position. But the
Spanish-American War also marked the start of a strain of American
foreign policy guided by crusader or missionary impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Why are we in the Philippines, asked Mark Twain, one of the few
strong antiwar voices, after it was clear that the United States
was going to stick around in the Pacific and not grant self-rule to
the Filipinos. ``To uplift and civilize and Christianize,'' was
McKinley's response.
</P>
<P>
   The war was remarkably short. A superior Navy smashed the
Spanish fleet in Manila Bay and off Santiago, Cuba. The ground war
in Cuba made Theodore Roosevelt, all of 40 years old, the most
popular man in the United States. He had resigned as assistant
secretary of the Navy to lead a volunteer unit, the Rough Riders,
who were certainly rough but did very little riding in Cuba. Their
battles were sharp, vicious crawls through jungle terrain in
killing heat.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt, by nearly all accounts, had an extraordinary sense of
his infallibility. Spanish bullets were chin music to him. Two
years later he was president, after the assassination of McKinley
at the start of his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of surrender, the United States took control of
Cuba, Puerto Rico and Guam and paid Spain $20 million for the
Philippines. The latter exchange completed the remarkable
acquisition of big pieces of the Spanish empire: 50 years earlier,
for $15 million, America had gained a third of Mexico after a brief
war.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender may have been hard on Spanish national
self-esteem, but it was also a positive turning point for a country
that had been in steep political decline. By a predominant view in
Spain, the country flourished artistically and intellectually
because it was finally free of the corrupting influences of its
empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that the centennial is much more important in
Spain, because real lessons were learned,'' said Alfonso Quiroz, a
professor of history at Baruch College and the CUNY Graduate Center
who is curator of both the New York Public Library exhibition and a
show at the New York Historical Society. ``The Spanish look back on
1898 as a moment of regeneration.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States held on to Cuba for four years and the
Philippines for nearly half a century, and has never relinquished
Guam or Puerto Rico. The Maine may be forgotten, but the waves from
that sinking have yet to flatten out. The American century started
with seven world powers and ends with one superpower. Whoever said
history does not turn on accidents?

TEXAS GOP MEETS WITH HOPES FOR HISTORIC GAINS IN NOVEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 7)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With grand plans for the fall election in mind,
state Republican stalwarts gather in Fort Worth this week to kick
off what they hope will be a historic year in Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   What once was unthinkable is now within reach for the Texas GOP:
a sweep of statewide elected offices, gaining control of the Texas
House for the first time in more than 120 years and keeping its
slim majority in the Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A key factor to winning is the popular and well-funded Gov.
George W. Bush, who is way ahead of Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Garry Mauro in the polls. Many Republicans are hoping
Bush will win big and help push other candidates into office.
</P>
<P>
   Those goals, if achieved, would be historic for the GOP in
Texas, which for decades has been a Democratic stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it all this year,'' says Robert Black, state party
spokesman. ``We've never had this kind of opportunity before.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hope to avoid the controversy that overshadowed the
1996 convention in San Antonio, when some delegates tried to bar
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison from being a delegate to the
national convention because they didn't believe her anti-abortion
stand was strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   But when some 13,000 people assemble in one place, the potential
for internal squabbles exists. The convention's main sessions are
on Friday and Saturday, though committee meetings begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, a gay group, have
complained that, again, they had been denied the chance to have a
booth at the event.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Labinski, the Texas group's president, says the religious
right that controls the party in Texas was behind the decision.
While national Republicans support the ``big-tent'' approach, he
says, state GOP officials are interested in ``party purification.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past decade, social conservatives have gained control
of the party in Texas. But they didn't fare well in the spring
primaries when several statewide candidates aligned with the
Christian right lost their races.
</P>
<P>
   Labinski says he believes the religious right's clout is
shrinking across the nation, and he sees Texas as its ``last
bastion'' of real power.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled speakers include Hutchison, U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm and
Bush, who will give the keynote speech Friday.

 &HT;     U.S. OFFICIALS: RESPONSE TO FIRES RAGING IN MEXICO NEEDS ``FULL
ASSESSMENT''
 &HT;     By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After touring Mexico's devastating forest fires,
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and Agency for
International Development Director Brian Atwood said a ``full
assessment'' will be done of how the two countries can better and
more quickly respond to such a binational crisis in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disaster in Mexico has to be the most serious of its kind
we have seen anywhere in the world,'' Atwood said Friday, comparing
the fires in southern Mexico to the enormous blazes in Indonesia
that consumed rainforests.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood and Glickman flew Thursday over the blazes in Mexico's
Chiapas state that will probably not be fully extinguished until
the country receives heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain national disasters are transnational now. This is one
of them,'' said Glickman, who also spoke at a press conference here
with U.S. correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood added: ``We are prepared now to look at this problem and
see it as an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton dispatched Atwood and Glickman to Mexico this
week to observe the fires, which have sent smoke wafting into Texas
and as far north as Wisconsin. About $8 million worth in U.S. aid
was sent to Mexico after Texas senators began to complain about
severe air pollution in Texas caused by the fires beginning in
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one American firefighters, five U.S. helicopters and
thousands of pieces of U.S. firefighting equipment began to arrive
in Mexico on May 25.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. technical experts and equipment are concentrated in
Chiapas, where Mexican firefighters are battling fires in the
Chimalapas reserve _ North America's most diverse rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican environmentalists have criticized their government for
not being prepared to deal with forest fires during a year of
drought, and for failing to ask for international help sooner.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States and Mexico have a relationship dating
back 30 years that includes training of firefighters, the countries
do not have a plan for mutual aid in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the two countries could change this, Atwood said, ``The
first thing we want to do is assess what we did right and what we
did wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the fires will probably be discussed at a binational
meeting between President Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo next week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Officials may announce then how the United States intends to
help Mexico reforest burned areas. Especially hard-hit is the
Chimalapas reserve, a stop for many migratory birds for the United
States and home to hundreds of the world's most endangered plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we worry about greatly is the bio-diversity
that is being lost here,'' Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that continued cooperation is needed to prepare for
more disasters attributed to El Nino. Next year, Atwood said, the
weather phenomenon could present reverse weather patterns, causing
flooding in Mexico and other regions hit by drought and fire this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman defended Mexico's attempts to control its forest fires,
which began last January and have become the worst in more than
half a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are impossible fires,'' Glickman said, blaming slow
progress on Mexico's drought and the steep, remote terrain of the
Chimalapas forest.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said an assessment of this year's forest-fire crisis
would also include the experience of Central American countries,
where U.S. aid was also sent to help fight similar blazes.
</P>
<P>
   Also up for review, the two U.S. officials said, are various
countries' attempts to reduce the practice of slash-and-burn
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, government officials blamed the traditional practice
for sparking many of this year's forest fires. Peasant groups in
Mexico reacted angrily to the charges, arguing that many farmers
are so poor they have little alternative to the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, burning land in preparation for planting is controlled
by farmers, who rely on spring rains to help extinguish flames.
This year, however, many of the fires raged out of control because
of the extreme heat and lack of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman, who met with Mexico's Minister of Agriculture while
here, agreed that poverty is the main culprit for slash-and-burn
farming that is devouring forests and causing fires that pollute
air elsewhere around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just tell farmers out in the middle of a very poor
area, `I'm sorry, you can't do this anymore. It is bad for the air
quality in the rest of the world.' They would look at you like
you're nuts,'' Glickman said.

 &HT;    Late Night Magic
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 8: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They don't call former basketball star Earvin Johnson ``Magic''
for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   He's won five NBA championship rings. He's silenced critics who
said his movie theaters in Atlanta, Houston and Los Angeles would
bomb. He's even beaten oddsmakers predicting he'd be dead by now,
nearly seven years after announcing he has the virus that causes
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But if Johnson hopes to slam dunk his new syndicated late-night
talk show, ``The Magic Hour,'' which debuts tonight, he might need
a new nickname.
</P>
<P>
   How about ``Miracle''?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't put the time and effort that I need to put into the
show, I will fall and fall fast,'' Johnson has said.
</P>
<P>
   At least give the guy points for honesty. Johnson knows that it
will take more than his mile-wide grin and slick ``show time''
moves for his show to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic Hour'' is the latest celebrity-driven talker in the
late-night sweepstakes, a woeful lottery littered with the battered
egos of those who've failed: Chevy Chase, Dennis Miller, Whoopi
Goldberg, Lauren Hutton, Pat Sajak, Rick ``Disco Duck'' Dees and,
most recently, Keenen Ivory Wayans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've watched those shows and we've learned a lot,'' says
Geovanni Brewer, one of the producers of ``The Magic Hour.'' ``We
don't plan on making those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Wayans' canceled show and Sinbad's barely breathing
``Vibe,'' which targets younger, urban and minority viewers, ``The
Magic Hour'' wants an audience that's more mainstream. Johnson is
shooting for the same crowd who watched his late-night idol, Johnny
Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Since Johnson's no Carson, the show's producers scrapped the
traditional opening monologue. Instead, the rookie host will get an
assist from sidekick Craig Shoemaker, a little-known stand-up comic
who'll do ``bits'' with Johnson at the top of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Other comedians have been hired to perform pre-taped sketches,
some including Johnson as various characters.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing a gimmick from Carol Burnett's long-running variety
show and banking on Johnson's ``aw shucks'' charm, he'll also do an
unrehearsed Q&AMP;A segment with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer says no subject will be off-limits and that Johnson
expects questions about the sexual recklessness that almost cost
him his career _ and his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody wants to ask him about that, he won't be shy to
respond, but it's not that type of show,'' she says. ``This is
going to be purely entertainment, a feel-good show.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, won't be grilling his opening week guests,
which include Harrison Ford and Peta Wilson on Tuesday; Arsenio
Hall, Gloria Estefan and Michael Douglas on Wednesday; Christine
Lahti and Kenny G on Thursday; and Gillian Anderson and Johnson's
former basketball coach, Pat Riley, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The show's house band will be fronted by Sheila E., a move
Johnson's spin doctors are touting _ incorrectly _ as a late night
first. (Wayans had an ``all-girl'' band. It still didn't help).
</P>
<P>
   Sheila E., a former Prince protege and daughter of rock pioneer
Peter ``Coke'' Escovedo, is one of the world's best percussionists
and will be joined by her brother Peter, also an accomplished
musician.
</P>
<P>
   A legendary stickler for preparation when he was playing
basketball, Johnson has also spent months doing rehearsal shows,
and taking lessons from a voice and interviewing coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relax and make a space, like it's your home,'' Johnson said
recently about the cozy ambience his handlers want him to create on
the set.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is also getting pointers from Jay Leno, whom his show
competes against in several key markets, and Hall, a buddy and
former gabmaster.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds great on paper. But late-night talk shows aren't
seen on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Steele, senior vice-president for Zenith Media, a New
York consulting firm, was impressed by Johnson during a
presentation he made to promote the show to advertisers. But she
has her doubts the show will last beyond its initial 13-week run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very charismatic, and sweet and likable, and he's turned
his adversity into a higher level of celebrity,'' Steele says .
``All of that is good for initial audience curiosity, but the show
itself will have to be even better (than other late night shows) if
it's going to last.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the show is an air ball or a swish will be up to the man
whose been pulling surprises out of his trick bag for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally when the Lakers blew it, Magic blew it,'' Johnson
says. ``That's what went along with the title of being a leader.
With this show I just think we're going to be a winner. I feel
we're going to be a winner.''

 &HT;    With HIV controlled, `retiree' staying busy
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 8: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost seven years ago, Magic Johnson faced a battery of cameras
and announced his retirement from the NBA ``because of the HIV
virus I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Today he is remarkably robust by any definition of good health,
thanks to drugs that have been so successful that they have reduced
the virus to levels that cannot be detected. His wife and three
children are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's new TV show, ``The Magic Hour,'' is just one aspect of
a busy life:
</P>
<P>
   -- HIS HEALTH: While by no means cured, he owes the appearance
of remarkable health to a Spartan lifestyle and modern medicine.
Like many AIDS patients on these new medications, he takes a
combination of three drugs, one a protease inhibitor.Side effects
can include nausea, vomiting, headaches, backaches or
gastrointestinal problems. The drugs are expensive, costing $12,000
to $15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   -- HIS MOVIE THEATERS: He's a partner in a joint venture with
Sony Theaters in Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta, with expansion
plans for nine more cities. In Atlanta, where he already has one
multiplex theater at Greenbriar Mall, the financing plans for a
second one, in south DeKalb County, drew criticism because of
concerns that public money would be used. But the plan, which was
approved by the DeKalb County Commission and will be implemented
through the DeKalb County Development Authority, provides financing
and interest rate incentives and uses funds from private investors.
</P>
<P>
   -- OTHER BUSINESS INTERESTS: Johnson recently became Starbucks'
first joint-venture partner, with a location in Los Angeles. He has
a joint venture with TGI Friday's, with plans to open restaurants
near his theaters. He also has formed California Urban Investment
Partners with the California Public Employees' Retirement System,
investing in commercial real estate. And he represents American
Express and Adolph Coors in TV ads. Recently, he joined Janet
Jackson and record industry executive Jheryl Busby in buying a
majority stake in Founders National Bank, California's only African
American-owned bank.

BEANBALL WAR LIKELY TO BRING PENALTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ American League president Gene Budig will take a
break from his usual regimen of signing baseballs and getting into
ballparks for free to hand out enormous suspensions, fines and
other spankings to both the Kansas City Royals and Anaheim Angels
for their beanball war.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Another opportunity missed.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, the teams met the other night and got
into a glorious old-timey cat fight, the kind they used to have in
the game's golden era, when men were men and had big knots on their
heads from strategically aimed fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   The spark was Kansas City pitcher Jim Pittsley's drilling
Anaheim's Phil Nevin in the seventh inning, which led to Anaheim's
Rich DeLucia hitting Kansas City's Dean Palmer in the eighth, which
led to Anaheim's Darin Erstad taking one in the thigh from Kansas
City's Scott Service in the ninth, which led to Kansas City's Jose
Offerman being hit by Anaheim's Mike Holtz, which led to a second
bench-emptying brawl in which Kansas City's Felix Martinez
sucker-punched Anaheim's Frank Bolick and then ran from his
retribution.
</P>
<P>
   (The first brawl, in the seventh, was just the usual milling
around.)
</P>
<P>
   It was great theater no matter how you examined it _ five
beanballs, 12 ejections, and one career essentially self-immolated.
Martinez, who had already made a name for himself by kicking
Minnesota's Otis Nixon in the face back in April and breaking his
jaw, became the first major-leaguer since the old Giant pitcher
Ruben Gomez to perform the hit-and-run.
</P>
<P>
   In that one, Gomez hit Milwaukee's Joe Adcock with a pitch, and
when Adcock, who was built like the box the United Nations building
came in, went after him, Gomez ran in terror. He was never the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, after sucker-punching Bolick, a fairly inoffensive
backup infielder, saw several Angels chasing him and fled. Worse
yet, he fled unsuccessfully, being chased down and slugged by
pitcher Jack McDowell, who is on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's performance was so inspiring that his manager, Tony
Muser, dragged him off the field personally, and had him sent to
Triple-A Omaha on the next three-stop, two plane-change he could
book.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Another opportunity missed.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball could have used a really good feud among two of its
lesser-lit teams, just to help goose a few crowds. Better to have
the miscreants on tour than on house arrest. Everyone likes to see
a villain, just on the off-chance he might perform some new
villainy. After all, why should the 12,020 who watched the
Angels-Royals brawls have all the fun?
</P>
<P>
   This is a lesson professional wrestling learned years ago _ keep
the bad guys in plain sight. Do you think Strangler Lewis, or
Gorgeous George, or Nick Bockwinkel, or Hulk Hogan would have
become household words and living, breathing cash machines if they
were getting suspended every time they hit some guy with a chair, a
suitcase, a ring bell, or another fan?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. They'd go from city to city, finding some
fabulous new way to circumvent the rules of the sport just to keep
the customers interested, and more important, coming back. Today's
turnbuckle rope is tomorrow's metal suitcase, and the day after
that a forklift.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's deepest thinkers, though, believe that villainy
should be dealt with administratively rather than by the rules of
optometry (an eye for an eye, etc.), which is why the Royals and
Angels are about to feel the icy hand of Uncle Gene.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to come down hard on Martinez, who is safely
ensconced out of harm's way in eastern Nebraska, and on Muser and
Anaheim manager Terry Collins, who presumably kept the war at a
boil by sending the boys out to exchange fastballs to the soft
spots. Since neither of them play, Budig could throw the booklet at
them, look tough while impacting nothing.
</P>
<P>
   This is a mistake, and a serious one. Would it not be better to
hype the rematch in mid-July until the good people of Orange County
are at full froth, and then bring out both teams in spangles,
flowing robes, and ring announcers cranked up on Sudafed and
creatine?
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, wouldn't it make more sense to have both teams
lob thinly veiled threats through the media between now and then?
Couldn't the Angels just show a picture of Martinez on the Edison
Field scoreboard with the single legend, ``He's Coming''? Couldn't
the Royals start up an ad campaign aimed at Nevin: ``Ahh, He Had It
Coming''?
</P>
<P>
   The proper course seems obvious. In these turbulent times,
dignity gets you nothing; if it still had value, there wouldn't be
the X Games, or hoop earrings on power forwards.
</P>
<P>
   But no, Vice Admiral Budig will deal with the scofflaws himself,
with a justice as swift as it is sure. Men will be punished and
taught a lesson that will last with them for, uh, let's be
conservative and say 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Another opportunity lost.

REVIEWING THE NEW CHEVROLET PICKUPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, folks, here it comes _ the vehicle you've been waiting for
since Dodge introduced the new Ram in 1994 and Ford brought out the
new F-150 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors finally has caught up, and let me tell you, it
was worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet's all-new, full-size pickup begins rolling into
showrooms late this summer, the first remake of this vehicle since
the current generation, C/K, debuted for 1988.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, the truck takes the name Silverado, which in the past
was the designation for an uplevel trim package on the Chevy
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The GMC version, which will show up in the fall, has a new name,
too: the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   To answer the big question first: No, there are no radical
styling changes, such as those on the Ram and F-150.
</P>
<P>
   These trucks look different, make no mistake about that. But
they still look like General Motors full-size pickups; they're just
a bit rounder and have some updated trim, such as new headlights,
grilles and bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Ram and F-150, the big differences aren't in style,
they're in substance. These trucks are stronger, faster, bigger,
roomier, and more high-tech than before _ and they outclass the
competition in all of those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Take the back seat in the extended-cab models. It's a real seat,
with enough leg and knee room even for big folks. And the third
door, which comes on the passenger side, is larger than before (and
larger than those in the Dodge and Ford), which makes it easier to
get in and out.
</P>
<P>
   The new GM pickups' V-8 engines are more powerful than the
competitions', too, with no penalty in fuel economy. In fact, gas
mileage exceeds that of the Ram and matches or exceeds that of the
F-150 in almost all cases.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is vastly improved over the past C/K model and the
competition. The GM trucks stop 30 to 50 feet sooner than the
current models from 80 mph, thanks to large, four-wheel disc brakes
and a standard, four-wheel antilock system _ an exclusive feature
for this vehicle class.
</P>
<P>
   The body is stronger than before, cutting down significantly on
squeaks and rattles, and providing better occupant protection. The
frame is 23 percent stiffer than that of the current model,
creating a strong foundation, and the frame is welded together,
rather than riveted, to add to that strength.
</P>
<P>
   Even the cargo box's strength has been improved _ by 20 percent,
GM says. That's from the use of new high-strength, low-alloy steel.
</P>
<P>
   Reliability should be dramatically improved, too. The electrical
wiring, for instance, has five splices _ down from 92 in the
current model. Ford's F-150 has 118 wiring splices _ places where
something can go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There are some other great features about the new Chevy and GMC
trucks, too. They come with a coolant-loss protection system that
allows them to be driven up to 50 miles at 55 miles per hour with
no coolant in the radiator.
</P>
<P>
   Battery rundown protection is built in: It shuts down the
electrical accessories if any are inadvertently left on after the
engine has been turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Even the windows have been enlarged for greater visibility.
Brighter headlights and backup lights add to the visibility, and
the lights come on automatically when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Five engines are available on the Silverado and Sierra, a V-6
and four V-8s, including a turbodiesel. Here are the choices:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 4.3-liter V-6, with 200 horsepower and 260 foot-pounds of
torque.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Vortec 4.8-liter V-8, with 255 horsepower and 285
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Vortec 5.3-liter V-8, with 270 horsepower and 315
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Vortec 6.0-liter V-8, with 300 horsepower and 355
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   _ And a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V-8 with 215 horsepower and a
whopping 440 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Four transmissions are offered: regular and heavy-duty
five-speed manuals, and regular and heavy-duty four-speed
automatics.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Body and drive combinations are numerous: There are regular and
extended-cab models in short- and long-bed versions, both with the
standard bed and the step-side bed _ and in two- or four-wheel
drive. They also come with varying suspensions, from a smooth
on-road configuration to a tough off-road one.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevy trucks come in three trim levels: base, midlevel LS
and uplevel LT. Leather seats are available in Chevy and GMC
models, as are front bucket seats.
</P>
<P>
   I've driven most of the new trucks, in both the GMC and Chevy
versions, including the four-wheel-drive models with the sporty
Z-71 off-road package. I put one of those to the test on a rugged
dirt road from Oracle, Ariz., to the top of Mount Lemmon, near
Tucson, and found the optional AutoTrac automatic four-wheel-drive
system to be convenient for on- and off-road use. The system
engages the front axle whenever the rear wheels begin to spin,
automatically transferring power up front.
</P>
<P>
   These trucks also can be easily equipped for serious
trailer-towing. The Silverado's Z82 trailering package makes it the
most trailer-ready pickup on the market, Chevy says. It includes
plug-ins for trailer lights and electric brakes. And a tow/haul
mode in the automatic transmission changes the vehicle's shift
patterns to improve performance while towing. There's a button at
the end of the gearshift lever to switch the transmission into
towing mode.
</P>
<P>
   The cabs are comfortable, and there's room for six adults with
three abreast in front and rear. Road and wind noise are
surprisingly light for a truck.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't find anything bad to say about these trucks, except
that there is no four-door extended-cab model planned. That could
drive some sales to the Dodge Ram Quad-Cab. Overall performance,
however, outshines that of the Ford and the Dodge, and only the
Ram's V-10 engine has more power than the best of the Gms.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you concerned about the environment might like to know
that all of these trucks' plastic parts are recyclable. There are
44 pounds less scrap metal produced in the manufacture of each
truck that in the current model.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   1999 Chevrolet Silverado pickup
</P>
<P>
   The Package: Full-size, two- or three-door,
two-to-six-passenger, V-6 or V-8 powered, rear- or four-wheel-drive
pickup truck, an all-new replacement for the C/K models; also
available in GMC version, called the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights: Stronger, bigger, more powerful and more high-tech
than before; significant but not outrageous restyling; built well;
most powerful V-8 engines in the class; roomier than the
competition; lots of standard safety features, including four-wheel
antilock brakes as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>

United States can better respond to fires in the future. Mexico and
the United States have a fire-fighting training relationship that
dates back 30 years, but no agreement requiring mutual aid to deal
with emergencies. The U.S. officials said the United States should
help with reforestation efforts after Mexico's fires are put out
and contribute more to an international effort to reduce
slash-and-burn agriculture, which caused many of this year's forest
fires. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

<P>
   Early Friday, the winds at 35,000 feet over Long Island were
blowing from the west at nearly 225 mph. This extraordinary wind
was a reflection of an unusually large temperature contrast that is
only slowly dissipating across the nation. Earlier in the week,
surface temperatures varied by 60 degrees across a front in the
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, a cold front will sink southward to the Gulf of
Mexico, ending the heat wave in most of the South. Thunderstorms
will accompany both ends of the front from the Carolinas to the Rio
Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Record heat is still expected in Florida, though afternoon
thundershowers will bring temporary relief. Low pressure near the
Carolina coast will strengthen during the next 24 hours, directing
cooler, less humid air into the Southeast on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A pool of cold air at 15,000 feet over the Great Lakes and
Northeast will combine with mild air near the ground to cause a
rapid overturning of the lower atmosphere. The result will be
widespread afternoon clouds from the Appalachians to the northern
Plains. A few showers will develop in the higher terrain of New
England, near the Great Lakes and in the western Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure stretching from North Dakota to Oklahoma will
promote dry, but cool weather for much of the Plains. Winds
ascending the Rockies will keep plenty of clouds along the eastern
slopes of the mountains in New Mexico. A disturbance moving into
the West Coast will trigger afternoon thundershowers from the
northern Sierra and Cascades to the Bitterroots and Wasatch.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TOO WARM FOR THUNDER
</P>
<P>
   A blistering heat wave this past week sent the mercury over 110
degrees on a few days in central Texas. Despite the scorching heat
and sultry air mass, there were very few clouds and no
thunderstorms in the area. The reason for the lack of clouds could
be traced to reports from weather balloons launched over Texas.
Many indicated readings near freezing at 18,000 feet. Such warmth
is usually only found near hurricanes, which produce a great amount
of heat due to condensation. The hot air above Texas prevented
rising air currents from reaching a level where a cloud could
form. &QL;

     COLLECTIONS LAG AS FEDERAL DEBT BACKLOG
HITS $52 BILLION
 &HT;     By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;     c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite reforms of its debt-collection methods, the
federal government has a backlog of $52 billion in delinquent debts
that spurred bipartisan complaints Friday from members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two years of shilly-shallying,'' Rep. Steve Horn,
R-Calif., chairman of a House government oversight committee, told
a hearing where Treasury Department officials conceded that they
were lagging in implementing the Debt Collection Improvement Act of
1996.
</P>
<P>
   One of the act's key programs has cost $40 million and brought
in only $4 million in repayments.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new measure, Treasury has extended powers and
government-wide responsibility for collecting debts that are more
than 180 days tardy, including student loans, farm and business
loans, and federally backed home mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   However, federal agencies have been slow to refer their debts to
Treasury until they have become so old as to be deemed
uncollectible.
</P>
<P>
   The law also authorizes automatic deductions from federal
salaries or federal benefits for anyone who has a delinquent debt.
But little of this has taken effect, since it depends on developing
a new computer program. Treasury spent $5 million on such a
program, which proved defective and has now been abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Undersecretary John D. Hawke Jr. acknowledged that
``there is still much work to be done,'' although he said that the
effort is now moving on track. Still, he tried to lower
expectations that his department will ever collect much of the huge
portfolio of delinquent debt. He cited a study by the accounting
firm of Price Waterhouse predicting that the best possible result
would be $1 billion in receipts a year.

<P>
   The administration's current slow pace brought expressions of
frustration from Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are just not coming in,'' she said. ``The older
the debt gets, the harder it is to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like some common sense,'' she said. She called on the
administration to stop waiting around for computer programs and
said they should begin taking immediate steps, such as sending out
notices under U.S. Treasury letterhead to debtors as soon as they
are 60 days late in making a payment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Corp. sent an analysis to the
congressional oversight panel warning that unless the government
takes more care in granting loans, it will continue to make bad
debts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cases it cited was a company that defaulted on one
federal loan and then was given a second loan from the same agency,
which it also failed to pay. Later, a second federal agency awarded
the same company $200,000 in contracts.

MEDAL WINNERS HONOR GLORY OF THOSE SACRIFICED IN WAR

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Behind nearly every Medal of Honor is a
gripping story of the valor that earned this nation's highest
award. But in its own right, the Medal of Honor itself has a
storied past in its rise to what is now considered the world's most
prestigious decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving the medal is unique and it involves such intense
bravery in mortal combat, that two out of three recipients are
presented the medal posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Medal of Honor is a symbol of all that is noble, all that
is so good about the American society,'' said Professor Daniel
Gibran of Tennessee State University, who is considered one of the
nation's top experts on the Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   In additional to representing individualism and a person's
ability to bravely rise above his colleagues, the Medal of Honor
depicts the struggle of good over evil, the promulgation of
democracy. It is the most exalted of all medals awarded for combat
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other medal that represents so much in any other
country,'' Gibran said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the medal did not always stand for so much. Indeed, when it
was first awarded to soldiers in the Civil War after its
establishment by Congress in 1862, the criteria for receiving the
Medal of Honor, along with its design, were tinkered with more than
once. At one point, the Medal of Honor was being awarded to
soldiers from the Civil War who had managed to keep the Union flag
from touching the ground during a battle.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1918, Congress created other medals for bravery, such as
the distinguished service cross, in order to set apart the
significance of the Medal of Honor, Gibran said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, a board of five retired generals appointed by
the Secretary of War were assigned to investigate whether anyone
had been awarded the medal for something other than distinguished
conduct involving combat with an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criteria were changed because a lot of people got Medals
of Honor that were not truly deserving,'' Gibran said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Congress again changed the criteria, now requiring that
the medal only be given in cases where there are at least two
witnesses, including an officer. That requirement, according to
some of the 163 living recipients who are in Saratoga Springs this
week for their society's annual convention, has prevented many
soldiers and sailors not receiving the medal even though their acts
of bravery warranted the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of men in this country who would have
received their Medal of Honor had their been an officer present,''
said H. Woodrow Williams, a World War II recipient of the Medal of
Honor and national chaplain of the Medal of Honor Society.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 74, earned his medal on Feb. 23, 1945, while serving
as a corporal in the Marines on Iwo Jima. Covered by only four
riflemen, Williams volunteered to take out Japanese machine gun
posts that were preventing his division from advancing. In one
instance during his four-hour ordeal, Williams mounted a pillbox
and inserted the nozzle of his flamethrower through an air vent to
kill the occupants who were firing on his unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that are not printed in a person's citation is the
help that he got from his fellow Marines who enabled him to
survive,'' said Williams, one of about 100 Medal of Honor
recipients in Saratoga Springs this week for their annual
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Williams said two of the four riflemen in his unit who
were providing protection for him as he advanced to take out enemy
pill boxes were killed that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear this medal in their honor, not mine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams fits the profile of many of the living recipients,
according to Jeanne Kirk, head of the Naval Operations Awards and
Special Projects Branch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are very gracious and unassuming,'' she said.
``Some of them just can't handle this sudden celebrity-type thing
they find themselves in.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the acts of valor for which they have been awarded the
Medal of Honor, especially since World War II, will always be set
apart from even the most impressive acts of bravery that now fall
short of the medal's criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we're not going to go back to the way we did (award
the medal) during the Civil War,'' Kirk said, pointing out that
more Medals of Honor were given out for the Civil War than any
other conflict in U.S. history.

TRANSSEXUAL SUES SAN FRANCISCO POLICE OVER JOB REJECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A transsexual trying to join San Francisco's
police force has filed a $3 million discrimination claim with the
city after her appeal of a failed psychological test was turned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Cristiana Rivas, 38, received a notice from the Police
Department early this week that said an independent psychiatrist
upheld the department's findings that she was unfit for service and
was therefore disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivas is convinced she was discriminated against, citing her
own psychiatrists' favorable evaluation, an eight-year stint in the
National Guard and six years as a top-level employee with the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as proof of her
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why I was denied,'' said Rivas, who had already
passed the department's written, oral, lie-detector and physical
tests, along with a thorough background check. ``This was a
disappointment but it didn't shock me. The department obviously
doesn't understand transgender issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry and frustrated, Rivas filed the $3 million claim with
Department of Human Resources' Equal Employment Opportunity
Division on Thursday and is working with her lawyer to put together
a lawsuit if her claim is denied.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department said it could not comment on why Rivas was
disqualified but spokesman Sherman Ackerson said the department
does not discriminate based on transgender issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco's police department is probably the most
enlightened about these issues than any other departments around,''
said Ackerson, referring to two transgender officers already on the
force.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivas believes the department, or at least its
psychiatrists, are not comfortable dealing with transgender
applicants because they don't understand the issues. As an example,
Rivas said she was referred to as a cross-dresser during her final
evaluation with a city-affiliated psychiatrist who then asked her
to explain the difference between cross-dressing and transsexualism
when she objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was dealing with an idiot,'' Rivas said. ``The
department should have someone trained to deal with transsexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Having fully expected to join the academy earlier this year,
Rivas quit her clerical job at ATF in January and is now on the
verge of having to sell her home because she has no income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm responding with the only thing I can do,'' Rivas said.
``They leave me no other choice.''

RENO DECIDES NOT TO BLOCK ASSISTED-SUICIDE LAW IN OREGON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite President Clinton's opposition to
physician-assisted suicide, the federal government will not stand
in the way of doctors who help terminally ill patients in Oregon
kill themselves, Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno concluded after a nearly seven-month review that the
federal anti-drug statute does not bar doctors from prescribing
lethal medication for dying patients, as allowed under Oregon's
unique physician-assisted suicide law. Oregon's 1994 Death with
Dignity Act, which state voters upheld in a referendum last
November, permits doctors to prescribe lethal doses of medicine to
patients expected to live only six more months.
</P>
<P>
   Two doctors must share the dire prognosis and agree that the
patient is mentally competent to ask for medical assistance in
committing suicide. Doctors, while allowed to prescribe lethal
medications, are prohibited under the law from giving deadly
injections.
</P>
<P>
   At least three terminally ill patients in Oregon have committed
suicide with the help of a doctor since the law went into effect
Oct. 27. The Oregon Medical Association, prior to the department's
announcement, cautioned doctors in the state that prescribing
lethal doses might result in the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration revoking their licenses to prescribe medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in refusing to hinder the Oregon law, rejected the
position of DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine, who in November
said physicians prescribing lethal doses would be in violation of
the federal Controlled Substances Act and would run the risk of
losing their prescription licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that Congress, in the CSA, intended to
displace the states as the primary regulators of the medical
profession, or to override a state's determination as to what
constitutes legitimate medical practice in the absence of a federal
law prohibiting that practice,'' Reno said. ``Notwithstanding our
interpretation of the CSA as it applies to the Oregon act, it is
important to underscore that the president continues to maintain
his longstanding position against assisted suicide and federal
support for that procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who said he voted against the state's
law, praised Reno's decision as ``a victory for democracy.'' The
senator, who requested Reno's view of how the federal statute
relates to the state law, added, ``Oregon now faces a challenge to
redouble our efforts to make certain that Oregonians have better
options for health care at the end of their lives.``
</P>
<P>
   One such option is hospice care, which calls on doctors to treat
the pain experienced by the terminally ill without ending their
lives, said Lisa Veglahn, vice president of the Hospice Foundation
of America. ``Physician-assisted suicide would not have to be an
option if there was more education about hospice and other end-of
life-options,`` such as palliative care, she said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Compassion in Dying, a patients' rights group, hailed
Reno's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of this country are not about to let DEA
bureaucrats or politicians inside the beltway (that surrounds
Washington) take away their right to a peaceful death on their own
terms,'' said Barbara Coombs Lee, director of Compassion in Dying.
``We feel confident the law will continue to be implemented safely
and carefully in Oregon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon statute, enacted by referendum in 1994, survived a
challenge from opponents when state voters last November rejected
by a 3-2 margin a ballot initiative to repeal the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last June ruled that terminally ill patients
do not have a constitutional right to have a doctor help them kill
themselves. But the justices, in upholding laws barring
physician-assisted suicide, said states may enact laws permitting
the controversial practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the nation, Americans are engaged in an earnest and
profound debate about the morality, legality and practicality of
physician-assisted suicide,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
wrote for the court. ``Our holding permits this debate to continue,
as it should in a democratic society.'' &QL;

NEW YORK STATE REPUBLICANS HAIL LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACEY TULLY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mary Donohue, former prosecutor and judge, casts
herself as a compassionate and loyal sidekick, a lieutenant
governor who is willing to follow, not lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand how important it is to Gov. Pataki to have a
team-playing lieutenant governor. I'm very comfortable in this
role,'' Donohue said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The former teacher who rose from being the head of Rensselaer
County's Junior League, to being elected district attorney and then
a state Supreme Court judge, resigned last week from the bench
after being tapped by Gov. George Pataki and GOP Chairman Bill
Powers to run for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   In nominating Donohue, delegates seized upon her longtime
loyalty to the GOP, a trait party loyalists claim is lacking in the
current lieutenant governor _ Betsy McCaughey Ross, who also was
hand-picked by Pataki in 1994 and is now trying to bump him out of
office as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   One county nominated Donohue, 51, as the ``team-playing
female.'' Another delegate stood up to proudly state that she was
sending her county's share of the vote to a woman who ``understands
loyalty and commitment.'' And Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno,
Donohue's former boss and next-door neighbor in Brunswick, hailed
her in a nominating speech as a ``lady who by her experience and
life qualifies herself to be a teammate, a partner, to our great
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue's acceptance remarks clearly had the flavor of a
runningmate, not a boss. She concentrated on the traditionally
female roles she has held: mother and teacher. And she made little
more than passing reference to her more recent careers as a
down-and-dirty criminal prosecutor and a tough-sentencing judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was truly concerned about my children's safety, your
children's safety,'' she said in explanation of her career as
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to hail Pataki's efforts to cut crime in New York _
a claim that might ring hollow to her neighbors in Rensselaer
County, where violent crime has increased 33 percent since 1992
even as it has fallen statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who was asked to compare his current lieutenant governor
to Donohue, said her support of his agenda is an obvious plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that I wanted to make sure we had someone
who shared my philosophy, who had the experience and the ability to
run this state, and I have no doubt that Mary Donohue does,''
Pataki said.

<BODY>
Watching a couple hundred newly minted MBAs parade happily down the
street last week, I thought the life of business must be as muc
prone to love as any other, but there are relatively few incentives
to talk about it. The closest thing to a business love story in the
tall case of new books beside my desk is ``Financier,'' the
biography of Andre Meyer, by Cary Reich. Its subtitle is ``A Story
of Money, Power and the Reshaping of American Business.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reissued recently as part of a series on business pioneers,
Reich's subject is the financial strategist who in the 1950s, '60s,
and '70s built Lazard Freres into a powerhouse among investment
banks. Fifteen years after it first appeared, it's still is an
exceptionally good read _ if you're interested in why Avis
Rent-a-Car turned out so well, for example, or in the Agnelli or
Englehard families. (The affable author, one of the best business
journalists in New York, died suddenly of pancreatic cancer in
March at 48.)
</P>
<P>
   The legendary Meyer had a typical French marriage of a certain
sort: a discreet, devoted wife and an eye that wandered widely over
the years, from chanteuse Claude Alphande to Jacqueline Onassis.
Bella Meyer faded into the background; she survived her husband
(who died in 1979) by only six months.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a different sort of marriage is chronicled in ``A
Beautiful Mind,'' by Sylvia Nasar, a reporter for The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of the business pages may remember Nasar's story ``The
Lost Years of a Nobel Laureate'' in late 1994. It described the
descent into madness at the age of 30 of a mathematical economist
named John Nash and the eventual remission of his disease, in time
for him to shake the hand of the Swedish king for contributions he
had made to economics nearly 40 years before. It was a particularly
memorable story because it took pains to locate Nash and his
illness in the context of his birth family.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story has made a swell book. It is not as much about
game theory that Nash helped pioneer as about the ways that
mathematicians lead their lives, and about schizophrenia. The
person who holds it all together is a pretty young physicist named
Alicia Larde, who married Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Nasar seems to have talked to anyone and everyone who knew Nash
over the years. But energy aside, her great strength is as a
storyteller engaged in the ways of the human heart. Her book is a
latter-day ``Shine'' for followers of economics, with a
mathematician rather than a concert pianist at its center _ and a
moderately happy ending that is not fake.
</P>
<P>
   John Forbes Nash Jr. was born in 1928 in Bluefield, W. Va., a
rugged Appalachian coal town where his father was an electric
utility engineer. His Protestant parents were routinely demanding;
in 1945, his talent for mathematics already obvious, Nash went off
to the Carnegie Institute of Technology; by the middle of his
junior year he had been accepted for graduate study at Harvard,
Princeton, Chicago, and Michigan. He chose Princeton, then, as now,
the mathematical center of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Already there were signs of the otherworldliness that was to
plague him. As a teenager he danced with chairs, played unfunny
practical jokes, and made clear his attraction to other boys. As a
young adult, he careened back and forth between men and women. But
he also possessed unmistakable talent, and at Princeton it
blossomed for a time into genius.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's first paper was called ``The Bargaining Problem,'' and it
was a clear-headed examination of the circumstances that might lead
parties to a deal to prefer to cooperate or to compete. In short
order he had set himself up in opposition to John von Neumann, the
reigning genius of Princeton, whose book with Oskar Morgenstern,
``The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior,'' had electrified the
community of mathematical economists.
</P>
<P>
   It was in his thesis that Nash described the concept that bears
his name: Nash equilibrium, or the situation in which each player
has adopted the strategy that serves him best in consideration of
the strategies of all others. That carefully delineated bit of
mathematics, and a further contribution to the theory of games,
were sufficient to win him a series of distinguished appointments:
to think tank Rand Corp., the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. He fathered a
son by his mistress, then married vivacious Alicia Larde, whom he
met in his course on advanced calculus for engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's antics increased in intensity and frequency. One winter
day in 1959, he walked into the common room at MIT and announced to
no one in particular that that day's New York Times contained a
message from a superior race in another galaxy that only he could
understand. Nasar's book chronicles the long bigger saga of the
paranoid schizophrenia that plagued Nash for the next 30 years,
that severed his links with virtually every one of the communities
that had sustained him: the schools, fellowships, departments,
friendships, children, and, in 1963, his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But Nash's wife continued to care for him even after they were
divorced. The bout of hospitalizations eventually ended. His mother
was dead, his sister unable to take him on. So in 1970, she offered
to let Nash live with her in Princeton, reasoning that a quiet life
on the edges of an academic community would be better for him than
any other regime.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't easy, either; as ``the boarder,'' he took meals with
his ex-wife, her mother, and his adolescent son. But in time the
simple, sheltered routine began to pay off. Nash haunted the
Princeton libraries like a wraith, scribbling on blackboards,
poring over religious texts; his second son grew up. (Well-raised
by his mother, Nash's first son had become a registered nurse.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, along a lengthy front, economics had begun moving
toward the austere mathematical structures that Nash and others had
erected in the late 1940s. The relevance of his early work to the
description of everyday dilemmas had become clear. Colleagues had
begun campaigning for Nash's election to the Econometric Society _
and, in Sweden, for a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, reporter Nasar is at her best. She captures the
furious competitiveness that accompanies the award of major prizes
like the Fields Medal for mathematics, and penetrates the swirl of
rumor that had surrounded the award of the 1994 Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that conservatives in the Swedish Academy had
staged a last-minute attempt to prevent the award to Nash on the
very morning the announcement was to be made. Only narrowly did it
fail. In the end, Nash was well enough accept the prize _ and even
to resume working, in a limited way.
</P>
<P>
   As to the claims for the centrality of John Nash's work, who
knows? Certainly developments in game theory have begun to change
our world, by pointing to alternatives to the concept of ``perfect
competition'' of economists. Nasar ends her book with a chapter on
what Vice President Al Gore had called ``The Greatest Auction
Ever,'' the sale of some $7 billion worth of public airwaves to
cellular phone companies in 1994 under procedures devised by
followers of Nash. Arrangements such as these are, of course,
precisely the activities at which the financier Andre Meyer
excelled. Before there was mathematically driven financial
engineering, he was a financier. Whether the formalization of the
Nash equilibrium has diminished the requirement for character and
judgment in business remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the worlds of business practice and
economic theory are coming closer together. And that the rules
governing human conduct are the same in each.

 &HT;    Summertime, and the AC is pumping
 &HT;    By Shannon Colavecchio and Seth Mnookin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Summer's not here yet, but Florida Power
&AMP; Light has already set records for electricity use throughout the
state.
</P>
<P>
   FPL officials said customers are pumping up air conditioning
units and putting a noticeable but manageable strain on their
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, in fact, set in the last two days all-time record
highs for the total demand on our system this early in the
summer,'' said Rod Macon, FPL spokesman. The records are for
electricity used this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County residents have been dealing daily with almost
record-high temperatures. With a 50-percent humidity level, the
heat index, which is how hot it feels when the humidity is
considered, stayed just on this side of 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit is a high pressure system that parked itself over
Florida and has refused to move. The first hope for cooler
temperatures and a few raindrops will not come until the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature hit the century mark for the third straight day
at Daytona Beach. The daily record high temperature at the National
Weather Service office in Melbourne was broken for the third day in
a row when it reached 99 degrees Thursday afternoon. The old record
of 94 degrees was set in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Summer arrives June 21.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the state issued a health alert to advise residents
about possible health problems due to exteme temperatures around
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Already this week the heat is being blamed for two Florida
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a 2-year-old girl died after a few minutes in her
family's sweltering minivan. Elizabeth Eunson's siblings and mother
were cooling off in a backyard pool Wednesday when she wandered out
to the van, climbed in through an open door and got stuck when the
door slid shut behind her, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes passed before the family realized Elizabeth was
missing, said Detective Stacey Barrentine of the Pinellas County
Sheriff's Office. By the time they pulled her from the van, it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   Dunedin is about 15 miles west of Tampa, where Wednesday's high
was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Carroll Vincent, 66, died of prolonged
exposure to the sun. He was seen sitting for more than 24 hours in
a chair outside his Fort Lauderdale home, but passersby realized
too late that he was unconscious. He was found Monday and died
Tuesday at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And in Palm Beach County, a 21 month-old boy was brought to St.
Mary's Medical Center Thursday after becomming sluggish during a
swimming lesson at the BallenIsles Country Club in Palm Beach
Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The toddler, who was also running a fever, did not lose
consciousness and was treated and released on Thursday, according
to Palm Beach Gardens Fire Department Captain Richard Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents resorted to sundry methods, both ordinary and
unusual, in their efforts to beat the heat.
</P>
<P>
   In Martin County residents filled their rapidly warming pools
with 300-pound blocks of ice. Ice distributors said they have been
racing to keep up with the sooner-than-expected peak summer demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bag we make is sold,'' said Harvey Townend, manager of
County Ice in Riviera Beach. ``We never catch up once it gets this
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County residents were slightly more prosaic in their
quest for cool. Hardware and home supply stores were doing a brisk
business in fans, air conditioners, and anything else that might
get a breeze going.
</P>
<P>
   At a Home Depot in suburban Lake Worth, Assistant Manager Howie
Murphy said his store was churning anything that might reduce the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for anything that moves air,'' he said. ``It's
all flying out of here.''
</P>

 &HT;    NCAA outdoor championship: Texas high jumpers come crashing down
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ ``A perfect ending,'' was Ivan Wagner's
facetious description of the conclusion to his track and field
season. But he didn't really mean perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appropriate'' was more, well, appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, the University of Texas' defending NCAA outdoor high
jump champion, concluded an injury-plagued junior season by failing
to clear the opening height at this year's meet. For Wagner, it was
a fitting end.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for the Longhorns, who have run smack into Murphy's Law at
the University of Buffalo's stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's training partner, Mark Boswell, also was disappointed.
The UT freshman had the nation's top leap entering the competition
(7 feet, 6 inches), but could clear only 7-0 1/2 recently to finish
tied for 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough meet,'' understated UT men's coach Bubba Thornton, who
saw his sophomore Jacob Davis, the favorite in the pole vault,
finish sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton felt better after the 1,600-meter relay prelims. The
Longhorns' quartet of Matt Ellis, David Aaron, Terrence Wakefield
and Calvin Williams ran the fifth-fastest qualifying time, 3
minutes, 6.10 seconds, to advance to the finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns women, meanwhile, fared well in their bid for
their first outdoor team championship since 1986. The UT women
advanced nearly everyone they expected to except for Liz Diaz in
the 1,500, and got sparkling performances from Suziann Reid in the
400 dash and 1,600 relay.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, the national leader who won the NCAA outdoors as a
freshman and the NCAA indoors in March, broke her own school record
in the 400 with a clocking of 50.86 seconds. The junior also
anchored Texas' 1,600 relay that recorded a season-best clocking of
3:29.40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I was going that fast,'' Reid said of her 400
time, which eclipsed her previous school mark of 50.95 seconds.
``My goal was to have the fastest time going into the finals. I
heard (Coach) Bev (Kearney) yelling at me to relax on the final
stretch, but I felt good so I just went along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling good was something that escaped Wagner and Boswell.
Fighting gusty winds that played havoc with their approaches,
Wagner failed to clear the opening bar of 6-11 to no-height for the
first time in his life. Boswell, a native of Brompton, Ontario,
Canada, who was competing in front of his mother, three sisters,
girlfriend and numerous other friends, passed at 6-11, cleared 7- 0
1/2 on his second try and missed all three attempts at 7-2 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   The event was won by Kansas State's Nathan Leeper, the Big 12
champion, with a leap of 7-5 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally I'm not disappointed,'' said Boswell, whose
national-best jump of 7-6 came at the Texas Relays. ``But I'm sorry
I didn't score more points for the team. That was the main thing
all along. This just makes me more determined to do better next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wagner, who competed most of the year on a left knee that
will require arthroscopic surgery in about two weeks for cartilage
damage, Thursday's competition pretty much told the story of his
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm throwing this year in the trash can,'' said Wagner, whose
best jump of the season was 7-3 after winning the NCAAs last year
at 7-6 1/2. ``I know I'll have better seasons and better meets in
the future, so this one is going to be forgotten.''

 &HT;    Palm Beach Neiman Marcus subject to restrictions in first year
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When high-end retailer Neiman Marcus
announces the grand opening of its Worth Avenue store in the year
2000 or so, only island residents will know.
</P>
<P>
   To prove its target customer lives in Palm Beach and that it
will not be regional store, Neiman Marcus agreed not to advertise
in major local newspapers, on television, radio or through mass
mailings for a year after it opens.
</P>
<P>
   That was only one of many conditions the Dallas-based retailer
agreed to gain approval of a three-story, 48,661-square foot store
from the town council by a 4-1 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Council President Lesly Smith opposed the store. ``I feel the
project is too big for the property,'' she said, adding that she
would shop there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I will shop in no more than 32,000 square feet of the
store and I certainly won't go to the third floor, which I
opposed,'' she joked.
</P>
<P>
   The Mediterranean Revival-style building with two levels of
underground parking will be on the easternmost block of Worth
Avenue, across the street from rival Saks and the Esplanade
shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   Developer Murray Goodman, who owns the Neiman's site, also agree
to donate 19,000 square feet of land for a park at the southwest
corner of Peruvian Avenue and South County Road. A 20-space parking
lot on Peruvian also will be replaced with a park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to accommodate everyone, including the town council,
which resulted in a lot of concessions,'' Goodman said. He said he
was offered $2.5 million recently for the Peruvian and South County
property.
</P>
<P>
   Architects trimmed 8,400-square feet from the original plans,
promised valet parking and will pay for an extra police officer in
the area from November through April to handle traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Neiman's customers will park free, and others will
pay 15 percent less than at a lot at the western end of Worth
Avenue during the winter season.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Neiman's will advertise only in publications that
circulate on the island and will mail only to zip code 33480, an
area that includes Palm Beach and South Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions are people who receive Neiman's famous
catalog, Neiman's credit card holders and people who ask for
mailings.
</P>
<P>
   No other Palm Beach store is restricted from advertising in The
Palm Beach Post, the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel or on television,
but Councilman Leslie Shaw wants the council to consider such
conditions for other major stores as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be geared to the Palm Beach customer,'' said Neiman's
CEO Bert Tansky. ``We are very pleased to be a part of Palm Beach.
We think we will bring something very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Town planning consultant William Brisson said the store would
have less traffic and cover less space than a group of small stores
on the same site.
</P>
<P>
   That did not persuade some residents. ``This is the end of Palm
Beach as we know it,'' said Worth Avenue merchant Ed Kassatly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll make money, but we'll lose our dignity,'' said
longtime resident Elise MacIntosh.

 &HT;    NCAA outdoor championships: Texas A&AMP;M hurdler battles the wind
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Winning his heat in the 110-meter hurdles evoked
an odd reaction from Larry Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Wade, a Texas A&AMP;M senior from Elgin, rolled his eyes and took a
deep sigh after crossing first at the NCAA outdoor track and field
championships.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Part if it was surviving the gusting, swirling winds inside the
University of Buffalo stadium. Part of it was his time of 13.96
seconds _ ``I haven't run that slow since I was a freshman,'' Wade
said _ and the two were related.
</P>
<P>
   The chilly winds played havoc on Thursday (6/4), especially for
the hurdlers. Nobody fell, but nobody felt comfortable, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was blowing in my face, at my back, sideways, everywhere,''
said the University of Texas' Angie Vaughn, the national leader in
the high hurdles whose preliminary time of 13.21 seconds in lane
eight was the fastest of the qualifiers. ``It was tricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a lot of hurdles,'' Vaughn said. ``It wasn't like I was
clobbering them. More like clipping them. But I can't be clipping
anything in the semifinals.''
</P>
<P>
   Also qualifying in the hurdles was Brigitte Foster of Southwest
Texas State with a time of 13.78.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to control your technique both over the hurdles
and between them. You couldn't get any drive,'' Foster said. ``But
at least I advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas women had another good day of qualifying, advancing
Vaughn in the high hurdles, LaKeisha Backus and Kim McGruder in the
100, Suziann Reid and Toya Brown in the 400 and their 1,600 relay.
Elizabeth Diaz failed to advance in the 1,500 when her time of 4
minutes, 22.18 seconds missed the cutoff by one spot.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES _ SWT's Foster also advanced in the 100 with a
seventh-place heat time of 11.75. ... The Baylor men's
national-leading 1,600 relay barely advanced to the finals. Bayano
Kamani, running the second leg, suffered a hamstring cramp and
limped the final 150 meters of his split to hand off to Stephan
Bragner. Bragner's 44.7 split and the 44.5 by anchor Brandon Couts
pulled the Bears from last to fourth in their heat and gave them
the seventh of eight qualifying times. ``I could have lost both
legs and I still would have gotten them the stick (baton),'' said
Kamani, a freshman from Houston. ``They would have done the same
for me because we're a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas sophomore Jessica Koch, a Round Rock product who
transferred from UT after her freshman year, led qualifying in the
3,000 meters with a time of 9:28.94. ... Nebraska's Tressa Thompson
broke her own meet record in the shot put with a toss of 61 feet, 2
1/4 inches. Second went to Southern Methodist's Teri Tunks, whose
throw of 60-10 3/4 also broke Thompson's previous mark of 60-8 1/2.
... Arkansas' Robert Howard won the long jump with a leap of 27-5
1/2 on his final attempt. ``No negative thoughts,'' Howard said of
his mind-set before the last jump. ``All I think of is running. I
see fire under my feet, like I'm running on coals.''

in the 400 with a clocking of 50.86 seconds. The junior also
anchored Texas' 1,600 relay that recorded a season-best clocking of
3:29.40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I was going that fast,'' Reid said of her 400
time, which eclipsed her previous school mark of 50.95 seconds.
``My goal was to have the fastest time going into the finals. I
heard (Coach) Bev (Kearney) yelling at me to relax on the final
stretch, but I felt good so I just went along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling good was something that escaped Wagner and Boswell.
Fighting gusty winds that played havoc with their approaches,
Wagner failed to clear the opening bar of 6-11 to no-height for the
first time in his life. Boswell, a native of Brompton, Ontario,
Canada, who was competing in front of his mother, three sisters,
girlfriend and numerous other friends, passed at 6-11, cleared 7- 0
1/2 on his second try and missed all three attempts at 7-2 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   The event was won by Kansas State's Nathan Leeper, the Big 12
champion, with a leap of 7-5 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally I'm not disappointed,'' said Boswell, whose
national-best jump of 7-6 came at the Texas Relays. ``But I'm sorry
I didn't score more points for the team. That was the main thing
all along. This just makes me more determined to do better next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wagner, who competed most of the year on a left knee that
will require arthroscopic surgery in about two weeks for cartilage
damage, Thursday's competition pretty much told the story of his
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm throwing this year in the trash can,'' said Wagner, whose
best jump of the season was 7-3 after winning the NCAAs last year
at 7-6 1/2. ``I know I'll have better seasons and better meets in
the future, so this one is going to be forgotten.''

KOSOVO FIGHTERS BOLSTERED BY ETHNIC ALBANIANS FROM GERMANY,
SWITZERLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FIERZE, Albania _ The rusted hulk of a ferry, its bilge pumps
spewing water into the emerald green Drinit River and its diesel
engine rattling, has become for hundreds of young men the last leg
on a journey to war.
</P>
<P>
   On the upper decks small knots of ethnic Albanians, some of the
600,000 Albanians in Germany and Switzerland, squatted and
whispered among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Six bearded Islamic militants with white skullcaps stood near
the railing with thousand-mile stares that seemed to inhibit the
conversation around them. The milling groups and hushed tones gave
the boat, which shuttles each day the two hours between Koman and
Fierze, the aura of a troop ship heading into battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be met at the landing,'' said a heavyset bearded man
quietly to six young men clutching cheap nylon bags who had
gathered anxiously around him. ``They have sent someone to take
care of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruits nervously smoked cigarettes as the boat chugged
past sheer, rocky cliffs that plunged dramatically into the still
expanse of water.
</P>
<P>
   The men have left behind families, jobs, however menial, and
peace to fight for a separate state with the Kosovo Liberation Army
against the Serbian military.
</P>
<P>
   Many speak German better than they do Albanian and know little
of their homeland other than the idealized visions imparted to them
by their refugee parents in cramped apartments in Munich or Zurich.
Most are motivated by a romantic fervor that must make up for an
appalling lack of military preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get two weeks of military training,'' said one of the men,
who gave his nom de guerre as Lum (pronounced loom) and who left
his job as a waiter in Germany. ``The Kosovo Liberation Army does
not send in people to fight without preparation. We will be
trained.''
</P>
<P>
   The location of the training camps in the lawless backlands of
northern Albania has become the focus of intense interest. The
Albanian government, which since the collapse of its central
administration last year has little influence here, says the camps
do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   None of the men interviewed, even those who said they had been
trained and were about to head over the mountains into Kosovo, were
willing to say where the training took place.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous presence of men in combat boots and black fatigue
pants in the border towns of Tropoje and Bajram Curri seems to
suggest that the camps are inside Albania along the frontier with
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remote place, with few roads and no policing,'' a
Western military observer said. ``It is not hard to hide a training
facility here. We believe the camps exist, but we do not know where
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The counterinsurgency campaign begun by the Serbs in March to
wipe out the rebels in the central Drenica region in Kosovo
Province set off the rush to fight by the young Albanians in the
diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   Gruesome pictures of some of the 80 people killed in the Serbian
sweep in March, mostly women, children and the elderly, were widely
disseminated by the ethnic Albanian leadership. Exile groups put
the grisly photos on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old university student, who gave his nom de guerre as
Gjon and who was born and has lived all his life in Germany, sat
with six friends in a small coffee shop in downtown Bajram Curri.
He and the other volunteers will cross the border in a day or two.
They will travel into an area where the Serbian military has been
pounding villages with heavy artillery for a week, and where
streams of refugees are fleeing into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Western observers say as many as 40,000 people could be
displaced from their homes by the attack, which is intended, they
said, to create a free-fire zone along the length of the border
with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs apparently hope that the zone, emptied of civilians,
will be a buffer to halt the smuggling of weapons and supplies from
Albania to the rebels fighting in the province, these officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made contact with representatives from the Kosovo
Liberation Army in Germany, and they helped us come,'' the
university student said. ``When we flew into Tirana, there were
many recruits on the plane. We all bought our own tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an adventure. We have learned from Bosnia that if
we do not defend our country, it will be taken from us by the
Serbs. We will not allow the Serbs to drive the Albanians from
their land.''
</P>
<P>
   The specter of Bosnia, where 200,000 people were killed and
hundreds of thousands of Muslims and ethnic Croats expelled from
their homes by the Serbs, weighs heavily on the volunteers. All
said Kosovo, where 90 percent of the 2 million people are ethnic
Albanian, would be emptied of all ethnic Albanians if Belgrade is
permitted to continue its military operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a history student at the university,'' Gjon said, ``but
I decided to drop out and come here to fight. My brother will join
me from Germany within a few days. Most young Albanians support the
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who arrive from Europe are confronted with crushing
poverty. The dusty towns in northern Albania often lack running
water and regular electricity. There is often no local authority,
other than a warlord and his group of armed henchmen. Many said
they were still trying to adjust to the chaos, poverty and
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I called my mother in Germany every day,'' said a
30-year-old volunteer, ``and then I stopped. She weeps, like all
mothers. I don't call her now. In a few days she must learn to live
without the sound of my voice.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Broadway hits a high note
 &HT;    Has sidebars: BROADWAY-MUSICALS, BROADWAY-NONMUSICALS
 &HT;    By HAP ERSTEIN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Construction jackhammers are pounding. Computerized
ticket sales are whirring. Satisfied audiences are jumping to their
feet and cheering. Theater producers, toasting their good fortune,
are popping champagne corks all over town.
</P>
<P>
   These are the sounds of Broadway, which is on a roll after years
of hand-wringing. Tonight, with the annual Tony Awards celebration,
Broadway officially closes the book on its most successful season
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary data from the League of American Theatres and
Producers indicate that more than 11.3 million people saw a
Broadway show this season, breaking the previous attendance high
notched in 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   Box office income reached an estimated record high of $545
million, a 9.2 percent increase over last season. In December, 23
musicals were running on Broadway _ the most at any time in modern
history. And the top ticket price for musicals spiraled to $75, a
$5 increase.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some ticket prices rose even higher. Livent Inc.,
which produces Ragtime, added a $1 surcharge _ making its tickets
$76 _ to defray the construction costs of its new Ford Center for
the Performing Arts. Then it established a $125 ticket that
includes entry to a VIP lounge at intermission, refreshments and
free coat check. Who says elitism is dead on Broadway?
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the attendance and sales records is the way
the theater district is cleaning up its act. Two renovated and
restored, state-of-the-art theatrical palaces have opened along the
formerly tacky, now tourist-friendly, neon-bright 42nd Street
corridor.
</P>
<P>
   But what's on stage? Some genuine quality.
</P>
<P>
   Those two ``new'' theaters, the New Amsterdam and Ford Center,
opened with a pair of blockbuster productions _ Disney's puppet
spectacle ``The Lion King'' and the musical juggernaut ``Ragtime.''
Each will continue overwhelming theatergoers for years to come,
regardless of who wins Best Musical tonight at the Tonys. Yes, for
the first season in a long time, there will be some nail-biting as
both musicals vie for the bragging rights and marketing punch that
comes with the Tony.
</P>
<P>
   Not that either show is hurting. ``Ragtime'' and ``The Lion
King'' are two of four shows (along with ``Chicago'' and ``Rent'')
doing sold-out business. A further measure of Broadway's health is
that by late May, another seven productions were doing above 90
percent attendance. In one week, ``Ragtime'' brought in an
impressive $888,006 and ``The Lion King'' $805,954. Together, the
two shows have accounted for $44 million in ticket sales, according
to Variety, equal to 77 percent of the season's increase in sales.
Without these two shows, the Broadway ledger books would look very
different.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that both shows, while containing moments of stylized
violence, could be described as ``family-oriented.'' Contrast that
with the third hot-ticket musical, a raunchy revival of ``Cabaret''
that emphasizes the seamy side of life in Weimar Berlin. It also is
housed in a recently re-opened theater, the gone-to-seed Henry
Miller, converted into the time-warp Kit Kat Klub for this show.
Any Broadway season that can produce three hit shows in three
previously inactive theaters cannot be all bad.
</P>
<P>
   For the downside, this was supposed to be the year that composer
Paul Simon and his long-promised ``The Capeman'' inched the sounds
of Broadway closer to pop-rock. Well, it never caught on, in part
because of theater novice Simon's abrasive remarks about
revolutionizing the musical theater. While that was surely a factor
in its reception, there was a convincing consensus among critics
that the show was an inert mess.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in records should note that ``The Capeman'' set
a new mark as the most expensive flop on Broadway, going through
more than $11 million before giving up after two months of
performances. Such is Simon's box office draw that there has been
talk of a concert tour of ``The Capeman,'' but don't hold your
breath.
</P>
<P>
   Good, bad or in between, nearly every new musical this season
originated in America, in contrast to the days when the British
dominated with ``Cats,'' ``Les Miserables'' and ``Phantom of the
Opera.'' But the most praised and popular dramas this season are
London imports _ ``Art'' and ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of America's best playwrights fared less well. David
Mamet's trio of short plays, ``The Old Neighborhood,'' folded the
week it received no Tony nominations. A revival of Neil Simon's
``The Sunshine Boys'' (that began at the Coconut Grove Playhouse)
found an audience, but his new, more personal play, ``Proposals,''
died quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Arthur Miller's 1960 family drama ``A View From the
Bridge'' has earned awards and a following, but his newest work,
``Mr. Peters' Connections,'' failed to connect with most critics.
And time and money ran out on David Henry Hwang's ``Golden Child,''
a delicate meditation on Western ways and their effect on Asian
values. It folded a week ago, even though it is up for the Best
Play Tony.
</P>
<P>
   And not all British plays were well received. ``The Herbal
Bed,'' about a court case involving William Shakespeare's daughter,
was acclaimed in London but met a wall of indifference here and
closed quickly. ``The Judas Kiss,'' David Hare's look at the trials
of Oscar Wilde starring Liam Neeson, also had favorable advance
word, but was totally shut out on Tony nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a bullish year on Broadway. But will this brisk
business spill over into upcoming seasons, or is it a mere fluke?
</P>
<P>
   It seems aggressive marketing from the League of American
Theatres and Producers is working, with Broadway trumpeted through
syndicated television specials and upbeat Web sites. (To see how
they crow about the season, click on http://www.broadway.org.)
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the league claims that theatergoers under 18
have doubled in the past seven years. Some of that must be due to
the increasing presence of Disney. Some must come from shows like
``Rent,'' ``Bring in 'da Noise'' and ``The Capeman,'' which aim to
attract untraditional Broadway audiences. The emphasis is off the
hypothetical ``tired businessman'' and toward the younger, hipper
audience.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the reasoning goes, theater-going habits may take root,
and Broadway could have new patrons for life. So not only is
Broadway not dying, it is sprucing itself up, preparing to sprint
into the 21st century. HAP'S PICKS

 &HT;    POWERHOUSE MUSICALS COMPETE FOR AWARDS
 &HT;    Sidebar for BROADWAY-TONYS
 &HT;    By HAP ERSTEIN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mini-reviews of three of Broadway's biggest musicals, all up for
Tonys Sunday night:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Ragtime'' _ The Livent musical mill (``Kiss of the Spider
Woman,'' the revival of ``Show Boat'') hits its apex with this
emotion-laden adaptation of E.L. Doctorow's turn-of-the-century
novel about the multicultural American melting pot.
</P>
<P>
   With a lush, anthem-rich score by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn
Ahrens (``Once on This Island'') and a tight, yet intricate script
by Terrence McNally (``Master Class''), it interweaves the fates of
three diverse groups. There's the WASPy New Rochelle crowd headed
by a muddled global explorer, Harlem blacks led by a ragtime
piano-player who grows militant from injustice, and Eastern
European Jews exemplified by a silhouette artist who becomes a
silent filmmaker and self-styled baron.
</P>
<P>
   The canvas is vast and the results are epic, as director Frank
Galati deftly balances so many story lines, and Graciela Daniele's
nimble, musical staging shows the clash of cultures in movement. In
the huge cast are such Tony-worthy performers as Brian Stokes
Mitchell, powerfully towering above the fray as firebrand Coalhouse
Walker, and the ethereal Audra McDonald as his washerwoman lover
reaching out to grab the American Dream. Peter Friedman is fiercely
protective of his daughter and later amusingly aristocratic as
upwardly mobile Tateh. And the delicate Marin Mazzie strikes a
personal chord with her soaring soprano, turning Mother's journey
of self-discovery into the spine of the show.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great musical, one that will continue to move
audiences for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragtime,'' Ford Center for the Performing Arts, 213 W. 42nd
St., New York, $31-$76, (212) 307-4550.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Lion King'' _ Give the Disney gang credit for not giving
us another ``Beauty and the Beast,'' a slapped together stage
version of an animated cartoon minus the charm. Instead, they went
into uncharted terrain, hiring cutting edge director-puppeteer
Julie Taymor, who transformed this story of a lion cub's ascension
to jungle royalty into her own celebration of the imagination and
potential of live theater.
</P>
<P>
   The opening number, ``Circle of Life,'' is a stunning display of
oversized puppet art, as the beasts of the veldt parade through the
aisles to the stage, visibly motored by human power. Youngsters
will see a new take on the video they cherish. Parents will see
something more ingenious and original.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Taymor's staging of the wildebeest stampede, a
fanciful flight of birds throughout the theater and a magical
assembly of puppet creatures that forms into a stage-high image of
former lion king Mufasa's face. The Elton John-Tim Rice film score
has been bolstered with songs featuring African rhythms and
orchestrations. The design elements are wondrous. Still, the
production feels like it hops from effect to effect, only
occasionally touching the heart as the film did. Taymor's spectacle
inspires awe, but she doesn't have a story that can fully support
her stage wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion King,'' New Amsterdam Theatre, 214 W. 42nd St., New
York. $25-$75. (800) 755-4000.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cabaret'' _ In 1966, when Harold Prince first staged this
dark, cautionary musical about the rise of Nazism, he admits he
compromised on some of the darker elements of Christopher
Isherwood's Berlin stories. Now comes British director Sam Mendes
to emphasize the seamy side of this John Kander-Fred Ebb show about
a mad moment in history mirrored inside a tacky, tawdry nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Masteroff retooled his script to make the homosexuality more
explicit, and Mendes tossed out some of the conventional musical
comedy numbers. But the revelation is how the Kit Kat Klub's Emcee
insinuates himself throughout the production as a wry observer, and
how lasciviously Alan Cumming redefines the creepy character.
</P>
<P>
   The evening is his, though Natasha Richardson also brings new
dramatic qualities to naive songbird Sally Bowles, wallowing in
decadence and political denial. Her convulsive breakdown during the
title song is a nightmarish stunner. The ensemble, which sings,
dances, plays band instruments and fills various supporting roles,
is a show unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is set in a theater converted into a Weimar cabaret,
but this environmental approach is the least important part of this
in-your-face production. It could easily be sacrificed if the show
tours, as road presenter and investor PACE Theatrical Group
intends. Meanwhile, life is likely to be a cabaret, old chum, for
the foreseeable future on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabaret,'' Kit Kat Klub, 124 W. 43rd St., New York. $55-$80.
(212) 239-6200.

 &HT;    Two non-musicals make impressive Broadway reviews
 &HT;    Sidebar for BROADWAY-TONYS
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The season for non-musicals on Broadway was also strong, though
the best of them were London imports. Hap Erstein's mini-reviews:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' _ In this quirky Irish fable,
prolific 28-year-old playwright Martin McDonagh deftly juggles dark
comedy and sheer melodrama in a mother-daughter tug-of-war that
plays like the flip side of ``The Glass Menagerie.''
</P>
<P>
   Manipulative Mag Folan sits inert watching television, barking
orders to her plain, 40-year-old virginal daughter Maureen, the
ironically nicknamed title character. When gentleman caller Pato
Dooley wakes up romantic feelings in Maureen, proposing to her by
letter, Mag worries that she will lose her dutiful servant.
</P>
<P>
   McDonagh and director Garry Hynes get delicious mileage from the
suspense over keeping the letter out of Mag's hands. Audience
sympathies ping-pong between Maureen and Mag, eventually tipped
when Mag dashes Maureen's chance for happiness. What follows is
both grisly and heart-rending.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the play's original Irish cast came to New York, led by
Marie Mullen (Maureen), a wounded bird with highly expressive mood
swings. In the smaller, but showier role of Mag, Anna Manahan is a
wondrous and wily malevolent hulk. Also first rate is Tom Murphy as
Pato's glib younger brother Ray, misguidedly entrusted to deliver
the proposal letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty Queen'' may not be deep stuff, but it is enjoyable
theater and a terrific introduction to the puckish McDonagh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' Walter Kerr Theatre, 219 W.
48th St., New York, $20-$60, (800) 432-7250.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Art'' _ Another welcome New York debut, this clever, compact
comedy by Parisian Yasmina Reza looks at how the purchase of a
minimalist painting undermines the friendship of three grown, but
childish men. With a trio of crafty performances by Alan Alda,
Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, the production's 90
intermission-less minutes move so swiftly, with so many robust
laughs, you may be out of the theater before all the observations
on ego, self-worth, male vanity and art sink in.
</P>
<P>
   Garber is dermatologist Serge, wealthy enough to plunk down a
small fortune for a white-on-white, I-coulda-done-that painting,
but insecure enough to need approval from his buddies. Judgmental
Marc (Alda) feels personally offended by the purchase, sending him
into jags of derisive laughter. Wishy-washy Yvan (Molina) tries to
mediate the situation to disastrous effect.
</P>
<P>
   Reza, aided by translator Christopher Hampton (``Les Liaisons

 &HT;    Kotsay had World at fingertips
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If he watches the College World Series,
he must do so with greater interest than most, knowing that he once
owned it.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kotsay, the Marlins' right fielder, was a sophomore center
fielder/relief pitcher on the Cal State-Fullerton baseball team
when they went to Omaha for the 1995 World Series. By the time he
left Rosenblatt Stadium, he had led Fullerton to the title, broken
or tied six offensive records, and been called ``the Messiah'' by
an opposing coach.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Kotsay said at the time. ``Maybe at the
College World Series I'm more focused. Maybe it's a feeling I
get.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a feeling he seemed to have all season in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay hit .422 with 18 home runs and 75 RBI for Fullerton in
the regular season, and he went 2-1 with an 0.38 ERA and nine saves
out of the bullpen. Nice.
</P>
<P>
   He collected five RBI and another save in leading the Titans to
the South Regional title. Very nice.
</P>
<P>
   But once he got to Omaha, things really started to cook. Kotsay
had gone 6-for-13 with a homer and eight RBI in the 1994 Series, so
it's not like he was sneaking up on anybody. But the way he took
the Titans to the 1995 title will live forever in the memories of
those who were there.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the first round, he doubled and scored the tying run, put
down a sacrifice bunt to set up the winning run, and came out of
the pen to record the game's final five outs and earn the save in
Fullerton's 6-5 victory against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   _ Round 2 saw the Titans beat Tennessee 11-1, and Kotsay hit a
grand slam and three singles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tennessee was back for more in the semifinals, and this time
Fullerton beat them 11-0 as Kotsay chipped in with an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   _ Then, in the final against USC, all Kotsay did was hit a
three-run homer and a two-run homer and get the final five outs in
relief.
</P>
<P>
   He went 9-for-16 with three homers, 10 RBI, seven runs scored
and two saves in the Series, and left Omaha holding College World
Series record for career batting average (.517), slugging
percentage (1.103) and grand slams (two). He also tied the records
for home runs (four), championship-game homers (two) and
championship-game RBI (five).
</P>
<P>
   It was Southern Cal coach Mike Gillespie who called Kotsay ``the
Messiah,'' and he still remembers the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't often see a guy come in and just do
everything,'' Gillespie said. ``He was so tough, we couldn't do
anything. People were talking about him maybe not going in the
first round (of the draft), but after what he did there, you knew
he had something.''
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay, of course, was the Marlins' first-round pick a year
later, and made it to the majors by the summer of 1997. Now that
he's a starter (and hitting .296 in his rookie season), there are
undoubtedly many more glory days ahead. But when it's College World
Series time, one can't help but remember the glory days of the
past.

that they are taking to the field, the pool and the track in

changing this with its new Nike Women's Shops _ stores within a

 &HT;    Indians draw old-time fans to Ohio game
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KETTERING, Ohio _ Rev. John Long has conducted hundreds of
wedding rehearsals in his 30-plus years in the ministry, but he
hopes none will go smoother than the one scheduled for today at Oak
Creek United Church of Christ in Kettering, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the bride and groom it had to be early and they
understood,'' said Long, who will need plenty of lead time to get
his family of eight to Cincinnati for tonight's game between the
Reds and Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Long will be among thousands of transplanted or traveling
Indians fans at Cinergy Field this weekend as the Reds host the
Indians in night games today (Friday June 5) and Saturday and a day
game Sunday. It will be the first time the Indians visit Cincinnati
for regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday game is sold out, but 2,000 standing-room tickets
will go on sale at 5:05 p.m. Saturday at Cinergy. The Reds expect
total attendance for the series to surpass 140,000. The record for
a three-game series is 152,565, set against the Los Angeles Dodgers
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing my Indians in person is something I've been looking
forward to for a long time,'' Long said. ``I made three trips to
Jacobs Field (in Cleveland) the first two years it was open
(1994-95), but then it became impossible for regular people to get
tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old Long grew up in Cleveland and quickly formed an
attachment for the Indians. ``The way I see it, I still owe them,''
he said. ``In 1948, I was in the sixth grade and school got
canceled for the World Series. In 1954, I was a senior in high
school and school got canceled again for the World Series. Any kid
who gets to miss that much school because of a baseball team has to
have loyalty to that team no matter what, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Long, who has served the Oak Creek church for 13 years, said his
parishioners, mostly Reds fans, accepted his loyalty to the Indians
with benign benevolence until interleague play began last year.
``Until that happened, I'm not sure anybody around here knew or
cared too much about Cleveland and vice versa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``pro football was always different. I was a
big Browns fan, too, so I heard from Bengals fans all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Long for tonight's pilgrimage will be his wife Shirley,
also a Cleveland native, and daughters Mary and Beth. Also going
are Dave Higgins, Beth's husband, their two children, Hannah and
Andrew, and Barbara Cassady, Shirley's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining ties to the Indians hasn't been easy for Dayton-area
residents, including Jim Dennis, an Oakwood attorney who moved here
from Cleveland in 1976, when the Big Red Machine was at its peak
and the Indians were in the midst of a decline that produced only
five winning seasons from 1967 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``My loyalty has always been to the Indians and always will
be,'' said Dennis, who will take in Saturday's game, ``but I took a
lot of ribbing in those days. I longed for the time when my Indians
would have that kind of record. And now the roles are reversed.
It's only a matter of time before the Indians win a World Series
and it's the Reds who are building.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Owens, another former Clevelander who lives in Oakwood,
said her allegiance has also remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy that the Reds were doing so well and even went to
a few of their games,'' she said, ``but if you're an Indians fan,
it doesn't matter how they're doing. No matter what happens,
they're still my Indians.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TIBURON, Calif. _ When you're tackling the highest peak in North
America, what's a mere staircase at home, even if you have to
scramble up and down it dozens of times a day?
</P>
<P>
   That's how Nancy Knoble spent the last few days. The summit of
her stairway, dubbed ``packing central,'' became base camp to a
jumble of mountaineering gear, from a blue ice ax to sharp metal
crampons to a green ``Z-Rest,'' a fan-shaped foam pad to cushion
her from glacial cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in your tent, it's amazing how snug you can be,''
says Knoble.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the 50-year-old Marin County resident will head a
three-week expedition to the rarefied heights of Mount McKinley,
the tallest mountain on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   She's leading a particularly resolute band of 12 _ five are
breast cancer survivors, and the remaining climbers are young women
determined to defeat the disease that afflicts one in eight women.
</P>
<P>
   The journey up the mountain, called ``the climb against the
odds,'' is part of a crusade to bring attention to breast cancer,
to raise funds and to instill hope in women taxed by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Knoble will be carrying, amid a 130-pound load, several
silk prayer scarves that she hopes to plant on the summit in a few
weeks. Among the messages scribbled on the scarves are numerous
words of encouragement: ``Go for it,'' and ``You move us to reach
higher than we've known.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoble's backpack also includes food for 23 days, toiletries, a
digital camera and laptop computer for daily Internet dispatches
(www.breastcancerfund.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``On summit day, someone, I hope, will be strong enough to type
in `We did it,''' Knoble says laughing. ``We're worried about the
weather interfering with our uplink.''
</P>
<P>
   The majestic, 20,320-foot Alaskan mountain, known to many by its
Native American name of Denali, is often treacherous, its weather
fierce and unrelentingly frigid, epitomized during a recent spate
of storms that killed two climbers, one of them a would-be rescuer.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say climbers on Denali are often assaulted by some of
the coldest, windiest weather in the world due to the mountain's
height and proximity to the Arctic Circle. Only about half the
1,100 climbers authorized every year to tackle Denali actually
reach the top, the others falling victim to frostbite or altitude
sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``On summit day, just taking one step is an effort, you need two
or three breaths with each step,'' says Knoble, who reached the
summit in a 1995 breast cancer expedition to Aconcagua. The
Argentine peak is the highest in South America.
</P>
<P>
   Both expeditions, sponsored by the Breast Cancer Fund, a San
Francisco nonprofit organization founded in 1992, were intended as
metaphors depicting the battle against breast cancer. Aconcagua
raised $1.6 million _ distributed by the fund to various research
and advocacy programs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for McKinley is to raise $100 a foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be many people present who are climbing their own
mountains,'' Knoble says. ``As the going gets tough, I'll be
thinking of them. One of them is a friend who is about to undergo
stem-cell treatment. I'll be thinking if she can get through
another day of therapy, I can take another step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dangerous mountain, but we have a really level-headed
group. We've trained hard, we have excellent guides, we aren't
going to take huge risks. We don't have as much testosterone as
some climbing groups, and that helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoble, a consultant who recently retired from her job as a vice
president for Pacific Telesis, is herself still climbing a medical
mountain. First diagnosed with the cancer in 1993, she had a
recurrence last year and underwent double mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, three Bay Area members of the expedition departed
for Alaska from San Francisco _ Sandy Badillo, a tennis pro in Half
Moon Bay who was diagnosed with breast cancer six years ago; Cathy
Ann Taylor, a Sausalito mountaineer who has worked as a guide in
Nepal and Tibet; and Marcy Ely, a teacher and family counselor who
lives in Napa.
</P>
<P>
   A mountain climber since she was a girl, the 50-year-old Ely
trained arduously for two years for McKinley. She won't be making
the actual climb, however. Last month she learned that the cancer,
first diagnosed in 1991, had returned and spread to her liver and
lymph gland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me pretty hard,'' says Ely, who nonetheless will
participate in a pre-climb, 10-kilometer run on Saturday. She'll
then fly with the climbers to the glacier the following day for the
beginning of the climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no respect for cancer, the havoc it wreaks on all of
us,'' Ely says. ``This is an ugly, terrible disease. To me, it was
like falling into a big crevasse. But I'm not just going to lie
there, I'll get up and fight it every way I can. I like my life,
I'm going to do everything I can to pull myself out of it.''

   GM-FLINT _ A strike at a General Motors Corp. plant in Flint,
Mich. is the start of what could be a series of summer labor brawls

   NIKE _ Retailers have tried many strategies to sell athletic
apparel. Stores have been decorated to look like locker rooms.
Photos of famous football and basketball stars have lined their
walls. Sporting events have been shown on in-store televisions. But
in many cases, women have received short shrift, despite the fact
that they are taking to the field, the pool and the track in
growing numbers. Footwear giant Nike Inc. has taken a step toward
changing this with its new Nike Women's Shops _ stores within a
store dedicated to women's shoes and apparel that were launched in
Maryland in April. The nation's fifth shop _ and its first in Texas
_ will formally open in the month-old Finish Line Inc. athletic
superstore in Barton Creek Square mall today. (Austin

   FPL-RECORDS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Summer's not here yet, but
Florida Power &AMP; Light has already set records for electricity use
throughout the state. FPL officials said customers are pumping up
air conditioning units and putting a noticeable but manageable
strain on their demand. Palm Beach County residents have been
dealing daily with almost record-high temperatures. With a
50-percent humidity level, the heat index, which is how hot it
feels when the humidity is considered, stayed just on this side of

   PALMBEACH-NEIMAN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When high-end
retailer Neiman Marcus announces the grand opening of its Worth
Avenue store in the year 2000 or so, only island residents will
know. Neiman Marcus agreed not to advertise in major local
newspapers, on television, radio or through mass mailings for a
year after it opens. That was only one of many conditions the
Dallas-based retailer agreed to gain approval of a three-story,
48,661-square foot store from the town council by a 4-1 vote. That
did not persuade some residents. ``This is the end of Palm Beach as
we know it,'' said Worth Avenue merchant Ed Kassatly. (O'Meilia,

WOMEN PLAN DENALI CLIMB TO RAISE MONEY FOR BREAST CANCER FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TIBURON, Calif. _ When you're tackling the highest peak in North
America, what's a mere staircase at home, even if you have to
scramble up and down it dozens of times a day?
</P>
<P>
   That's how Nancy Knoble spent the last few days. The summit of
her stairway, dubbed ``packing central,'' became base camp to a
jumble of mountaineering gear, from a blue ice ax to sharp metal
crampons to a green ``Z-Rest,'' a fan-shaped foam pad to cushion
her from glacial cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in your tent, it's amazing how snug you can be,''
says Knoble.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the 50-year-old Marin County resident will head a
three-week expedition to the rarefied heights of Mount McKinley,
the tallest mountain on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   She's leading a particularly resolute band of 12 _ five are
breast cancer survivors, and the remaining climbers are young women
determined to defeat the disease that afflicts one in eight women.
</P>
<P>
   The journey up the mountain, called ``the climb against the
odds,'' is part of a crusade to bring attention to breast cancer,
to raise funds and to instill hope in women taxed by the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Knoble will be carrying, amid a 130-pound load, several
silk prayer scarves that she hopes to plant on the summit in a few
weeks. Among the messages scribbled on the scarves are numerous
words of encouragement: ``Go for it,'' and ``You move us to reach
higher than we've known.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoble's backpack also includes food for 23 days, toiletries, a
digital camera and laptop computer for daily Internet dispatches
(www.breastcancerfund.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``On summit day, someone, I hope, will be strong enough to type
in `We did it,''' Knoble says laughing. ``We're worried about the
weather interfering with our uplink.''
</P>
<P>
   The majestic, 20,320-foot Alaskan mountain, known to many by its
Native American name of Denali, is often treacherous, its weather
fierce and unrelentingly frigid, epitomized during a recent spate
of storms that killed two climbers, one of them a would-be rescuer.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say climbers on Denali are often assaulted by some of
the coldest, windiest weather in the world due to the mountain's
height and proximity to the Arctic Circle. Only about half the
1,100 climbers authorized every year to tackle Denali actually
reach the top, the others falling victim to frostbite or altitude
sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``On summit day, just taking one step is an effort, you need two
or three breaths with each step,'' says Knoble, who reached the
summit in a 1995 breast cancer expedition to Aconcagua. The
Argentine peak is the hihest in South America.
</P>
<P>
   Both expeditions, sponsored by the Breast Cancer Fund, a San
Francisco nonprofit organization founded in 1992, were intended as
metaphors depicting the battle against breast cancer. Aconcagua
raised $1.6 million _ distributed by the fund to various research
and advocacy programs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal for McKinley is to raise $100 a foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be many people present who are climbing their own
mountains,'' Knoble says. ``As the going gets tough, I'll be
thinking of them. One of them is a friend who is about to undergo
stem-cell treatment. I'll be thinking if she can get through
another day of therapy, I can take another step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dangerous mountain, but we have a really level-headed
group. We've trained hard, we have excellent guides, we aren't
going to take huge risks. We don't have as much testosterone as
some climbing groups, and that helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoble, a consultant who recently retired from her job as a vice
president for Pacific Telesis, is herself still climbing a medical
mountain. First diagnosed with the cancer in 1993, she had a
recurrence last year and underwent double mastectomies.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, three Bay Area members of the expedition departed
for Alaska from San Francisco _ Sandy Badillo, a tennis pro in Half
Moon Bay who was diagnosed with breast cancer six years ago; Cathy
Ann Taylor, a Sausalito mountaineer who has worked as a guide in
Nepal and Tibet; and Marcy Ely, a teacher and family counselor who
lives in Napa.
</P>
<P>
   A mountain climber since she was a girl, the 50-year-old Ely
trained arduously for two years for McKinley. She won't be making
the actual climb, however. Last month she learned that the cancer,
first diagnosed in 1991, had returned and spread to her liver and
lymph gland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me pretty hard,'' says Ely, who nonetheless will
participate in a pre-climb, 10-kilometer run on Saturday. She'll
then fly with the climbers to the glacier the following day for the
beginning of the climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no respect for cancer, the havoc it wreaks on all of
us,'' Ely says. ``This is an ugly, terrible disease. To me, it was
like falling into a big crevasse. But I'm not just going to lie
there, I'll get up and fight it every way I can. I like my life,
I'm going to do everything I can to pull myself out of it.''

RAINS EASE WILDFIRE CRISIS IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Light rains throughout Mexico are helping thin the
number of wildfires in the country, but the heavy rains needed to
douse the largest blazes might not come until next month, U.S.
relief officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And once the fires are out, officials say, global agricultural
experts must eradicate the slash-and-burn techniques responsible
for countless fires each year.
</P>
<P>
   The fires and how to prevent them will be on the agenda when
Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo meets with President Clinton
next week on a trip to address the United Nations World Drug
Summit, said J. Brian Atwood, administrator for the Agency for
International Development.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Mexican wildfires have dropped from 273 on May 24
to 143 on Thursday, Atwood told foreign correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light rains have begun in some areas (of the country), but
they are not enough to put the fires out,'' Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must still wait on the advent of the rainy season to get
the heavy rains that will end the fire season,'' he said. ``And we
still think that those rains could be delayed until early July.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman led an
observation team on a three-day tour to assess U.S. assistance to
Mexican firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The team visited the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, where about
half of the country's wildfires are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   The hot spot remains the Chimalapas jungle preserve in Oaxaca,
where more than 1,700 firefighters are pitted against a network of
blazes in roadless, jungle-clad ravines.
</P>
<P>
   Dense smoke often grounds government helicopters, forcing
firefighters to slog for hours across mountainous terrain to reach
fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60 Mexicans have died fighting the fires.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood and Glickman spoke of the scale of the disaster in nearly
apocalyptic terms. Nearly 30,000 fires have been registered in
Mexico and Central America since December. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This disaster is the most severe in the world; it is even
worse than what happened last year in Indonesia and more difficult
to fight,'' Atwood said, referring to the raging wildfires in that
southeast Asian nation. ``I don't think there has ever been a
disaster of this magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman called the fires ``a threat to the United States'
environmental security.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say fires set by farmers to clear land are
responsible, but an intense drought in Mexico and Central America
contributed to this year's wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   Slash-and-burn clearing claims one acre of global forest land
hourly.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is ubiquitous in Asia, Latin America and Africa; 20
percent of the greenhouse gases put into the world's atmosphere
annually come from forest and agricultural fires, Atwood said.

ABORTION EMERGES EARLY AS AN ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In his primary campaign, ``experience money
can't buy'' was how Lt. Gov. Gray Davis distinguished himself from
his Democratic opponents.
</P>
<P>
   For the general election race, the newly minted nominee running
against Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren has found a new
mantra: ``pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days into the campaign for the November 3 election, Davis
has already seized on his opponent's opposition to abortion to try
to paint him as an extremist.
</P>
<P>
   The former two-term controller pounded the theme home at a
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League rally in
San Francisco Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision for California is much closer to the mainstream than
Dan Lungren's: I am strongly pro-choice. He's not,'' Davis told 30
mostly women supporters at the event led by NARAL president Kate
Michelman.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is hoping a pro-abortion rights message will resonate with
uncommitted women voters _ especially independents and moderate
Republicans _ whose support he needs in what is expected to be a
close race.
</P>
<P>
   State politics watchers say the message plays well with voters
who view support for abortion rights as a litmus test, but may have
little effect on the electorate at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems less likely that it will swing the women's vote, if
such a thing exists,'' said Mary Hughes, a San Francisco-based
political consultant. Hughes said most women are more interested in
issues like education, public safety and health care _ the
``benchmark issues that women pay a lot of attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the public is divided on abortion: while 60 percent
of Americans identify themselves as ``pro-choice,'' many dislike
late-term abortions and would support parental consent for minors
seeking abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't favor a constitutional amendment prohibiting
abortion, but they don't like abortion either,'' said John Pitney
Jr., political scientist and former Republican party official. ``So
an emphasis on this issue could backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion was never much of an issue in the primary. The three
major Democratic candidates all backed abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   As a congressman, Lungren co-sponsored the ``human life
amendment,'' a failed measure to overturn Roe vs. Wade. A devout
Catholic, he also voted to cut federal funding for abortions and
for family planning services.
</P>
<P>
   Staking his own claim to the center, Lungren has sought to
moderate his abortion stance. As governor, he says he would seek
only three changes: ending taxpayer-funded abortions and late-term
procedures, and reinstating a state law requiring parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's strategists maintain that abortion is a minor issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would defy Gray Davis or any of those he was standing with
to show me any poll that shows this is the issue voters care most
about,'' said Dave Puglia, Lungren's campaign manager. ``It is
education, crime and taxes, in that order.''

READY FOR SOME MORE FOOTBALL? NBC, TURNER APPEAR SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, are you ready for some football?
</P>
<P>
   How about some more football.
</P>
<P>
   And more football. And more, and more, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Well, get ready. I mean, get ready. Because it looks like it's
a-coming unless someone knocks some sense into the folks at NBC and
TNT/TBS right quick.
</P>
<P>
   A good clean blitz hit by Junior Seau ought to do it.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been following this ongoing non-story, General
Electric's NBC and Time Warner's cable networks are considering
launching a new pro football league by as early as 1999 that would
compete against the NFL and its network partners, ABC, ESPN, Fox
and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Left at the altar by NFL owners when future TV broadcast rights
were auctioned off, NBC and TNT are looking for programming to fill
what now looms as a gaping hole in their entertainment schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heidi'', apparently, is not available.
</P>
<P>
   We can sympathize with their loss. In the fragmented TV world of
today, where viewers can and do pick from dozens of channels,
networks have a harder and harder time attracting large,
demographically attractive viewing audiences for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Pro football is still the best way to capture the attention of
one of those key audiences, young adult males. Losing the NFL,
which NBC and Turner did when they chose not to ante up the
billions necessary to stay in the game, cost the networks
significant advertising revenue and prestige for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the new league proposal like to think of the
plan as a revenge scheme. Who knows? Maybe vengeance is a part of
it. Getting back at the folks who run the NFL would be great sport
for the jilted networks. But the guess here is that, in the
sobering light of day, the networks are far more businesslike than
that implies.
</P>
<P>
   Is starting a new league good business, though?
</P>
<P>
   Not even the networks seem completely certain of that yet. On
the plus side, there may be some advertisers out there who'd look
at a new league as a viable alternative, given the soaring ad rates
being charged by the NFL. Also, there may be some economic benefits
to the networks owning their own league _ eliminating the middle
man, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   For now, executives at NBC and Turner will only say they're
moving close to a commitment which they are likely to announce in a
few months.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping they eventually come to the conclusion that it's
not in their best economic interest.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a new league is not in the interest of football fans.
Salaries in the NFL, thanks to the new TV deal, are on their way to
rocketing to an average of more than $1 million per player. Yet,
quality is hardly up, thanks to constant expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Depth at the skill positions in the league is particularly
suspect. Spreading the limited number of capable quarterbacks, for
one, across a dozen teams in a new league will only water down a
product like a ballpark beer.
</P>
<P>
   The viewing appetite for a new league also seems limited, at
least based on history. Did anybody really watch the USFL, the WFL
or, now, NFL Europe?
</P>
<P>
   Thought not.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, how about that Rhein Fire?
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, you could excuse Donald Trump and other millionaires
for financing franchises in startup football leagues. Besides their
considerable egos, they were fueled by the memories of that great
success, the American Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL wrestled the brawnier NFL to the mat, sure, but that was
30 years ago when the sports and television landscape was quite
different.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL had far fewer teams then, so there were far more
talented football players looking for work in the pro game. The NFL
had become rather conservative in its play calling, too, creating
demand for the AFL's wide-open style of play. Further, lots of
growing, attractive markets craved pro sports franchises back then,
and the American TV viewing audience was just in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there was lots of room to grow. Now, there is far
less.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is there plenty of pro football, there is college game
after college game every Saturday afternoon and evening in the
fall. There is a possibility that the new league would play in the
summer, but you remember how well that idea has worked in the past.

<P>
   Either way, football fans know a glut when they see one.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, stodgy as it is, could use a good shaking up or two.
Just listening to the incessant thumb-sucking debate over something
like instant replay makes you want to head butt your Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to borrow another league's pet phrase, the NFL got game _
and ain't nobody else gonna get it.

   ORE-ASSISTED-SUICIDE (Washington) _ Reversing a previous
government threat to suspend the licenses of physicians who help
people kill themselves, Attorney General Reno says Justice
Department will not intervene in Oregon's assisted-suicide law, the
first of its kind in the country. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-U.S. (Undated) _ Ira Magaziner will announce the White
House's new proposal for overhauling the Internet's naming and
address system. The proposal will refine a plan announced earlier
this year to turn over management of the system to the private
sector and stimulate competition for registering new Internet
addresses. By Amy Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BUDGET (New York) _ In defiance of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
the City Council voted on Friday to approve its own version of the
city budget. It sets up one of the more contentious fights yet
between the council and the mayor, and it may eventually be left to
the courts to decide which side will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The economy added more jobs than
expected in May, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at a
28-year low of 4.3 percent. Payrolls expanded by 296,000 people
last month, exceeding forecasts of a gain of about 220,000. April's
employment gain was revised upward to 302,000 from the initial
estimate of 262,000. By Sylvia Nasar.
</P>
<P>
   SEX-CONVERSATION (Undated) _ In corporate conference rooms, in
dentists' chairs, and over dinner, the continuing news about both
Viagra and Monica Lewinsky appears to have accelerated a change in
the way many Americans speak about a subject that some would prefer
be barely spoken about at all. In recent months, the subject of sex
and the language of sex acts and sex organs have been nudged a few
inches closer to the conversationally commonplace. By Janny Scott.
</P>
<P>
   BOX-FIGHT-CANCELED (New York) _ Evander Holyfield's heavyweight
title fight against Henry Akinwande appears to be off after
Akinwande tested positive for hepatitis B. This follows a female
fighter being disqualified because she was pregnant. If the card
goes off at all, Roberto Duran, the 47-year-old Panamanian, will be
the headliner. It all amounts to boxing's comedy of errors in a
sports facility that pledged to get back into the business.

VOTERS WOULD PREFER DEBATES TO TV COMMERCIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL SIGNER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ As the dust settles from the Democratic
gubernatorial primary, we Californians should congratulate
ourselves on finally learning not to be duped by television
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   For years we were mesmerized, even intoxicated, by expensive,
glowing television commercials with vivid graphics, flowing music
and easy-to-swallow sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   As Lt. Gov. Gray Davis noted, ``In California politics, if
you're not on TV, you don't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Californians are getting smarter. After two generations of
television politics, we're finally remembering that real
politicians like Davis get to know their constituents over the
years through face-to-face, extended conversations. Fundamentally,
real politics is about building trust over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The political philosopher Hannah Arendt wrote that for the
ancient Greeks and Romans, ``courage was the political virtue par
excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians had to cross what she called the ``gulf between the
sheltered life in the household and the merciless exposure of the
polis.''
</P>
<P>
   The point was this: Politics was hard. Politicians had to learn
to sweat, to take hard knocks in front of tough crowds. The lesson?
It takes courage to gain voters' respect.
</P>
<P>
   But TV politics are shown to TV audiences, who can't talk back.
National voting rates have declined, from 65 percent of eligible
voters in 1960 to less than 50 percent today. Can this have
something to do with the decline of real politics?
</P>
<P>
   We cannot and should not, however, entirely blame television
which, in many cases, serves as an efficient means for engaging the
citizenry. The trick is to achieve a balance, which is not
difficult. It simply requires making TV politics more like real
politics.
</P>
<P>
   An example: As campaign manager of a 1996 congressional
candidate in Massachusetts, I noted that statewide politics there
are treated more like a sporting event than a soap opera. John
Kerry and Bill Weld had six _ count 'em _ six hour-long televised
debates during prime time in the months before the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   The debates were treated like championship football games.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists drove up public excitement, and citizens crowded
around TV sets in living rooms and bars. The next day, the debate
was the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the rub: The debates were good. Because the
politicians weren't allowed to dupe citizens with sound bites, they
were subjected to Arendt's ``merciless exposure of the polis.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld and Kerry had to sweat it. On stage without a net, they had
to appeal to their audiences by talking about real issues, in
depth. The common complaint became, ``Why can't we have them
both?''
</P>
<P>
   That was real politics. How different it has been in California,
where wannabe politicians sit in an air-conditioned TV studio and,
after dozens of takes and a lot of fancy cutting and graphic
design, pay for ``politics'' by giving checks to consultants and TV
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Bah. This is not real politics. It's adolescent blackbox
theater.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope. After nominating workhorse Gray Davis, let's
get some real politics going between him and the Republican
nominee, Dan Lungren. Californians should advocate a grueling,
substantive, non-sound-bite set of at least five hour-long,
prime-time TV debates.
</P>
<P>
   The networks will make money if the debates are publicized with
vim and vigor. And Californians will trust Lungren and Davis more
if they feel as if they've gotten to known them, at length and in
their own words.
</P>
<P>
   California's leader should have the courage to step in front of
the crowd and risk a few rotten tomatoes, if that's what it takes.
Our greatest politicians, like Daniel Webster and Abraham Lincoln,
gained their fame on the public platform. They look like giants
next to today's celluloid actors.

HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS MARK 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF ESCAPE FROM NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Holocaust survivors from around the world are
holding a reunion here this weekend to mark the 60th anniversary of
the first ``Kindertransport,'' an effort to help Jewish children
escape the Nazis just before and during World War II by fleeing to
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 of the 10,000 Jewish children who left Germany,
Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland on trains and then ships for
Britain between 1938 and 1940 are attending the reunion, some of
them meeting one another for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one part of the Holocaust where the end result was
life, not death,'' said Tamara Meyer, a spokeswoman for the
Washington-based Kindertransport Association. ``It's the story of
love _ the story of one country that opened its doors and allowed
children to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the reunion, which started Friday and goes
through Sunday in the Washington suburb of Arlington, Va., are
taking part in workshops, hearing speeches and sharing stories of
their lives after their escape. They will visit the United States
Holocaust Museum in Washington on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the survivors now live in the United States. Some have
come from Europe, some from Israel and some from as far away as
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1938, Jewish leaders in Europe and in the United
States appealed to major western nations to take in the Jewish
children under Nazi Germany's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jews knew the horror firsthand,'' said Melissa Hacker, a
filmmaker who recently finished a documentary about the
Kindertransports. ``They wrote to newspapers, they wrote to the
governments of different countries _ anyone that could help them.''
</P>
<P>
   But only Britain responded.
</P>
<P>
   The United States _ then plagued by the Great Depression,
various outbreaks of antisemitism and a strict immigration quota _
denied their appeal, Hacker said.
</P>
<P>
   Children left their parents behind as they fled to England. They
lived with foster families or in orphanages in England, Ireland,
Scotland and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their parents died in Nazi death camps, Meyer said.
``But these survivors say they are the lucky ones,'' she added.
``They are grateful that they never worked in the camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Eva Burger, a Kindertransport survivor now living in Silver
Spring, Md., was 13 when she and her two sisters were rushed out of
their home town, Vienna, Austria, and shipped to London in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very sad and traumatic,'' Burger recalled. ``I didn't
know what was happening. I just wanted to take care of my little
sisters and not be apart from them.''
</P>
<P>
   But when they arrived in England, the three sisters were sent to
different foster families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tragic time for us, but looking back, I think
all of the people who took care us did the best they could,''
Burger said.
</P>
<P>
   Burger, who only spoke German at the time, said language and
cultural barriers made her new life in England more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   She was eventually reunited nine years later with her sisters
and their mother, who had survived the death camps. Her mother told
them their father had died in one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living because people made sacrifices,'' Burger said.
``Our parents, our foster families, the British government,
everyone. We need to remind each other of that.''

REPORTS OF BOB HOPE'S DEATH GREATLY EXAGGERATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Leader Dick Armey made Bob Hope
laugh on Friday, but he bombed in Congress with an erroneous report
that the beloved comedian had died.
</P>
<P>
   In another reminder of the perils of Internet news, Armey,
R-Texas, spread a premature report of Hope's death after The
Associated Press mistakenly put an advance copy of the 95-year-old
showman's obituary on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   One of Armey's aides gave the Internet story to Armey, who
handed it to Rep. Bob Stump of Arizona and asked Stump to announce
the death on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   The news caught everyone by surprise _ including Hope, who was
eating breakfast at his California home when his death was
announced. Ward Grant, Hope's longtime friend and spokesman, said
he immediately called Hope's home to check the veracity of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob roared with laughter,'' Grant said. ``He said, `They were
wrong, weren't they?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake was no laughing matter in Washington, where Stump
and Armey were deluged with phone calls from reporters and Hope
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize to Bob Hope, his family and the entire nation for
the erroneous announcement made on the House floor today,'' a
red-face Armey said in a prepared statement. ``I regret this
announcement and look forward to many more happy memories from a
wonderful entertainer and distinguished American.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quickly removed the offending item from its
Web site. News organizations routinely prepare obituaries on
prominent people who are ill or old, but the stories, obviously,
are not intended for public release until the subject is, in fact,
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said Hope has become accustomed to premature reports of
his death, although none of the previous rumors warranted mention
on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it nice to know that even the high and mighty can make
mistakes,'' Hope's pal said.

NOTHING, IT APPEARS, IS OFF-LIMITS IN GENERAL CONVERSATION
ANYMORE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANNY SCOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In corporate conference rooms, in dentists' chairs and over
dinner, the continuing news about both Viagra and Monica Lewinsky
appears to have accelerated a change in the way many Americans
speak about a subject that some would prefer be barely spoken about
at all.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the subjects of sex and the language
describing sex acts and sex organs have been nudged a few inches
closer to the conversationally commonplace. Many Americans say they
have found themselves using words they would never previously have
used, discussing erectile dysfunction at dinner parties, talking to
their children about adultery, laughing (uncomfortably) at sex
jokes told in the presence of people like their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Schwartz, the director of the Masters &AMP; Johnson Clinic
in St. Louis, recently visited a new dentist for the first time and
says he became the audience for a battery of jokes about oral sex
told by the dentist, a man, in the presence of a female hygienist.
</P>
<P>
   At a black-tie dinner at the New York Botanical Garden last
month attended by 1,100 people, Peter Bijur, the chairman and chief
executive of Texaco, strode to the podium and opened with a joke
suggesting that some of the floral centerpieces were having
Viagra-assisted erections.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria in
Manhattan, at a black-tie gala for the National Osteoporosis
Foundation, Lesley Stahl, the correspondent for CBS's ``60
Minutes,'' stood up before 800 people to accept an award and
delivered an almost identical joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now speak about the unspeakable as though it were fruit
salad,'' said Elizabeth Gould Hemmerdinger, a writer who with her
husband, H. Dale Hemmerdinger, a New York City real estate
executive, regularly holds dinner parties in their apartment on
Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word `erection' is something I couldn't say until six
weeks ago,'' she said. ``It was something that I wouldn't
ordinarily bring into a conversation with a man who might be the
head of a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, it was bad form in certain circles to speak of
a ``breast'' of chicken. For many years, the word ``pregnant'' was
not uttered on television. Married couples in sitcoms occupied twin
beds and television comedy writers were prohibited from using the
word ``penis'' on the air.
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed, and not just in the last six months. Some
trace the more explicit conversations about sex back to 1948, when
Alfred Kinsey's book ``Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' inspired
a national discussion of sex. Then came Masters and Johnson, Shere
Hite, cohabitation, gay rights and eventually AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we've had this dialogue for a long time,'' said Pepper
Schwartz, a sociologist at the University of Washington who studies
sexuality, family and gender. ``What has happened now is that
barriers of discussion have been broken in terms of actual acts
being done by specific people.''
</P>
<P>
   One big reason for that has been the attention lavished by the
news media on issues like Gennifer Flowers' account of what she
said was a 12-year affair with President Clinton along with Paula
Corbin Jones' graphic allegation that the president had
propositioned her in a hotel room in Little Rock, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other examples: the coverage of the relationship
of Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado and Donna Rice; the arrest of Paul
Reubens, the actor who played Pee Wee Herman, on charges of
indecent exposure; the case of Lorena Bobbitt, who cut off her
husband's penis, and the trial of Marv Albert, the sportscaster, on
sexual assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening wedge really was the Bobbitt thing,'' said Robin
Lakoff, a professor of linguistics at the University of California
at Berkeley. ``That was when people could first say `penis.' I
remember a month there when you could not turn on the television
but some news show was saying `penis' at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in January, the charges that Clinton had an affair with a
White House intern, Ms. Lewinsky, catapulted oral sex onto the
front page, trailing behind it unsubstantiated rumors of such
things as a semen-stained dress and rumpled tissues retrieved from
the trash. Two months later, the Food and Drug Administration's
approval of Viagra put impotence at the top of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, men were all over television, testifying about
erectile dysfunction. Bob Dole, the former senator, volunteered on
``Larry King Live'' on CNN that he had used Viagra. Even his wife,
Elizabeth Dole, president of the American Red Cross, was induced by
a reporter to comment on Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning, I open up the paper and say, `This is another
part of the Pepper Schwartz right-to-work law,''' said Professor
Schwartz, the sociologist. ``I've been studying sex for 25 years
and this is just like the Gold Rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Letitia Baldrige, the authority on manners, tosses a Viagra joke
into lectures. Robert Knight, the director of cultural studies for
the conservative Family Research Council, recalls parents chatting
about Albert's sexual proclivities on the sidelines of a Little
League game in suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Haffner, president of the Sexuality Information and
Education Council of the United States, also volunteers as a Sunday
school teacher in Westport, Conn., and recently found herself faced
with an eighth-grade class's questions about why Ms. Lewinsky might
have saved a semen-stained dress.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Lee, the medical director for Partners Community Health
Care, a network of doctors and hospitals in Boston, recalls the
discussion that ensued at a meeting at his office when it was
announced that one health insurance company would cover the cost of
12 Viagra pills a month.
</P>
<P>
   First there was dead silence. Then a senior executive in her 40s
said, ``That seems like a lot.'' Everyone burst out laughing, Lee
said. ``Maybe for you!'' someone called out. Another said, ``They
must not have young children!''
</P>
<P>
   One colleague told Lee that she did not believe the estimates of
the average number of times couples have intercourse in a month.
She suggested that men running health maintenance organizations
were authorizing more pills than necessary, in a kind of sexual
swaggering.
</P>
<P>
   ``With those comments, people were revealing something about how
often they are having sex,'' Lee said with some amazement. ``Just
to have these conversations is shocking. People are making
references to each other's sexual function that are
unprecedented.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Neil Lewis, a 55-year-old management psychologist in Atlanta,
was eating lunch with the chief executive of a company that had
hired him as a consultant on organization effectiveness, when he
was startled to be solicited for advice on whether the man should
try Viagra, the pill to treat impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Marx, a writer and one of a half-dozen women who took
part in a round-table discussion of the sexual allegations against
Clinton, the transcript of which appeared in The New York Observer,
said it seemed as if new, usable words have been added to the
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these words, I just followed people's cues in when to
use them,'' she said. ``I would have beaten around the bush and
used euphemisms, but when the newspapers and the media start using
them then I feel I can use them without being embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, news media coverage has legitimized language
and topics once considered taboo. Stories with sexual elements are
reported on the evening news, dissected on talk shows and picked up
by late-night comedians, whose jokes resurface the next day at the
proverbial water cooler.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the Lewinsky story broke and Ted Koppel on
``Nightline'' on ABC gamely took up the question of whether oral
sex constitutes adultery, one media research organization has
counted hundreds and hundreds of jokes about Clinton's sex life on
four late-night comedy shows.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public
Affairs in Washington, said Jay Leno, David Letterman, Conan
O'Brien, and Bill Maher told 729 jokes about Clinton's sex life in
their monologues in the first five months of 1998 (compared with
about 250 in all 12 months of 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Chris Kelly, the head writer for ``Politically Incorrect,''
Maher's show, said Maher had recently sent a monologue back to the
show's writers that they had just completed. He wanted different
jokes because 80 percent of the ones they had written were about
Clinton's private parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hurt us in the quality satire game,'' Kelly said of the
glut of sexually oriented news stories. ``In that you now can use
old dirty jokes and call them jokes about the president. It's
lowered our standards and raised the stakes: What can we do next?''
</P>
<P>
   The shift is visible elsewhere. Karlyn Bowman, a resident fellow
at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington who studies
public opinion and demographic trends, says pollsters are now using
terminology she had never seen in survey research.
</P>
<P>
   When Elmo Roper first asked a question about male adultery in a
1943 poll, he used the euphemism ``untrue to their wives,'' Ms.
Bowman said. In 1939, he asked respondents to say whether they
considered premarital sex ``right, unfortunate or wicked.''
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Yankelovich Partners asked bluntly whether the
president should submit to an examination of his genitals if
ordered to do so by the court in the Jones case. A question in a
different poll repeated verbatim Ms. Jones' description of what she
said Clinton did in her presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way from talking about being `untrue,''' Ms.
Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sees a difference in what Americans are talking
about. Some say they believe that most people have always spoken
about sex and made jokes about it; the only difference now, they
contend, is that the news media are doing it too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' said Debbie Stoller, 35, an editor of Bust, an
alternative women's magazine based in New York City. ``It's like
hearing your parents having sex: We know they know about it, it's
just that they're never supposed to let on that they know about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who do believe that things have changed, some say it
is for the better. Anything that makes people more comfortable
discussing sex is good, they reason. Others, however, worry that
talk of sex is coarsening public conversation and edging out more
urgent topics.
</P>
<P>
   Rochelle Gurstein, a historian at the Bard Graduate Center in
New York City and the author of ``The Repeal of Reticence'' (Hill &AMP;
Wang, 1996), which explores the evolution of what Americans can say
and do in public, says the changes denigrate the lives of public
figures and trivialize discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Weisberg, a professor at the Benjamin Cardozo School of
Law and a Guggenheim Fellow, is studying what he calls the
``privatization of public discourse'' _ the clogging up of the
``public space'' with conversation about things once thought of as
private, like the sex lives of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kelly, the comedy writer, is inclined to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking about someone else's sex life is a waste of time,''
he said one afternoon recently. ``You lose time to do other things,
like politics or comedy or art or science. I think it's easy and I
think it's a shame. And I'll be doing some more in about 45
minutes.''

ISOLATED ISRAELI SETTLERS PREFER NOT TO DWELL ON UNCERTAIN FUTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OFRA, West Bank _ Yoyoda and Tamar Nizri are staying put. For
the young Israeli couple, the wild deer and unspoiled landscape
surrounding this isolated West Bank settlement is enough to
persuade them to remain.
</P>
<P>
   They don't think much about the prospect that their settlement
15 miles north of Ramallah is likely to become an enclave in a sea
of Palestinian-controlled land if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
carries out the long-awaited troop withdrawal that Clinton
administration mediators have been pressing.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do they dwell on a recent statement by Netanyahu that he is
``close'' to accepting a deal, possibly the U.S. plan, which would
leave 40 percent of the West Bank under full or partial Palestinian
control. No official map of the land Israel would give up has been
made public, and Netanyahu said an unofficial one published by the
Hebrew daily Haaretz on Friday was not up to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live here now and we don't think about what will be,'' said
Tamar Nizri, a 19-year-old newlywed with freckles and blonde hair
wrapped in a tie-dyed scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, who teaches Jewish studies to secular Israeli
children in Jerusalem said, ``Maybe if we think about it, we will
be afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Their sentiments echo those of many of the 161,000 Jewish
settlers sprinkled throughout the West Bank. Shocked by the
prospect of living as Israeli satellites in what will likely become
Palestine in any final peace deal, many settlers prefer not to
dwell too much on an uncertain future. Instead, they take each day
at a time and hope that their government will find a way to keep
all of the 144 West Bank settlements under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cloudy situation,'' said Nizri's husband, Yoyoda, 22.
``We ignore it. Because if you think about it, then you can't live
in a way that plans for the future, you can't have peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But as U.S. pressure on Israel to cede additional territory to
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority grows, the settlers'
ambiguous situation grows harder to ignore. For months, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright has been pushing Israel to withdraw
from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank, and Netanyahu has,
in public at least, held firm with an offer of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The implication has been that giving up more than 9 percent of
the West Bank would endanger Israel's security, but few people here
know exactly how it would. Netanyahu has guarded his negotiating
positions so closely that even members of his own Cabinet complain
that no one has seen the official map except the four members of
the inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. mediators have not drawn up maps to avoid seeming to be
deciding on Israel's security, which they have said only Israel can
decide. The 13 percent figure was chosen so that the Palestinians,
who now fully or partially control 27 percent of the West Bank,
would hold an even 40 percent when negotiations on a final peace
deal begin.
</P>
<P>
   That means settlers have had to guess for themselves what the
various proposals would hold for them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they asked a Hebrew University hydrologist, Haim
Gvirtzman, to draw up maps so they could determine how much land
could be ceded to Palestinians while keeping all settlements in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Gvirtzman, a religious settler from the West Bank settlement of
Dolev, determined that Israel would be able to withdraw from only
30 percent _ about the amount already turned over to Palestinian
control. Anything more would affect at least some settlements,
Gvirtzman determined.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gvirtzman's maps. which were eventually published
by the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan
University, a 9 percent Israeli withdrawal would affect about 1,700
settlers living in 10 settlements. If the percentage jumps to 13,
about 9,000 settlers in 18 settlements would be affected. Ofra,
home to the Nizris, would be cut off from Israeli-controlled
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leaders are slightly more vague, partly because they
want to keep the focus on Israel's security rather than on the more
political argument over the viability of settlements that
Palestinians and left-wing Israelis view as the main ``obstacle''
to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Yehudit Tayar, who speaks for an umbrella settler organization
called Yesha, said only that ``about 20 communities'' would be
affected if Israel met the Clinton administration halfway with an
11 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find a community that's not going to be affected
one way or the other _ it could be water, it could be electricity,
it could be access roads,'' she said. ``But 11 percent would
isolate certain settlements where you would have one access road
surrounded by Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid these concerns, Ariel Sharon, Israel's formidable security
hawk and a member of Netanyahu's inner circle, has focused in
public on military issues whenever he tours the West Bank. He
follows the Israeli consensus with the view that Israel must retain
the Jordan Valley, the Judea Desert and a wide corridor to
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But in his view, Israel must also retain the mountain of western
Samaria, under which a major water aquifer lies, hilltops near
Nablus, where early warning stations are located, and a radius
around Ben Gurion Airport east of Tel Aviv that would cut into part
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   While Sharon's concerns are aimed at Israelis, they have the
potential to affect tens of thousands of Palestinians who live in
these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu argues that 98 percent of the Palestinian population
is under Palestinian rule. But that figure is slightly misleading:
98 percent are under the Palestinian Authority's civilian control _
meaning Palestinian officials collect taxes and run schools there _
but only 37 percent of Palestinians fall under the full
jurisdiction of Arafat's entity, according to Gvirtzman.
</P>
<P>
   For the Palestinians, the difference is crucial: Israeli
soldiers cannot enter areas under full control of the Palestinian
Authority, but the Israelis still patrol areas they jointly control
with the Palestinians, and they can still set up roadblocks, make
arrests and impose curfews in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the Nizris, Sharon's concerns may make little
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by more Palestinian villages than Israeli
settlements, Ofra stands a chance to survive any further withdrawal
only if Israel builds a by-pass road connecting it to the Jordan
Valley to the east.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, the Nizris don't know what they would do. Far
from the stereotype of the settler armed with a machine gun and a
mission to reclaim the land of the Bible and prevent a Palestinian
state, the Nizris might move north to the Galilee region or south
to the Negev Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Or they may stay near Ofra in their tiny home with their
3-month-old baby, bean bags on the floor and wooden Indian carvings
on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this land is ours,'' said Yoyoda Nizri. ``And I
believe we should live here. But I didn't come here for those
reasons. Anywhere we live in Israel will strengthen our country,
and I don't see a difference between here and anywhere else.``

REAL QUIET TRIES TO MAKE HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBBIE ARRINGTON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. -- Bob Baffert figures he's done all he can do to
prepare Real Quiet for today's rendevous with history. Now, he just
has to hang loose and wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hardest part _ the waiting,'' said the white-haired
trainer Friday morning after watching his Kentucky Derby and
Preakness champion lope around Belmont's sweeping curves. ``I know
I won't sleep tonight. I just want this thing to be over.''
</P>
<P>
   That wait will end late this afternoon when Real Quiet enters
the starting gate for the 130th Belmont Stakes, the 1{-mile test of
the champion.
</P>
<P>
   If the skinny bay colt with a crooked leg manages to win, Real
Quiet will become only the 12th horse ever to wear the Triple Crown
and the first in two decades. Affirmed was the last to accomplish
this Herculean task, 20 years ago to the day.
</P>
<P>
   A victory would be worth $5.6 million to a horse that cost only
$17,000, a bargain Cinderella that Baffert nicknamed the Fish
because of his long and narrow build. Now, the Fish has turned into
a shark, ready to devour his 12 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, a former Long Beach resident, found himself in this
same position at last year's Belmont with ``Double Crown'' hero
Silver Charm. But the big gray came an arm's length short of
winning the grueling Belmont, finishing second to Touch Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is luck and coincidence,'' said Baffert about his
back-to-back Triple Crown tries, the first in a century of racing
tradition. ``But I do believe in the Derby gods and the Triple
Crown gods, too. My owners are generous, wonderful people. When you
live a good life, you'll be rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Those gods have been smiling a lot on Team Baffert. After early
forecasts for thunderstorms, today's weather is expected to be
breezy and warm under sunny skies. A crowd of 70,000 is expected to
come out to root for Real Quiet, Baffert and owner Mike Pegram.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of the Fish has astounded many longtime race watchers,
but Baffert has a ready explanation. ``The sport of kings can be
very intimidating to people. But you can get lucky; we've shown
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Several critics have blasted Real Quiet, winner of only four of
14 starts, as unworthy of the Triple Crown. But Baffert ignores
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People keep knocking our horse and us because we came from
humble beginnings,'' continued the 45-year-old trainer. ``It's just
like President Clinton. He's doing a great job, but people keep
knocking him. We're from the same generation. So is Mike (Pegram).
We're all regular guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram agreed. ``President Clinton doesn't act any differently
now than before he became president. Success didn't change us. We
didn't have to go through the Depression or fight World War II, but
we've had our own social crises to deal with. We look at the world
a helluva lot differently than someone in their 60s. We're more
kicked back, not as serious. We've done a good job, but some folks
still won't give us any credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram, a self-made millionaire who went from flipping burgers
to owning 22 McDonalds franchises, added another similarity between
himself, Baffert and Clinton. ``We all eat at McDonalds.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Real Quiet, Pegram sees him as the people's pony. ``This
horse belongs to the fans. They're the ones who really make racing.
We want people to feel like they're part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's still one mammoth hurdle for Real Quiet to overcome.
Baffert regards Victory Gallop, who finished second behind Real
Quiet in both prior classics, as the main rival again. ``But I
don't really pay attention to who else is in the race. I can only
worry about my own horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that can get him beat is bad racing luck,'' he
added. ``His only vulnerability is having a guy like me train
him.''
</P>
<P>
   His instructions to jockey Kent Desormeaux will be simple.
``It's a huge field and I'll tell Kent to get him around that first
turn clean, then I guarantee he'll be fine the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   After only three days, Real Quiet has acclimated beautifully to
this Long Island race track. Exercise rider Larry Damore beamed
after Friday's morning jog, reporting that Real Quiet handled
Belmont's sandy surface better than Pimlico, home of the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hitting on all cylinders,'' said Baffert. ``He used to
gawk around, but now he's intensely focused and very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   No Baffert fans will be rooting harder for Real Quiet than Bob
and Beverly Lewis, the owners of Silver Charm. The Newport Beach
couple flew to New York to watch another of their horses, Baquero,
compete on Belmont Day's stakes-heavy undercard. But they say
they'd like nothing better than to see Real Quiet do what Silver
Charm couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're stablemates,'' said Bob Lewis. ``Silver Charm has been
stabled right next to Real Quiet at Churchill Downs and, if I know
my horse, he's been whispering to him, giving him instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises sympathize with the Real Quiet camp. ``Last year at
this time, I was thinking, `God, I wish this thing would get over
with!' '' he added. ``The longest three weeks of our 51 years of
marriage was that time between the Preakness and the Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   Those three weeks are almost over again. Baffert planned to
spend Friday night at Yankee Stadium with his sons, he said.
``Then, I'll do what I did last year: Go back to the hotel room,
have a couple of brewskis and try to relax.''

SEISMIC WATCHERS QUESTION NUCLEAR TESTING CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some of the recent Indian and Pakistani nuclear
tests might have been ``muffs'' that were either extremely weak or
failed to explode as designed, a top expert says.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian government said it they exploded five nuclear
devices, and the Pakistanis six, in underground tests between May
11 and May 30. Seismic waves from those explosions rippled through
the Earth's crust, and some were detected by seismographs hundreds
and thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   However, Western seismologists are investigating the possibility
that the Indians and Pakistanis successfully detonated fewer bombs
than claimed, according to Thorne Lay of the University of
California at Santa Cruz, an adviser to the U.S. government on
monitoring of nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   The tests ``may have included `muffs' that failed to achieve the
anticipated (explosive) yield,'' said Lay, a geophysicist who
chaired two National Research Council studies on nuclear-test
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   While some bombs unquestionably detonated with full force,
``we're puzzled by the very weak signals or non-detection of
(seismic) signals'' from others, Lay said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian underground tests are conducted in a region with
``very stable continental rocks, which should be very efficient at
transmitting (seismic) signals.''
</P>
<P>
   Lay said some explosions may have fallen short of critical mass.
In a normal atomic bomb, the fissionable material is compressed
extremely quickly into a super-dense state called critical mass.
</P>
<P>
   This unleashes a flood of subatomic particles called neutrons,
which split enough atoms fast enough to trigger an atomic
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, an atomic bomb incinerated Hiroshima with an explosive
force of 14,000 tons of TNT. By contrast, a subcritical explosion
might equal 10 to 20 tons of TNT, the nuclear version of a wet
firecracker.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation, Lay said, is that the Indians and
Pakistanis might have detonated some bombs simultaneously. This
might have made it difficult for Western seismologists to assess
the true magnitude of individual blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that the Indians and Pakistanis may have
deliberately conducted subcritical blasts to test parts of nuclear
devices, rather than full-fledged bombs.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lay said, it would be hard to reconcile this with the
fact that India and Pakistan have referred to all the blasts as
nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. officials and test-monitoring experts confirmed that
seismographs failed to detect proof that all 11 blasts occurred as
claimed.
</P>
<P>
   India's claims for the May 13 blasts are ``a puzzle, because we
saw absolutely no signals'' from the alleged explosions that day,
said Paul Richards of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at
Columbia University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Cochran, a physicist and critic of U.S. nuclear weapons
policies at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said: ``It's
clear that we didn't detect all the blasts that were alleged to
have occurred. Some of that is explainable and some of it is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Cochran recalled seeing a photo of a surface crater formed by
one of India's explosions. The crater looked unusually small for
something allegedly generated by a nuclear blast of the advertised
size, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cochran said certainly one possibility is that Indian and
Pakistani officials overstated the size of the blasts. Another
possibility is that some tests were conducted in geological terrain
that might have muffled the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another possibility is that the seismic network itself
failed. But Western experts reject this explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really see no failure of the monitoring system at all,'' Lay
said. If anything should be questioned, he said, it is the claims
made by the Indian and Pakistani governments.

COMMENTARY: MR. TOAD'S LAST RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1989 in Canterbury, England, the world's leading experts on
frogs and other amphibians gathered for their first ever world
congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, in the bar and in chance encounters in the hall,
the experts swapped frog stories. At some point they realized that
they were all seeing the same problem: Their frogs and toads were
dying _ not just in disturbed habitats, but in the most pristine
nature preserves _ from brown toads in Yosemite National Park to
golden toads in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Today the case of the dying frogs is well documented, but what's
interesting is that no one still knows exactly why they are dying.
So conservationists are asking: Are the frogs the canaries in our
coal mine? Miners used to take canaries underground with them; if
the canary died, that would indicate the presence of deadly but
odorless carbon monoxide and warn miners to flee. Are the frogs
sounding such an alarm?
</P>
<P>
   ``Things go extinct all the time,'' said William Brown, science
adviser to the secretary of the interior. ``But when species like
frogs and toads that have been with us since the Jurassic period
suddenly start to disappear _ without us understanding exactly why
_ you have to take notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it something mankind is doing, and if so, is it something
that will eventually threaten mankind? Is it the increase in
ultraviolet light from holes in the ozone that is reducing the
frogs' immunity to viruses, parasites and fungi? Is it chemicals
and pesticides in the atmosphere? Is it rising temperatures?
</P>
<P>
   These questions were worrying enough for the National Science
Foundation to bring together in Washington last week a group of top
environmental scientists to swap research on what might be killing
the frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Their emerging consensus: There is no single smoking gun, but
rather the combination of all the ``insults to the environment''
over the last 50 years. To follow up, Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt, who attended the seminar, has initiated an interagency
task force to monitor the frog decline.
</P>
<P>
   Frogs and other amphibians have very permeable skin, which makes
them very sensitive to changes in the environment, whether water or
the air. ``They are one of the first animals to disappear when
there are threats to a habitat, because they are so sensitive to
water and air degradations,'' said Roderic Mast, vice president of
Conservation International. ``You have to assume that what impacts
frogs will eventually impact everything else in the ecosystem. That
makes it a biodiversity and a human health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something so humbling about the idea that at a time
when everyone is talking about the year 2000 computer bug, Indian
and Pakistani nuclear tests and the ``information revolution,'' a
group of animals that are so familiar to us all _ frogs _ can start
to die out without anyone knowing why. Who knows what's happening
to the millions of other species we haven't identified?
</P>
<P>
   Worse, this loss of biodiversity is happening just as
life-science companies are making real breakthroughs in their
ability to collect plants and animals from highly biodiverse
environments and screen them for useful genes that can be isolated
from that plant or animal and then used for medical cures or to
stimulate agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it's genes from the rosy periwinkle, a flowering
plant from Madagascar, that are now used to treat childhood
leukemia and Hodgkin's disease. To the extent that we are losing
biodiversity through extinctions, we are shrinking this natural
storehouse of lifesaving genes, and we will never have access to
them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``To prevent that, we conservationists create protected areas,''
said Mast. ``And yet we have creatures like frogs going extinct in
protected areas. So that is not enough. It calls into question what
is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It also calls into question the distinction too often made
between home and away, between protected areas and nonprotected
areas. Home is where you keep clean, and away is where you pollute.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe the frogs from Canada and Costa Rica, Yosemite and
Australia are telling us that this distinction isn't valid anymore.
Maybe they're telling us that home is home and away is home, and if
you pollute one you pollute the other. Maybe they're telling us
about the limits of our knowledge and warning us to do something
about the silent species we are losing through development and
deforestation _ before it's too late. &QL;

THE LINGUA FRANCA AT THE MEN'S FRENCH OPEN FINAL? SPANISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ They eat clay, drink clay, sleep clay, think clay.
According to them, they were born with their sneakers covered with
the stuff and have been sliding around on it since. For them, it's
terra firma.
</P>
<P>
   So somehow it seems only appropriate that Carlos Moya and Alex
Corretja, a couple of Spaniards who have lately been knocking on
the door of Grand Slam and top 10 respectability, have landed in
the final of the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   This Grand Slam tournament may be in France, which moaned Friday
when the Paris native, Cedric Pioline, disintegrated in straight
sets in his steamy afternoon semifinal against Corretja, but this
year the men's final belongs to Spain. Just as it did in 1994 when
its then-defending champion Sergi Bruguera defeated Alberto
Berasetegui.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline called it a bit of a puzzle that, although France boasts
the only Grand Slam tournament played on red clay, Spain boasts the
only genuine bumper crop of red clay artists. Spain sent 19 men to
this tournament, five of them seeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this tournament here in France, and we are not really
the specialists of clay courts. The real specialists are the
Spaniards,'' Pioline said. ``It seems like a paradox, but they were
born and bred on clay courts, more or less.''
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Moya, who first showed up on the Grand Slam
radar when he took a sleeper run to the 1997 Australian Open final,
defeated his training and dining companion, the 15th-seeded Felix
Mantilla, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4, 6-2, Friday to achieve his first French
Open final. Unlike his experience in Australia, Moya had been
fixated not only on reaching, but winning, this final even before
he arrived in Paris with a Monte Carlo title for ballast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I came here, I said I have good feelings, good
vibration; I don't say that if I don't feel it, I don't fake,''
said Moya, a star with a distinctive modest streak. ``If I don't
play well here, I recognize my mistake, but now I'm in the final
and I hope I'm going to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   But so does his countryman, the 14th-seeded Alex Corretja, the
unassuming baseliner who gained his Grand Slam notoriety with a
Kafkaesque experience at the 1996 U.S. Open, where he
double-faulted at match point of his five-set quarterfinal against
a reeling, choking and nauseated Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   After 4 hours 9 minutes, Sampras soldiered on and later claimed
that year's championship. Apparently a glutton for punishment,
Corretja set a Grand Slam longevity record with his
5-hour-31-minute marathon with Hernan Gumy here in the third round.
This time the resilient Spaniard produced an 11-9 fifth-set,
tie-breaker decision.
</P>
<P>
   Like the taller, more nimble Moya, the 24-year-old Corretja has
been concentrating on developing his all-court skills, especially a
serviceable volley, and Friday he used every square inch of the
center court as he dismissed the exhausted Pioline, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-ranked, soon-to-be 29-year-old Frenchman had played a
trio of five-setters en route to his first Roland Garros semifinal.
Friday, he could barely get his serve across the net, much less
create the flamboyant volleys necessary to detour Corretja's
passing shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that Cedric was struggling on the court,'' said
Corretja, now 3-0 against Pioline on clay. ``I wanted to show him
that if he wanted to beat me, he should be there and he should
fight every point.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12th-seeded Moya, the highest seeded man left in the
tournament, had the more treacherous trip to the final. He
inherited the responsibility of eliminating third-seeded Marcelo
Rios, the Chilean who had been favored to win his first Slam here
as well as re-acquire the No. 1 ranking, in the quarterfinal round.
</P>
<P>
   Moya's ability to get that job done steeled him for this one:
friend or not, Corretja must be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex is a close friend of mine, but when you get to the court,
you fight like crazy, you run, you do everything, you try to step
on him if necessary,'' Moya said.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Wimbledon 1884, two sisters met in a
Grand Slam final when Venus and Serena Williams squared off in the
mixed doubles final with their respective partners, New Jersey's
Justin Gimelstob and Argentina's Luis Lobo.
</P>
<P>
   Williams-Gimelstob, the 1998 Australian Open champions, trailed,
4-1, in the opening set before claiming this championship, 6-4,
6-4. ``It was the toughest team Justin and I ever played,'' said
Venus Williams, who is now halfway to a mixed doubles Grand Slam
with Gimelstob. ``We better watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   For 16-year-old Serena Williams, her partnership with the
animated 27-year-old Lobo yielded a trip to the final of her first
French Open: ``I love Luis and I hope to be with him forever,'' she
said. &QL;

IRAQI FOREIGN MINISTER ATTACKS U.N. INSPECTOR'S PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq's foreign minister on Friday dismissed as
a ``nonstarter'' the agenda that the United Nations' chief arms
inspector for Iraq plans to take to Baghdad next week.
</P>
<P>
   The arms inspector, Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, is due to meet Iraqi officials to discuss what has been
called a ``road map'' of requirements to lead Iraq toward the
lifting of an 8-year-old oil embargo. He will ask for documents and
materials still unaccounted for by the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, at a news
conference at the United Nations, angrily rejected Butler's
conclusions, presented to the Security Council this week, that Iraq
was still withholding critical material and information on
biological, chemical and missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in UNSCOM are politically motivated,'' al-Sahhaf
said of the Special Commission. He left the impression that Butler
could not look forward to a warm reception in Baghdad next week.
</P>
<P>
   Amir al-Saadi, a former general and now an adviser to President
Saddam Hussein, said at the news conference that Butler's road map
was ``just an excuse to ask for a new slogan: access to
documents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All documents relevant to disarmament have been presented,''
al-Saadi said, confirming the suspicion of some Western officials
that there are some areas of information in Iraq touching the
political leadership where U.N. inspectors will never be permitted
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sahhaf reiterated Iraq's claims that it had met all the
requirements of the disarmament process and that nothing now stood
in the way of lifting sanctions. He also repeated complaints that
the embargo, imposed in August 1990 after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, had produced ``the severest suffering in human history''
among the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed as temporary and insufficient the oil-for-food
program, under which Iraq can now sell up to $5 billion in oil
every six months to pay for civilian goods. He said conditions were
continuing to worsen and more children were dying.
</P>
<P>
   But in Baghdad on Thursday, a spokesman for the program, Eric
Falt, said a recent World Health Organization survey of Iraq had
found attendance at health clinics rising across the country, with
50 percent of patients interviewed saying they were getting the
full treatments prescribed, after suffering shortages of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``On average, 74 percent of the patients felt there had been an
increase in the availability of drugs over the last three months,''
Falt said. Doctors in government health centers gave a lower
figure, saying they received only about a third of the medicines
they needed to treat the 10 most common diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The oil-for-food administrator in Iraq, Denis Halliday,
announced recently that he would be allocating money to improve
Iraq's run-down schools. Electricity systems and agriculture are
also getting larger shares of equipment and money with an increase
in the amount of oil allowed to be sold. The program was expanded
early this year by the Security Council, under pressure to do more
to relieve the hardships of Iraqis. &QL;

CLINTON URGES TECHNOLOGICAL LITERACY FOR STUDENTS ENTERING HIGH
SCHOOL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Warning of a ``digital divide,'' President
Clinton called Friday for technological literacy to become a
requirement for middle school students and pledged $180 million to
help train teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In a commencement address at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Clinton also defended a law now under attack by the
telecommunications industry that would provide reduced costs to
poor schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
visited the opening of the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods and
participate in a ``video conversation'' between students at
Concord, Mass., and St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In his address to MIT's 2,400 graduates, Clinton challenged
states to make technology literacy a requirement for students to
graduate from middle school. He pledged to provide $180 million
over three years, starting in 2000, to train a team of teachers who
in turn would help train other teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child in America deserves the chance to participate in
the information revolution,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten states, including Texas, currently require technology
literacy of high school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happily, the digital divide has begun to narrow, but it will
not disappear of its own accord. History teaches us that even as
new technologies create growth and new opportunity, they can
heighten economic inequalities and sharpen social divisions,''
Clinton said, citing the Industrial Revolution as an example.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted the high-technology industries already
employ more people than the auto industry did at its height in the
1950s. Yet, Clinton said rich schools are three times more likely
to have Internet access than poor schools, and white students are
more than twice as likely as black students to have a computer in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But until every child has a computer in the classroom and a
teacher well-trained to help, until every student has the skills to
tap the enormous resources of the Internet, until every high-tech
company can find skilled workers to fill its high-wage jobs,
America will miss the full promise of the Information Age,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also urged the graduates to join his effort to preserve
the so-called ``E-Rate'' that requires telecommunication companies
to provide discounts of up to 90 percent to schools and libraries
connecting to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now some businesses have called on Congress to repeal the
initiative. They say our nation cannot afford to provide discounts
to these institutions,'' Clinton said. ``I say we cannot afford not
to have an E-rate.''
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that the FCC is considering suspending the
E-rate program, but an administration official said the White House
had no knowledge of any such move.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications companies agreed in 1996 to provide the
low-cost service in return for the Federal Communications
Commission lowering the local access fees long-distance companies
pay to local telephone companies. The lowered access fees were to
save long-distance companies $2.6 billion over 11 months while the
discount to schools and libraries was to cost $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, the industry is now pressing for repeal of the
initiative, saying it has imposed a 5 percent surcharge on business
customers and will add the surcharge to residential customers in
July. Critics call the surcharge the ``Gore tax'' after Vice
President Al Gore who championed the provision.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said the industry
previously agreed to provide the service. He maintained there was
no reason to pass along the surcharge costs to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of poor schools and libraries and rural health
centers are in desperate need of discounts. If we really believed
that we all belong in the Information Age, then, at this sunlit
moment of prosperity, we can't leave anyone behind in the dark,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for large increases in the budgets of the
National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health
for long-term information and communications research. He cited the
discovery this week in Japan that subatomic particles called
neutrinos have mass, a key to the workings of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This discovery calls into question the decision made in
Washington a couple of years ago to disband the superconducting
super collider, and it reaffirms the importance of the work now
being done at the Fermi National Acceleration Facility in
Illinois,'' Clinton said. Congress canceled the supercollider,
which was to be built in Waxahachie, Texas, in 1993 because of
escalating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shared commencement duties with Dr. David Ho, who
discovered the drug combination treatment to control AIDS. Ho
accepted MIT's invitation to speak at its commencement last
February but the White House, searching for a venue for Clinton to
speak on the Information revolution, called last month asking to be
included.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ho, born in Taiwan, lamented the anti-immigrant sentiments
brewing in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``One prevailing view that immigrants constitute a constant
drain on our society is simply baseless, wrong and shameful,
especially for this nation of immigrants,'' Ho said.
</P>
<P>
   After his address, the president had lunch with Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., and then joined the first lady to mark the
opening of the Thoreau Institute. Don Henley, former drummer for
the band The Eagles, created the institute and the Walden Woods
Project to preserve the legacy of Henry David Thoreau. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some habits are hard to break. From the late
1960s to the early 1990s, the Grateful Dead were on the road almost
every year, playing down-home improvisational rock for twirling,
tie-dyed Dead Heads.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the death of Jerry Garcia, his fellow members
of the Grateful Dead are back together as the core of a new band,
the Other Ones, that sets out to resurrect and extend the Dead's
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that Jerry would want us to play, not to sit around
and mourn forever,'' said band percussionist Mickey Hart in a
backstage interview. ``We all have enough money in the bank so we
don't have to do this. But it's in our veins, and it still seems
like a natural thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The band made a triumphant hometown debut in San Francisco on
Thursday night at the Warfield Theater for a sold-out house of
2,400 people who arrived with loyal but guarded expectations and
left the concert jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones include Hart, Bob Weir on guitar and Phil Lesh on
bass, Dead members since the 1960s, and Bruce Hornsby on keyboards,
who toured with the Dead in the 1990s. Mark Karan and Steve Kimock
on guitars, Dave Ellis on saxophones and John Molo on drums
complete the new band. Drummer Bill Kreutzmann, the other surviving
founder of the Dead, has retired.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the new band is to headline the third Furthur
Festival, an annual package tour of Dead-related bands. It goes to
the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., on June 29
and the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., on June 30. Hart said
the Other Ones had made no plans beyond the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Other Ones' debut was a benefit, raising more than $200,000
for the Rain Forest Action Network. Like a smaller-scale version of
the scene outside the Dead's last stadium tours, gray-bearded fans
from the 1960s and college students filed in while long-haired fans
stood outside with index fingers held up, hoping for a miraculous
last-minute ticket. ``It's like church,'' said Robyn Caywood, a
25-year-old fan who got a seat. ``And the music just pulls you like
puppet strings.''
</P>
<P>
   For their debut, the Other Ones had two things that the Grateful
Dead did not: nearly a month of daily rehearsals (including a
change of guitarist in the last week) and a set list that was
chosen before the band appeared onstage. But like the Dead, the
Other Ones rely on the chemistry of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The band's first few songs were tentative, with the two new
guitarists sounding unduly reticent; recent material like ``Easy
Answers'' (which appears on Rob Wasserman's album ``Trios'')
struggled to find a groove. But with the old blues ``Going Down the
Road Feeling Bad'' the music opened up, and suddenly the Other Ones
recaptured the effervescence of the Dead in its glory days.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead brought the security of American roots music _ country,
blues, Appalachian music, rhythm-and-blues, even touches of Latin
rhythm _ to psychedelic wanderings; they made good-timey excursions
out of songs haunted by death and uncertainty. The two sets by the
Other Ones became both a reminder of what the Dead accomplished and
a glimpse of new prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The band still plays some Garcia songs, and it kept many of the
Dead's old arrangements. Some were familiar from the Dead's stadium
era in the 1980s and '90s; others, like the brilliant, elaborately
constructed ``St. Stephen,'' had dropped out of the repertory. And
with Hornsby and Ellis, the music could detour into jazz harmonies
and swinging rhythms that the Dead rarely attempted. ``Space,'' a
free-form jam, wandered from scintillating Minimalistic patterns to
a new song, ``Banyan Tree'' (with lyrics by the Dead's longtime
collaborator Robert Hunter), to quick quotes of the Miles Davis
tune ``So What.''
</P>
<P>
   Molo has taken up Kreutzmann's role as the steady timekeeper
while Hart knocks out accents and cross-rhythms on an international
assortment of instruments. Hart's fondness for odd meters turned up
in a new arrangement of ``Fire on the Mountain'' and in a 1960s
Dead song, ``The Eleven'' (which is in 11/4 time).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, Karan and Kimock's guitars echo the Garcia
sound, bell-toned and perpetually inquiring; Garcia's style is
embedded in the Dead's songs.
</P>
<P>
   The two guitarists revived tell-tale Garcia phrases, like his
calmly ambling blues lines, his floating downward slides and his
light-fingered bluegrass runs. But with two lead guitarists (and
sometimes three when Weir switches from rhythm guitar to lead), the
Other Ones can toss around more bits of melody. They grew more
playful as the sets progressed, teasing each other with overlapping
scales or little tendrils of tunes like ``Scarlet Begonias'' and
``China Cat Sunflower.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than three hours of music, the Other Ones celebrated the
Dead with the Dead's own limber, open-ended curiosity, bolstered by
the kind of thorough practice and rejuvenated energy that the
latter-day Dead had lost.
</P>
<P>
   There was nostalgia in hearing the reconstituted band, but there
was also a renewed sense of possibility. As Weir sang in ``The
Eleven,'' ``This is the season of what now?''

<P>
   FIERZE, Albania _ The rusted hulk of a ferry, its bilge pumps
spewing water into the emerald green Drinit River and its diesel
engine rattling, has become for hundreds of young men the last leg
on a journey to war.
</P>
<P>
   On the upper decks small knots of ethnic Albanians, some of the
600,000 Albanians in Germany and Switzerland, squatted and
whispered among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Six bearded Islamic militants with white skullcaps stood near
the railing with thousand-mile stares that seemed to inhibit the
conversation around them. The milling groups and hushed tones gave
the boat, which shuttles each day the two hours between Koman and
Fierze, the aura of a troop ship heading into battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be met at the landing,'' said a heavyset bearded man
quietly to six young men clutching cheap nylon bags who had
gathered anxiously around him. ``They have sent someone to take
care of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruits nervously smoked cigarettes as the boat chugged
past sheer, rocky cliffs that plunged dramatically into the still
expanse of water.
</P>
<P>
   The men have left behind families, jobs, however menial, and
peace to fight for a separate state with the Kosovo Liberation Army
against the Serbian military.
</P>
<P>
   Many speak German better than they do Albanian and know little
of their homeland other than the idealized visions imparted to them
by their refugee parents in cramped apartments in Munich or Zurich.
Most are motivated by a romantic fervor that must make up for an
appalling lack of military preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get two weeks of military training,'' said one of the men,
who gave his nom de guerre as Lum (pronounced loom) and who left
his job as a waiter in Germany. ``The Kosovo Liberation Army does
not send in people to fight without preparation. We will be
trained.''
</P>
<P>
   The location of the training camps in the lawless backlands of
northern Albania has become the focus of intense interest. The
Albanian government, which since the collapse of its central
administration last year has little influence here, says the camps
do not exist.
</P>
<P>
   None of the men interviewed, even those who said they had been
trained and were about to head over the mountains into Kosovo, were
willing to say where the training took place.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous presence of men in combat boots and black fatigue
pants in the border towns of Tropoje and Bajram Curri seems to
suggest that the camps are inside Albania along the frontier with
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remote place, with few roads and no policing,'' a
Western military observer said. ``It is not hard to hide a training
facility here. We believe the camps exist, but we do not know where
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The counterinsurgency campaign begun by the Serbs in March to
wipe out the rebels in the central Drenica region in Kosovo
Province set off the rush to fight by the young Albanians in the
diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   Gruesome pictures of some of the 80 people killed in the Serbian
sweep in March, mostly women, children and the elderly, were widely
disseminated by the ethnic Albanian leadership. Exile groups put
the grisly photos on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old university student, who gave his nom de guerre as
Gjon and who was born and has lived all his life in Germany, sat
with six friends in a small coffee shop in downtown Bajram Curri.
He and the other volunteers will cross the border in a day or two.
They will travel into an area where the Serbian military has been
pounding villages with heavy artillery for a week, and where
streams of refugees are fleeing into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Western observers say as many as 40,000 people could be
displaced from their homes by the attack, which is intended, they
said, to create a free-fire zone along the length of the border
with Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs apparently hope that the zone, emptied of civilians,
will be a buffer to halt the smuggling of weapons and supplies from
Albania to the rebels fighting in the province, these officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made contact with representatives from the Kosovo
Liberation Army in Germany, and they helped us come,'' the
university student said. ``When we flew into Tirana, there were
many recruits on the plane. We all bought our own tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an adventure. We have learned from Bosnia that if
we do not defend our country, it will be taken from us by the
Serbs. We will not allow the Serbs to drive the Albanians from
their land.''
</P>
<P>
   The specter of Bosnia, where 200,000 people were killed and
hundreds of thousands of Muslims and ethnic Croats expelled from
their homes by the Serbs, weighs heavily on the volunteers. All
said Kosovo, where 90 percent of the 2 million people are ethnic
Albanian, would be emptied of all ethnic Albanians if Belgrade is
permitted to continue its military operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a history student at the university,'' Gjon said, ``but
I decided to drop out and come here to fight. My brother will join
me from Germany within a few days. Most young Albanians support the

DIVIDED TEXAS COURT RULES AGAINST HYUNDAI IN LAP BELT CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A sharply divided Texas Supreme Court held
Friday that auto manufacturers can be held liable even if their
safety designs meet minimum standards for seat belts set by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling stems from a 1989 auto accident in which an
18-year-old man was left paralyzed from the chest down after being
thrown through the sunroof of a car that was not equipped with lap
seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a very important decision for consumers in
Texas and for consumers throughout the country,'' said Christa
Brown of Austin, lawyer for Mario Alvarado, who sued Hyundai Motor
Co., Hyundai Motor America Inc., and Port City Hyundai Inc. over
the injuries he sustained in a rollover crash that occurred outside
Laredo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the court has decided is, essentially, that just because
the federal government doesn't prohibit something, it doesn't mean
companies can do whatever they want with regard to safety. They
can't just point to the federal government and say ... `We did the
minimum. King's X. That's all we need.'''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado was a front seat passenger in a 1988 Hyundai Excel that
spun out of control on a rain-slickened roadway and rolled over.
The car was equipped with automatic shoulder belts, which engaged
when the doors closed, but the car did not have lap belts _ an
option permissible under minimum federal standards at the time,
according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The case represents a rare victory for plaintiffs in the
conservative Texas Supreme Court, which is dominated by
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The main question before the court was whether the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act _ which sets safety standards
that vehicle manufacturers must meet _ precludes consumers from
suing a manufacturer for damages sustained in a seat restraint
system that does not include lap belts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Justice Rose Spector, writing for the majority, said it
does not.
</P>
<P>
   She was joined by justices Raul Gonzalez, the only other
Democrat on the bench, and Republican justices Greg Abbott, James
Baker and Deborah Hankinson.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, Hankinson and Spector are seeking re-election this fall
in contested races.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion cited a section of the act that states,
``compliance with any federal motor vehicle safety standard ...
does not exempt any person from any liability under common law.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That portion of the law ``would be rendered virtually
meaningless if it did not preserve claims such as the Alvarados',''
Spector wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the majority opinion held that because the federal
regulations do not mandate a particular seat belt design or
performance standards for rollover accidents, ``it leaves states
free to impose their own standards when no standard is in place.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the auto manufacturer did not return calls from the
Houston Chronicle. But Donna Kane, spokeswoman for Hyundai Motor
America, told The Associated Press that lawyers had not yet seen
the opinion and could not comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Justice Priscilla Owen wrote in her dissent that the
central issue was whether Congress ``intended ... to leave the
decision as to what occupant restraints should be provided in
vehicles to the (U.S.) secretary of transportation or to leave that
to juries across America.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissent cited numerous court opinions that have ruled
common-law claims such as the Alvarados' are pre-empted by federal
law.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the lawyer for Alvarados, said the ruling clears the
major roadblock her client has faced in pursuing the $18 million in
actual damages that a trial jury awarded him in 1991. Hyundai
appealed the jury award, but a San Antonio appeals court has
withheld ruling to allow the Supreme Court time to decide whether
Alvarados should have been barred from seeking damages in the first
place, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an old case,'' Brown said. ``The question ever since
(the jury award) has been how many legal roadblocks can Hyundai
throw up to avoid responsibility for that lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the Texas Supreme Court decision could lead
courts in other parts of the country to start holding auto
manufacturers liable for safety restraint systems that have not
adequately protected vehicle occupants. If it didn't have impact
beyond Texas, she said, Hyundai would not have gone to the lengths
it did to fight the case.

SOLZHENITSYN HAS FEW READERS IN THE NEW RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ By the time the first copies of Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's latest book landed at a Moscow bookstore on
Thursday, its arrival had been heralded far and wide. Excerpts were
published in half a dozen newspapers, and there were announcements
on radio and television _ just the kind of fanfare that might be
expected for a work by the great Soviet dissident, Nobel Prize
winner and tireless defender of Russia's battered soul.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the advance publicity, the publication of ``Russia
in Collapse,'' a 204-page volume of apocalyptic musings about the
fate of the nation, begs a question that has dogged its 79-year-old
author since his return from exile four years ago: Who in Russia
today is prepared to read what Solzhenitsyn has to say?
</P>
<P>
   If the publisher's initial print run of 5,000 is any indication,
the answer is: not many, certainly far fewer than the millions of
readers who snapped up copies of Solzhenitsyn's classic, ``The
Gulag Archipelago,'' when it was finally printed here for the first
time in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is surprising is that such a famous, noted author would
put out a book in only 5,000 copies,'' said Roy Medvedev, another
Soviet-era dissident whose own book on Russian capitalism came out
last week, also in only 5,000 copies. ``What is striking is the
loss of interest in Solzhenitsyn on the part of Russian society.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the phones were ringing all morning on Thursday at the
Russian Way bookstore _ a tidy, tiny haven of classical literature
on a street filled with features of the new Russia: beauty salons,
garish cafes, investment banks, currency-exchange booths.
Solzhenitsyn's loyal readers, many of whom share his alienation
from the culture around them, were calling in to ask when they
could come by and pick up their copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been waiting for days,'' said Nadezhda Ustelis, a
retired state bureaucrat, who walked out with a plastic bag stuffed
full of copies of the book ($1.40 in paperback, $2.20 in
hardcover). ``Friends and relatives from all over have asked me to
send copies, and I am sending the book to my grandsons, so they
will know our history.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday the publisher, Victor Moskvin, said, more than
2,000 copies had been sold and another printing of 5,000 is planned
next week. ``We are very happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Solzhenitsyn, who rarely gives interviews, has not personally
promoted the book, which is currently available only in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Since his return in November 1994 after a 20-year exile, mainly
in Vermont, Solzhenitsyn has become one of the paradoxes of the new
Russia. Freed from the harsh Soviet censorship that made mere
possession of his books a criminal act, Solzhenitsyn _ more than
any other Russian writer or thinker _ has had ample opportunity to
address his public.
</P>
<P>
   He was host of a talk show on national television. He has
traveled the country, lecturing and listening to what people have
to say. His works have been published not only in select literary
journals but in Argumenti i Fakty, Russia's most popular newspaper,
with a readership of 3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our paper has always been interested in the opinions of
Alexander Isayevich,'' said Natalya Zhilnorova, assistant deputy
editor. ``We think they are very important and useful for Russia,
for our society. We consider him one of the geniuses of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet for all the reverence, Solzhenitsyn has been been unable
to connect with a broad audience, even though his gloomy assessment
of Russian society, government and culture is widely shared by
many. His talk show was canceled for lack of viewers, his trips go
largely unreported, and for all the prior notice, ``Russia in
Collapse'' has elicited little reaction of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks like a prophet, but who needs prophets when society
is changing every month, every day?'' Medvedev asked. ``The name
Solzhenitsyn allows him to be published in any newspaper, but that
does not mean he has readers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new book is a rambling collection of Solzhenitsyn's thoughts
and impressions about what he has seen and heard here over the last
four years. The picture he paints is relentlessly grim: a country
brought to its knees by the avarice and cowardice of its ruling
elite and by the West _ in particular the United States _ which has
wasted no time in taking advantage of Russia's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Few leaders or institutions escape Solzhenitsyn's wrath. NATO
expansion, he writes, is a ``plot to exert pressure on Russia.''
Radio Liberty, the American-financed radio station that once
transmitted his works to Russian listeners, turned itself into
``something like a Chechen radio station'' during the two-year war
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Even the International Monetary Fund _ a favorite bogeyman for
Russian nationalists _ is working against Russia's own interests,
Solzhenitsyn says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like slaves, we obey the program of the IMF _ either because
we are stupid or because we consciously put ourselves in somebody
else's hands,'' he writes. ``In 10 years we will sink to the level
of African countries, and already we are treated like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians share Solzhenitsyn's bitterness, and according to
Medvedev, that may be one of the reasons so few are ready to hear
him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He criticizes the current regime, and for that reason neither
the authorities nor the West support him,'' Medvedev said. ``As for
ordinary people, the young and the disaffected, they see that his
criticisms are not as sharp as others'. His is general criticism,
without any new information. It is just a statement of fact: He is
against socialism, against capitalism, and he has no concept of
what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Vera Moseyeva, a retired clerk who remembers the first
book by Solzhenitsyn that she ever laid her hands on (it was almost
in tatters by the time it had been carefully and secretly passed to
her), it does not matter what he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he says is always interesting,'' she said, after
buying three copies of ``Russia in Collapse.'' ``He writes for the
people, and what he writes is very actual. Does he scold too much?
Given the way life is these days, how can one not be scolding?''

U.S. WON'T PROSECUTE DOCTORS WHO AID SUICIDE VIA OREGON LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., N.J., Ill., Utah)   (bl)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Friday removed the
last legal obstacle to the full operation of Oregon's landmark
assisted suicide law, declaring that doctors who use the law to
prescribe lethal drugs to terminally-ill patients will not be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   While Oregon is the only state that has legalized assisted
suicide, Reno's ruling Friday signaled that other states may enact
similar laws without interference from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In her decision Friday, Reno overruled an opinion last November
by Thomas Constantine, the administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, an agency of the Justice Department. The DEA had
warned that the government would impose severe sanctions on any
doctor who writes a prescription for lethal doses of medicine for a
patient.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine, who issued his threat after being pressed to
consider the Oregon law by two senior conservative members of
Congress, had said that using drugs for suicide was not a
legitimate medical use under the federal drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   In reversing that position Friday, Reno said that a Justice
Department study concluded that the drug laws were intended to
block illegal trafficking in drugs and did not cover situations
like the Oregon suicide law.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether her ruling will increase the number
of people who seek to use the Oregon law because doctors might now
be less inhibited to help people end their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Hoffman, the former president of the state medical
society, had complained that Constantine's threat had chilled many
doctors from prescribing lethal drugs to patients eligible under
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Only three people are reported to have used the law since it
survived a series of other legal challenges last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The law was written to be used only by Oregon residents in order
to prevent the state from becoming a mecca for people seeking
medical help in ending their lives. Other states have rejected such
laws and the next test may come in Michigan, where proponents are
preparing an initiative to be put on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Reno said there was no evidence that Congress
meant for the DEA to have the novel role of resolving the profound
moral and ethical questions involved in the issue. In her statement
she noted that President Clinton remains opposed to
physician-assisted suicide and signed a law prohibiting the use of
federal funds for any such procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., one of Congress' most prominent
abortion foes, said Friday he is confident that there will be a
legislative attempt to undo Reno's ruling. Congressional aides said
that some of the efforts will be similar to those used to deter
abortions, like requiring waiting periods or mandatory counseling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The politics that swirl around the issue of legalized suicide
largely parallel those of abortion. The Roman Catholic Church in
Oregon led the fight against the state initiative, and Friday,
Portland Archbishop John Vlazny said in an interview that Reno may
have misinterpreted the federal drug laws. ``But if this is indeed
what the law states, then we need to make a better law, a law that
would basically say that the law of the land is that drugs cannot
be prescribed to assist in suicide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was greeted warmly not only by supporters of the
referendum but by some Oregonians who opposed the measure but felt
angered that politicians and agency administrators in Washington
had sought to undo the results of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said on Friday that he had voted against
authorizing physician-assisted suicide, but that like many in his
state he resented the action of the DEA. ``There was no ground for
federal officials to impose their will on the voters of Oregon,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial referendum was approved by a 51-49 margin in 1994
but was held up by legal challenges for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents mounted an effort last fall to rescind the original
vote but were rebuffed by a large margin in a second statewide
referendum. It has been a widely held belief in Oregon that the
margin was not so much an indication that people approved of
physician-assisted suicide but rather a reflection of voters'
resentment that the opponents did not accept the will of the
electorate the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine was pressed to declare the law inoperative by Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
and Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee. Hatch on Friday criticized Reno's decision in a
statement, saying she had misunderstood the federal drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has prompted politicians like Hatch and Hyde, who have
long decried federal intervention and promoted states rights, to
argue for Washington to intervene. The Supreme Court has said that
while there is no constitutional right to assisted suicide, states
are free to create their own laws on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law Friday predicted that Reno's ruling will
not greatly increase the number of people in Oregon who will commit
suicide with a doctor's help. State officials have said they will
release a report as soon as they have recorded 10 suicides and they
have not yet done so. Barbara Combs Lee, who wrote the proposal in
the referendum, said that news reports attributing information to
family and friends account for only three suicides so far.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Death with Dignity Act gives terminally-ill adults
the right to request a lethal dose of prescription drugs if the
patient is of sound mind and judged by two doctors to have less
than six months to live.

 &HT;    According to the Word: Biblical texts most often cited by
opponents of homosexuality
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 7: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Verses from New Revised Standard Version of the Bible
</P>
<P>
   -- Genesis 19:1-11
</P>
<P>
   The story of two angels who visit Lot, the nephew of Abraham, in
Sodom. While the angels are in Lot's house, the ``men of Sodom''
ask him to bring out the ``men who came to you tonight'' so that
``we may know them.'' Lot offers his two virgin daughters in place
of his guests. The men of Sodom are struck blind when they insist
on attempting to go into Lot's house to take the men.
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation: Many ministers and scholars say the great sin of
this passage is that the men of Sodom wanted to have sexual
relations with Lot's male visitors. In fact, the word ``sodomite''
is sometimes used to refer to homosexuals. Others argue that the
transgression of the men of Sodom was that they were abusive and
inhospitable.
</P>
<P>
   -- Leviticus 18:22
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an
abomination.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Leviticus 20:13
</P>
<P>
   ``If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have
committed an abomination; they shall be put to death; their blood
is upon them.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation: Perhaps the strongest passages in the Bible
referring to homosexuality. However, advocates of a more lenient
view of homosexuality in the church say the condemnation of
male-male sexual relations must be taken in the context of
Leviticus' emphasis on keeping certain practices to preserve Jewish
identity. Other laws in Leviticus forbid eating shellfish and
wearing mixed fabric.
</P>
<P>
   -- Romans 1:18-32
</P>
<P>
   According to the apostle Paul in this book, when people who knew
God failed to honor God, ``God gave them up to degrading passions.
Their women exchanged natural intercourse for unnatural, and in the
same way also the men, giving up natural intercourse with women,
were consumed with passion for one another. Men committed shameless
acts with men and received in their own persons the due penalty for
their error.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation: The only passage in the Bible that refers to
lesbian sexual relations. This text cites homosexuality as a symbol
of how far humankind has fallen from God's ideal, according to
traditional interpretations. Some have even seen AIDS as the ``due
penalty'' of homosexual sex. Those who disagree say that in the
context of Paul's time, the apostle was saying only that homosexual
acts were unusual or not the norm, and that heterosexuals should
not go against their innate nature and have homosexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   -- I Corinthians 6:9-10
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom
of God? Do not be deceived! Fornicators, idolaters, adulterers,
male prostitutes, sodomites, thieves, the greedy, drunkards,
revilers, robbers _ none of these will inherit the kingdom of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   -- I Timothy 1:9-11
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is laid down not for the innocent but for the lawless
and disobedient, for the godless and sinful, for the unholy and
profane, for those who kill their father or mother, for murderers,
fornicators, sodomites, slave traders, liars, perjurers, and
whatever else is contrary to the sound teaching that conforms to
the glorious gospel of the blessed God.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpretation: These New Testament texts include apparent
references to homosexual practices in lists of bad deeds, while
offering no further discussion about the specific acts or
prohibitions. Certain words in the passage have been translated
over the years as ``homosexuals,'' ``sexual perverts,''
``sodomites'' and ``male prostitutes,'' fostering arguments about
exactly what acts or practices they address.

 &HT;    Is change possible?: The `ex-gay movement' sets off intense
debate
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Jack Vaiden and his wife had just finished making love
when he made an agonizing confession.
</P>
<P>
   Vaiden was holding his wife, Diane, when she turned to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack, I'm afraid I'm losing you,'' his wife of six years said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never leave you for another woman,'' Vaiden responded.
``If you lose me, it'll be to either two things: death ... or to
another man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you trying to tell me, Jack?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Faith may move mountains, but can it change a person's sexual
desires? That's the brutal question Vaiden and other Christians
face when they discover they have homosexual desires. Many pray for
years, participate in dramatic healing ceremonies or even marry,
hoping they will become free of homosexuality. They may become part
of the ``ex-gay movement,'' an organized effort by Christians who
proclaim Jesus can release people from homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of Christians views religious-based efforts to
make gay people straight as not only impossible, but cruel. They
insist there is no such thing as an ex-gay person.
</P>
<P>
   Vaiden has lived on both sides of the issue. He tried celibacy.
He tried marriage. He tried God. But his homosexual desires
persisted. He eventually divorced his wife and for the past 15
years has been living with a man in Stone Mountain. His partner,
Lowrey Fleming, whom he met in a Bible study class, helped Vaiden
raise his two sons, now adults in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubts about my salvation,'' Vaiden, 51, said. ``I
tried to tell the Lord for years what he says. I thought he was
saying, `You can't be gay. You can't be Christian.' But I was
telling him what he had to say. When I finally trusted enough to
allow him to speak for himself, I learned that, `Lord, your grace
is sufficient.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vaiden says he is comfortable with his sexual orientation today.
But many Christians remain certain that practicing homosexuality is
a sin. The issue has split the Christian community into two camps.
</P>
<P>
   One group believes homosexuality is a sin that can be ``healed''
by belief in Jesus. Exodus International, based in Seattle, is the
flagship for this group, whose primary mission is to free
Christians from homosexuality through rigorous Bible study, prayer
and support group principles.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1976, Exodus has 88 chapters in the United States and
nine international chapters in places as far apart as Singapore and
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Christians who embrace their gayness also cite Scripture. And
their contention that homosexuality isn't something that can be
changed has in recent years been reinforced by many in the
scientific and psychological communities.
</P>
<P>
   Gays and ex-gays differ on basic assumptions about
homosexuality. Most Christians who believe God can change a
person's sexual orientation think that homosexuality is not inborn,
but caused by a person's environment. They often cite an inadequate
relationship between children and parents as the spark for
homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   George Morales said he was healed of his homosexuality during a
demonic deliverance session at Landmark Church, a charismatic
church in Norcross. Morales, 32, said a troubled relationship with
his father caused him to look for affection from other men. He said
his father routinely called him stupid and told him he ran ``like a
faggot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was subconsciously, `If you can't give me that love, I'm
going to go to a man to get that love,''' Morales said.
</P>
<P>
   Many gay Christians who laim they have been healed are
unwilling to say they no longer are attracted to members of the
same sex. They describe healing as a process, not an overnight
change. Temptation remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at a man, if I'm attracted to him, I'll turn my
head the other way,'' Morales said. ``I just don't feed on it.
That's what the devil wants me to do, to go back into that
</P>
<P>
   lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Morton is a member of Living Stones, an Atlanta-based
ministry affiliated with Exodus International. Morton, 40, a
minister's son from Indiana, joined Living Stones after his
marriage failed because of his homosexuality. He lost his wife and
male lover in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Morton said Living Stones uses a tough-love approach. Members
are required to meet each week, stay in constant touch with a
sponsor, and are forbidden to buy pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Morton said his struggle to overcome his gay tendencies was
fierce. Lonely, he would call Living Stones' members late at night.
``I'm dying,'' he remembers telling his friends. ``I can't stand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morton said leaders of the group did not condemn him for his
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would talk to me on the phone, talk me through it and
share their experiences,'' said Morton, now chairman of the Living
Stones support group in metro Atlanta, which has 12 active members.
``Sometimes they would tell me to get in the car, bring my clothes
over and spend the night with them and their families. We'd make
plans for (the next day) so I would have something to look forward
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Morton said, he still has homosexual desires, but they
have ``tremendously subsided.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the ex-gay movement believe Morton's quest will
ultimately fail. They scoff at the idea that homosexuality can be
explained by a deficient relationship between a child and a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Vaiden, for example, said he got along great with his father and
mother. Both supported him when he left his wife, although they
didn't understand his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with straight parents, straight brothers and I was
as gay as they come,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Vaiden and others believe homosexuality is inborn. Scientists
are starting to agree with such thinking. Several recent studies
suggest sexual orientation is predetermined at birth.
</P>
<P>
   The American Psychological Association adopted a resolution last
year that said it was dangerous to try to alter a person's sexual
orientation. Doug Haldeman, who conducted the APA study, said he
found ``absolutely no evidence'' that ex-gay ministries or
traditional psychological counseling can change a person from gay
to straight.
</P>
<P>
   What Haldeman said he found instead were homosexuals who live in
``inner martyrdom.'' They kill their sexual desires to live a
straight lifestyle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically think that sexual orientation is very strongly
rooted and impossible to change,'' Haldeman said. ``Those inner
impulses are very strong. Imagine for a moment if you were
forbidden the rest of your life of having sex with the gender of
your choice and had to try to have a loving relationship with
another gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Sneed, a 27-year-old Emory University graduate student,
drew the same conclusion as Haldeman after he tried to go straight.
Sneed said he thought he was twice ``healed'' of his homosexuality
_ once by a Pentecostal preacher during a revival service and
another time during an exorcism where church members assured him
that they had driven out the ``demon of homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither healing lasted. Sneed said he continued being sexual
with men, even while he assured people that he was ``free from the
devil'' and condemned other homosexuals. He said he finally
accepted his homosexuality because he believed God created him gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe a person who is gay or lesbian can be
converted,'' Sneed said. ``I tried. I think it's damnable. They're
forcing people to live in a way that's not honest to them or the
God that created them. You have people who want to live right
buying into this crap because you've taught them to hate
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Christians who believe that God can deliver people from
homosexuality think the argument that people are born gay is
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the position of Joe Dallas, author of several books that
are critical of what he calls ``pro-gay theology.'' He also
describes himself as an ex-gay. He was once a member of the
Metropolitan Community Church, the world's largest gay-affirming
Christian denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas points out that studies suggesting biological roots for
homosexuality are small in sample size and far from proven, a point
Haldeman concedes.
</P>
<P>
   Of much greater importance, Dallas adds, is the fact that
Christians who grapple with homosexual desires must still obey
Scripture, which forbids homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we assuming that even if something is proven to be inborn
that that will legitimize the behavior?'' Dallas said. ``We seem to
be innately created with the ability to lie. Children do it so
well. But none of us have adopted that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, who said he left the MCC church because his gay
</P>
<P>
   lifestyle had caused a ``crisis in confidence'' in his faith,
said critics of the ex-gay movement base their beliefs on their own
personal failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They conclude, `I didn't change so no one can change,'''
Dallas said. ``And because they didn't change, they think it must
not be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaiden has long since given up trying to change his sexual
orientation. That's not to say he didn't struggle to remain with
his wife and attempt to be straight.
</P>
<P>
   Vaiden thought he could cure his homosexuality through prayer
and Scripture. But such efforts proved futile. He tried to balance
his sexual desires with his need to take care of his wife and
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all the blessings and that wasn't enough,'' Vaiden said.
``I felt like a horrible spider who was pulling these people into
my web, destroying my parents, my children, my wife and the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   It all became too much. Vaiden divorced. A year later he and
Fleming began living together, a partnership that has lasted for 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   Vaiden's public ministry ended. The church he helped to start,
First Moravian in Stone Mountain, asked him to step down because he
had become too ``controversial.''
</P>
<P>
   Today he trains hotel managers and is a member of the
Metropolitan Community Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ask anyone to agree or accept,'' Vaiden says of his
lifestyle and choices. ``At best, just leave me alone. I've already
put in too much time, too much prayer, too many tears.''

BOOMING U.S. ECONOMY JUST KEEPS ON BOOMING  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SYLVIA NASAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite Asian tremors, stock market jitters and fears that
America is running out of workers, the economy is still booming. In
May, the Labor Department reported on Friday, employers added
nearly 300,000 new jobs, unemployment held steady at an almost
unbelievably low 4.3 percent _ the lowest rate in 28 years _ and
pay continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. economy has never performed as well,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. ``Asia is taking a big
bite out of U.S. exports, but domestic demand has stayed very
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors focused on the optimistic side, reasoning that such a
show of economic strength bodes well for corporate profits. The
stock market, which had been faltering lately, surged in a powerful
rally that pushed the Dow Jones average up nearly 2 percent, its
best gain in four months.
</P>
<P>
   The May jobs figures are only the latest evidence that the
economy remains far more robust than most experts expected.
Spending on everything from new homes and cars to business
equipment has been soaring in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the surge in hiring surprised economists who were
expecting the unemployment rate to tick up in May and payrolls to
only rise modestly. What's more, the Labor Department reported that
the job market was stronger in March and April than previously
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The best labor market since the go-go 1960s is a boon for most
Americans who are now enjoying signing bonuses, more frequent
raises and, not least, the luxury of choice. The quit rate _ the
best measure of how confident workers are that they trade their old
job for a better one _ has been hovering close its highest level
since the beginning the economic expansion seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although a tight labor market also increases the possibility
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool the
economy down, wage inflation is hardly surging. Hourly earnings are
now 4.3 percent above their year-ago level. After rising 5 cents in
April, earnings edged up another 4 cents to $12.73.
</P>
<P>
   The sole weak spot in the job market is in industry. Asia's
problems have been hitting American exporters hard since the
beginning of the year, contributing to a big buildup in inventories
and production cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, manufacturers have started to reign in headcounts.
Factory payrolls, which grew by more than more than 300,000 in past
two years, shrank for the second month in a row _ by 26,000.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, all of the hiring _ 332,000 jobs _ last month was by the
dominant service sector which includes everything from Wall Street
and shopping malls to trucking and management consulting firms.
</P>
<P>
   What's fueling the demand for workers, including, increasingly,
the young, inexperienced, and least educated, isn't much of a
mystery: American businesses and households are on a spending spree
that shows few signs of abating and promises to keep the job market
tight for the foreseeable future. Consumers are spending more
freely than ever, as jammed parking lots at the nation's malls and
the latest reports from merchants confirm.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, Detroit automakers reported May was their best
sales month in a dozen years. On Thursday, big retailers reported a
7.1 percent in May sales following a 10.2 percent gain in April,
the best monthly increase in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise then that retailers added 89,000 new jobs in
May, the second big consecutive increase.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are also buying houses. April home sales were the
strongest in history. And furniture, hardware, and other items for
the family home are moving briskly. The 9,000-job drop in
construction in May likely reflects the past few months of unusual
weather patterns and comes after builders hired 204,000 workers
between October and April.
</P>
<P>
   There's no sign that households are tapped out. Partly because
of that hot job market, household income is swelling at a rate
that's highly unusual by historical standards, nearly 5 percent a
year. With inflation running close to 1 percent, if that, `a dollar
is worth a dollar' these days.
</P>
<P>
   The other spur to spending is coming from the stock market,
which has quadrupled in value over the last eight years. Half of
all Americans have some stake in the market, and they're the ones
with most of the disposable income. An economic rule of thumb holds
that consumers spend approximately 3 percent of their wealth gains.
That rule seems to be holding now. The personal savings rate has
declined from 6.5 percent to 3.5 percent in the past five years;
that's an indirect measure of the wealth effect _ $200-plus billion
in extra spending.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses are also spending like there's no tomorrow. Spending
on new equipment and structures has been booming almost since the
beginning of the expansion and shows no signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for all the investment is that high stock prices and
low interest rates make it more affordable.. Equipment orders
suggest that investment spending, while it may have slowed a tad
from its 27 percent annual rate in the first quarter, is still
rising at a double digit rate.
</P>
<P>
   But while there's no evidence yet that domestic demand is
slowing, some drags on growth are already visible. The trade
deficit _ which shaved 1.5 percentage points off the economic
growth rate in the first quarter _ is expected to widen from the
after effects of the Asia crisis, which has diminished demand for
American products in Asia and increased the amount of Asian-made
goods bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a slowdown but there's no reason for it to
happen quickly,'' said Alan Sinai, chief economist at Primark
Decision Economics.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate of Americans with college degrees has been
hovering around 1.5 percent for some time, but the biggest decline
in joblessness _ to 6.7 percent _ over the past year has been among
high school dropouts. ``They're the only ones left to hire,'' said
David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, an economic
forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Slower economic growth may not mean that it will get harder to
find a job or to get a raise. With the pool of unemployed dwindling
and labor force growth slow, unemployment is likely to stay low
even if the economy expands at just half the recent pace. Thus,
said Robert Mellman, chief economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.,
the economy may weaken but ``people will still feel great.''

 &HT;    A place of refuge: some gays seek out homosexual churches,
synagogues
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The glowing newlyweds looked as if they had just stepped out of
a Hallmark greeting card.
</P>
<P>
   Only a week earlier they were joined in a church. Now they were
basking in each other's presence, flipping through their wedding
album and making plans for their honeymoon in Greece. It was a
typical snapshot of post-wedding bliss except for one unusual
detail:
</P>
<P>
   The newlyweds are both men.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Calvert and Bryan Keever were joined during a commitment
ceremony in the Christ Covenant Metropolitan Community Church near
downtown Decatur, Georgia. The MCC is a congregation founded by and
for homosexuals. Calvert, an MCC deacon, could not envision
worshipping _ or marrying _ anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing for me to understand are people who are gay
and lesbian that will attend and support a mainstream church,''
Calvert said. ``That church will take their money but will not
affirm them. How they can walk into that church and participate is
beyond me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven o'clock Sunday morning may be the most segregated hour in
America, but a new kind of church division is now taking place _ a
growing separation between the straight and homosexual religious
communities. Gays and lesbians in metro Atlanta, no longer willing
to wait for mainstream churches to embrace them, have in recent
years created their own religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Voice, a weekly catering mostly to the city's gay
community, lists at least 40 places of worship in the Atlanta area
that welcome gays and lesbians. A few are part of mainstream
denominations, defiantly ignoring church doctrine. But most were
specifically created for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The options are dizzying. There are listings for homosexual
groups for Mormons and Quakers, a synagogue for gay and lesbian
Jews and even a group for ``New Age'' gays. Despite their
theological differences, each place of worship shares a common
message: God doesn't mind if you're gay.
</P>
<P>
   That message of affirmation profoundly affects many homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I walked in and heard the first note on the piano,
I was in tears,'' Calvert said. ``It felt like I was home. It was
amazing to see gay couples come forward and receive Communion
together, to embrace each other, to cry together and laugh
together. Nobody was pointing, judging or casting stones.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gomes, a Harvard University theologian and author, said
homosexual places of worship serve a vital function.
</P>
<P>
   ``They affirm the spiritual nature of people who have only been
defined sexually,'' said Gomes, who is gay. ``They are an open
rebuke to standing churches because they wouldn't exist if standing
churches would be more hospitable.''
</P>
<P>
   If mainline churches continue to reject the inclusion of
homosexuals, leaders of gay places of worship say, their
congregations will prosper. According to MCC officials, they have
one of the fastest-growing Christian denominations in the world.
Since its founding in Los Angeles in 1968, MCC has grown to about
300 churches in 17 countries. MCC's worldwide membership, officials
report, is now at 32,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Community Church was founded by Troy Perry, a
minister defrocked by his Pentecostal church for homosexuality.
After recovering from a suicide attempt, Perry said he received a
call from God to start a church that affirmed gays and all other
outcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Leila Gal Berner, former rabbi of Congregation Bet Haverim in
Atlanta, understands such a call.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the mainstream religious community does not choose
to embrace all human beings as God embraces all human beings,
there's going to be an exodus from the mainstream churches,'' said
Berner, a lesbian who recently left for Israel for a six-week study
program.
</P>
<P>
   Still, don't expect any homosexual megachurches in Atlanta or
elsewhere. Most gay places of worship have comparatively small
memberships. The MCC congregation that Calvert and Keever attend
has about 220 members. The Unity Fellowship Church, which is
predominantly black and open to gays, has about 25 members.
Congregation Bet Haverim has about 165 members.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, though many homosexuals feel uncomfortable in
mainstream places of worship, they insist on retaining the
trappings of such traditional faith communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Community Church in Decatur, for example, looks
as if it could have been lifted from a Norman Rockwell painting:
white steeple, stained-glass windows and an orange juice stand out
front. The MCC worship style includes the traditional sacraments of
baptism and Communion.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to their theology on sexuality, though, homosexual
places of worship differ sharply from the mainstream. MCC teaches
that biblical passages condemning homosexuality have been
misinterpreted. The sin of Sodom, for example, was inhospitality,
not homosexuality, the denomination holds.
</P>
<P>
   Keever has no doubt that Jesus accepts him as a gay man.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the teachings of Christ, Jesus never addressed
the issue,'' Keever said. ``Look at who Jesus hung out with. If you
were marginalized in society, that's where Jesus was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Glenna Shepherd, the MCC pastor who conducted the
Calvert-Keever commitment ceremony, said she thinks that most
churches will accept homosexuals in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much like trying to change people who were
left-handed,'' Shepherd said. ``In centuries past, that was someone
who was born of the devil. Now we have learned that that's how
their brains worked. They were born that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd, a lesbian, said mainstream churches' opposition to
same-sex marriages places gays who want to be faithful to one
partner in a no-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `You can't be married and look at how promiscuous
you are,''' Shepherd said. ``It puts you in a corner and accuses
you for being in a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Though homosexual places of worship provide a refuge, Gomes
believes their influence will diminish in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, churches that are based purely on sexual
orientation don't have much of a future because we are more than
sexual beings,'' Gomes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a contemporary necessity, but once the inevitable
happens, when churches respond inclusively to issues of sexuality,
unless these other churches have something else to offer, they
really won't survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calvert, however, said his allegiance to MCC will last. It is
where he says he found God and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that this was the right thing to do,'' Calvert
said of his union with Keever. ``God crossed our paths and brought
us together for that reason.''

 &HT;    Gay members put new life into old church
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1990, the Rev. Mike Cordle and his wife walked
past St. Mark United Methodist Church in Atlanta on their way to
see a play at the Fox Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Cordle was an up-and-comer in the North Georgia Conference of
the United Methodist Church _ senior pastor at St. Andrew United
Methodist Church in Cobb County, where the 1,200 members had
overpledged the annual budget and were planning a new building to
accommodate their rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   Passing St. Mark, he shared a rumor with his wife: ``Word is
they're going to send an old minister here, and he and the church
will pretty much retire together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordle, 52, freely admits that ``my heart was broken'' when, two
months later, a conference official called to tell him the bishop
wanted him at St. Mark. The call was a turning point for Cordle and
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no church in Georgia _ and few in the United States _
has seen a more dramatic turnaround because of welcoming gays and
lesbians than the old Gothic church on Peachtree Street.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Cordle sees the hand of providence in the timing
of his first Sunday at the church. After preaching to about 90 of
its 200 mostly elderly members, he and his family stepped outside
to see a parade flowing down Peachtree Street. He joked that the
city had staged it to welcome him. It was his first Gay Pride
parade.
</P>
<P>
   During the next year, Cordle worked hard and picked up eight new
members, but because of difficulty meeting denominational
obligations and utility bills, the congregation froze his salary.
And on the first anniversary of his arrival at the church, Cordle
and his family went outside to watch the Gay Pride parade again.
</P>
<P>
   As Cordle tells it, watching the thousands of people walk by, he
began an argument with God. He heard God telling him to welcome the
paraders to St. Mark. He felt he had to convince God that he would
be committing political suicide to do it. ``God kept nagging,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the dispute, Cordle took the idea to the church lay
council, thinking surely the members would reject the proposal.
They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   On his second anniversary at the church, when the Gay Pride
parade came by St. Mark, Cordle, his wife and several members of
the church passed out 50,000 donated leaflets about the church,
along with cups of water, to participants.
</P>
<P>
   The next Sunday, about half a dozen curious gays and lesbians
came to services. They told others about their experience, and more
people came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to St. Mark convinced I would be disappointed,'' said
Harry Knox, 37. ``I really thought this might be a trick _ this
business of handing out water on the street corner. I thought they
just wanted to recruit us and try to change us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I arrived, the incredible spirit of the place
overwhelmed me. To know I was welcome there and didn't have to hide
who I was, I was moved in a way I would never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   The church began structuring ministries to meet the needs of its
new members: AIDS-related services, the Genesis group for men
struggling with their sexual orientation, the Rainbow Sunday School
Class.
</P>
<P>
   And gay and lesbian members began to become integrated into
other groups and classes, to volunteer throughout the church's
program, and to bring more friends.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the older members left, but many more new members
joined. Some were young heterosexuals who wanted their children to
be part of a diverse community.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the church took in its 1,000th member. Its annual
budget is more than $500,000 _ five times as much as when Cordle
became minister. The congregation has paid off all but $17,000 of
the $1 million cost of renovating the elegant old sanctuary.
Attendance averages more than 800 each Sunday in two services.
</P>
<P>
   Without its gay and lesbian members, ``St. Mark would have been
wiped out by now,'' said the Rev. Dow Kirkpatrick, 81, the eloquent
retired minister who preached racial justice from the pulpit of St.
Mark during the civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to say this because it sounds so exaggerated,'' he
says of the church's decision to welcome homosexuals, ``but this
has been one of the most significant spiritual experiences I've
ever had.''

 &HT;    THE SEARCH FOR A CLERICAL ROLE
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the issues surrounding homosexuality, ordination of
sexually active gays and lesbians to the Christian ministry may be
one of the most inflammatory. The Rev. Leon Jeffords, 64, pastor of
First Presbyterian Church in Douglasville and a leader in the
Presbytery of Greater Atlanta, sums up the feelings of many clergy
and laity across mainline Protestantism toward the ordination of
noncelibate homosexuals: ``We feel the Scriptures are very clear
that a person should be living a lifestyle that is honorable and
glorifies the Lord. We believe homosexuality doesn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few openly gay and lesbian candidates for the ministry have
found churches willing to defy popular practice. Some were ordained
before they discovered their homosexuality. But for most gay
would-be clergy, the position of the churches leaves several
choices _ hide their sexuality, accept a lifetime of celibacy,
transfer to the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community
Churches or another gay-friendly body, or wait for a change in
denominational policy.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at four gay metro Atlantans, two who long for
ordination and two who have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS GLASER
</P>
<P>
   47, Presbyterian
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a wrought-iron table in the courtyard of Trinity
Presbyterian Church on a sunny February day, Chris Glaser looked
dejected. Glaser, who is openly gay, had just watched the
Presbytery of Greater Atlanta vote down a proposal that would have
brought him closer to what he believes is his lifelong calling _
the Christian ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser, 47, has been watching such votes, nationally and
locally, since graduating from Yale Divinity School 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although unordained, Glaser has spoken in churches across the
country, headed a national organization of homosexuals within the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and written several books, including
``Uncommon Calling,'' the story of his struggle to serve the
church. He now edits Open Hands, a quarterly journal of
congregations open to gays and lesbians in five denominations.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Atlanta in May 1993, when his partner, Mark King,
took a job at AID Atlanta. The two joined Ormewood Park
Presbyterian Church and had their relationship blessed in a
ceremony performed by the church's former minister. They remain
active church members, but Glaser said he identifies himself less
strongly as a Presbyterian than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic that eventually gays and lesbians will be
ordained in the Presbyterian Church and in mainstream
denominations,'' said Glaser. ``I'm not optimistic that I'll be
ordained.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``I'm in it for the long haul,'' he said. ``My greatest
motivating factor is knowing what we do will make it easier for
young people born now.''
</P>
<P>
   HARRY KNOX
</P>
<P>
   37, United Methodist
</P>
<P>
   Ever since his teen years, Harry Knox, 37, has wanted to be a
United Methodist minister. As a student at Emory University's
Candler School of Theology, he served as pastor of a tiny church
where two families had gay sons. Through the process of counseling
them, he says, he realized he could not be an effective minister
unless he came to terms with his own sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Because the United Methodist Church does not ordain practicing
gays and lesbians, Knox transferred to a seminary of the United
Church of Christ, generally more open. But a Georgia-South Carolina
denominational committee refused by a single vote to ordain him.
``They made it clear it was because I was gay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The church might have accepted his application had he agreed to
be celibate, he said, ``but I think it would have sent a message to
parishioners that it's OK to let the church hurt you. I was not
willing to say I should not be a sexual person.''
</P>
<P>
   After investing nine years and tens of thousands of borrowed
dollars in college and seminary, Knox felt lost. ``I didn't know
how to be or do anything else,'' he said. He returned to the United
Methodist Church as a member, and took a job in the nonprofit
health field. In January, he became head of the Georgia Equality
Project, a political action organization for gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Knox teaches Sunday school at St. Mark United Methodist Church,
where he met his partner, John Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed in the church primarily because I love Jesus and they
do Jesus better at church than anywhere else,'' said Knox. ``I have
also stayed in the church because it's my responsibility to call
the church to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Knox said he feels ``ordained by God if not by the United
Methodist Church,'' but cannot fully be a minister until the church
allows him to administer its sacraments.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tremendous loss in my life,'' he said. ``I grieve
every Sunday a little.''
</P>
<P>
   THE REV. CHRIS COPELAND
</P>
<P>
   29, Baptist
</P>
<P>
   A year ago more than 100 people at Oakhurst Baptist Church laid
their hands on a kneeling Chris Copeland as he became an ordained
minister. ``It was truly one of the most meaningful and powerful
experiences of my life,'' says Copeland, 29. ``Those people had
come to say to me they recognized my gift for ministry and my call
for ministry. They affirmed that and celebrated it with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland grew up in Snyder Memorial Baptist Church in
Fayetteville, N.C., and felt called to the ministry from age 16. By
his senior year at Wake Forest University, he was state president
of the Baptist Student Union, the Southern Baptist Convention's
college campus ministry. By that year he also knew he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   He enrolled in Andover Newton Theological School in
Massachusetts, affiliated with the American Baptist Churches U.S.A.
and the United Church of Christ, but left because he felt compelled
to choose between being a minister and being gay.
</P>
<P>
   After a year working in campus ministry, he entered the law and
theology program at Emory University(Ga.) intending to work in
social justice. In Atlanta, he joined Oakhurst Baptist Church, a
congregation affiliated with both the American Baptist Churches and
the Southern Baptist Convention. Two years later, he felt he could
no longer deny the call he felt to be a minister.
</P>
<P>
   In what he describes as an ``epiphany,'' Copeland decided to
``go for broke and trust God.'' He asked Oakhurst to ordain him.
Risking expulsion from the SBC, the church did, on May 11, 1997. A
day later, Copeland received degrees in law and theology from
Emory.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland, who is not in a relationship now, works in the field
of institutional development. But he holds on to the hope of being
a Baptist pastor. ``That's what I feel called to and what I want to
be and long to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He recently marked the one-year anniversary of his ordination by
watching the videotape of the service. ``It sort of gave me a
renewed sense of hope that this is going to happen,'' he said. ``I
don't know when.''
</P>
<P>
   THE REV. MARION KANOUR
</P>
<P>
   44, Episcopal
</P>
<P>
   She was a former Marine captain and a nun. Now the Rev. Marion
Kanour is an openly lesbian Episcopal priest.
</P>
<P>
   Kanour, 44, serves as assistant to the rector at St.
Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in DeKalb County. In August 1997,
when she and her partner of three years were introduced, the
congregation gave them a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Kanour is open about her sexual orientation and her
relationship, she said, because ``it seemed too claustrophobic in
the closet for me, and too paranoid. I would always be afraid of
who knew. I wouldn't be able to be fully who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanour said she was 35 and preparing for ordination when she
began to discover her homosexuality. ``It was for me the most
spiritually connected I have ever felt, when I realized who God
made me to be.''
</P>
<P>
   When questions about sexuality came up during the ordination
process, she said, ``I chose to respond by talking about a spectrum
of sexuality, believing we all fall somewhere on the spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Virginia, she was raised a Southern Baptist and
later became a Roman Catholic. She graduated from Oregon State
University, spent four years in the Marine Corps and then earned a
divinity degree from Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   She entered the Sacred Heart of Jesus order of nuns, but after a
year and a half, officials asked her to leave. ``I didn't believe
they could discern God's will for me,'' she said. ``That affected
the vow of obedience in a
</P>
<P>
   big way.''
</P>
<P>
   When her father died soon after she left the convent, she
returned home to Norfolk and found work as parish administrator at
Good Shepherd Episcopal Church. There, she decided she wanted to be
ordained a priest.
</P>
<P>
   Since she was living in Atlanta three years later when she
completed preparation, Atlanta's Bishop Frank K. Allan ordained her
in 1991 on behalf of the bishop of southern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Kanour spent a year in clinical pastoral education at Northside
Hospital, worked four years as a chaplain at Grady Memorial
Hospital's hospice, and became interim vicar at Emmaus House, a
south Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   mission.
</P>
<P>
   When Allan accepted her official transfer to the diocese last
year so that she could serve in a parish, Kanour became the first
openly gay person received for official clergy status in the
diocese.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Bartholomew's, a church known for its wide range of
community ministries, she is assistant to the rector for missions
and evangelism. She finds the ministry exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sexual orientation isn't the focus here,'' says Kanour.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Put down roots: You're doing what comes naturally
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCaysville, Ga.--Hmmm. The question fascinates: Why do we feel
the need to garden in the mountains when nature does such a good
job without our help?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Ann Camp's husband, Rusty, wants to know whenever he
sees her planting and tending astilbe, hosta, ostrich fern and such
at their cabin near here. ``He just thinks with so many
wildflowers, ferns, etc., why would I want to add anything,'' Camp
wrote in a recent letter.
</P>
<P>
   Her answer speaks for many of us: ``It's putting your stamp on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over and over again, I've seen them in places throughout the
world _ plantings around dwellings surrounded by incomparable
scenery.
</P>
<P>
   In the highlands of Puerto Rico, where stunning views of sea and
valleys and mountains take your breath away, where the most lush
vegetation and colorful flowers thrive on their own, gardens still
grow around houses everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   On the Isle of Wight, most residents cannot resist planting _
hydrangeas are particularly popular, with lovely fall leaf color _
even though the woods and water can thrill forever.
</P>
<P>
   On Cape Ann, Mass., too, and in Santa Fe, N.M., where natural
beauty awes and inspires, where coastal waters and arid delights
proliferate like sea grasses and sagebrush, people must put their
own stuff in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   We all want our stamp on it.
</P>
<P>
   Up here in the mountains, there's a whole lot of stamping going
on.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably enchanting, the hazy blue ridges and quilted shades
of green beckon. In the woods, you get lost in the delight of more
plant species than are in some countries. Who can dispute _ or
resist _ the charms of sweet-
</P>
<P>
   shrub, wild azalea, rhododendron, joe-pye weed, elderberry,
holly, ginger and so many more.
</P>
<P>
   But still, we plant. It's hard to find a home where nothing has
been added.
</P>
<P>
   For my part, I'm doing all I can as fast as I can to stamp my
land immediately around the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   First, the herb garden at the front door. Then, the space on the
side, which began with ferns, Japanese maples and black pines: It
grows by the week _ including more stones than I can shake a pick
at _ and may someday hint at what Dorothy Fuqua describes as
``Japanesque.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Momma's garden, so named because it embraces many of the
plants my mother's mother so loved _ rose of Sharon, butterfly
bush, zinnia, sweet olive _ continues to thicken with the help of
friends. Evelyn Davenport provided bee balm and foxglove. Laura
Abernathy shared a red rose and some wintergreen, while Greg
Crawford provided Big Momma an abelia. So far, these newcomers seem
not to mind giving up their comfortable homes for my brutally new
and rocky garden.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Galloway gave me a shopping visit to his woods, where I
dug as many hemlocks and white pines as my car would haul (I need a
truck). The little trees promise to grow as big and fine as their
older siblings.
</P>
<P>
   And the plantings continue. In some ways, they reflect our
effort to embrace and complement and extend nature's beauty, to
bring it right up to our own doors. To bring it home. And, yes, to
show ownership and exert control of our spaces, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we do this with plants directly out of the verdant
landscape, sometimes with plants straight from the nursery (or
friends' gardens). Regardless, each plant integrates us with
nature. Each puts a green stamp on the plot that holds our home.

 &HT;    One church, two viewpoints
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 7: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GINNIE HART--52, Cumming, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Ginnie Hart, a 52-year-old preacher's kid, former Bible
translator and ex-wife of an evangelical missionary, has spent much
of her life studying or teaching the Scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as an openly lesbian United Methodist, Hart teaches Bible
classes, attended mostly by gays and lesbians, that focus on how
she believes the Bible has been misused against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole life is coming together,'' said Hart, who works for a
Gwinnett computer company and is building a house in Cumming with
her partner.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, a mother of two who says she had sex with women throughout
her 21-year marriage to a staff member of Intervarsity Christian
Fellowship, never left the church and says she never felt guilty.
``God was the bedrock to me all my life,'' she said. ``I would say
intuitively I knew I was not condemned by God.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your position on the ordination of sexually active
homosexuals and the blessing of same-sex unions?
</P>
<P>
   A: I do not believe there is any reason in Scripture, based on
homosexuality alone, to deny ordination. I would want to know
whether a person, gay or straight, is abusive or unfaithful. Those
are the larger questions.
</P>
<P>
   And when people want to be committed to each other and make that
a public statement, I think the church ought to support them. I
believe one of the problems in the gay community is that we are not
able to make our commitments publicly or openly. It's real easy to
get out of a relationship few people know you're in.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The church essentially says to homosexuals that they should
remain celibate. What's wrong with that position?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the age-old problem of separating the body from the soul
or spirit. Historically, we've had that dichotomy in the church.
All this is a part of who I am. My sexuality, my spirituality,
everything about me is meant to be integrated. To say that it's OK
to be gay as long as you don't `do it' is like saying it's OK to be
hungry but don't eat. It's preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you see as the church's responsibility toward
homosexuals?
</P>
<P>
   A: If we can't find a place in the church where we can find the
name and learn what it means to be homosexual _ that sexually,
emotionally and spiritually I am going to be bonded more closely to
women than to men _ where are we going to find it? Where are we
going to be nurtured and supported? If the church is not going to
be a place where we can learn to be soulful and holy and whole,
where are we going to learn that?
</P>
<P>
   Q: The United Methodist Church and some other denominations make
a distinction between civil rights and the role in the church. They
call for equal employment rights for gays and lesbians and yet will
not ordain them or bless their unions in the church. Do you see any
conflict in these positions?
</P>
<P>
   A: What we've seen is an evolution in the church's understanding
of civil rights. When you get to the point when you can say they
deserve civil rights _ why wouldn't you ordain them?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please outline the theological and scriptural bases for your
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you interpret Scripture literally _ take the text and what
it says ... it probably means you have a conclusion about any
subject. `Women shouldn't preach.' You can go to Scripture and find
a verse to support it. `Homosexuality is an abomination.' It's
easy. You don't have to do a lot of study. The other way to
interpret Scripture _ and to me the only way _ is to do it
historically and critically. We have to know what was going on
historically and culturally to know what the author meant and what
the first audience heard. You find a nugget of truth and apply it
today.
</P>
<P>
   A verse in Leviticus says a man shouldn't lie with a man as with
a woman. ... At that time people were practicing fertility rites as
a part of their religion. In ritual prostitution or fertility
rites, all kinds of sex was happening. Male-male sex was considered
special because it produced double semen. Here comes God, Yahweh,
choosing out people and saying, ``You don't do this.'' The issue
was not an issue of sexuality. The issue was an issue of idolatry.
It had nothing to do with homosexuality as we know it today. If you
don't know what was going on historically and culturally, you'll
misinterpret that text.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does your own experience as a lesbian affect your views?
</P>
<P>
   A: My own experience is that I had every reason in the world not
to be gay. I was a preacher's kid. I was a missionary overseas and,
with my husband, was a stateside missionary supported by friends
and churches. I knew if those people knew what I was struggling
with, then it would devastate them and devastate our ministry. I
was married and had two beautiful children. ... But my own
experience tells me this is who I am. You get to the point where
your only chance at freedom is letting it all go. Until I stopped
fighting, I could not be whole.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the church was not always there for me, God was
always there for me. It's one reason it's been important for me to
stay in the church and try to educate people.
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD LOONEY
</P>
<P>
   64, Macon, Georgia
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Richard Looney, 64, of the South Georgia United Methodist
Conference, has followed and participated in church discussions on
the issue of homosexuality for almost two decades. Looney recalls
debate at the 1980 General Conference ``sounding more and more like
a political rally.'' So he stood and asked the delegates to cease
applauding, telling them, ``This was not a contest. It is a very
delicate subject that affects the lives of people, and we need to
address it with sensitivity and compassion.'' His remarks changed
the tone of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Looney was on a denominational study committee on homosexuality
that brought its report to the 1992 General Conference.
</P>
<P>
   He has been married for more than 40 years and has three
children and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your position on the ordination of sexually active
homosexuals and the blessing of same-sex unions?
</P>
<P>
   A: My personal position and that of the church is that the
practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching.
Sometimes the church is criticized for being closed to homosexuals.
That's not the case at all, but there's a careful distinction
between orientation and practice.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So the church essentially says to homosexuals that they have
to change or remain celibate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. That's for ordination.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To join the United Methodist Church, a person pledges to try
to live by its teachings. Some have suggested that practicing
homosexuals not even be admitted to membership. Would you go that
far?
</P>
<P>
   A: While I don't think we would go on any witch hunt or anything
like that, we would hope that people understood the church's
position and were willing to be loyal to the church.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you see as the church's responsibility toward
homosexuals?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the church by its nature is to be open to all persons
and to offer ministry, to offer guidance and support, but the
church has the right to expect certain standards of its ministers
and its members.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The United Methodist Church and some other denominations call
for equal employment rights for gays and lesbians, and yet will not
ordain them or bless their unions in the church. Do you see any
conflict in
</P>
<P>
   these positions?
</P>
<P>
   A: The church has the right to expect a different standard, or a
higher standard, of its members. While the church would stand for
basic civil and human rights, the church retains for itself the
right to say what basic membership standards and ordination
standards are.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please outline the theological and scriptural bases for your
point of view.
</P>
<P>
   A: The scriptural basis, I think, is very clear. All the
references to homosexuality in the Old and New Testaments are
negative. Nowhere is the practice of homosexuality commended. On
the other side, the positive passages begin even with the story of
creation when God created male and female and blessed their union.
The Old and New Testaments are full of affirmations of marriage
between a man and woman. So, that could be called biblical
theology. ...
</P>
<P>
   We also talk about tradition, how the Scripture has been
interpreted in the broad sweep of Christian history. That's been a
pretty universal understanding of God's will, that human sexuality
is God's gift, but it's to be expressed within the bounds of
marriage between a man and a woman. Then there's what's called
natural theology as well, that which is in keeping with nature.
Personally, from the reading I've done, though I'm not a scientist,
certain practices of homosexuality, particularly male
homosexuality, are a violation of the human anatomy and very high
risk. Again that would be confirmed in Paul's statement in Romans
when he calls homosexuality unnatural. ...
</P>
<P>
   The global understanding of this matter, I would say, is
overwhelmingly geared to the church's traditional position. Some of
the growing churches in Asia and Africa are just amazed that we
spend this much energy on an issue they think is clearly forbidden
in the Christian tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you had friends or family members who are homosexual?
And if so, how did they affect your attitude toward homosexuality?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. ... Their practice or disagreement with the church's
position does not change how I feel about them. Nor does my love of
them change my feeling that the church's position is legitimate and
not only scriptural, but loving. I think all of us can agree that
all persons are of sacred worth, but not all practices are
compatible with Christian teaching.

 &HT;    Debate within the church
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 7: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For United Methodists, the verdict in the church trial of the
Rev. Jimmy Creech was almost as divisive as the O.J. Simpson
verdict was for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Across Methodism, the Creech trial brought to a head simmering
debates about homosexuality. Creech, a pastor in the country's
second-largest Protestant denomination, was acquitted in March of
violating church law by blessing the union of two lesbians at his
Omaha, Neb., church. Eight of the 13-member, all-clergy jury found
him guilty, one short of the nine required for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout continues.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 ministers who supported Creech signed a statement
vowing to continue to bless same-sex unions, while those outraged
at the verdict called for a special session of the denomination's
General Conference to deal with the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   And the issue may find its way into the North and South Georgia
conferences this month.
</P>
<P>
   After his bishop did not reappoint him to his Omaha church,
Creech announced that he will take a leave of absence from the
ministry and move to North Carolina. His last sermon in the Omaha
pulpit will be today.
</P>
<P>
   The Methodists are just one group of many in Christendom
struggling with questions of same-sex relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterians, Lutherans, Episcopalians, Catholics, Baptists and
members of the United Church of Christ have their own skirmishes.
The votes and charges at the national level have filtered down into
metro Atlanta's pews and pulpits, in some cases causing division
within churches and defection from denominations.
</P>
<P>
   On a practical level, the great church debates center on two
questions: Should there be a rite for same-sex unions? And, should
sexually active gay men and lesbian women be ordained to church
office?
</P>
<P>
   But on a theological level, what is at stake may be much greater
than a ceremony or a clerical position. Some leaders on both sides
of the line see themselves in a battle for the soul of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Driving beliefs about homosexuality are views about other,
larger matters:
</P>
<P>
   The Scriptures
</P>
<P>
   Those who oppose recognizing homosexuality as a legitimate
sexual practice take a literalist approach to Bible verses that
refer to same-sex relationships as an ``abomination.'' To accept
such relationships, to them, would undermine the teachings of the
Bible. Those who advocate a more liberal attitude in the churches
say the Bible must be examined through the lenses of experience,
science and later revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people on both sides who take the Bible seriously,''
said the Rev. Michael Wilson, associate pastor of Clairmont
Presbyterian Church in DeKalb County. ``This discussion has a lot
to do with whether we're going to interpret Scripture according to
Scripture or according to the culture in which we live.'' He
believes Scripture is clear that homosexual practice is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Rex Kaney, pastor of Trinity United Methodist Church in
downtown Atlanta, says that Scripture has to be examined in the
light of contemporary understanding. ``Scripture has always had the
primary place, but we have always felt like we needed to do
scholarly and serious search to discern what the Scriptures mean.
As I read the Bible, all those texts about homosexuality are about
several things. They are about violence. They are about lust. They
are about inhospitality. They are not ever, it seems to me at this
point in history, dealing with the subject of homosexuality as
possibly being an orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of God
</P>
<P>
   Most Christians agree that God balances mercy and judgment.
Opponents of homosexual ordination and same-sex unions regard
homosexual activity as sinful and emphasize the need to ask God's
forgiveness and determine to sin no more. Those who say gays and
lesbians are entitled to greater recognition point to God's
inclusivity and the admonition to ``judge not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's an issue of repentance,'' said Joe Whittemore, a
United Methodist layman from Hartwell. ``When we join the Methodist
Church, we're asked if we repent of our sins and reject sin and
intend to lead a new life. We answer `I do' in order to join the
church. So this brings us to the main issue of whether homosexual
acts are sin. I believe the answer is very clearly yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's a justice issue,'' said the Rev. Tim Shirley,
pastor of Virginia-Highland Baptist Church. ``It is an issue of the
gospel. Never do I see where Jesus delegates anyone to second-class
status. Never do I see where Jesus excludes anyone. It just isn't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of the church
</P>
<P>
   The names of two movements within United Methodism describe the
attitudes of the two factions toward the church. Reconciling
Congregations are those who intentionally include gays and
lesbians, focusing on the need to bring in and nurture everyone as
a member of God's family. Transforming Congregations are those who
believe homosexuals can be changed in their orientation through
God's healing powers, or can find the courage to live a life of
celibacy in order to conform to the church's teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing black, white, gay, straight, old and young together
around the Communion table at Grant Park-Aldersgate United
Methodist Church is a foretaste of the kingdom of God, said the
church's pastor, the Rev. Pat York. The church's affiliation with
the Reconciling group is more than a political statement, she said.
``We're willing to be open and welcoming and affirming, and we're
willing to say that. When all churches become in reality
reconciling, we'll all be Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Pat Looper, pastor of Faith United Methodist Church in
Riverdale, said she supports the mission of the Transforming
Congregations ``wholeheartedly'' because ``they are the ones giving
the truth to people. How terrible to say to the wife abuser, the
alcoholic or the adulterer that nothing's going to change! You can
be transformed through Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of sexual expression
</P>
<P>
   While both sides say they see sexual expression ideally as an
expression of commitment and love, in general those who would
prohibit the blessing of same-sex unions or the ordination of
sexually active homosexuals see sex as tied to procreation and
God's plan of creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans are to see their sex as a part of the ongoing flow of
life, as a blessed link in the generations, becoming fathers and
mothers to the generations of tomorrow in a way that can be
honored, and then honoring the fathers and mothers who went
before,'' said Max Stackhouse, professor of Christian ethics at
Princeton Theological Seminary, in a recent discussion sponsored by
a ``centrist'' group in the United Church of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sharon Taylor, pastor of Atlanta's Ormewood Park
Presbyterian Church, counters that God created humans to live in
families. ``I'm thinking when we say to gay and lesbian people that
they cannot create relationships, that we're telling them they
cannot live in families. You must do life all by yourself,'' she
said. ``That is so far removed from everything we talk about with
God and making communities and loving that it feels sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements run deep, but most mainline Christians do agree on
some statements about sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by the Alliance of Baptists, a moderate group of
Southern and American Baptists, is echoed in reports by other
denominations, including the United Methodist Church and the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). The statement says:
</P>
<P>
   -- Human sexuality is a gift of God and should be ``accepted
with gratitude and expressed responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Genital sex ``is most responsibly expressed when it occurs in
the context of caring, loving, committed, covenant relationships
between monogamous adults.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Sexual abuse and exploitation are contrary to God's will.
</P>
<P>
   -- Human sexual behavior is imperfect.
</P>
<P>
   Several mainline denominations have also adopted resolutions
calling for civil rights for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond these basic statements, consensus is hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   A 1992 United Methodist report concluded with an admission that
it was left with ``unresolvable questions and disagreements,'' and
acknowledged the possibility that ``no study process will be able
to answer the important questions conclusively or bridge all the
differences soon.''
</P>
<P>
   With more bishops, priests and ministers willing to defy their
denominations by blessing same-sex unions and ordaining
homosexuals, and more legislative action pending before several
bodies, there is no end in view.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the country's historic Christian bodies
can hold together while the grappling goes on.

ALFRED KAZIN, 83, AUTHOR AND CRITIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mass.)  (lb) 
 By WILBORN HAMPTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alfred Kazin, author, critic, teacher and New York
intellectual, died Friday at his home on the Upper West Side of
Manhattan on his 83rd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Through the last few years of his life Kazin lived with the slow
progression of prostate cancer and also suffered from bone cancer
in his last months. He continued to work until the end. Only weeks
before his death he wrote a critical appraisal of Isaac Bashevis
Singer for The New York Review, and he consulted on plans for the
paperback edition of his latest book, ``God and the American
Writer'' (Alfred A. Knopf), which was published last year.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 50 years Kazin wrote prolifically about two great
subjects: American literature and himself. His territory was the
Brownsville section of Brooklyn, where he grew up; the streets of
the city, which he restlessly walked as if Herman Melville, Edgar
Allan Poe and Walt Whitman were beside him, and the landscape of
American literature, which he criticized with passionate intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Roth, commenting Friday on Kazin's contribution to
American letters, said: ``To understand what a colossal achievement
Alfred's life was, one has only to remember that in 1942, when he
was still in his 20s _ and the Brooklyn-born son of uneducated
Yiddish-speaking immigrants _ he wrote `On Native Grounds,' a
brilliant reinterpretation of American literature from William Dean
Howells to William Faulkner, a book of literary criticism which
read like a passionate communication intended for intelligent,
living human beings rather than like a 1940s academic exercise or a
1930s political tract. He was America's best reader of American
literature in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading and writing were Kazin's lifeblood. He could recall
whole passages from novels with acuity and he wrote prolifically,
finding in the written word a sort of religion that sustained him
throughout his life and with which he never broke faith.
``Literature has been my lifework, my passion, and oddly enough my
`profession.''' he once said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   As a critic, Kazin said writers should be understood in relation
to their culture. Unlike the New Critics, he did not engage in
minute textual analyses, and he paid less attention to style and
form than to the relationship of a literary work to its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any critic who is any good,'' he wrote in ``Contemporaries,''
a critical survey of modern writing, ``is going to write out of a
profound inner struggle between what has been and what must be, the
values he is used to and those which presently exist, between the
past and the present out of which the future must be born.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview, he said: ``Criticism for me was not a
theory. It was a branch of literature, a way of writing like any
other _ of characterization, analysis and almost physical empathy.
One could be a writer without writing a novel. Every taxi driver
and bartender who told you his story wanted to be a novelist.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``An American Procession'' (1984), his historical survey of
American writers, was published, Marcus Cunliffe said in The New
York Times Book Review that Kazin had confirmed ``a reservation in
the front tier of the reviewing stand, next to his eminent
predecessors, Van Wyck Brooks and Edmund Wilson.''

LAWMAKERS KICKING THE (CAMPAIGN) HABIT OF ACCEPTING TOBACCO MONEY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional trim included) 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Kay Bailey Hutchison first ran for the Senate,
she depended on contributions from tobacco interests to help fill
her campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
   But more recently, the Texas Republican decided to kick the
habit, joining an increasing number of lawmakers who are trying to
distance themselves from an unpopular industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said she became miffed at the tobacco companies after
their executives testified before Congress that they didn't believe
their product was addictive and they weren't trying to coerce young
people into smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided they were not telling the truth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the senator has not accepted tobacco contributions
and returned several donations that came anyway, according to an
analysis of Federal Election Commission campaign reports by the
Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the previous two years, Hutchison took more than $55,000 from
tobacco companies and their executives to help pay for two
expensive Senate campaigns. She first ran in 1993 in a special
election to fill the seat vacated by Lloyd Bentsen and later again
in 1994 for the regular six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Not all lawmakers share Hutchison's aversion to tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' other senator, Republican Phil Gramm, has continued to
accept industry contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm spokesman Larry Neal suggested that shunning tobacco
contributions was largely a public relations ploy and that the
senator considered it sufficient that he disclose the sources of
his contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people try, for political purposes, to grandly explain
how they are not going to take contributions. ... It is not a
political tactic we use,'' said Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1996, Gramm received more than $33,000 from
tobacco companies and executives.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been one of the most vocal opponents of the
anti-smoking legislation now being considered by the Senate. The
measure would substantially increase the price of cigarettes and
give the federal government broad authority to regulate tobacco
products.
</P>
<P>
   However, debate has slowed considerably because of moves by
Gramm and others to attach unrelated amendments, such as
eliminating the tax burden on married couples and funding anti-drug
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she has been angered at the tobacco companies'
attitudes, Hutchison has not embraced the anti-smoking measure
before the Senate, in part, because it is opposed by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said she believes that proposed restrictions on
tobacco advertising included in the original bill will never come
to pass because the industry will not voluntarily comply with the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   Despite increasing reluctance by some lawmakers to accept
donations, the big tobacco companies have continued to pour large
amounts into the political system.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies appear to be making donations through their
non-tobacco affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette makers are also shifting their resources from
backing individual candidates to making unrestricted donations to
political parties and their House and Senate re-election
committees. These donations, known as ``soft money,'' can be used
for such functions as party building.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, the nation's largest tobacco company, has been
the most generous ``soft money'' contributor to the Republican
National Committee over the last three years, giving $1.1 million
in 1997 and $275,000 so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause president Ann McBride said that the tobacco
industry can still wield influence over lawmakers through soft
money contributions. And she questioned whether lawmakers could
distance themselves from the companies unless they condemned their
parties' acceptance of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have it both ways on this issue,'' she said.``They
(lawmakers) should be taking an activist role in stopping soft
money from coming in any form to affect federal elections.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though tobacco is not grown in Texas, 16 of the state's
30-member House delegation received a total of $57,500 in tobacco
contributions in 1997 and the first few months of 1998, according
to the Center for Responsive Politics analysis.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, a vocal critic of the
anti-tobacco legislation being considered by the Senate, was the
largest recipient among state lawmakers at $11,000.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay spokesman Mike Scanlon said the Houston-area congressman's
decision to take tobacco money is ``just a matter of individual
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all lawmakers who take tobacco money are opposed to the
anti-smoking legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Take Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, who has supported such measures
and also received $1,000 in tobacco money in the current election
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he accepts money from large tobacco companies that
have non-tobacco related subsidiaries that employ workers in his
district. Green cited RJR Nabisco, which has a local plant that
makes crackers, and Phillip Morris that runs a Maxwell House coffee
operation in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Kevin Brady of The Woodlands hasn't decided
where he stands on the anti-smoking legislation, but he won't take
tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very low opinion of the tobacco industry,'' said
Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Other Houston-area representatives that have policies of
rejecting tobacco contributions are Democrats Ken Bentsen and Nick
Lampson.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Black, a tobacco industry lobbyist and a top adviser in
Gramm's recent unsuccessful presidential bid, said that he has
noted that more politicians have been refusing tobacco money in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But Black said he doubted that politicians help themselves much
by refusing such contributions. And he added, ``It is hard enough
to raise money without handcuffing yourself beyond existing
limits.'' &QL;

 NEW YORK: Edmund Wilson.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred Kazin was born on June 5, 1915, the son of Charles Kazin,
a house painter, and the former Gita Fagelman, a dressmaker, both
of whom had emigrated as youths from czarist Russia. From his
childhood in Brownsville, Kazin and his sister, Pearl, were imbued
with the immigrant, working-class values that were to sustain a
society through the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my first conscious moments,'' he said in an interview
after publication of ``A Walker in the City'' in 1951, ``I was
absorbed in the most intimate problems of the working class, in the
fire and color of immigrant life. I was by temperament created for
the idea of revolution, in the sense of making the world over and
creating a new society.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazin remembered growing up as a ``very lonely and unhappy kid''
who suffered from a stammer and sought distraction in books and
music. ``Do you know when I stopped?'' he recalled of his childhood
stammer. ``When I became a professional writer. I knew I had
something that could not be taken away from me.'' He also studied
the violin and remained throughout his life ``a poor but determined
violinist.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents instilled in him what he later described as ``quaint
old-fashioned socialism'' and the ``historic Jewish effort to
realize the kingdom of God in this world.'' He escaped the poverty
of his youth through the pages of books.
</P>
<P>
   But if literature transported him far from the tenements of his
childhood, he never disowned his origins, to which he returned
frequently, with affection and wit and honesty, in his writings. He
described himself as ``intensely Jewish'' but did not wear his
ethnicity on his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   His entry into the world of letters began almost by accident.
Like so many of the new generation of young intellectuals in New
York City, sons and daughters of immigrants for the most part,
Kazin attended City College, honing his literary sensibilities and
opinions from the many newspapers and magazines that were published
in the city through the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1934, while riding a subway to classes from Brooklyn,
Kazin was reading a book review in The New York Times by John
Chamberlain. The review so enraged him that the young undergraduate
got off the train at Times Square and went to complain personally.
His arguments against the book so impressed Chamberlain that he
wrote a note to Malcolm Cowley at The New Republic, suggesting he
hire Kazin. ``Here's an intelligent radical for you,'' he said, and
Kazin began to write for the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Kazin spent most of the next 60 years writing. He earned his
bachelor's degree in 1935 from City College and his master's degree
in English three years later. He began writing reviews and essay
for other magazines and took a strong interest in the new writing
of the time. In 1937, Carl Van Doren, then a professor at Columbia
University, suggested that he undertake a book-length study of
modern American literature.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next five years working on the book, writing
alongside his friend Richard Hofstadter, who was working on the
Columbia dissertation that would establish him as a historian when
it was published as ``Social Darwinism in American Thought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd work all morning at the New York Public Library, eat
lunch at the Automat across the street, play one game of pingpong _
at which he'd beat me _ at a pool parlor on 42nd Street,'' Kazin
once remembered. ``Then we'd work the rest of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazin titled his book ``On Native Grounds,'' and its publication
in 1942 established him as one of the bright young critics of his
time. The book was a wide-ranging review of the history of American
literature beginning with William Dean Howells, through Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   The book set a standard for literary criticism.
</P>
<P>
   With World War II raging in Europe, Kazin took an assignment on
behalf of the Office of War Information and the Rockefeller
Foundation and went to London to study the British labor movement
and education in the British army. On his return, he moved back to
Brooklyn and began work on a memoir about a boy growing up in
``Brunzvil,'' as he recalled it being rendered by its residents.
</P>
<P>
   The book was ``A Walker in the City,'' and Kazin later said he
had sought to write something like Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass'' or
``The Bridge'' by Hart Crane in prose. When it appeared in 1951,
Leslie Fiedler complained that it ``obstinately refuses to become a
novel,'' Norman Mailer thought the boy narrator was too virtuous,
and Lionel Trilling said he was a ``schmo.''
</P>
<P>
   But the memoir established Kazin as one of the country's leading
postwar voices and commanded a growing readership drawn to its
evocative prose:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last crazy afternoon light the neons over the
delicatessens bathe all their wares in a cosmetic smile, but strip
the street of every personal shadow and concealment. The torches
over the pushcarts hold in a single breath of yellow flame the acid
smell of half-sour pickles and herring floating in their briny
barrels. There is a dry rattle of loose newspaper sheets around the
cracked stretched skins of the `chiney' oranges. Through the
kitchen windows along every ground floor I can already see the
containers of milk, the fresh round poppy-seed evening rolls. Time
for supper, time to go home.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Other books followed, including such volumes of criticism as
``The Inmost Leaf'' (1955), ``Contemporaries'' (1960), which Kazin
dedicated to Edmund Wilson, and ``An American Procession'' (1984),
as well as the memoirs ``Starting Out in the 30s'' (1965), ``New
York Jew'' (1978), ``A Writer's America'' (1988), ``Our New York''
(1990) and ``God and the American Writer'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   The books often viewed American letters through a particular
prism. ``A Writer's America,'' for example, examined the influences
of the diverse American landscape _ urban as well as rural _ on its
writers, just as ``God and the American Writer'' looked at the
effects the country's religious heritage had on its literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American Procession'' charted the path of the nation's
letters over the course of what Kazin called ``the crucial
century'' from 1830 to 1930, and ``Contemporaries'' was a survey of
writers in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walker in the City,'' ``Starting Out in the 30s'' and ``New
York Jew'' were memoirs in which Kazin explored the childhood,
adolescence and young adulthood of a son of immigrants, recreating
the world of the liberal Jewish intellectual that was to have such
a profound influence on American culture in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In between publication dates, Kazin earned his living writing
reviews and essays for newspapers and magazines like American
Mercury, Partisan Review, The New Yorker and Harper's Magazine. He
was literary editor of The New Republic and an associate editor of
Fortune. He also wrote countless introductions to reprint editions
of classic and more contemporary works.
</P>
<P>
   Kazin was also a guest professor at universities in the United
States and abroad. He taught at Harvard, Smith, Notre Dame,
Berkeley, Cambridge, Cologne and the University of Puerto Rico, to
name only a few. He later held distinguished professorships at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook, and the City
University of New York, at Hunter College and the Graduate Center.
</P>
<P>
   As a critic, Kazin could be exacting. Although he had sympathy
for the disdain the Beat generation in the 1950s had for the
excesses of American society, he was dismissive of the writing it
produced. ``The `Beats' are mostly middle-class kids looking for
kicks,'' he wrote in 1960. ``They're bored by the fat-dripping
society around them. The kids coming up now see a bunch of tired
liberals shooting off their mouths about what happened in the '30s.
They can't get interested.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he admired the spirit of the civil-rights movement
of the 1960s and observed, ``The young Negroes demonstrating in the
Southern sit-ins are not bored, you can be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazin himself was active in the civil-rights movement and was
involved in other causes. He joined the fight against the Post
Office Department's attempt to ban ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' as
obscene, and as a member of a remarkable and acrimonious circle of
Manhattan intellectuals participated in the political and aesthetic
disputes over socialism, communism and Western culture that
invigorated New York life in the 1930s, '40s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues included Irving Howe and Irving Kristol, Norman
Podhoretz, Lionel and Diana Trilling, William Barrett, William
Phillips, Mary McCarthy, Sidney Hook and Harold Rosenberg. Many of
the friendships did not survive professional jealousies and the
rise of neoconservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Kazin, an unreconstructed liberal, never forgave Podhoretz and
Kristol when they turned to the right. ``I detest their politics,''
he said of the neoconservatives in New York magazine in 1995.
Podhoretz retorted: ``I think Kazin's gone off the deep end
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Kazin was admired for his scholarship, his broad range of
interests and his emotional vitality. He wrote in a deliberate
style that was infused with wit and grace. His critics sometimes
felt that his views rambled. John Gross, reviewing
``Contemporaries,'' a collection of essays, said Kazin's criticism
sometimes lacked a ``compulsive central theme, a fixed view of men
and books.''
</P>
<P>
   There was little that Kazin found wholeheartedly good in modern
literature. In later years, he expressed doubt that much writing of
this century would find a lasting place in history's library.
``There's always Faulkner, of course,'' he would usually add.
</P>
<P>
   Once, asked about his favorite writer, he said, ``The book I
most often dip into is Gibbon's `Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire.' I like to reread Gibbon in the anxious watches of the
night because he is so reassuring about history and himself. Gibbon
knew _ he thought he knew exactly _ what was virtue and what was
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   His love affair with literature carried him through a sometimes
stormy private life that included four marriages. His first was to
Natasha Dohn, also the daughter of Russian immigrants. The marriage
ended in divorce, and he married Caroline Bookman, with whom he had
a son, Michael. That marriage lasted three years, and in 1952, he
wed Ann Birstein, a novelist, with whom he had a daughter,
Cathrael. He married Judith Dunford, also a writer, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   A dashing man with almond-shaped eyes hooded by bushy brows,
Kazin was a charming and soft-spoken conversationalist who, as one
interviewer described him, ``carried his erudition lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed good food and wine and talk and loved to travel. ``My
idea of heaven,'' he once said, ``is to settle down in a jet with a
book, a notebook and a martini.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; a son, Michael of Chevy Chase, Md.;
a daughter, Cathrael Kazin of Jerusalem; two stepsons, Jonathan
Dunford of Paris and Nathaniel Dunford of New York; a stepdaughter,
Hilary Shanahan of New York; a sister, Pearl Bell of Boston; two
grandchildren and five stepgrandchildren .
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Kazin made no apologies for being a hard critic. ``I am
dissatisfied, profoundly so, with the world as it is,'' he once
observed. ``But I would be dissatisfied with any world. And I'd
hate to lose my dissatisfaction.''

HOPE (Washington) _ The testimonials to Bob Hope on the U.S. House
floor were so heartfelt that one could almost imagine the
95-year-old entertainer were still alive. In fact, he was. A
thoroughly embarrassing string of events, even by congressional
standards, started when House Majority Leader Dick Armey introduced
Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., for an ``announcement I think will be of
great interest to this body.'' Stump stepped to the microphone and
said, ``Mr. Speaker, I have the sad responsibility to tell you this
afternoon that Bob Hope passed away.'' At that moment, Hope was
finishing breakfast in California. The culprit was an Associated
Press article being prepared in the event of Hope's death. The
article somehow was inadvertently displayed on the news service's
Web site. Stump, who has known Hope since 1943, called Hope to
apologize and was told by Hope's daughter that he ``was alive and
well.'' Said Stump: ``I said we were sorry and that I hoped Mr.
Hope got a kick out of it.'' By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL;

UNCOVERED (Phoenix) - Thousands of Arizona's former welfare
families are walking away from free state health care benefits, and
no one is sure why. While bureaucrats debate what to do, these
former welfare families are increasingly dependent on costly
emergency room care at taxpayers' expense _ even though most remain
eligible for state insurance coverage. Arizona is not alone.
Arizona's welfare reform began a year earlier than most states, but
researchers already are tracking this unexpected impact nationwide.
By PAT KOSSAN. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RELIGION (Phoenix) - The line between church and state shrinks to a
pinstripe at a Higley, Arizona, charter school. While the school
runs on taxpayer dollars, its big red-white-and-blue sign proudly
proclaims: ``In God We Trust.'' At a Phoenix charter school, a
picture of the Virgin Mary hung for a time in the school office.
And in Mesa, Aria., a charter school placed an advertisement
encouraging students to attend Mormon seminary. When it comes to
separating religion and government, there are charter schools that
walk that fine line and others that have clearly crossed it. KELLY
PEARCE. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PEYOTE (Phoenix) - Leo Mercado claims that his use of the
hallucinogenic drug peyote is part of his religion, a ``sacrament''
that helps him to spiritually purge his soul and cleanse his life.
But a Pinal County Superior Court judge saw it differently, ruling
this week that Mercado was essentially hiding behind the cloak of
religious immunity to veil illegal activities and that he should
forfeit a quantity of the drug. By JUDI VILLA. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PEACE (Phoenix) - As if students at Arizona State University East
don't already go to school in the hinterlands, they'll soon go even
farther in pursuit of college degrees. Beginning this fall, ASU
East will offer master's level credit for agribusiness students who
join a special Peace Corps program. By MELISSA L. JONES. Story will

EMBATTLED NEW YORK REPUBLICAN VOWS TOUGH FIGHT TO RETAIN SENATE
SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACEY TULLY  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ushered in by a chorus of delegates who shouted ``He
delivers,'' Sen. Alfonse D'Amato won the endorsement Friday of the
Republican State Committee _ an organization he helped mold into a
political powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, the state Republican Party's modern patriarch and chief
fund-raiser, was the only candidate during the two-day convention
to make a grand entrance from the rear of the hall, wading slowly
through the aisle, grasping outstretched hands as the theme song
from the movie ``Rocky'' played.
</P>
<P>
   His acceptance speech, which began with a nostalgic snap-shop of
his immigrant family tree, took on the media as much as it did his
would-be opponent.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized editorial writers and national newspapers for
failing to understand his work and defended his fund-raising as a
strategy designed to make sure he has the means to take his message
directly to the people.
</P>
<P>
   As of April, D'Amato, chairman of the powerful Senate Banking
Committee, had raised $17 million and had $10.8 million on hand to
spend, dwarfing the sums collected by the three Democrats vying for
their party's nod to run against the 18-year incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, however, has made it clear that D'Amato is
their primary target in the upcoming races in New York. His
potential opponents are former vice presidential candidate and talk
show host Geraldine Ferraro; U.S. Rep. Charles Schumer; and New
York City Public Advocate Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   The man who said he chose to enter to the theme song from
``Rocky'' because it is a symbol of ``someone who took on the odds
and did it his way,'' remained on the offensive throughout his
speech, mocking critics who say he helps those who, financially,
help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Al D'Amato helps his friends. Oooooh. Shocking. That
must be something anti-American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato, who is trailing in polls and painted himself as the
beleaguered underdog on Friday, did say he intends to campaign
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' he said, ``I never take a race for granted. The state
has more Democrats than Republicans. But the fact of the matter is:
I've never been better positioned if you look at it realistically.
And I feel terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 4.9 million registered Democrats in New York, compared
to the state's nearly 3.1 million Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island native's message rang true with delegates from
other parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to me to be a no-nonsense elected official who can be
credited with listening to the plight of the everyday person,''
said Peter Crummey, minority leader of the Albany County
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's known as somebody who cares about the little things as
well as the big.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest groups the senator is tackling this year are
the teachers, who wield ample political muscle and campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who has called for merit pay for good teachers and an
end to automatic tenure, reiterated his education reform goals on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should give them merit pay to encourage them,'' D'Amato
said. ``We should also recognize that there has to be a level of
competency.''

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS IS BOOMING FOR SMALL U.S. ARMS DEALERS

 By RAYMOND F. BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Solomon Islands, a tiny country in the Pacific with a
population of 400,000, has no army and a police force of barely a
thousand including traffic cops. But last summer the government
purchased enough equipment to outfit a small combat unit including
assault rifles, machine guns, helmets, boots and two small
airplanes from a U.S. company.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon and the U.S. Customs Service, officials
expressed misgivings about the sale, fearing that the weapons and
the gear were destined for rebels in nearby Papau, New Guinea.
Others argued that it would be better for the Solomon Islands to
invest in health and education. Australia and New Zealand also
opposed the deal, believing it was irresponsible to be bringing
more weapons into the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department accepted that the arms were necessary
for the police and issued the necessary licenses. Since then, a
newly elected government in the Solomon Islands, suspicious about
the motives for the arms deal, has launched an investigation and
tried to cancel it.
</P>
<P>
   While the sale to the Solomon Islands is military peanuts _ only
$3.4 million _ it offers a window into the workings of the small
arms trade which has equipped terrorist organizations and civil
wars from Afghanistan to Rwanda. Within the U.S. government,
arguments that such sales might fuel an ethnic conflict, or go to a
government with a poor human rights record, are routinely drowned
out by arguments that the deal will be good for U.S. business and
improve relations with other countries, U. S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the end of the Cold War has brought a decline in
government sales of tanks and jet fighters, the private military
trade is booming. From annual sales of between $2 billion to $3
billion during most of the Cold War, shipments have climbed to more
than $25 billion in 1996, government records show.
</P>
<P>
   These private sales of small military weapons are more difficult
for Congress and the public to track than the transfers of military
hardware sold by the Pentagon. The government agencies that license
private sales, including the State and Commerce departments as well
as the Customs Service, will not release information about who gets
licenses for what weapons because the records are considered
``confidential business information.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the so-called small arms _ assault rifles, pistols,
mortars _ that are fueling the regional, ethnic and nationalist
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Available in abundance, cheap to buy, requiring little
training to use, small arms have become the weapons of choice for
the present day conflicts fought mostly in the streets and back
lanes by irregular troops in violation of accepted standards of
humanitarian law,'' United Nation's Under Secretary General for
Disarmament Jayanthan Dhanapala said at a recent conference on
controlling the trade in light weapons in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of the victims of small arms fire are women
and children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joost Hilterman, director of the Arms Control Project at Human
Rights Watch, characterized the Solomon Islands transaction as
``fairly typical'' of small arms deals. Major governments, like the
United States, and even more so Russia and China, he said, sell
weapons for commercial reasons without caring much about the
consequences. And while an individual deal might mean little for
the a large arms producing nation, the consequences can be
devastating for the region where the weapons are headed.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. military officer who has served in the Pacific
agreed. ``Here you have a country that has virtually no money for
basic services for its citizens, for schools, hospitals, roads.
What is the compelling reason for spending money on arms? Can't we
just be the ones to say `no.'?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has pushed for international treaties
to curb the illegal trade in firearms, because these generally end
up in the hands of street criminals, organized crime syndicates, or
organizations Washington considers terrorist, like the Tamil Tigers
in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a growing movement by groups like the British
American Security Information Council and the International
Committee of the Red Cross as well as governments like Norway and
Belgium to put controls on the legal arms trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to control the illegal trade in light weapons,
there has to be more controls on the legal trade, beginning with
more transparency.'' said Lora Lumpe, director of the Arms Sales
Monitoring Project at the Federation of American Scientists in
Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most shipments of light weapons receive ``little or no
congressional or public scrutiny,'' she said. The State Department,
she explained, is only required to report to Congress on individual
military sales in excess of $14 million and many small arms deals
fall below that amount, such as the one to the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon Islands deal would likely have remained a secret had
it not been for the change of government there last August, just
weeks after the prior government had ordered the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The new government has launched an investigation aimed in part
at learning more about the U.S. company that sold the weapons,
Century Arms.
</P>
<P>
   The company is one of the largest arms traders in the United
States but its activities are shrouded in secrecy. The State and
Commerce departments, as well as the Customs Service, all declined
to provide any information about the licenses the company has
received for arms dealings. The company has offices in St. Albans,
Vt., and Boca Raton, Fla. Calls to both of these offices asking for
comment on the Solomon Islands sale were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   While the State Department has defended the Solomon Islands
shipment because the weapons ``would be used by the Royal Solomon
Islands Police,'' the new Solomon Islands government does not think
so. It has asked the New Zealand government to seize one of the
ships carrying the weapons. New Zealand complied and the weapons
are now being held there while the Solomon Islands government
searches for a buyer.

<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ An object found at the regional air traffic
control center in Olathe on Wednesday was a personal joke between a
contractor's employees and was not meant to resemble a bomb,
authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a personal matter between two people,'' said FBI
spokesman Jeff Lanza. ``They just left it behind in the rest
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanza said there was no evidence that the two intended to make
the quart-sized water bottle filled with a brownish-yellow fluid
resemble a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no laws violated, at least not at the federal
level,'' Lanza said. No charges will be filed and the case has been
closed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The object sent a scare through the Kansas City Air Route
Traffic Control Center at 9:35 a.m. Wednesday _ one of the center's
busiest times.
</P>
<P>
   Its discovery forced controllers to reroute about 200 airplanes
and temporarily ground 41 flights at more than 600 airports in the
area, including Kansas City International and Lambert-St. Louis
International.
</P>
<P>
   The Olathe Fire Department took the object _ a clear plastic
water bottle with a disposable cup on the top and a cigarette
sticking out like a fuse _ to its explosives range and drew a
sample of the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a nonflammable, sugary, water-based,
noncarbonated liquid.
</P>
<P>
   By 11:30 a.m, employees had returned to their jobs and the
Olathe Center returned to normal operation.
</P>
<P>
   Lanza declined to release the name of the contractor or the
employees involved. He also would not discuss the nature of the
joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a personal thing unrelated to the center,'' he said.
``It was only a coincidence it looked like a bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanza said the contractor's employees contacted the FBI late
Wednesday after they saw news reports about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   He said the individuals told the FBI that they inadvertently
left the object in the men's room. It was discovered within a few
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Lanza said the FBI interviewed those involved Wednesday evening
and Thursday morning for several hours before taking the
information to the U.S. attorney's office, which determined no
charges would be filed.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Federal Aviation Administration reacted
appropriately even though the object ended up not being a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA did everything it should have done, given the fact
they didn't know what it was and the level of security they must
maintain,'' he said. ``They took the proper steps....It looked like
a bomb, and they are trained in what to do. They took the proper
steps to protect human life.''

   GOLDMAN-WORTH (New York) _ Goldman, Sachs has taken many
companies to market, putting its imprimatur on the value of
thousands of public offerings of shares. So what value would it put
on itself? The answer, as might be expected with a franchise as
envied as Goldman, is not clear-cut, and estimates range from as
low as $15 billion to as high as $35 billion. So, if Goldman were
to sell a 20 percent piece of itself to the public this fall, as
some expect, it would be making a multibillion-dollar offering,
possibly one of the biggest in recent years. By Peter Truell.

REVIEWING THE NEW CHEVROLET PICKUPS
</HEADLINE>
 (Repeating for all needing) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, folks, here it comes _ the vehicle you've been waiting for
since Dodge introduced the new Ram in 1994 and Ford brought out the
new F-150 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors finally has caught up, and let me tell you, it
was worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet's all-new, full-size pickup begins rolling into
showrooms late this summer, the first remake of this vehicle since
the current generation, C/K, debuted for 1988.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, the truck takes the name Silverado, which in the past
was the designation for an uplevel trim package on the Chevy
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The GMC version, which will show up in the fall, has a new name,
too: the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   To answer the big question first: No, there are no radical
styling changes, such as those on the Ram and F-150.
</P>
<P>
   These trucks look different, make no mistake about that. But
they still look like General Motors full-size pickups; they're just
a bit rounder and have some updated trim, such as new headlights,
grilles and bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Ram and F-150, the big differences aren't in style,
they're in substance. These trucks are stronger, faster, bigger,
roomier, and more high-tech than before _ and they outclass the
competition in all of those areas.
</P>
<P>
   Take the back seat in the extended-cab models. It's a real seat,
with enough leg and knee room even for big folks. And the third
door, which comes on the passenger side, is larger than before (and
larger than those in the Dodge and Ford), which makes it easier to
get in and out.
</P>
<P>
   The new GM pickups' V-8 engines are more powerful than the
competitions', too, with no penalty in fuel economy. In fact, gas
mileage exceeds that of the Ram and matches or exceeds that of the
F-150 in almost all cases.
</P>
<P>
   Braking is vastly improved over the past C/K model and the
competition. The GM trucks stop 30 to 50 feet sooner than the
current models from 80 mph, thanks to large, four-wheel disc brakes
and a standard, four-wheel antilock system _ an exclusive feature
for this vehicle class.
</P>
<P>
   The body is stronger than before, cutting down significantly on
squeaks and rattles, and providing better occupant protection. The
frame is 23 percent stiffer than that of the current model,
creating a strong foundation, and the frame is welded together,
rather than riveted, to add to that strength.
</P>
<P>
   Even the cargo box's strength has been improved _ by 20 percent,
GM says. That's from the use of new high-strength, low-alloy steel.
</P>
<P>
   Reliability should be dramatically improved, too. The electrical
wiring, for instance, has five splices _ down from 92 in the
current model. Ford's F-150 has 118 wiring splices _ places where
something can go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There are some other great features about the new Chevy and GMC
trucks, too. They come with a coolant-loss protection system that
allows them to be driven up to 50 miles at 55 miles per hour with
no coolant in the radiator.
</P>
<P>
   Battery rundown protection is built in: It shuts down the
electrical accessories if any are inadvertently left on after the
engine has been turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Even the windows have been enlarged for greater visibility.
Brighter headlights and backup lights add to the visibility, and
the lights come on automatically when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Five engines are available on the Silverado and Sierra, a V-6
and four V-8s, including a turbodiesel. Here are the choices:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 4.3-liter V-6, with 200 horsepower and 260 foot-pounds of
torque.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Vortec 4.8-liter V-8, with 255 horsepower and 285
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Vortec 5.3-liter V-8, with 270 horsepower and 315
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Vortec 6.0-liter V-8, with 300 horsepower and 355
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   _ And a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V-8 with 215 horsepower and a
whopping 440 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Four transmissions are offered: regular and heavy-duty
five-speed manuals, and regular and heavy-duty four-speed
automatics.

AMERICA'S SAVINGS RATE IS A SHALLOW STATISTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The rap on America's savings rate doesn't
seem justified given the growth of rainy-day assets and U.S.
economic performance.
</P>
<P>
   One local observer, anticipating this week's savings summit in
Washington, lamented the fact that ``our savings rates are lower
than at any time since World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds bad, but consider: America is doing quite well, thank
you. Our robust economic growth, low unemployment and negligible
inflation are the envy of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The observer, incidentally, is Bill Lyons, president and chief
operating officer of American Century Cos. Inc., parent company of
the American Century mutual funds family based in Kansas City.
Lyons no doubt is more acutely aware than most that mutual fund
assets topped $5 trillion this spring. That number is up from about
$300 billion in 1982, a phenomenon that isn't exactly reflective of
a wastrel society.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, the amount Americans have put into the mutual
fund piggy bank since the early 1980s just about equals the growth
in the national debt during that time. Meanwhile, Washington
collected hundreds of billions of dollars more in Social Security
taxes than it needed to finance benefits and spent the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   What's ironic about the savings summit is that it's being held
in the nation's capital, where more has probably been done to
discourage thrift than any place in America. Nevertheless, Congress
and the White House ordered the confab to encourage Americans to
save more for their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   What's really needed, however, is not so much a talkfest on the
subject but the political embrace of a set of policy measures that
would eliminate the myriad government-created disincentives to
saving in America. The first step should be to eliminate taxation
of the rewards derived when money is saved rather than spent. The
second step would be creation of a dual Social Security track that
would allow taxpayers to save some of their payroll taxes for their
own use in personal retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of this issue is the question of whether the
savings problem really is as bad as many claim. Judging from
America's enviable situation, it certainly wouldn't seem so.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this? The method of measuring savings distorts reality.
The rate is determined simply by subtracting national consumption
from after-tax income. This fails to account for the wealth created
by the soaring stock market or the equity buildup being enjoyed by
homeowners. Moreover, there's no way to measure the psychological
deterrent to saving created by Social Security taxes, which have
become a heavier load than the income tax burden for a majority of
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   As for savings, the magnitude isn't as important as the way the
resources are used. Thailand, South Korea and Japan all have much
higher rates of saving than America, for instance, but those
countries are a mess. One reason for the Asian economic turmoil is
that much of the savings were squandered on ill-advised
investments. It doesn't matter how much a society saves if the
money isn't transformed into sound wealth-creating investment.
</P>
<P>
   This is something else for the summiteers in Washington to keep
in mind. The masses who provided savings in Asia were essentially
betrayed by their political and business leaders. Now they have the
worst of all worlds: diminished prosperity and increasingly
doubtful prospects for comfortable retirements.

UNDATED: four-speed automatics. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Body and drive combinations are numerous: There are regular and
extended-cab models in short- and long-bed versions, both with the
standard bed and the step-side bed _ and in two- or four-wheel
drive. They also come with varying suspensions, from a smooth
on-road configuration to a tough off-road one.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevy trucks come in three trim levels: base, midlevel LS
and uplevel LT. Leather seats are available in Chevy and GMC
models, as are front bucket seats.
</P>
<P>
   I've driven most of the new trucks, in both the GMC and Chevy
versions, including the four-wheel-drive models with the sporty
Z-71 off-road package. I put one of those to the test on a rugged
dirt road from Oracle, Ariz., to the top of Mount Lemmon, near
Tucson, and found the optional AutoTrac automatic four-wheel-drive
system to be convenient for on- and off-road use. The system
engages the front axle whenever the rear wheels begin to spin,
automatically transferring power up front.
</P>
<P>
   These trucks also can be easily equipped for serious
trailer-towing. The Silverado's Z82 trailering package makes it the
most trailer-ready pickup on the market, Chevy says. It includes
plug-ins for trailer lights and electric brakes. And a tow/haul
mode in the automatic transmission changes the vehicle's shift
patterns to improve performance while towing. There's a button at
the end of the gearshift lever to switch the transmission into
towing mode.
</P>
<P>
   The cabs are comfortable, and there's room for six adults with
three abreast in front and rear. Road and wind noise are
surprisingly light for a truck.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't find anything bad to say about these trucks, except
that there is no four-door extended-cab model planned. That could
drive some sales to the Dodge Ram Quad-Cab. Overall performance,
however, outshines that of the Ford and the Dodge, and only the
Ram's V-10 engine has more power than the best of the Gms.
</P>
<P>
   Those of you concerned about the environment might like to know
that all of these trucks' plastic parts are recyclable. There are
44 pounds less scrap metal produced in the manufacture of each
truck that in the current model.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   1999 Chevrolet Silverado pickup
</P>
<P>
   The Package: Full-size, two- or three-door,
two-to-six-passenger, V-6 or V-8 powered, rear- or four-wheel-drive

</P>
<P>
   Highlights: Stronger, bigger, more powerful and more high-tech
than before; significant but not outrageous restyling; built well;
most powerful V-8 engines in the class; roomier than the
competition; lots of standard safety features, including four-wheel
antilock brakes as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Negatives: No fourth door available in extended-cab models.
</P>
<P>
   Major competitors: Ford F-series, Dodge Ram.

MIDWEST BUSINESSES CAN CAPITALIZE ON SALES TO ASIA, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN ROSENBERG  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Even small companies in Hays, Kan., are
learning that Southeast Asia can be a treasure pot.
</P>
<P>
   That's the message Waffle-Crete International Inc. delivered
Thursday at a Southeast Asia trade forum in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Waffle-Crete started looking for sales in Southeast Asia early
in the decade, and now the region accounts for two-thirds of its
sales. The Hays company, which employs about 35 persons, makes
concrete forms used in construction.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Peteete, the company's sales director for Asia and Africa,
said, ``Asia is going through difficult times, but it will
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of U.S. ambassadors stationed in Southeast Asia
addressed the daylong conference at the Kansas City Marriott
Downtown hotel, describing the problems facing the countries in
which they are posted.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 businesspeople attended the U.S. Ambassadors Tour,
sponsored by the US-ASEAN Business Council and other organizations.
The tour is stopping in just four other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, represents
a part of the world that has experienced torrid economic growth in
recent years. But currency problems and bad bank debt lately have
hurt the region. In some nations, such as Indonesia, social and
political unrest have followed.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan, in a luncheon speech, said he had taken a
delegation of businesspeople to Asia and planned to tour other
parts of the world because the global economy is increasingly
important to Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Five percent of Missouri workers, or 140,000, owe their
livelihood to foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is crucial for states like Missouri to establish
their own identity in foreign markets,'' Carnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Jensen, a U.S. senior commercial officer based in Jakarta,
said Indonesia would rebound in two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't write it off because of problems that are somewhat
temporary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, turmoil from a recent change of government leadership can
make it difficult to do business in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows who the influence-peddlers are today who can get
you your business deal,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Hubbard, ambassador to the Philippines, said that a
decade ago the country experienced internal troubles similar to
those in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines' economy will grow by 2 percent to 3 percent
this year and 4 percent to 5 percent next year, he said. Exports
are soaring, particularly of Japanese and U.S. goods manufactured
in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And growth in the Philippines will take off once the country
recovers from the currency and stock market collapses it recently
sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bright spots in the Philippines once this crisis is
over,'' Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam has consolidated the number of government-owned
enterprises from 12,000 to 6,000 in recent years, according to
Dennis Harter, deputy chief of the U.S. mission in Hanoi. Communist
leaders still have not embraced capitalist market economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to help Vietnam transform its economic
system as well as its political realities,'' Harter said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring Laos, however, already is becoming more
market-oriented. Ninety percent of 600 state-owned enterprises
recently were privatized, or opened to investors, said Wendy
Chamberlin, ambassador to Laos.
</P>
<P>
   The country is on the road to rapid development. For instance,
30 hydroelectric power projects are being considered, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand, banks are saddled with bad debts of $25 billion,
about 20 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, according
to William Itoh, U.S. ambassador to the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great deal of pain lies ahead...,'' he said. This year,
economic output will decline by up to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate restructuring has yet to begin in earnest,'' Itoh
said. Yet, U.S. companies should not hesitate to start implementing
strategies for the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic downturns often provide opportunities to those with
the foresight to invest,'' Itoh said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Green, U.S. ambassador to Singapore, said the Chinese word
for ``crisis'' is composed of the words for ``danger'' and
``opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, the other half of crisis is opportunity,'' Green
said.

   WESTWOOD, Kan. _ Long-distance rates continue to drop.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sprint Corp. said rates for daytime long-distance
calls were dropping to 10 cents a minute for residential customers.
Previously, the dime rate was available only at night and on
weekends, and daytime customers were charged 25 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch to the new plan, called Sprint Sense
AnyTime.
</P>
<P>
   The dime rate will be available free only to customers who rack
up long-distance bills of $30 a month or more. Otherwise, customers
will be charged a fee of $4.95 a month to qualify for the dime
rate.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Sprint Sense AnyTime plan, the company is
offering a rate of 25 cents a minute for calls billed to a calling
card and new rates for collect calls. A new dime-a-minute
collect-calling plan offers consumers the dime rate 24 hours a day
with a $1.95 surcharge per call. The plan is called 1-800-one-dime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give customers the freedom to call anytime they
want...and have the peace of mind they're getting a low
dime-a-minute rate around the clock,'' said Tom Kessler, assistant
vice president in Sprint's consumer services group.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said the new rate was being offered because more people
are home during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more consumers take advantage of flexible work
schedules, they need the simplicity of a calling plan that offers
them a great rate when they call,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   The Westwood-based Sprint will continue to offer its Sprint
Sense plan, with a dime-a-minute rate at nights and on weekends and
a rate of 25 cents a minute during the day, with no fees or minimum
charges.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. also offers a rate of 10 cents a minute, but only to
customers who sign up for the company's One Rate Plus plan, which
carries a fee of $4.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Communications Corp., the second-largest long-distance
company, has a plan that offers low rates during the evening and on
weekends but higher rates during the day. The MCI One plan offers
consumers long-distance for 10 cents a minute at night and on
Saturday, 5 cents a minute on Sundays and 25 cents a minute during
the day during the week.
</P>
<P>
   The best long-distance plan offered by any of the top five
long-distance companies comes from Qwest, which offers 10 cents a
minute with no fees. Excel, the No. 5 carrier, offers 10 cents a
minute with a fee of $1 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies, which purchase time on the networks of larger
companies, sometimes offer the lowest rates.
</P>
<P>
   CGI Long Distance Services, based in Mission, offers a rate of
10 cents a minute. Customers can keep their existing long-distance
service and get the CGI service by dialing a seven-digit access
code.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami company, One Flat Rate.Com, advertises on the Internet
that it offers a flat rate of 8.9 cents a minute with no fees.

PRAYER AMENDMENT GETS MAJORITY OF VOTES, IS DEFEATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1997 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House toils beneath the inscription ``In God We
Trust,'' yet the debate Thursday over the school prayer amendment
revealed just how divisive the issue of praying to the deity can
be.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment _ which for the first time in a generation would
have permitted school-sponsored organized prayer and religious
displays on public property _ received a majority with 224 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it fell short of the two-thirds necessary for a
constitutional change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant that a majority of the House agreed that the
Supreme Court has gone too far in distorting the First Amendment
and religious freedom rights,'' Rep. Ernest Istook Jr., an Oklahoma
Republican and sponsor of the amendment, said afterward, putting a
positive spin on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   His leading opponent, Rep. Chet Edwards, a Texas Democrat, said,
``We won a tough vote against sound bite politics and for the Bill
of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the amendment passed, it would have required a similar
majority in the Senate and then ratification by three-fourths of
the state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure was a victory in any case for religious
conservatives and their supporters in Congress, who had made it a
legislative priority. It was the first time in 27 years that
Congress recorded a vote on a school prayer amendment and
Thursday's vote will become a political marker for the fall
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The more than six-hour debate turned on politics, on individual
interpretations of the 1963 Supreme Court decision that outlawed
school prayer, on what the founding fathers intended, and on the
meaning of the word ``God.''
</P>
<P>
   An effort to remove the word from the measure was defeated, as
was an attempt to send the entire amendment back to committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to the level of debate occurring already,'' said Rep.
Louise Slaughter, a New York Democrat and an opponent. She then
quoted Rep. Jack Kingston, a Georgia Republican and supporter, as
saying recently of the amendment's opponents:
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that there is a special place in
hell for a number of federal court judges, as I am sure there will
be for members of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate also produced some sharp exchanges across the
philosophical divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have religious convictions and have the right to
express them,'' said Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of
California. ``There's nothing wrong with shouting out for the glory
of God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they have that right,'' replied Rep. Gene Green, a Texas
opponent. ``But that's not the right to stand up in algebra class
and say it.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the issue was certain to evoke strong passions, the
debate took on an even greater urgency among supporters. Against a
backdrop of recent killings in several of the nation's schools,
many speakers equated the attacks with the absence of a religious
presence in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine,'' said Istook, ``that in an era when drugs, guns and
knives are common in public schools, we are told the Ten
Commandments is not welcome, not permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Edwards said of the Religious Freedom Amendment: ``Anyone
can pray in school and no one, not Ernest Istook, not the Supreme
Court, is going to stop me and my child from praying in school.
What is prohibited is allowing government organized prayer. Parents
do not send their children to school to be proselytized by
religious groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters argued that children ought to be able to initiate
voluntary prayers in classrooms, at graduations, at sporting events
and other school activities. The amendment, they said, does not
require that everyone must join in, nor does it prescribe what
prayer should be said, nor establish an official religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all there is to it,'' said Rep. Sue Myrick, a North
Carolina Republican and supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents countered that laws already allow students to pray:
before class, during lunch, after school and during moments of
silence. They can also form religious clubs. Opponents worried
about the ``perilous path'' the amendment opened by tampering with
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But since the last vote on school prayer in 1971 _ when the
supporters actually gained more votes with 240 in favor and 163
against but still failed to reach a two-thirds majority _ faith and
family issues have moved center stage, especially in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month ago, Republican congressional leaders, faced
with angry Christian activists, assured them that religious issues
would become legislative priorities.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a full-court press for school prayer by religious
conservatives. The Christian Coalition financed a $500,000 radio
advertising campaign in support of the amendment that aired in many
swing congressional districts. The coalition also sent letters to
voters in Edwards' Texas district that accused him of ``bigotry
directed at Christians,'' and stated: ``His attitudes have no place
in Texas or anywhere in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition leaders have said they intend to send out 45
million voter guides next fall and the school prayer vote is likely
to be one of its leading political indicators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put all the king's men and all the king's horses on this,''
said the Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Traditional Values
Coalition. ``This is a defining moment for many congressmen and
elected officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents saw it that way, too. But for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Several complained that the rules governing the debate of the
amendment were patched together at the last minute and didn't
reflect the importance of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night we were still slapping this together,'' said Rep.
Robert Scott, a Virginia Democrat and leading opponent. ``This will
be the first amendment to the Bill of Rights. Every word is
important. We need to know exactly what the amendment will do.''
MORE
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ amendment will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas agreed, noting that
James Madison and Thomas Jefferson debated the issue of religious
freedom in the Virginia legislature over a period of 10 years. ``We
want to change this in two-three hours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. James Traficant Jr. of Ohio replied, ``I submit
the founding fathers are rolling over in their graves. They never
intended to separate God and the American people and this legal
mumbo jumbo is absolutely ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Each side boasted its own lists of interdenominational backing.
But as symbolic as the debate promised to be, it was largely made
in a near-empty chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries were half-full with tourists, scout groups and
others, while below, on the blue, red and gold carpeted floor, only
a few members were present at any one time, except during a vote,
when the hall was full.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was almost strictly on party lines. One who did break
ranks, Rep. Amo Houghton Jr., a New York Republican, captured the
flavor of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to sort out the issue,'' Houghton said, ``because
both sides claim they're on the side of the righteous.''

APPEALS COURT TO HEAR SECRET SERVICE, LINDSEY ARGUMENTS IN LATE
JUNE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prodded by the Supreme Court, a three-judge appeals
court panel agreed Friday to consider whether President Clinton's
closest confidant and three Secret Service employees must testify
before a federal grand jury investigating an alleged presidential
affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The judges _ two of them appointed by Clinton _ announced that
arguments would be heard in the final week of June.
</P>
<P>
   The order by the U.S. Court of Appeals was issued a day after
the Supreme Court denied a request by independent counsel Kenneth
Starr to intervene and quickly resolve his disputes with the
Clinton administration over attorney-client privilege and a
so-called ``protective function privilege'' for the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to shortcut the normal appeals route, the Supreme
Court handed Starr his first court setback since he began
investigating the president's relationship with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's second loss came Friday when Chief U.S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson released a May 22 order refusing the
prosecutor's request for access to records of a Barnes &AMP; Noble
bookstore that might show books purchased by Lewinsky. The judge
ruled that Lewinsky's purchases were irrelevant to Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the probe say the special prosecutor is
trying to determine whether Lewinsky bought ``Vox,'' a Nicholson
Baker novel about phone sex. Starr is still seeking records from
another bookstore, Kramerbooks &AMP; Afterwords, which is fighting his
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   In the Supreme Court ruling Thursday, the justices wrote that
they ``assumed that the Court of Appeals will proceed
expeditiously'' to decide the two privilege appeals by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Once the three-judge panel rules, each decision can be appealed
to the entire 11-member Court of Appeals, which includes seven
Republican appointees. From there, the cases could be appealed to
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has argued that Bruce Lindsey, a longtime friend
of President Clinton who serves as deputy White House counsel,
should not have to tell Starr's grand jury about his conversations
with the president about the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers say Lindsey's conversations are protected by
the attorney-client privilege, which shields most communication
between a client and lawyer. Starr argues that the privilege does
not apply to government lawyers, like Lindsey, who have information
about criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the Treasury Department, which
oversees the Secret Service, have asserted that the president's
security detail should not be forced to cooperate with Starr's
inquiry because doing do would undermine the essential trust chief
executives must have in those who protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson last month sided with Starr and ruled against the
Clinton administration on both the privilege claims, which prompted
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents filed in the past week, Starr and his team of
prosecutors argue that Lindsey and the Secret Service have
information vital to determining whether Clinton or others
obstructed justice by trying to cover up his alleged sexual
misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   In its order expediting consideration of the Clinton
administration appeals of Johnson's orders, the three-judge panel
set arguments for June 26 in the Secret Service case and the week
of June 29 on the Lindsey matter.
</P>
<P>
   The judges hearing the case are:
</P>
<P>
   _ A. Raymond Randolph, 54, who was deputy solicitor general
under Robert Bork. Named by President Bush to the Washington-based
Court of Appeals in 1990, Randolph has a reputation as an
intellectual and a tough questioner during oral arguments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Judith W. Rogers, 58, a Harvard-educated former assistant
attorney general who served as chief federal judge of the
Washington district before Clinton elevated her to the appeals
court. Prior to her appointment to the federal bench by President
Reagan, Rogers served as a corporation counsel for the District of
Columbia government.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Tatel, 56, a liberal who served in the Carter
administration as director of the Office of Civil Rights at the
Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Appointed to the
appeals court by Clinton in 1994, Tatel is admired by liberals and
conservatives for his fairness and thorough questioning during oral
arguments.

HOUSE BACKS PLAN FOR DEEPER TAX AND SPENDING CUTS 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House narrowly approved a plan Friday to cut
taxes and spending far more deeply than last year's bipartisan
balanced budget deal. The move puts Republicans on another
ideological collision course with the White House over the size and
role of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defection of nine moderates in the party unwilling
to support spending reductions of the magnitude called for in the
budget outline, the Republican leadership rammed the measure
through by a 216-204 vote after a contentious debate and some
intense arm-twisting.
</P>
<P>
   The House plan calls for about $100 billion in tax cuts over the
next five years, offset by spending cuts of the same amount. The
primary tax cut would be a reduction in the so-called marriage
penalty, the provision in the tax code that forces many two-income
couples to pay more than they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   It must be reconciled with a version passed by the Senate that
calls for $30 billion in tax cuts and keeps spending largely on the
path agreed to by Congress and President Clinton in last year's
balanced budget deal. And even after the House and Senate resolve
their differences, the resulting budget plan does not become law
but rather serves as a general blueprint for drafting spending and
tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   The House decided Friday to increase military spending slightly
before accounting for the effects of inflation, but to reduce
domestic spending substantially. The plan did not specify what
programs would be cut from the budget, which next year will total
about $1.7 trillion, and postponed most of the reductions until
later years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who worked the House floor until
the final moments to insure that wavering moderates voted yes, said
it was clear that the House would have to move in the Senate's
direction, somewhat diluting the party's ideological message. House
members are also under pressure from many governors to soften
provisions that would cut promised welfare block grants to the
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be maybe slightly less conservative by the time we're
done with the Senate,'' Gingrich said after the vote. ``The Senate
will be a good bit more conservative by the time they're done with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But a split-the-difference compromise with the Senate, yielding
tax and spending cuts of $60 billion or so over the next five
years, would put the Republicans into a potentially bruising fight
with the White House and congressional Democrats heading into the
fall election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the prospect of huge budget surpluses for years
to come, the two parties are having much the same argument they
were having two years ago when they both anticipated deficits well
into the future.
</P>
<P>
   In his budget proposal early this year, Clinton called for more
than $100 billion of new spending programs in education, child care
and health care, paid for in part by revenues the White House hopes
will be generated by anti-smoking legislation that may or may not
pass Congress. Clinton's budget called for $20 billion of narrowly
targeted tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a tough, tight and successful balanced budget plan that
is clearly working, this plan reflects an arbitrary desire to cut
key areas like education, health care and the environment with
little of any analysis of what could really be negative impacts on
key priorities,'' White House economic policy adviser Gene Sperling
said of the House proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Democratic strategists said, Friday's vote could give
Democrats potent ammunition in their effort to win back control of
the House by putting some moderate Republicans in key districts on
record as favoring what their Democratic opponents in the fall will
portray as extreme cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, conservative Republicans seemed to be spoiling for
another ideological fight. After having seen their fervor for
smaller government dissipate last year under pressure to reach a
pragmatic budget-balancing compromise with Clinton, Gingrich and
his lieutenants were clearly eager to reassert their conservative
credentials in advance of this year's mid-term Congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to forget the reason people sent us here,'' said
Rep. John Kasich, the chairman of the Budget Committee and the main
author of the Republican plan. ``We came to make the government
budget smaller and the family budget bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich said the spending cuts in his plan amounted to ``a penny
on the dollar'' and were essential in breaking Washington's
tax-and-spend culture.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat
on the Budget Committee, said the proposed cuts would fall almost
entirely on social programs. And House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt said the Republican budget was a replay of the 1995 plan
that led to a showdown with President Clinton and a shutdown of the
federal government. The Republican proposals, Gephardt said, were
``expired milk poured into new cartons.''
</P>
<P>
   The most conservative Republicans had been pressing for $150
billion in tax and spending cuts, but gave way when it became
apparent that such big cuts would make it impossible to pass the
plan in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Although the party's leadership came up with the needed votes,
some moderates said they were voting for the plan only reluctantly,
fearing that the combination of big tax cuts and unspecified future
spending reductions imposed too much of a strain on legitimate
government programs and risked the nation's newfound fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like taking out a 30-day note to pay for your dream house
that you want to live in for the rest of your life,'' said Rep. Amo
Houghton of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But during the floor debate, Gingrich appealed to party loyalty
and warned potential dissidents not to distance themselves from the
party's accomplishments of the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you vote against the Kasich budget, you're voting against
the team that reformed welfare, the team that cut taxes, the team
that balanced the budget, the team that brought discretionary
spending under control,'' Gingrich said. ``And I think that's
wrong.''

RAINY SEASON'S FIRST SHOWERS FAIL TO QUENCH MEXICO WILDFIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The first showers of the rainy season have fallen
across parts of Mexico and Central America but have failed to
quench many wildfires that are destroying virgin forests and
feeding a smoke cloud that is drifting across the southern United
States, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and American officials predicted that some fires, which
have consumed millions of acres of forest and grassland across the
region, may continue to rage for several weeks. About 150 fires, 23
of them large, very destructive blazes, were burning this week.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural Secretary Dan Glickman, who led an American
delegation that flew over vast blazes roaring through one cloud
forest in southern Mexico on Thursday, described them Friday as ``a
catastrophe.'' Another senior American official said they were the
worst he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disaster in Mexico has to be the most serious of its kind
in the world, including Indonesia,'' said Brian Atwood, director of
the Agency for International Development. ``The duration of these
fires, the complexity of fighting them and the danger to the
firefighters, it's the most serious that we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation visited Mexico to coordinate a $5 million
assistance program, which includes a heavy-lift helicopter and
radios, as well as boots and other safety equipment for 3,000
Mexican forest rangers. Many Mexican firefighters have been wearing
straw hats and sandals while battling flames with buckets of water.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new equipment, Glickman said that because many fires
were raging across virtually impenetrable mountain ravines and
ridges, ``rainfall will have as much to do with extinguishing the
fires as anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, seasonal rains that began this week have not been heavy
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Light rains have begun in some areas but they're not
sufficient to extinguish these fires,'' Atwood said. A spokesman
for Mexico's Environment Ministry agreed Friday with that
assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The American officials praised Mexico's battle to control the
fires, in which more than 60 firefighters have died this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing an outstanding job fighting this thing,''
Glickman said. Those comments and praise by other American
officials contrasted with statements by Mexican conservationists,
who have argued that the Mexican and American governments have been
slow to react.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, for instance, Homero Aridjis, a
prominent Mexican environmentalist, called the Mexican government's
response to the wildfires ``really exasperating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first the policy was to minimize the fires,'' Aridjis said.
``And now that much of our ecological patrimony has been destroyed,
the government is still waiting for rains to put them out. This is
like waiting for Godot.''
</P>
<P>
   Environment Secretary Julia Carabias defended herself and other
officials Friday against a barrage of similar recent criticisms,
saying her government ``took precautions, sounded the alert, acted
vigorously and continues to act.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, standing at Ms. Carabias' side on a
visit to a mountain park burned by recent wildfires that roared
through a Mexico City suburb, said, ``Our country has suffered what
I would characterize as a true ecological tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many, perhaps most, of the blazes have started as
out-of-control agricultural fires, set by peasant farmers who
prepare their fields for planting by burning the previous year's
stubble. In other cases, forests have been set afire to clear plots
for growing marijuana or opium, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been fires caused by narcotics traffickers,''
Zedillo said. &QL;

GOP LEADERS NUDGE HOUSE INTO PASSING $101 BILLION TAX CUT PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders mustered enough support Friday
to pass a five-year $101 billion tax cut plan, but it was hardly a
victory for some GOP moderates concerned that making deeper
reductions in social programs to pay for it could hurt them in an
election year.
</P>
<P>
   The non-binding budget resolution was approved by a narrow
margin of 216-204. It lays out an ambitious plan to cut taxes by an
additional $101 billion over the next five years and to pay for it
by making the same amount of cuts in various entitlement programs.
But it fails to specify how much would be trimmed from areas such
as welfare, education and Medicaid, and it includes no
recommendations on how to pay for $25 billion in extra spending
included in the recently approved highway and agriculture bills.
</P>
<P>
   Several moderate Republican who voted against the resolution
said they were concerned about the lack of specifics in the measure
and warned that the tax cuts might be too much at a time when the
country is still saddled with an estimated $6 trillion debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of the American people want us to pay down
the $6 trillion national debt we have before we have more tax
cuts,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., one of nine Republicans who
voted against the resolution out of concern that it could result in
more cuts in welfare, veteran and federal employee benefit
programs.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, traveling in Lincoln, Mass., also expressed
concern about the cuts, calling the budget plan ``an unfortunate
step backwards.'' He said it would lead to severe cuts in health
care, education and environmental programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when Washington is seeing its first surplus in
almost 30 years ... this budget is not the right approach,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to head off an embarrassing defeat of the
resolution, Republican leaders twisted arms right up until the last
minute in hopes of keeping together enough of their GOP colleagues
to pass it. They were aided in their efforts by the defection of a
handful of conservative Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the outcome in favor of more tax cuts, the House GOP
plan has almost no chance of standing up in conference with the
Senate, which has approved a more modest five-year budget blueprint
calling for $30 billion in tax cuts and few spending reductions
beyond those outlined in last year's balanced budget agreement with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Republicans who were reluctant to support the measure
to begin with were told by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and
other leaders that it would be ``fixed,'' as one GOP member put it,
in conference with the Senate. One Republican aide said his boss
was told that the vote for the measure would be ``more symbolic
than anything because the tax cut and spending goals would never be
accepted by the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
has criticized the House resolution for not identifying where
spending reductions would be made to pay for the tax cuts, which
would come largely from the elimination of the so-called marriage
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the marriage penalty, or the extra tax that an estimated
21 million couples would not have to pay if they were still filing
as singles, would benefit mostly upper, two-income families. That's
why some Republican moderates are worried that cuts in social
programs that affect the poor and retired could backfire on them in
an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Elimination of the marriage penalty has long been a goal of
pro-family conservatives, and Gingrich promised in a meeting
several weeks ago with social and religious conservative leaders
that it would be included in the GOP budget plan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the budget resolution is non-binding, it is used to set
the broad goals for spending and revenues as Congress goes about
its annual ritual of authorizing and appropriating funds for
government departments and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the GOP House blueprint, authored by Budget
Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, calls for spending $1.73
trillion on federal programs in 1999. It envisions a budget surplus
of $34 billion next year and $223 billion by 2004. Kasich's plan
also delays most of its tax and spending cuts until 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing for support, Kasich said his resolution would save
``one penny out of every dollar'' the government spends over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cannot save one penny on every dollar, then we're
telling the American family that the government is more important
than they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In their effort to defeat the measure, Democratic opponents drew
attention to the differences between the Kasich plan and the budget
resolution recently passed by the Senate. Differences over the two
measures, they warned, could lead to another government shutdown
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the path we were on in 1995 that led to two
government shutdowns,'' said Rep. James Moran, D-Va.
</P>
<P>
   In rallying to pass the Kasich plan, the Republicans rejected a
budget proposal sponsored by Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., that was
similar in many ways to the plan passed by the Senate. It also
contained $30 billion in tax cuts over five years with few spending
reductions. But it would have increased spending on education,
welfare, Medicaid and other programs by $10 billion. The increases
in those areas, however, would have been paid for by the same
amount of cuts in other entitlement programs. &QL;

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 7, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RICH-POLITICIANS-REVIEW _ The resounding defeat of Al Checchi, a
half-billionaire businessman who spent $40 million of his own money
in the race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, prompted a
certain populist euphoria _ a new conventional wisdom across the
land that even in flashy California, money can't buy you voters'
love. By Todd S. Purdum. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ISLAM-BOMB-REVIEW _ There is, today at least, no special reason
to believe that Pakistan's newly declared ability to build a
nuclear arsenal will provide a nuclear umbrella for other Islamic
societies, or that those other countries will find it easier to go
nuclear themselves. By Elaine Sciolino. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION-REVIEW _ A statistical look around the world on
abortion shows a complex picture. Assuming that cultural
sensitivities are reflected in laws about abortion, there is a
remarkable divide between richer countries and poorer ones where
abortion and its effects are concerned. By Barbara Crosette. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEDAL-HONOR-REVIEW _ Why they don't give medals of honor
anymore. By Eric Schmitt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-TAX-REVIEW _ Congress is well on its way towards
overhauling the tax-law provisions that push many married couples
into a higher tax bracket than they would be in if they were
single. By Richard W. Stevenson. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY-REVIEW _ Monica Lewinsky has her new legal dream team.
She will also surely have bigger bills to go along with the bigger
names now defending her. By Jill Abramson. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASHFLOW-REVIEW _ Entertainers are the least of it. Wall Street
is securitizing virtually everything that produces a predictable
stream of cash. Typhoon insurance. Tax liens. Loans for used cars
and fraternity houses. Fax machine leases. Mutual-fund fees. Unused
airline tickets. Movies yet to be made. Even defunct power plants.
By Leslie Eaton. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GINGRICH-REVIEW _ Newt Gingrich's brand of eclectic, activist
conservatism fits no distinct Republican mold. Moderates shy from
his confrontational tactics, while House conservatives tried to
oust him last year as too accommodationist. Party pragmatists
consider him too unpredictable and undisciplined. By Alison
Mitchell. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-STRIKES-REVIEW _ Transportation strikes are an annoying
fact of life in France, yet most people sympathize with the
strikers when the subways shut down or truckers block the highways.
By Craig R. Whitney. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CIA-NUCLEAR-REVIEW _ The world might be less dangerous than it
is today had the CIA and its sister intelligence services foreseen
India's nuclear tests last month. Armed with that foresight, the
United States might have been able to forestall a test, as it did
back in 1995, and thus prevent an arms race in one of the planet's
least pacific places. By Tim Weiner. &QL;

MARKET SOARS ON NEWS OF ROBUST ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market roared back to life Friday after the
government said that economic growth remains robust.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, after weeks of sluggish
trading, rose 167.15 points, or 1.88 percent, to close at 9,037.71,
its biggest surge in four months.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in blue-chip issues created a broad two-day rally in
equity prices, and even lifted bond prices, after two days of
government reports portrayed an economy that was revving on all
cylinders.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, one on Thursday which said that factory orders,
productivity and retail sales were rising, and another Friday that
showed strong job growth with little inflationary pressure, set off
a buying spree on Wall Street, particularly in blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index soared 19.03 points, or
1.74 percent, to close at 1,113.86 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite gained 12.97 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, to
1,782.92.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said the reports suggested that the
domestic economy may be resilient enough to withstand the festering
economic crisis in Asia, which dented investor sentiment last
October, and that a slowdown in corporate profit growth at home may
soon reverse course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors believe we have a good strong economy, no inflation
and that profits can go up,'' said Alfred Goldman, a strategist
with A.G. Edwards Inc. ``When you're in a bull market, it's a glass
is half-full attitude, and that means people are positive.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, though, weakening profit growth and high
valuations had largely sapped enthusiasm for stocks, punishing
scores of technology shares, and knocking 4.4 percent off the Dow's
all-time high of 9,211.84, set in May.
</P>
<P>
   But again and again in this bull market, investors have been
warmed by a steady stream of government reports about an economy
that has managed to steer a deft middle ground between economic
might and slackening growth.
</P>
<P>
   That outlook _ which many skeptics have long cast doubt on _
seemed to be hinted at in Friday's government report, which managed
to cheer both stock and bond investors. Stock investors because it
seemed to portend solid profits; bond investors because they did
not see inflation accelerating in the jobs data.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, while the Dow soared in early trading, bond prices
also rose. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond climbed half a
point, pushing down its benchmark yield to 5.78 percent from 5.82 a
day earlier, the lowest close since early January, meaning that
long-term interest rates are once again near a 25-year low. (Bond
prices and their yields move in opposite directions.)
</P>
<P>
   That enthusiastic combination fed on itself throughout the day.
Investors, tentative since early April, went back to their favorite
big, blue-chip issues, such as Walt Disney, Merck and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd doesn't want to leave the scene,'' said Larry
Wachtel, a market strategist with Prudential Securities. ``They
just don't want to be as aggressive in buying as they used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the profit picture clears up _ and many Wall Street
analysts are optimistic that profit growth will resume in the
latter part of the year _ share prices may see-saw, Wachtel says.
But the week ended with a burst of enthusiasm as the Dow gained
233.91 points, or 2.6 percent, in the last two sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of retail stocks have been particularly strong. The S&AMP;P
retail index, for instance, is up 32 percent this year, led by
Wal-Mart, the Gap, Kmart and Sears, all of which are enjoying
robust profits.
</P>
<P>
   The market is also being driven by a wave of merger activity
that has heartened more than a few speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, warned that investors should not make
too much of Friday's rally, which came after a two-month long slump
that saw about 76 percent of all Big Board stocks fell 10 percent
or more from their April highs.

DOUBLY GRATEFUL: OTHER ONES MAKE PROMISING DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometimes tough decisions call for waffling.
</P>
<P>
   In the Grateful Dead camp, there's been plenty of agonizing
lately about naming a guitarist for the new, post-Jerry Garcia
group the Other Ones. For Thursday night's debut at the Warfield,
the indecisive band invited not one but two replacements for the
irreplaceable Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the set _ three hours' worth of signature songs that
at times reached giddy peaks _ the core band members may be obliged
to keep both.
</P>
<P>
   It was no secret that the specter of the late Garcia would loom
large over the Other Ones' unveiling, a pricey benefit for the
Rainforest Action Network that served as a public warm-up for a
monthlong summer tour with the Furthur Festival. Until recently,
Dead mainstays Bob Weir, Phil Lesh and Mickey Hart were considering
guitarist Stan Franks, whose jazz background was expected to
discourage the inevitable Garcia comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   But Franks' tentative approach during a few side-project trials
led to an uproar among the Dead cognoscenti. Many clamored for
Steve Kimock of the Bay Area jam band Zero; word has it his
Garcia-like inclinations ran counter to some members' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the blue comes Mark Karan, a burly local native with a
curiously un-Deadlike resume that includes stints with Dave Mason,
Huey Lewis and the Rembrandts. At the Warfield, Karan and Kimock
shared stage left, deftly clearing room for each other and
creating, with Weir, an exhilarating web of guitar tones.
</P>
<P>
   Opening with ``Jack Straw,'' the band took a few minutes to find
its footing, but after Karan took an effective, economical lead on
his Gibson Les Paul, Hart and second drummer John Molo began
pounding. As the song fell together, the expectant crowd burst into
enthusiastic hooting.
</P>
<P>
   Returning from last summer's Furthur Festival was Berkeley
saxophonist Dave Ellis, whose presence _ despite early technical
troubles _ went a long way toward distinguishing the Other Ones'
sound from that of the Dead. Longtime associate Bruce Hornsby added
his trademark feathery, upper-register runs on grand piano, sharing
most of the vocal duties with Weir.
</P>
<P>
   On the second song, ``Sugaree,'' Hornsby sang Garcia's lead
while Kimock, perched on a stool and wearing headphones, took his
own first lead on a huge hollow-body guitar. The song's easy gait
left lots of room for surges of ensemble interplay; by its finish,
there were plenty of relieved grins onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Weir flexed a little musical muscle with ``New Minglewood
Blues'' and ``Goin' Down the Road Feeling Bad.'' Playing six-string
bass, Lesh took a vocal turn on the latter song and then made way
for a canny Bakersfield guitar lead by Karan.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything worked perfectly. Hornsby's vocal on ``Scarlet
Begonias,'' for instance, was characteristically wan, and Lesh
sounded a little like Grandpa Simpson on ``Box of Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   During the second set of the three-hour show, the band played a
half-hour-plus medley that included ``Playing in the Band'' and the
free-form ``Space.'' Stepping to the sidelines as the two
percussionists cranked up the drum-battle portion of ``Space,''
Weir made a comic gesture befitting the night's heady atmosphere,
circling his ears with his fists like bike pedals.
</P>
<P>
   As the lengthy medley pieced itself back together from
purposeful deconstruction _ with Hornsby alluding to Miles Davis'
``So What'' on piano, Ellis switching between baritone and soprano
sax, and Hart coaxing skeleton music from a xylophone _ the show
rose to a zenith it would maintain till closing time.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the group found its way back to ``Playing in the Band,''
setting off a delirious finale that included ``St. Stephen,'' ``The
Eleven'' _ out of the repertoire since 1970 _ and the Dead version
of Bobby ``Blue'' Bland's ``Turn On Your Love Light.'' The latter,
the night's last song, was perfectly chosen, featuring
around-the-horn showcases for each musician and the effervescence
of a Holy Rollers congregation.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many, this show bode well for life after
Jerry.

M BASE: COLD AND DEFINITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the M Base movement in jazz came into being in
the mid-1980s, it organized several strains of jazz rhetoric into a
point of view that wasn't always backed up musically. But the early
members _ saxophonists Steve Coleman and Greg Osby, pianist Geri
Allen, trombonist Robin Eubanks, cornetist Graham Haynes and singer
Cassandra Wilson _ worked on a communal sound that was easily
identifiable, mixing textures and jazz improvisation. And often
idiosyncratic improvisation: Coleman and Osby came up with a
distinct school of soloing, jagged and abstract and virtuosic, that
hadn't been heard before.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade some members have fallen away, others have
become stars, and Coleman and Osby have slipped into a bit of
popular neglect. But recently they have been recording powerful
albums and working on the conception, and at the Knitting Factory
on Thursday night, as part of the Texaco New York Jazz Festival,
they and Haynes put on mature shows that filled the Main Space with
enthusiastic fans.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman started the show with his trumpeter, Ralph Alessi,
playing against the bass of Anthony Tidd. The rest of the group,
with Jason Moran on piano and Sean Rickman on drums, joined in, and
for much of the set the music maintained a motoric, repeating
velocity that was harmonically vague. One can deal with the music's
coldness, its sameness, its emphasis on a textural hardness that
sometimes seems like a retreat from emotionalism, or one can't; it
still sounds like nothing else in music.
</P>
<P>
   And that coldness and lack of variety is its attraction:
Coleman's lines, with their lack of dynamic change, force a
listener to follow the music's contours, and by the end of the show
he had presented his case for a music of real complexity and
imagination. Osby, who followed, uses all sorts of groups and with
this one he backed himself with an acoustic trio.
</P>
<P>
   Osby's abilities are still surging forward, and he dipped
immediately into a stunning jazz seriousness with a set of tunes
that had his saxophone, liquid and sleek, making even the most
intricate lines swing. Where Coleman's music was rigid in its
industrial order, Osby's band made its material flexible, with
drummer Rodney Green changing volume and attack. Moran, a young,
promising pianist, improvised solos brimming with acidic ideas that
the group followed.
</P>
<P>
   The next set, by Graham Haynes, brought together DJs, videos and
Haynes' electronically reworked cornet. It ventured into the
freneticism of drum and bass, then went into funk and ambient dance
music, with ominous bass lines overlaid with noise and sound.
Haynes' cornet slit holes in the music, and with waves of echoing
sound he appeared in the foreground.
</P>
<P>
   The night ended in the main space with an all-star group of M
Base musicians, including Coleman and Osby on saxophones, Haynes on
cornet and a rhythm section that included Moran, David Gilmore on
guitar, Tidd on bass and Rickman on drums. It was hard music,
positioned somewhere between pop and jazz, and its accommodations
sounded just fine, as if the movement no longer had to worry about
whether it had arrived. It was complete.

HATS ADD PERSONALITY TO SUMMER CASUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: New top with Bob Denver angle; also deleting byline ) 
 (JT)  
 &HT;     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIVEN all the 20th-century icons who have been resurrected and
paid homage to in the name of fashion, nothing is more curious than
the pedestal erected for that hapless bungler of television fame
Gilligan. Or so it would appear from last summer's vogue for the
fishing hat, which Bob Denver almost never took off his head in the
three years that ``Gilligan's Island'' ruled the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Gilligan is the apotheosis of simple chic compared
with those other castaways _ the movie star, the millionaire and
his wife _ who packed an astounding amount of clothes for a
three-hour tour. And Gilligan had the right idea: in tropical
weather, a hat protects the head and neck from the sun. Moreover,
given the natural impulse to dress down for summer in a lightweight
jacket, polo shirt and khakis, a good hat adds a crucial bit of
personality and polish to an otherwise lackluster outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is no reason the Gilligan hat has to go into
reruns this summer. (Nor is it likely to, now that Denver's image
seems slightly less jaunty following a marijuana arrest last week.)
Even if one does not want to step out in a dandified straw boater,
there are any number of summer hats less dowdy than Gilligan's.
</P>
<P>
   At Barneys New York, a jaunty black straw hat made in England by
Fred Bare, $60, is neat and crisp enough to wear with a suit, yet
equally apropos of a short-sleeve shirt and shorts. A black striped
straw hat by Rod Keenan, $265, also at Barneys, is less versatile
but much more stylish. Made of a finer weave, it is also more
comfortable and durable.
</P>
<P>
   At Agnes B., on Greene Street in SoHo, a narrow-brim hat, $83,
has an old-fashioned shape, but made in black leather, it has a
sharp, rakish cool.
</P>
<P>
   At the venerable milliner Worth &AMP; Worth, on Madison Avenue at
43d Street, summer hat styles range from a simple, smart cotton
driving cap, $30, to a panoply of Panama hats in varying weaves,
styles and prices. A Baku straw snap-brim is $145, while Panama
Montecristi hats can cost up to $1,000, depending on the fineness
of the weave and of the jipijapa, the straw from which Panamas are
made.
</P>
<P>
   At Bergdorf Goodman, the finest Panama hat is $495 and can be
squashed in a suitcase, within reason, and still snap back into
shape. A cowboy-style Panama with a leather hatband is $195 and has
a novel charm.
</P>
<P>
   For those who still cling to the Gilligan ideal but want to
upgrade, Paul Stuart, on Madison Avenue at 45th Street, has a
waterproof fishing hat in a sleek black oiled cotton, $27.50. And
Prada sells a fishing-style hat in black or brown nylon for $214 _
perfect for those who feel marooned without a designer label.

COURT SCHEDULES ARGUMENTS ON PRIVILEGE IN LEWINSKY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following a suggestion from the Supreme Court, a
federal appeals court Friday set a quick schedule to consider the
privileges asserted by the Clinton administration to limit the
testimony of four government employees in the Monica Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
instructed the White House and the independent counsel to prepare
for oral arguments to be held during the week of June 29 over the
legal privilege that has been asserted to limit testimony of White
House deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey and June 26 for the privilege
claimed to block the testimony of three employees of the Secret
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has asserted that the questions asked of
Lindsey about conversations that he had with President Clinton and
other officials are protected by the attorney-client privilege. The
Secret Service has claimed that its employees should not be
questioned because any breach in White House confidences would make
it harder for agents to protect the president.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Supreme Court turned down a request by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr to quickly decide the issues
posed by the administration's appeal. In brushing aside Starr's
request, the court said that it expected the appeals court would
``proceed expeditiously.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. district judge last month ruled that the attorney-client
privilege was outweighed by Starr's need for Lindsey's testimony.
The judge also ruled that there was no privilege that could be
invoked by the Secret Service.

PSST, IT'S OK TO DUCK OUT OF THE OFFICE EARLY ON FRIDAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For the last couple of years, it's gotten pretty quiet
around here on Friday afternoons. After about 2 p.m., the phones in
the business news department stop ringing, the faxes stop coming
and there's a general sense of peace that invades what is typically
a fairly busy place during the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Glancing out the windows, you can see people fleeing work early
to get a start on the weekend. One banker was spotted practically
running from his office about 2 p.m. one Friday, carrying a duffel
bag for a weekend at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard week, said the banker, who, like many in this
column, wishes to remain anonymous. It's OK to duck out early, but
it's still not a good idea to advertise it.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more people seem to be working harder during the
rest of the week, leaving early on Friday has become the latest
perk for the management and professional classes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a way to prevent burnout, said Stephen Morel, general
manager of Pro Staff, a staffing company in Houston. Like many
staffing companies, Pro Staff is swamped with orders from clients
to find workers. Morel, who works long hours Monday through
Thursday overseeing the company's 22 offices, said he tries to
leave at midafternoon on Fridays to get in a game of golf or simply
go home to relax, and encourages the employees who report to him to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can work 10 hours every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stampede starts about 3 p.m., said Joe Ahmad, a Houston
lawyer who has watched the trend develop as the parking lot in his
downtown office building quickly empties on Friday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad speculates that the lawyers who populate his building are
leaving early because they're doing so well financially. They want
some time to enjoy themselves, he said, and ducking out early is a
way to take a breather.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving early _ especially if the boss is still at the office _
still feels a bit clandestine. It's like a freebie but it really
isn't, said a consultant who works for one of the big accounting
firms in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of shortened Fridays became institutionalized at
many oil companies when they began moving to a compressed work
schedule a few years ago. Many employees either get every other
Friday off or they work a half-day every Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As that practice becomes more common, it's getting harder for
people to find anyone connected to the energy industry at their
desks on a Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get so frustrated because I can't get hold of anyone,'' said
Shirley Barr, who owns a public relations firm. ``I figure, `What
the heck, I might as well take off, too,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 p.m., Barr said, she is off running errands or at the
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll check my phone mail messages but seldom any clients
call,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Rivera said she finds she has to make a specific
appointment if she wants to schedule a Friday afternoon phone call.
Otherwise, forget it _ there is no chance Rivera, who teaches
people how to make presentations, will track someone down at 4 p.m.
on a Friday.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber stockbroker Tom Edwards stops making phone calls at
noon, and instead spends the afternoons getting paperwork done and
designing client portfolios. It seems to be worse in the summer
than the winter, said Edwards, who claims he rarely leaves early on
Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving work early is a practice largely confined to the
white-collar professional world such as finance. At industrial
plants, Fridays are like any other day.
</P>
<P>
   Leave early? asked Kirk Norris, the brewmaster at the
Anheuser-Busch plant in Houston, who seemed startled by the
question. It's a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour operation, he said.
There's no leaving early on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity in some circles of leaving early, many
managers still hate to be seen running to the parking lot with
briefcase in hand before the lunch crowd has dissipated for fear of
looking like a slacker. It's like the company that built a gym for
its managers but no one would be caught dead using it, said Bob
Dipboye, professor of psychology and administrative science at Rice
University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And there's always those who, as hard as they try, can't seem to
clear their desks early. At the advertising agency Bates Southwest,
most folks clear out by 1:30 p.m. on Friday during the summer. But
Chief Executive Jerry Kerr isn't one of the lucky ones. He said he
left early only three times last summer.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. has taken so many companies to
market, putting its prized imprint on the value of thousands of
public offerings of shares.
</P>
<P>
   So what value would it put on itself?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, as might be expected with a franchise as envied as
Goldman, Wall Street's last big private partnership, is not
clear-cut. The investment banking firm releases limited financial
information about itself, and competitors seem reluctant to hazard
too precise a guess lest it cost them a chance to help underwrite a
juicy public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Their off-the-cuff, not-for-attribution estimates of what
Goldman might be worth, range as low as $15 billion and as high as
$35 billion, depending on what multiple is used for its book value
_ which equals the amount of capital invested over the years by
partners and outside limited investors, plus its retained earnings.
</P>
<P>
   So if Goldman were to sell a 20 percent piece of itself in an
offering this fall _ the soonest such a sale could occur, because
the summer months are too fickle to float an offering of this sort
_ that could result in a multibillion-dollar sale, possibly one of
the biggest in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And if Goldman does turn itself into a public company, all of
Wall Street will be watching to see how the partnership divides up
the cream: all the excess profits realized after settling debts and
allowing for invested capital owned by Goldman's general and
limited partners.
</P>
<P>
   The betting is that Goldman's 190 partners would keep most of
the surplus for themselves, while using some to placate Goldman's
211 junior partners and key employees, and perhaps throwing a bone
to the firm's retired partners and outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting next Friday in Rye Brook, partners will have a
chance to discuss a public offering, either as a stand-alone deal
or as a prelude to a possible merger or acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors ensure that the idea, which has been debated for
years within the firm, will be taken seriously this time. Jon
Corzine and Henry Paulson Jr., the firm's co-chairmen, lean toward
going public and have been laboring behind the scenes to build a
consensus. Even more helpful, the runaway bull market of the last
few years means there finally may be enough money to satisfy the
many factions.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the deal is close to a sure thing. But if it
went forward, here is how the numbers might work.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, two of Goldman's closest
rivals, trade at between 3.5 and four times book value. Goldman
will certainly argue that it deserves to do at least as well. After
all, Moody's, the ratings agency that tracks some of the firm's
debt issues, estimated in April that Goldman's 48.1 percent net
return on common equity in 1997 far outstripped Merrill Lynch's
27.6 percent and Morgan Stanley's 21.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If that flies, the firm might then fetch upward of $22 billion,
roughly 3.5 times the $6.3 billion book value it reported at the
close of the quarter ended Feb. 28. One Goldman insider thought $25
billion, or four times book, was a more reasonable guess. (At that
figure, an offering of 20 percent in the form of newly issued
shares would generate about $5 billion in cash, while valuing the
shares owned by insiders at about $20 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   The current equity of roughly $6.3 billion, which represents the
retained value of all current owners' interest, would be replaced
by new shares: at least $2.5 billion to the 190 general partners,
$1.4 billion to limited partners, mostly retired partners, and
about $2.4 billion to some large outside investors, according to
figures as of Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Of the outside investors, Sumitomo Bank of Japan has $736
million of invested capital; Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, an
educational trust in Hawaii holds $658 million; and a number of
institutions, including AIG, the big insurer, hold about $755
million.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman may then decide to toss another $2 billion or so,
roughly $10 million apiece, to the group of 211 valued employees
just below the partnership level and perhaps give shares to some
others as well.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave as much as a $16.7 billion surplus to
distribute, with existing partners expected to take nearly all of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Those with big shares in Goldman _ like Corzine, Paulson and Roy
Zuckerberg, its longest-serving partner _ might each rake in at
least $200 million, with the average partner taking in a mere $100
million or so.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this largesse, however _ both for replacing existing
capital and for sharing in the premium _ would be handed out in the
form of shares in the newly created corporation. Since the firm
might want to conserve cash raised in the offering for possible
acquisitions, current owners who wanted cash would probably have to
take a discount, Goldman executives said. Such a strategy would
also help tie the talent to the firm at least for the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures may yet shift, depending on how Goldman did in the
second fiscal quarter ended May 31. It earned pretax profits of
just over $1 billion in the first quarter ended Feb. 28, and more
than $3 billion in the fiscal year ended Nov. 30.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Goldman executives say they have enjoyed a lush second quarter,
too, suggesting that book value may yet swell by a few hundred
million dollars before a deal is done and a multiple-to-book is
applied. Hence the even higher estimates approaching $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sheer vanity may push the number higher still. Given Goldman's
plum client roster, their depth of talent, and their common desire
to be seen as the crown jewel of Wall Street, the number might have
to be as high as $35 billion for a deal to get done. That would be
so even without the huge asset-management businesses that make
rivals' earnings more stable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Goldman franchise is the more valuable franchise,
because of its focus and reputation,'' said Samuel Hayes, a
professor of finance at Harvard business school, discussing
Goldman's value relative to its major competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it hasn't hurt that Goldman has done its bit to stoke
the raging bull market that has tempted the firm into even
considering going public. Abby Joseph Cohen, its market seer, has
been among the most bullish _ and the most prescient _ forecasters
of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Richard Strauss, Goldman's highly rated brokerage
analyst, has been a leader among the bulls on brokerage firms,
cheering the stock price of Merrill Lynch to new highs earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Goldman insiders are careful about the rosy
estimates floating around for their own firm. ``At a multiple of
two times book, I would think everyone would be very happy,'' said
one limited partner who declined to be identified. ``At three times
book, I think everyone would be positively delirious.''
</P>
<P>
   Some outside Wall Street executives also sound a note of
caution. Goldman's earnings have grown more dependent than most
people think on proprietary trading, where the firm puts its own
capital at risk, said Susan Webber, a consultant at Jaquish
Advisors who worked at Goldman more than 10 years ago. If so,
Goldman's earnings might be less stable and therefore less valuable
than some analysts realize.
</P>
<P>
   There are other unknowns as well. ``When you look at Goldman and
you look at it as a multiple of earnings, Wall Street is going to
adjust that for a tax rate that would be proper for a corporation,
and for compensation expense that would be higher for a
corporation.'' said Haig Nargesian, a senior vice president at
Moody's.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, partners with the biggest shares in the firm
would make the most money, one reason perhaps why many of them seem
to favor going public. Zuckerberg, Corzine, Paulson and Robert
Hurst, the head of investment banking, are among the biggest
shareholders in the firm, and are believed to now support the
idea. &QL;

INTERROGATIONS IN DIANA INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, Egypt)  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Nine months after the car crash that killed Diana,
Princess of Wales, and her companion, Dodi Fayed, a French
investigator on Friday grilled photographers who pursued the
couple, relatives of the dead and witnesses to try to determine how
it happened.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator, Judge Herve Stephan, is trying to determine
whether nine photographers and a motorcyclist arrested at the scene
of the accident last Aug. 31 may have somehow caused the chauffeur
of the couple's Mercedes to lose control and crash into a tunnel
support pillar at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Henri Paul, acting security chief of the Ritz Hotel,
owned by Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed Fayed, also died in the
crash. The French authorities later determined that he was legally
drunk at the time of the accident and had been taking
antidepressant drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan convened Mohamed Fayed, Diana's mother, Frances Shand
Kydd, the photographers and a battery of lawyers Friday morning in
the bidding room of the medieval Palace of Justice, a chamber
normally used to auction seized goods, for a virtual reconstruction
of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The sole survivor of the crash, Trevor Rees-Jones, a bodyguard
who worked for the Fayeds, did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immorality, the inhumanity of what they did,'' Fayed said
of the photographers during a break in the proceedings outside the
palace, on the Ile de la Cite, near Notre Dame. ``If I was not in a
courtroom, I would hang them all. They were like vultures around
the bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shand Kydd did not speak to reporters. ``She won't talk to
me,'' Fayed said. ``She thinks she's in the royal family. I'm just
an ordinary guy, a working-class guy. It's snobbery.''
</P>
<P>
   Fayed, an Egyptian citizen who also owns the Harrods department
store in London, has been fighting for acceptance by the British
establishment for years. He has also encouraged speculation that
the accident was somehow arranged by the British secret service to
ensure that Diana, as the mother of a potential heir to the British
throne and head of the Church of England, would not marry his son,
a Muslim. Diana and Prince Charles, the eldest son of Queen
Elizabeth II, were divorced before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   With conspiracy theories and denials swirling around England
since the accident, Stephan has been doggedly trying to determine
who may indeed be guilty of a criminal act in the case: Paul, the
photographers, the hotel management or perhaps the elusive driver
of a white Fiat Uno supposedly brushed by the Mercedes just before
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a nationwide investigation, neither car nor driver has
ever turned up. French law normally requires a reconstruction of a
crime scene, but Stephan has reportedly waived one so far because
blocking traffic for hours at the accident site in a busy underpass
beneath the Place de l'Alma, on the right bank of the Seine, would
be impractical.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday's session was closed to the public and to reporters, but
what little trickled out indicated that the inquiry was stuck at
about the point where it has been since late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Various witnesses have said that Paul, the driver, was legally
drunk but that the Ritz management and the passengers in the car
did not realize it.
</P>
<P>
   The photographers have said they were too far behind the
speeding car to have caused it to run out of control and have
denied charges that they neglected to try to summon help for the
victims because they were busy snapping gory pictures of the scene.

GM PARTS WORKERS STRIKE; PRODUCTION COULD BE HALTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ In the town that launched General Motors as a
national icon, 3,400 workers at a GM metal stamping factory walked
off their jobs Friday waving American flags and hoisting green and
white cardboard picket signs, protesting what they called broken
promises about their job security.
</P>
<P>
   The work stoppage, called by the United Auto Workers, could halt
production at 17 of GM's 29 North American production factories
within a week. The metal factory builds fenders, hoods and steel
engine cradles, components critical to the assembly of many of GM's
bread-and-butter-light trucks and sport-utility vehicles, as well
as some cars.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides, which also faced such a tense labor showdown in
1997, when seven different strikes were staged at factories across
the country, were scheduled to head back to the bargaining table
Saturday morning. But even if a settlement were signed, GM and UAW
could be at odds again as early as Thursday, when 5,000 workers at
a nearby parts-making factory are scheduled to decide whether to
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The strike comes after weeks of negotiations over fears that GM
is scaling back a plan to equip the factory with $300 million in
new stamping machinery, leaders of UAW Local 659 said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation escalated over the Memorial Day weekend, when GM
quietly removed from the factory several large stamping dies that
press steel into various parts for its 1999 GMC Sierra, a full-size
pickup truck that industry experts expect to become one of GM most
profitable vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials said its investment plan for the factory, much of
which it contends is already under way, is contingent on the local
union honoring a series of promised work changes to help speed up
production rates. The company wants the flexibility to shift
workers without worrying about violating union job classifications
and to shed work that is not pivotal to vehicle production. A GM
spokesman said the equipment was removed to prevent the strike from
disrupting its upcoming truck launch.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers view the action as a direct threat to the factory's
future employment levels and say it underscores GM's refusal to
bargain in good faith.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They also say the company has already cut the factory's job
classifications to six from about 18. ``How are we supposed to
believe anything this company says when they sit at the bargain
table and tell us one thing, then at night sneak in and steal our
work right out from under us,'' said Lucy Matthew, a parts
inspector who has worked for GM for 15 years. ``It's been time for
the workers in Flint to send GM a message for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   GM employs 33,000 people at 18 different facilities in Flint,
more than in any other city in the country. In the late 1970s when
GM was still king of the auto industry, dominating more than 50
percent of the market, it employed 77,000 workers in Flint alone.
But as its market share declined, GM consolidated much of its
operations, eliminating more than 40,000 jobs here in the 1980s and
1990s. GM is slated to shut its Buick City large car assembly
factory in 1999. It employs 2,800.
</P>
<P>
   GM won't speculate on how quickly the strike will begin
affecting its other operations. But signs of the strike's other
toll were already beginning to surface all across this city of
140,761.
</P>
<P>
   The strike took center stage in conversations in Flint, which
was home to the automaker's founder and its first major assembly
operations but was cast as a victim of GM's corporate policies in
the documentary ``Roger and Me''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to downsize Flint right out of
business,'' said Aubrey Carter, a sales clerk. ``It used to be that
you could get fired from one plant in town and go get a job at
another in the same day. But over the last 10 years or so GM has
taken more jobs out of here than they bring in. A lot of good
people have left this town because of GM.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, Anita Metevier believed GM would always be around to
be good to her family. Her father raised seven kids on a GM
paycheck. But in the 20 years that her husband has worked for GM,
she says the automaker's commitment to the city has declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM use to mean a stable future,'' said Mrs. Metevier, whose
husband works at the parts plant threatening to strike next week.
``But you can't count on that any more. No matter how loyal we are,
it's still doesn't seem enough to make them care about the families
they affect when they start talking about cutting jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Since talks of strikes started swirling around town three months
ago, Mrs. Metevier said she has been paying up credit bills and
stocking up on canned foods.'' With GM, you just never know what
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   GM says it remains committed to Flint and will invest $1.5
billion there through 2001, including a new $500 million engine
plant. ``We're not abandoning Flint, the UAW or the United states,
but we can't continue to be in businesses that are not
profitable,'' said a GM spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Pilipovich, owner of a used-car dealership and auto repair
shop, says his business slows virtually every time there is a rumor
of a strike. He estimates about two-thirds of his customers are GM
employees.
</P>

   ``GM owns this town. People who don't even work for GM buy GM
just to be loyal,'' he said pumping gas into his 1993 GM Chevrolet
Lumina and straining to heard above throngs of honking horns in
support of nearby pickets. ``But it seems like they've turned their

AUTOMAKERS SAY CRASH TESTS HAMPER DESIGNING SAFER VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario _ U.S., European and Japanese automakers said
at a conference here Friday that increasingly high-speed government
and insurance industry crash tests were preventing auto engineers
from designing sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and large cars
that would be less dangerous to other motorists.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is under growing pressure to design sport
utility vehicles and other light trucks that would kill fewer
occupants of other vehicles. Light trucks _ a category that
includes pickup trucks and minivans as well as sport utility
vehicles _ are a third of the vehicles on the road but account for
half the traffic deaths, and their sales are growing rapidly. When
light trucks hit cars, 81 percent of the deaths are in the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Safety scientists from Detroit's Big Three automakers,
Daimler-Benz, Honda and a Japanese auto industry research
consortium all contended Friday that the recent trend toward crash
tests was forcing them to design vehicles with very stiff frames.
The latest government and insurance industry tests involve slamming
cars and light trucks into concrete barriers at speeds of up to 40
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   At those speeds, the sheer weight of a big sport utility vehicle
or a very large car will tend to mash its passenger compartment
against the barrier _ unless the vehicle has a stiff frame to hold
everything in place, the auto industry representatives contended.
</P>
<P>
   But once a vehicle's frame has been stiffened to pass the crash
test, it poses more of a danger to other motorists, the auto
engineers said. Stiff vehicles tend to punch deeply into cars
during real-world collisions, increasing the risk of death or
injury for car occupants.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward high-speed crash tests requires automakers to
produce stiff designs for big vehicles that are less compatible in
crashes with smaller cars, said Falk Zeidler, a senior safety
engineer at Daimler-Benz. ``It is counterproductive for the
compatibility issue, especially for large cars'' and other big
family vehicles, he said at a conference here in this factory town
across the Detroit River from Detroit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute because sport utility vehicles
have become more luxurious over the last decade, as features like
leather seats and extra towing capacity have added half a ton to
the weight of the Chevrolet Suburban, for example. Federal
regulators say that some sport utility vehicles now have frames
that are five times as stiff as car frames.
</P>
<P>
   While federal regulators refused to discuss Friday the
automakers' complaints, people familiar with the regulators' plans
said in recent interviews that the federal government has been
considering ways to alter its tests.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is to slam a 3,000-pound barrier into each car,
instead of slamming cars into concrete barriers at 35 miles an
hour. A three-ton Suburban could stop a 3,000-pound barrier without
the stiff frame required by the current federal test.
</P>
<P>
   The moving barrier would also require Friday's small cars to be
built more sturdily. Sending a 2,000-pound subcompact into a
concrete barrier at 35 miles an hour is a fairly easy test because
there is not much weight in the subcompact to mash the passenger
compartment against the barrier. Requiring a subcompact to
withstand an impact by a 3,000-pound barrier would present more of
a challenge for engineers. But any actual change in federal test
procedures would likely require years of review.
</P>
<P>
   Any move to replace the current test could also leave drivers of
Suburbans feeling less confident about their survival prospects if
they ever did run into a bridge abutment or some other unyielding
surface. Insurance industry officials, who have begun issuing
safety ratings for family vehicles based on crash tests at 40 miles
per hour, insisted Friday that engineers should be able to design
even the heaviest vehicles to withstand high-speed impacts into
fixed barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Neill, the president of the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, a Washington-based group supported by insurers
seeking to reduce the cost of accident claims, said automakers
should be able to design vehicles with less rigid front ends that
crumple more in an accident, cushioning the force of the impact
while also reducing the damage to other vehicles. Only the
passenger compartment should be rigid, to reduce the likelihood
that the engine and other dangerous parts will intrude and hit
passengers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Lund, the institute's research director, said that the
hoods and front ends of big sport utility vehicles may need to be
longer, so that there is more metal available to be crumpled in a
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry research has also found that extremely stiff
vehicles can be less safe for their own occupants, particularly in
low-speed accidents. This is because more of the force of the
impact is transferred to the occupant instead of being absorbed by
the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. regulators originally labeled Friday's conference as the
Light Trucks and Vans Summit. But following complaints by the auto
industry that this suggested a showdown that might lead to new
regulations, the gathering ended up being named the International
Dialogue on Vehicle Compatibility.

COMMENTARY: STARR'S GUILT TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that he's on a faster track, which we can only pray will
expedite the most extravagant investigation of a quickie sex act in
American history, you might think that Ken Starr has at last
regained his bearings. No more martyring of anybody's mother, no
more posing with garbage bags in the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, alas, the independent counsel reverted to form by
making a speech so genuinely nutty it's hard to know which is more
amazing _ what he said, or the fact that his words escaped serious
scrutiny by a (you choose) bored or compliant press.
</P>
<P>
   The speech in question, delivered before lawyers in North
Carolina, was the one in which Starr implicitly likened himself to
Atticus Finch, the altruistic advocate for a wrongly accused black
man in Harper Lee's ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' and decried lawyers
who resemble Bruiser, the villain in John Grisham's ``The
Rainmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's literary parable was widely reported to be a sly attack
on President Clinton's lawyers, who, as the independent counsel put
it, ``try to concoct new privileges'' to thwart pursuit of the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   That charge is true enough. And yet a reading of the speech's
full text suggests that Starr, much like a criminal who
compulsively revisits the scene of a crime, was not so much out to
demonize the White House's legal stall artists as to indict himself
for his own legal whoring, for Big Tobacco. His thinly veiled
confession of sin might almost be construed as noble _ had it not
the bizarrely sadomasochistic quality of a self-flagellation.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Starr denounced legal ``hired guns,'' whom he
defined as ``greedy and unethical (lawyers) who hock their services
_ and indeed their morals _ to the highest bidder.'' Such lawyers,
he said, are ``indentured servants, rather than professionals'' _
because ``there are some things that a professional will not do for
money.'' He called on his peers to reclaim ``the moral high
ground'' by just saying no to clients who pay them fortunes to
``use their skills to impede the search for truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Who is Starr attacking most ferociously here? Whatever else is
to be said about Bill Clinton's lawyers, they're surely not
defending their now debt-ridden client for the money. Starr, by
contrast, has done exactly what he faults Grisham's villain for
doing, and did it while moonlighting on the government payroll: He
hocked his services to a high bidder whose main goal is to impede,
not further, the revelation of truth. In his case, that bidder was
Brown &AMP; Williamson _ a tobacco company much like the odious one in
another recent Grisham novel, ``The Runaway Jury,'' that he somehow
neglected to cite in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   What Big Tobacco got for the independent counsel's indentured
servitude was a Clintonesque attempt to use privilege to delay
justice. Starr was the lawyer who invoked attorney-client
privilege, however irrelevantly, before an appellate court in 1995
to further his client's efforts to intimidate and frustrate Henry
Waxman and Ron Wyden, who'd used a cache of Brown &AMP; Williamson
internal documents in their House investigation of the cigarette
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr lost the case. Had he won, he might have slowed or
derailed not just Congress' pursuit of that industry but state
tobacco litigation. The red-hot evidence Starr was trying to shield
with attorney-client privilege and other legal red herrings was not
of perjury about an alleged sex act but of a possibly criminal
conspiracy to destroy the health of millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown &AMP; Williamson documents suggested that the company had
known that nicotine was addictive since 1963 and had suppressed
research linking smoking to cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Starr really believes that if he finally does get to the
bottom of Monicagate, he'll be an American hero in the Gregory Peck
mold. But we don't have to wait another day to see that he already
fits the archetype of the Grisham heavy (Mickey Rourke in ``The
Rainmaker'') he deplores.
</P>
<P>
   What can't be explained, even by us armchair psychiatrists, is
what possessed the independent counsel to deliver a speech
trumpeting his guilt. Is he so blind to his own hypocrisy that he
didn't know what he was doing? Or is there an internal struggle
going on here that's more Robert Louis Stevenson than Harper Lee? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ By the time the first copies of Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's latest book landed at a Moscow bookstore on
Thursday, its arrival had been heralded far and wide. Excerpts were
published in half a dozen newspapers, and there were announcements
on radio and television _ just the kind of fanfare that might be
expected for a work by the great Soviet dissident, Nobel Prize
winner and tireless defender of Russia's battered soul.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the advance publicity, the publication of ``Russia
in Collapse,'' a 204-page volume of apocalyptic musings about the
fate of the nation, begs a question that has dogged its 79-year-old
author since his return from exile four years ago: Who in Russia
today is prepared to read what Solzhenitsyn has to say?
</P>
<P>
   If the publisher's initial print run of 5,000 is any indication,
the answer is: not many, certainly far fewer than the millions of
readers who snapped up copies of Solzhenitsyn's classic, ``The
Gulag Archipelago,'' when it was finally printed here for the first
time in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is surprising is that such a famous, noted author would
put out a book in only 5,000 copies,'' said Roy Medvedev, another
Soviet-era dissident whose own book on Russian capitalism came out
last week, also in only 5,000 copies. ``What is striking is the
loss of interest in Solzhenitsyn on the part of Russian society.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the phones were ringing all morning on Thursday at the
Russian Way bookstore _ a tidy, tiny haven of classical literature
on a street filled with features of the new Russia: beauty salons,
garish cafes, investment banks, currency-exchange booths.
Solzhenitsyn's loyal readers, many of whom share his alienation
from the culture around them, were calling in to ask when they
could come by and pick up their copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been waiting for days,'' said Nadezhda Ustelis, a
retired state bureaucrat, who walked out with a plastic bag stuffed
full of copies of the book ($1.40 in paperback, $2.20 in
hardcover). ``Friends and relatives from all over have asked me to
send copies, and I am sending the book to my grandsons, so they
will know our history.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday the publisher, Victor Moskvin, said, more than
2,000 copies had been sold and another printing of 5,000 is planned
next week. ``We are very happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Solzhenitsyn, who rarely gives interviews, has not personally
promoted the book, which is currently available only in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Since his return in November 1994 after a 20-year exile, mainly
in Vermont, Solzhenitsyn has become one of the paradoxes of the new
Russia. Freed from the harsh Soviet censorship that made mere
possession of his books a criminal act, Solzhenitsyn _ more than
any other Russian writer or thinker _ has had ample opportunity to
address his public.
</P>
<P>
   He was host of a talk show on national television. He has
traveled the country, lecturing and listening to what people have
to say. His works have been published not only in select literary
journals but in Argumenti i Fakty, Russia's most popular newspaper,
with a readership of 3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our paper has always been interested in the opinions of
Alexander Isayevich,'' said Natalya Zhilnorova, assistant deputy
editor. ``We think they are very important and useful for Russia,
for our society. We consider him one of the geniuses of our time.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet for all the reverence, Solzhenitsyn has been been unable
to connect with a broad audience, even though his gloomy assessment
of Russian society, government and culture is widely shared by
many. His talk show was canceled for lack of viewers, his trips go
largely unreported, and for all the prior notice, ``Russia in
Collapse'' has elicited little reaction of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks like a prophet, but who needs prophets when society
is changing every month, every day?'' Medvedev asked. ``The name
Solzhenitsyn allows him to be published in any newspaper, but that
does not mean he has readers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new book is a rambling collection of Solzhenitsyn's thoughts
and impressions about what he has seen and heard here over the last
four years. The picture he paints is relentlessly grim: a country
brought to its knees by the avarice and cowardice of its ruling
elite and by the West _ in particular the United States _ which has
wasted no time in taking advantage of Russia's weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Few leaders or institutions escape Solzhenitsyn's wrath. NATO
expansion, he writes, is a ``plot to exert pressure on Russia.''
Radio Liberty, the American-financed radio station that once
transmitted his works to Russian listeners, turned itself into
``something like a Chechen radio station'' during the two-year war
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Even the International Monetary Fund _ a favorite bogeyman for
Russian nationalists _ is working against Russia's own interests,
Solzhenitsyn says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like slaves, we obey the program of the IMF _ either because
we are stupid or because we consciously put ourselves in somebody
else's hands,'' he writes. ``In 10 years we will sink to the level
of African countries, and already we are treated like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians share Solzhenitsyn's bitterness, and according to
Medvedev, that may be one of the reasons so few are ready to hear
him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He criticizes the current regime, and for that reason neither
the authorities nor the West support him,'' Medvedev said. ``As for
ordinary people, the young and the disaffected, they see that his
criticisms are not as sharp as others'. His is general criticism,
without any new information. It is just a statement of fact: He is
against socialism, against capitalism, and he has no concept of
what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Vera Moseyeva, a retired clerk who remembers the first
book by Solzhenitsyn that she ever laid her hands on (it was almost
in tatters by the time it had been carefully and secretly passed to
her), it does not matter what he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he says is always interesting,'' she said, after
buying three copies of ``Russia in Collapse.'' ``He writes for the
people, and what he writes is very actual. Does he scold too much?
Given the way life is these days, how can one not be scolding?''

AS HIS DEATH IS ANNOUNCED, BOB HOPE ENJOYS BREAKFAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., announced the death
of Bob Hope Friday, he felt a sense of personal loss. Stump was a
homesick teen-ager in the Pacific Theater in World War II when the
comedian lifted his spirits with his stand-up comedy routine.
</P>
<P>
   So Stump was greatly relieved only minutes after his
announcement to learn that Hope, who turned 95 on May 29, was very
much alive.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press said it had caused the misunderstanding by
inadvertently displaying an advance obituary of Hope on its Web
site. Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House Republican leader, saw
the obituary and handed it to Stump, asking him to announce the
death on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Stump was an obvious choice, since he had introduced the bill
that made Hope an honorary veteran. Many servicemen from World War
II to the Persian Gulf War recall Hope's morale-boosting
appearances. Stump closed his tribute, which was televised
nationally by C-Span, with the words, ``We're all going to miss
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But not yet. News organizations that reached Hope's California
home were told by his daughter Linda that Hope was enjoying his
breakfast. Armey apologized on the House floor for the
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Stump, who was a Navy medic, called Hope ``the best friend
anyone in uniform ever had.'' Stump spoke to Hope's daughter and
was relieved to find her ``not the least bit upset.''

SUCCESSOR NAMED TO LEAD CAMPAIGN FINANCE INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno announced Friday that
she has named a veteran federal prosecutor in New Hampshire to
succeed Charles Labella, a lawyer who is stepping down from the top
job in the Justice Department's campaign finance inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that David Vicinanzo, an assistant U.S. attorney,
would begin work this summer as Labella's deputy and will assume
control when Labella becomes interim U.S. attorney in San Diego in
August or September.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of who will head the inquiry has been a controversial
subject for Reno. Republican lawmakers have pressured her to seek
an independent prosecutor to investigate the matter, but she has
refused. She tried to reassure Congress by taking the case away
from prosecutors at the Justice Department's Public Integrity
Section and assigning it instead to Labella, a federal prosecutor
from outside Washington with an aggressive reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Under Labella, the inquiry gained momentum and in the last five
months, prosecutors have brought charges against Democratic
fund-raisers Johnny Chung, Charlie Trie and Maria Hsia. Recently,
prosecutors learned from Chung that an executive of a Chinese
aerospace firm with close ties to China's military contributed
funds to President Clinton's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers criticized Labella's departure, announced just
six months after he arrived. They suggested his resignation
represented a lack of commitment to investigate how the Democrats
financed the 1996 presidential re-election campaign. Reno's
announcement Friday suggested that Vicinanzo planned a longer
tenure and would move to Washington with his wife and seven sons.

QUESTIONS REMAIN FOR PARCELLS AFTER ROOKIE WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ After looking closely at his 12 draft picks
during rookie week, Jets coach Bill Parcells Friday sounded like a
man who wasn't sure about what he had bought.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those picks are being asked to play positions that are
different from their college roles. The most noted is Scott Frost,
the quarterback for co-champion Nebraska, who is trying to become a
safety.
</P>
<P>
   When he was selected in the third round, Frost thought he would
play at free safety. But at 6 feet 3 inches and 219 pounds, he
would be uncommonly big for that position.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Frost was switched this week to strong safety, a
position that would pit him often against tight ends, and support
the defense against the run, rather than go head-to-head against
swift receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Frost, who played safety at Stanford before transferring to
Nebraska, looked shaky the first few days when receivers slanted in
front of him and repeatedly snared passes. By Thursday, he began
behaving more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having trouble with one-on-one coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frost is also concerned about his technique. ``That, I have to
learn more than anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the kid can keep up mentally,'' Parcells said. ``It's
just adjusting to technique. And he's going to be doing it over and
over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he makes it,'' Parcells said, ``the upside could be
tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   During rookie week, a former cornerback, Kevin Williams of
Oklahoma State, has been the free safety. He talks like one, too,
describing himself as having the knack for the position. As a
senior, he picked off seven passes at cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm out there,'' he said, ``the ball just seems to find
me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Victor Green is the incumbent at strong safety, the Jets
are looking to replace Jerome Henderson at free safety. He is going
to compete at right cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets also drafted Jason Fabini, a left tackle from
Cincinnati, and are trying to make a right tackle out of him. That
spot was vacated by David Williams, who was cut last week. Siupeli
Malamala, a longtime backup, will be the man to beat out there.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Parcells drafted Casey Dailey of Northwestern, where he
was a pass-rushing end. Now he is a linebacker, although Parcells
hopes he may be able to chase the quarterback in special
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen them in pads,'' Parcells said Friday as camp
closed, and he won't see them again until training camp opens July
22.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the real evaluation still remains.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' decision to play the Giants on grass in their annual
exhibition game is a possible prelude to converting Giants Stadium
from an artificial surface ... The Jets cut linebacker Craig Guest,
who had been on the practice squad last year. They also dropped
three players they had picked up in the off- season: defensive
tackle Matt Keneley, wide receiver Bernard Holmes and punter Craig
Deignan.

DAVID WALSH, 52, PROMOTER OF BRE-X STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ David Walsh, a journeyman stock promoter whose gold
mining company, Bre-X Minerals, was at the center of a fraud that
wiped out the holdings of investors in Canada and the United
States, died on Thursday at Doctors' Hospital in Nassau, the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   He was 52 and had been in a coma since Sunday, when he suffered
a brain aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   Under Walsh, Bre-X shares grew from a highly speculative penny
stock to one of Canada's most sought-after investments, worth more
than $200 a share at its peak before collapsing and eventually
becoming a notorious symbol of Canadian stock fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The company never produced a commercial ounce of gold; its only
real asset was its claim to a piece of dense jungle in Indonesia
that supposedly held as many as 200 million ounces of gold, which
would have made it the richest strike in history.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the artful way Walsh promoted the stock, investors
clamored for it, and much bigger mining companies competed
aggressively to become Bre-X's partner in the site, known as
Busang.
</P>
<P>
   The end came just weeks after an American company, Freeport
McMoran Copper and Gold Inc., became Bre-X's partner early last
year. Independent drilling by Freeport found that there was little
or no gold at Busang.
</P>
<P>
   As Bre-X began to implode, Walsh seemed as stunned as any of the
investors who had seen their Bre-X stock suddenly become worthless.
``We'll be exonerated,'' he told reporters who waited for him on
the sidewalk outside Bre-X headquarters in Calgary, Alberta, the
day the announcement was made. ``And the property will stand as we
have indicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Later investigations found that Bre-X's core samples had been
``salted,'' a process in which gold dust is sprinkled into drilled
sections of earth to falsely indicate rich deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the United States and Canada filed class action
suits against Walsh and other company officials. Bre-X itself
declared bankruptcy last November, and Walsh resigned as chairman
soon after. He and his wife, Jeannette, who had helped him start
Bre-X in the basement of their Calgary home in late 1987, had sold
significant amounts of Bre-X stock at high prices months before the
company collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh always maintained that he had no prior knowledge of the
fraud. ``It's been difficult because he always viewed himself as a
victim along with everyone else,'' said Alan Lenczner, Walsh's
lawyer in Toronto. ``He claimed he had nothing to do with the
tampering nor could he have known about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh was born in the English-speaking section of Montreal in
1945. The son of a stockbroker, he entered the investment industry
as a young man. He was named vice president of Midland-Doherty, a
Montreal brokerage firm when he was 29, the youngest person in the
firm's history to hold that position. He had his first brush with
controversy in 1975 when he arranged to sell stock shares that a
friend of his had stolen. Though he was never implicated in the
theft, Walsh was pressed to leave the firm.
</P>
<P>
   After holding a number of positions with other firms, he moved
in 1982 to Calgary, where he first became involved in mining. He
started his own company, Bresea Resources Ltd. in 1984, taking the
name from the names of his sons, Brett and Sean. After struggling
for several years, Walsh and his wife were heavily in debt and
declared personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   But always on the lookout for a new deal, Walsh turned to an old
friend, John Felderhof, a Canadian geologist he had met in
connection with an Australian mining project a decade earlier.
Felderhof was working in Indonesia and he interested Walsh in a
potential mining site known as Busang.
</P>
<P>
   The project began to look up after Bre-X hired Michael de
Guzman, a Filipino prospector, who began to file increasingly
optimistic reports about the amount of gold at the site. Pushed
along by Walsh's easy-going, everyman style, Bre-X stock soared,
making many investors millionaires. In Canadian financial circles,
Walsh was transformed from loser to legend.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, just weeks before the first reports that there
was little or no gold at Busang, De Guzman disappeared. He is
believed to have jumped to his death from a helicopter flying over
the Indonesian jungle.
</P>
<P>
   As the first damaging reports about Busang came out, Walsh
insisted that there had been no fraud and that the discrepancy in
estimates was caused by differences in testing methods. But as the
evidence increased that the samples had been tampered with, he
contended that he had been taken in by the fraud. He withdrew into
the Bre-X headquarters in Calgary. Later he and Mrs. Walsh moved to
the home they had bought in Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived through the highs and lows of Bre-X together,''
Felderhof told the Globe and Mail of Toronto Thursday. Felderhof
now lives on an estate in the Cayman Islands. ``Although we did not
always agree on every decision, I always believed that David was
trying to do the utmost for the shareholders, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh and his wife, along with company advisers and brokerage
firms, have been named in several suits filed by investors in
Canada and the United States. Lawyers involved said the lawsuits
would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is survived by his wife, Jeannette, and their sons Brett
and Sean, all of Nassau. His body has been donated to science. A
memorial service will be held in Montreal next week.

TWELVE RIVALS FACE REAL QUIET AT BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAY PRIVMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are running, but they are not scared. Emboldened by doubts
regarding the ability of Real Quiet to sweep the Triple Crown,
rival trainers have entered 12 horses to face the hero of the
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes in Saturday's 130th Belmont
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The trainers are more confident than the bettors, who are
expected to send Real Quiet off as a heavy favorite. He is the 6-5
favorite on Belmont Park's morning line, but a record number of
challengers are facing him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet follows 24 horses who previously captured both the
Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes. Of those, 22 went on to
the Belmont Stakes. And none faced more challengers than Real
Quiet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fear him,'' the trainer James Bond, who sends out the
lightly raced Raffie's Majesty, said Friday morning at his barn at
Belmont Park. ``I think he's a nice horse, but I think he's
beatable. I'd be a fool not to think he's the horse to beat, but a
mile-and-one-half is uncharted water.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The challengers come from varied backgrounds, but they have the
same mission: to prevent Real Quiet from becoming the 12th Triple
Crown winner. Some of the challengers have faced Real Quiet in the
first two legs of the Triple Crown, and are hoping a change in
scenery will turn their fortunes. Others are hoping that the
Belmont's distance will trip Real Quiet, or that Real Quiet is
exhausted from his two previous victories, leaving him vulnerable
to a fresh newcomer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen how the Triple Crown takes a toll on a horse,'' said
Elliott Walden, the trainer of Victory Gallop, who has finished
second to Real Quiet in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness.
``After the Preakness, Victory Gallop came out of his feed tub a
little and lost some weight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only Victory Gallop and the long-shot Basic Trainee have chased
Real Quiet in the first two legs of the Triple Crown. Chilito,
Hanuman Highway and Parade Ground ran in the Derby, skipped the
Preakness and have rejoined the party for the Belmont. Classic Cat
and Hot Wells bypassed the Derby, then ran in the Preakness and
continued on to the Belmont. Grand Slam, Limit Out, Raffie's
Majesty, Thomas Jo and Yarrow Brae ran in lesser races than the
Derby and the Preakness this spring and are making their Triple
Crown debuts in the Belmont. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Quiet is a game horse,'' Bond said. ``But the question
is, what has he run against? He ran better in the Preakness than
the Derby, but this is a whole different race now. The added
distance, a lot of horses back out of it that last half-mile. When
he gets to the top of the lane, he's got to run with my horse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be in this race if I didn't think he belonged,''
Bond said of Raffie's Majesty. ``I'm not running for second. Nobody
remembers who runs second. The only one they remember who ran
second is Alydar.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alydar finished second to Affirmed in all three legs of the
Triple Crown in 1978, the last time the Triple Crown was swept.
This year's Alydar is Victory Gallop, who lost the Derby by a
half-length, then was two-and-one-quarter lengths behind Real Quiet
in the Preakness. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been close enough to Real Quiet that we think we can
beat him,'' Walden said. ``I feel like we're not that far off of
Real Quiet. We've got as good a shot to upset him as anyone
does.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet Victory Gallop will have to be fully recovered from an
infectious skin disease that has left unsightly patches on his
coat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a while to run its course,'' Walden said. ``On a scale
of 1 to 10, he had an 8. There aren't any patches in the area where
the saddle goes. It was all over his shoulder and his rump.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pace of the Belmont figures to be demanding. Chilito, Basic
Trainee and two horses trained by D. Wayne Lukas _ Grand Slam and
Yarrow Brae _ all have sharp early speed. But at a mile-and-a-half,
the jockeys will need to remain patient, lest they waste their
chances by moving prematurely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to be really, really patient,'' said John
Velazquez, who rides Classic Cat. ``You don't know who will handle
the distance.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of those challenging Real Quiet, Velazquez is among the most
respectful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't knock that horse,'' he said. ``I think he's the real
thing. He went around everybody in the Preakness. But I want to
beat him. I'm rooting for my horse. I don't care about history, the
Triple Crown. Real Quiet isn't putting food on my table.'' &QL;

U.S. SOCCER TEAM SETS UP CAMP IN FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France _ The U.S. soccer team arrived in
the heart of the Beaujolais wine region Friday, setting up camp for
the World Cup in a 14th to 17th century chateau that has been
fitted with air-conditioning but still relies on roosters for alarm
clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by a 130-acre vineyard and a 75-acre oak forest, the
Chateau de Pizay, 25 miles north of Lyons, provides splendid if
tedious isolation from distraction as the Americans prepare for
their opener on June 15 against Germany in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   They are not the most famous Americans ever to stroll through
the magnificent gardens _ Hillary Clinton once visited the wine
cellars _ but they are one of 32 teams that will captivate the
planet over the next month in the world's most popular sporting
event.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks, geese, roosters and plainclothes police officers in
ill-fitting suits wandered about the estate, while gendarmes
strolled the perimeter, a reminder that even in this bucolic
setting, someone could choose to use the public stage of
international soccer to launch his own private terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd like to be closer to somewhere, but for our focus
this is an ideal place, a professional environment away from
everything, being awakened by roosters and cows,'' forward Roy
Wegerle said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the team will bivouac near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,
and at an ocean resort on the Atlantic, but for now the players are
immersed in the culture of the verdant French countryside. At a
late-afternoon practice, local people set up a speaker in a window
and played the national anthem as the Americans prepared for a
light workout in the muggy heat. Tiny American flags were planted
near the stadium like beds of tulips, and young schoolchildren sat
and watched on the sidelines in what appeared to be rehearsed
jubilation.
</P>
<P>
   Guard dogs patrolled the outer fence of the stadium, and police
cars escorted the team bus, but the players who remembered their
stay at a military base in Italy for the 1990 World Cup said the
security here was sufficient without being overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Italy, every time we came to a corner, guys would start
waving their guns and pointing them,'' said Tab Ramos, who is
playing in his third World Cup. ``It was a lot more dramatic, as
you feel the Italians would be.''
</P>
<P>
   The next order of business for the team is a closed-door
scrimmage on Tuesday against Gueugnon, a team in the French
league's second division. Coach Steve Sampson still has two crucial
choices to make before the Germany game. He must find a starter on
the right wing in midfield and at striker in the 3-6-1 alignment
that features three defenders, six midfielders and one forward.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Hejduk, who has missed three exhibitions because of a
hamstring injury after an encouraging performance in a 3-0 victory
over Austria in April, will most likely see at least 45 minutes of
playing time in the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears that if he progresses sufficiently from
arthroscopic knee surgery two months ago, Eric Wynalda will be
favored ahead of Wegerle and Brian McBride at forward. Wynalda is
the career-leading scorer for the Americans.

WASHINGTON STATE'S SENATORS CITE COOPERATION IN FILLING JUDICIAL
VACANCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sens. Patty Murray and Slade Gorton have named a 12-member
bipartisan panel to screen would-be successors to U.S. District
Judge William Dwyer, who has delivered major decisions on Northwest
social, environmental and political issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slade and I will jointly interview the finalists they send us.
We will then jointly select, and jointly send a name to the White
House,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Selection of a successor to Dwyer, who wants to retire, will
complete a political dance in which Republican Gorton, Democrat
Murray and the White House have compromised and cooperated to fill
seven federal court vacancies in the Northwest and California.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he expects to have all nominees to the bench, except
Dwyer's replacement, confirmed by the Senate before Congress'
scheduled adjournment at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are way ahead of other parts of the country in putting
together judicial appointments, despite the rancorous setting of
the U.S. Senate,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   The key has been a tradeoff in which Murray and the White House
gave Gorton a major voice in the selection of several judges, as
well as his own choice in filling one vacancy on a key federal
appellate court. Gorton had said he would block all judicial
confirmations in Washington state until he was able to help pick
judges.
</P>
<P>
   With a complicated agreement in place, a partisan logjam in
judicial confirmations by the Republican-run Senate has been
broken, at least in the Northwest. The breakdown of vacancies and
appointments includes:
</P>
<P>
   _Already confirmed: The Senate has approved Seattle trial lawyer
M. Margaret McKeown to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and
Pasco lawyer Ed Shea to the U.S. District Court bench in Yakima.
</P>
<P>
   McKeown and Shea were recommended by Murray. The 9th Circuit is
based in San Francisco, but five of its 28 judges sit in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   _Nominated and pending: With Gorton playing a significant role,
Clinton nominated Seattle attorney Ron Gould to the 9th Circuit,
and King County Superior Court Judge Robert Lasnik to the U.S.
District Court bench in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view, the president has followed the
Constitution and asked for the Senate's advice as well as consent.
In my view, these nominees are entitled to consent by the Senate,''
Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Lasnik are expected to be confirmed by the Senate
without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   _Pending and Controversial: In a complicated deal between Gorton
and White House counsel Charles Ruff, the Senate is expected to
vote soon on the long-delayed confirmation of University of
California law professor William Fletcher to the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher would take a San Francisco-based seat on the court. His
mother, Betty Fletcher, a 9th Circuit judge based in Seattle, would
retire.
</P>
<P>
   The White House would then nominate Washington State Supreme
Court Justice Barbara Durham, a candidate picked by Gorton, to
Betty Fletcher's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mixture of these appointments means the ideological
balance on the court will not be changed,'' Gorton said. The 9th
Circuit is closely divided between moderate and liberal judges
appointed by Presidents Clinton and Carter, and several outspoken
conservatives elevated to the bench by President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   _The Dwyer vacancy: The committee to screen Dwyer's potential
successors will be co-chaired by Jenny Durkan, a Democrat prominent
Seattle trial lawyer, and former U.S. attorney Mike McKay, a
Republican active in George Bush's 1988 campaign. It is equally
divided between Murray and Gorton appointees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't put a definite timetable on the selection panel,
but they understand the need to get it done quickly because Dwyer
wants to get off the bench,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer has carried a full case load despite suffering from
Parkinson's Disease and back problems.
</P>
<P>
   After being screened, interviewed by the senators and
recommended to the White House, whoever is tapped as Dwyer's
successor must still undergo an extensive FBI background check.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation of Dwyer's successor will probably come after the
next Congress convenes in January.

   &UR; WHERE'S MY PET ROCK? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;  &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC; annoying as the
fads of years past.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, the sight of a sullen, 21-year-old convenience store
clerk fingering his eyebrow rings is almost enough to make my
rethink my opposition to mandatory sterilization. And the way some
men my age and older pull what few remaining hairs they have left
back into those pathetic little ponytails makes me think that we
might save everyone a lot of time and trouble if we forget about
Social Security reform and, instead, just have us leap off a high
cliff once we turn 40 or buy our first toupee, whichever comes
first.
</P>
<P>
   So, no, today's fads are nothing to brag about. But are they
more irritating than earlier fads? I'm inclined to say no. Take,
for instance, the ``Baby on Board'' signs. This is a perfect
example of how a gentle, well-intentioned idea (a yellow sticker
alerting other drivers to be extra-careful) can metastasize into a
huge, bloated spinoff industry of window and bumper stickers that
runs the gamut from crude to inane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby on Board'' was followed by ``Grandma on Board,'' which
was followed by ``I (heart) My (breed of yappy) Dog,'' which was
followed by ``How's My Driving? Call 1-800-EAT (bad word).''
</P>
<P>
   Flagpole sitting and goldfish swallowing were fads that had the
common courtesy to die out quickly. Bumper stickers show no sign of
going away soon, and we can blame it all on a few well-intentioned
parents in 1985 who thought they were promoting highway safety.
(You can bet we won't make that mistake again!)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of highway safety, do you remember the citizens band
radio craze of the mid-'70s? Do you want to? Of course, you don't.
That's because for three or four years, the infernal things
dominated the popular culture, assuming one can use the word
``culture'' to describe something that happened in the '70s, which
I personally think you cannot. CB radios were introduced in 1947,
but it took the Arab oil embargo of 1974 to turn them into a fad.
</P>
<P>
   Truckers and ordinary drivers yakked back and forth to each
other to find out which gas stations were open and selling gas.
(Ah, the good old days.) It wouldn't have been so bad if that was
all there was to it, but, of course, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   True CBers had to master a second language. Cops were
``Smokeys,'' Volkswagens were ``pregnant roller skates'' and if
everything was OK it was ``a big 10-4.''
</P>
<P>
   The CB craze died out thanks to cell phones (don't get me
started on them and, unwittingly, thanks to Betty Ford. Mrs. Ford
was a CB fan and even had her own handle, ``First Mama.'') Once
people learned of the connection between CBs and the Ford
administration, they quickly found other ways to waste their time.
Such as collecting Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
</P>
<P>
   The comic books were bad, the TV show was worse and the movies
made ``Mr. Magoo'' seem like ``Gone With the Wind.'' I should know.
We've still got the action figures, party wagon, blimps, lunchboxes
and Halloween costumes stashed away somewhere in the attic. It's up
there with the Rubik's cubes, pet rocks, Ouija board, lava lamps
and Hula Hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's some of the dumbest, shoddiest, most useless junk
ever to defile our planet but, heck, it might be worth something
someday. Especially if any of those things ever become popular
again. Think about that.

BOY, 11, CONVICTED IN SEXUAL ASSAULT GETS 10 YEARS IN YOUTH
FACILITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ An 11-year-old boy who beat and sexually assaulted a
3-year-old girl was sentenced to 10 years in a Texas Youth
Commission facility Friday by a jury that apparently rejected the
notion that he should be treated as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence means that the boy, who could have received a
40-year sentence, will be released by the time he is 21.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Hal Gaither, a critic of trying pre-teen offenders as
adults, praised the jury's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demagogues in the Legislature want to try 10- and
11-year-olds as adults,'' he told the panel after he read its
verdict. ``You have sent a message that the adult system is not
where these young people belong.''
</P>
<P>
   Although defense attorney Garry Cantrell urged the jury to give
the child probation, the boy's father, who is on probation himself
for a drug conviction, apparently was satisfied with his son's
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' he said, smiling as he left the courtroom. ``I
never expected probation.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was found guilty Thursday of two counts of aggravated
sexual assault and one count of injury to a child. Police said he
and two brothers, ages 7 and 8, beat the young girl with a brick
and molested her last April 9 after she followed them to a creek
bottom in West Dallas. By law, the brothers could not be charged
with a crime because they are under age 10.
</P>
<P>
   A string of prosecution witnesses, including psychologists for
the Dallas Juvenile Department and the Dallas Public Schools, had
testified that the older boy had acute behavioral problems and
would require lengthy sex offender treatment and counseling for his
anger and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster has been a special education student since he
entered the first grade in 1995, and testimony indicated that he
has an I.Q. in the 64-74 range.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roderick Snead, a psychologist with the Dallas school
district, said the boy has ``borderline intellectual functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   There was testimony that he threatened teachers and yelled at
them, disrupted classes and fought with other children.
</P>
<P>
   Cantrell called several friends of the boy's family, who
testified that he was ``normal'' and did not display aggressive or
violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, his mother concurred. On the witness stand,
she described her son as ``a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments, prosecutor Gina Savage did not request a
specific sentence, but urged the jury to assesses a punishment
``sufficient to protect Dallas County.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantrell was more impassioned in his plea. ``No matter how big a
monster you try to make (him) out to be, he is still a little
boy,'' he said. ``No matter what you say about TYC, it is a bad
thing. It is still a jail. Do not throw away the life of this
11-year-old boy.''
</P>
<P>
   After the sentence was read, Cantrell said, ``It was a good
outcome. It says that at some point he won't be treated as an adult
criminal.''

</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England raised interest rates by a quarter-point to
slow the economy so the Labor government of Prime Minister Tony
Blair could finally hit its inflation target. The repo rate, the
lowest rate at which the central bank lends money to commercial
banks, was raised to 7.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   London stock prices plunged on the news, amid fears that higher
interest rates would raise the value of the pound, making British
exports even less competitive in global markets. The elephant, by
the way, was built in 1940, has a top speed of 6 miles an hour and
is for sale for $160,000. It was being delivered to an art and
antiques fair in London.

<P>
   In the largest deal ever in the pharmaceutical industry, the
American Home Products Corp. said it would acquire the Monsanto Co.
for $34.4 billion in stock. The combined company would be the
nation's top seller of prescription drugs and a world leader in
insecticides and other agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   Its brands would include Advil painkiller, Centrum vitamins and
Nutra Sweet sugar substitute. The acquisition would allow American
Home Products to double research spending, and would also cover its
legal liabilities from two diet drugs that have been taken off the
market. &QL;

   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. agreed to pay $400 million to Orange County,
Calif., in a legal settlement that will largely close the book on
the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is by far the largest so far stemming from the
1994 Orange County bankruptcy, which created a morass of litigation
as the county sought to recover some of the more than $1.6 billion
it suffered in losses from risky investments.
</P>
<P>
   The county still has lawsuits pending against more than a dozen
Wall Street securities houses and a variety of other companies. But
Merrill Lynch was clearly the county's main target, since it was
much more heavily involved than other companies in selling risky
derivatives to the county-run investment pool.  &QL;

   Sales of new single-family homes rose 5.2 percent in April to a

its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.1 percent in April
_ the fourth consecutive monthly increase. The index has not
declined since April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, construction spending rose 0.8 percent in April, the
fifth consecutive monthly gain. Factory orders rose 1.2 percent,
the biggest increase in five months.
</P>
<P>
   On a less upbeat note, the productivity of workers continued to
grow, but more slowly. And on a downright sour note, Americans
filed nearly 342,000 personal bankruptcy petitions in the first
quarter, up 6 percent from the period a year earlier, according to
a lending industry group. &QL;

   But even before India's action, The Nation magazine raised an
interesting possibility: Is India using the arms race as a means of
bankrupting its rival? A Princeton physicist and expert on the
Pakistani nuclear program, Zia Mian, says India is much less
dependent than Pakistan on the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   According to the charges, cheap wine from another district was
added to the chateau's, wine from two vintages was blended
together, excess sugar was added to the wine to raise the alcohol
content (sacre bleu!), and wood chips were used to give some of the
chateau's wine the taste and smell of wine that had been aged in
oak barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Giscours, one of the largest estates in the Medoc, was one of

TUTU ASKS BOTHA TO GIVE AN APOLOGY, BUT IN VAIN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGE, South Africa _ There were times during Archbishop
Desmond Tutu's two days of testimony that ended Friday when the
head of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission looked weary and
times when he seemed unable to hold back sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   When a lawyer for former President P.W. Botha suggested the
commission was biased because some members believed former
government officials engineered atrocities, the archbishop looked
incredulous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you live?'' he asked. ``I live in South Africa. ``
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the questioning, lawyers for Botha tried to put the
commission on trial, though he is the one facing contempt charges
for refusing to appear before the panel. Over and over, the lawyers
disputed the open-mindedness of the commissioners and suggested
there was no need for Botha's appearance because he had answered
questions in writing. The only purpose in calling him, they said,
was to humiliate him.
</P>
<P>
   Under the relentless questioning, the archbishop insisted that
the commission was trying to be fair. It had been patient with
Botha, he said, by waiting nearly a year for his written responses
and had intervened to get the government to help with his legal
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Botha, 82, were serious, the archbishop
said, and the questions needed to be answered in a setting that
allowed follow-up questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were tortured.'' the archbishop said. ``People were
abducted. People disappeared. And that didn't happen in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   As the showdown came to an end, however, and the archbishop was
told he could step down, he hesitated. Ignoring court protocol, he
turned to Botha and asked him to apologize for the pain apartheid
had caused, even if he never intended it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to appeal to him,'' the archbishop said, ``to take this
chance provided by this court to say he may not have intended the
suffering to happen to people, he may not have given orders to
authorize anything. But if Botha was able to say that `I am sorry
that policies of my government caused you pain' _ just that, that
would be such a tremendous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When his plea was met by silence, the archbishop tried once
more. ``I appeal to him,'' he whispered.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, who has shown little emotion since the trial resumed on
Monday and has usually left the courtroom quickly, appeared
agitated by the archbishop's remarks. At one point, he seemed ready
to speak to reporters, but his daughter intervened.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, though, when a reporter called out a
question to him, he came forward and in a characteristically
defiant tone, told the assembled journalists to go read a number of
books about him, including his biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing more to say,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, who led South Africa from 1978 to 1989 during some of the
most brutal years of white minority rule, has steadfastly refused
to apologize for apartheid, saying he will answer only to God. He
has called the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up to
investigate the nation's violent past, a ``circus.''
</P>
<P>
   He is on trial for ignoring three subpoenas to testify before
the commission, which has heard evidence from former members of his
Cabinet that Botha himself order the bombing of a church building
in 1988 as well as raids against apartheid activists outside the
country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Botha has had a stroke and recent hip replacement surgery, and
to persuade him to testify voluntarily, the panel has offered to
let him appear in a closed-door hearing here in this vacation
resort near where he lives in retirement. He refused.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Tutu's testimony Friday, the trial was adjourned
for 10 days, when closing arguments are expected. If convicted,
Botha faces up to two years in prison and a fine. If Botha hoped to
avoid the spectacle of an appearance before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, he has hardly done any better in the
courts. The judge in the case, Victor Lugaju, has done little to
restrain the proceedings, giving both the prosecution and defense
wide latitude to make their cases.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution forced Botha to sit through accounts of the
bombing of the church building. It also called a bitter former
police colonel to the stand who called Botha a coward for not
acknowledging that the colonel and others were following orders
when they killed and tortured anti-apartheid activists.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing his testimony, Tutu said that even if there was
no conviction, the trial had served to make Botha accountable for
the past. ``The thing that we sought, we got in a different way,''
Tutu said.

FINANCES WORRY NEUTRINO RESEARCHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAKAYAMA, Japan _ As Japanese and American scientists basked in
the glow of their monumental discovery of neutrino mass, announced
here on Friday, a financial cloud that could hamper future research
hung over the 120-member team on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Through the team's leader, Dr. Yoji Totsuka, the scientists
appealed for the Japanese government's reconsideration of major
cuts in financing for the Kamioka Neutrino Observatory, where the
discovery of neutrino mass was made. Many of the 300 physicists
attending an international neutrino meeting here predicted
privately that the discovery could eventually be rewarded with one
or more Nobel Prizes.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has been unsympathetic, Totsuka said in an
interview. Faced with severe budget problems, he said, the
government has reduced the Kamioka group's spending by 15 percent
and threatens another 15 percent cut next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may mean shutting down the detector for up to six months,
which would have devastating effects on our research,'' Totsuka
said.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment announced on Friday demonstrated that neutrinos
created by the impact of cosmic rays on the earth's upper
atmosphere ``oscillate,'' or change from one type to another as
they reach the ground and pass through the earth. With this
discovery, the observatory demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt
that neutrinos have mass.
</P>
<P>
   That will require revision of the generally accepted theory of
the structure of matter, which is made of quarks, leptons and
force-carrying particles. Depending on how large the
still-unmeasured mass of neutrinos may be, they could prove to be a
significant proportion of the mass of the universe, perhaps
accounting for some of the ``dark matter'' that has not been seen
directly but exerts large gravitational effects.
</P>
<P>
   An American member of the Kamioka research collaboration, Dr.
James Stone of Boston University, said its big underground neutrino
detector, Super-Kamiokande, was investigating a range of major
physics problems other than the search for neutrino oscillations on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   One project explores the possibility that protons _ building
blocks of matter _ may decay. Super-Kamiokande, essentially a water
tank the size of a 10-story building deep under western Japan's
mountains near here, is also looking for an explanation of the
deficit in neutrinos detected from the sun, a problem not solved by
Friday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The detector also continuously looks for bursts of neutrinos
coming from supernova explosions and peculiar explosions called
``gamma ray bursters,'' which may be the most violent events in the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the nearest supernova in 400 years exploded in a nearby
galaxy, and at almost the same moment that the supernova appeared
as a dot of light visible from the Southern Hemisphere, a neutrino
detector in Ohio and the Kamioka observatory in Japan picked up a
strong neutrino pulse.

   The achievement marked the debut of neutrino astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Cronin of the University of Chicago, one of the Nobel
laureates at the neutrino conference here, called the cuts in
financing for the Kamioka observatory alarming and said he would
join in an appeal to the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
   Another Nobel Prize winner here, Dr. Sheldon Glashow of Harvard
University, said support for physics research was menaced in many
countries.

<P>
   ``Sweden is threatening to withdraw from CERN for financial
reasons,'' he said, ``and that could have a ripple effect reducing
the financial commitment of other European nations to the
coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   CERN, the acronym for Europe's high-energy-physics consortium,
is building what will be the world's most powerful accelerator, the
Large Hadron Collider, in a circular tunnel near Geneva. Congress
canceled an even larger accelerator that had been under
construction in Texas, but, with American scientists still hoping
to work at the cutting edge of particle research, the United States
has become a partner in building the European collider.
</P>
<P>
   Major reductions in support of CERN by European nations could
delay the new accelerator and other large programs, including those
designed to explore the question of neutrino oscillations and mass.
</P>
<P>
   One such experiment would direct an intense beam of neutrinos
from one of the CERN accelerators near Geneva through the ground
about 450 miles to a neutrino detector inside a vehicular tunnel
under the Gran Sasso Mountain in northern Italy. The idea is to see
whether any neutrinos change type during their long trip through
the earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the accidents of politics and economics help
science,'' said Dr. Barry Barish of the California Institute of
Technology, who uses a detector in the Gran Sasso tunnel. ``The
tunnel was built because local politicians persuaded the government
to appropriate a large sum for infrastructure, and there was a
problem finding something to spend it on. The tunnel proved to be a
boon for physicists who needed the mountain above it to shield
their experiments from unwanted cosmic rays.''
</P>
<P>
   American members of the Super-Kamiokande team said they planned
to send a letter to the Japanese government pleading for steady
support of the observatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``American scientists greatly benefited from the Japanese
government's generosity,'' Stone said. ``Japan paid for most of the
$100 million construction cost of Super-Kamiokande, and the United
States put up less than 10 percent, and yet American physicists
make up half the research force. We hope the Japanese government
will allow uninterrupted operation of this great scientific
instrument.'' &QL;

SUMMERTIME, AND THE DRIVING IS BREEZY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Summer is around the corner, and the forecast, thanks to El
Nino, is for a dry, sunny season _ ideal conditions for open-air
motoring.
</P>
<P>
   Some three dozen open-top car models are currently available in
the United States, at prices of $20,000 to $350,000. And while
low-end models continue to fade away for lack of interest _ the
Honda Civic del Sol and Toyota Paseo are among this year's
casualties _ fancy droptops are being added. Among these are the
Volvo C70, which goes on sale next month, and the Mercedes-Benz CLK
Cabriolet, due this fall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a rundown of the topless cars on sale this summer,
excluding a number of sport utility vehicles _ like the Chevrolet
Tracker, Isuzu Amigo, Jeep Wrangler, Kia Sportage and Suzuki Vitara
_ that also have roofs that come down or come off. Prices are for
base models; luxury and gas-guzzler taxes are not included.
</P>
<P>
   ACURA NSX-T $88,782. Mid-engine, rear drive; 2 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NSX-T is lightning-quick, thanks to its very light aluminum
body, its wind-slicing profile and its V6 engines that use Formula
One racing technology. Indeed, since it is built to Honda's
exacting standards, the NSX has been criticized for being too
perfect _ a trouble-free appliance that thinks it's a Ferrari.
Still, it is a pleasant and reliable exotic car that can be driven
every day. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASTON MARTIN DB7 Volante, $141,600. Front engine, rear drive; 4
seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The DB7's road manners cannot be faulted, and the supercharged
V8 is capable of pushing the two-ton grand touring car from zero to
60 in a mere 6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But what really separates this elite convertible from the pack
is aesthetics: the lithe swoop of the fenders, the mirror-like
paint job, the aromatic leather, the faultless walnut trim. Too bad
the DB7 costs twice as much as the rather similar Jaguar XK8. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUDI CABRIOLET $35,100. Premium, $38,800. Front engine, front
drive; 4 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its superclean styling still looks fresh, but the Cabriolet is
the last of the previous-generation cars in Audi's lineup. Because
its V6 doesn't meet stricter pollution standards, the '98 is not
available in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts or New York. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BENTLEY AZURE $339,900. Front engine, rear drive; 4 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All you really need to know about the Azure is its price. With
only 93 sold last year, you'll surely have the only one on the
block. It will get you a good table at Spago and will win you
respect from Hollywood's toughest critics: valet parking
attendants. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BMW 3-SERIES 323i, $34,700; 328i, $41,500; M3, $45,900. Front
engine, rear drive 4 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In all of its many body and drive-train configurations, the
3-Series was a benchmark when it was remade for 1992, and it
remains one of the world's most pleasurable cars for everyday
driving. Exceptionally rigid for a convertible, it handles
brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   New this year is the 6-cylinder 323i, which replaces the
4-cylinder 318i, and a convertible version of the legendary,
high-performance M3. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BMW Z3 1.9, $29,995; 2.8, $36,470. M Roadster, $42,770. Front
engine, rear drive; 2 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The M Roadster promises a high-octane fix for the Z3's
shortcomings. For while the voluptuous body grabs attention, the
car's performance hasn't matched its appearance _ especially the
wimpy, buzzy 4-cylinder 1.8. And the Z3, built in South Carolina,
lacks BMW's usual refinement. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET CAVALIER Z24 $19,910. Front engine, front drive; 4
seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A small package with reasonable accommodations for at least two
people and some luggage, the Cavalier has a family resemblance to
its big brother, the Camaro. The interior is attractive and
functional, although the hard, unsupportive seats make long trips
unpleasant. The 4-cylinder engine is adequate, and the handling is
good. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET CAMARO V6, $22,650; Z28, $27,975. Front engine, rear
drive; 4 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Camaro and its Pontiac counterpart, the Firebird,
may be living on borrowed time. The 30-year-old muscle car formula
_ raw power, reasonable price _ has lost its magic in an era of
high insurance rates and sport-utility mania. The Camaro still
performs, but it feels dated. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHEVROLET CORVETTE $44,990. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The classic nameplate was saved from General Motors' budget
cutters to be reborn as the best 'Vette ever. While some
aficionados dislike styling touches seemingly borrowed from Acura,
there is little grousing about the performance of the
345-horsepower V8 _ or about the newly accommodating interior and a
trunk that can hold golf bags. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHRYSLER SEBRING JX, $21,235; JXi, $26,500. Front engine, front
drive; 4 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America's best-selling convertible is built in Mexico and has
little in common with the Mitsubishi-built coupe of the same name.
Spacious, stylish and comfortable, the Sebring offers good value.
It also has a rarity among convertibles: a back seat big enough for
two adults. But order the JXi V6; the 4-cylinder JX is
overwhelmed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DODGE VIPER RT/10 $64,700. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only in America! No other country could produce such a bold,
aggressive, over-the-top car _ the whopping 8-liter V10 engine
produces an awesome 450 horsepower. But the performance is
American-brutal, not European-refined. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FERRARI F355 SPIDER $138,115. Front engine, rear drive; 2
seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari's V12's get the attention, but for enduring driving
pleasure it's hard to beat the smaller, lighter F355, with its V8
just in front of the rear wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Ferraris, this one requires getting used to. The manual
gearbox is balky; the cockpit is cramped for 6-footers. And judged
purely by the numbers, it performs no better than a Porsche or
Corvette. But for those hooked on the wheel's rock-solid feel and
the engine's sensual howl, there is no substitute. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORD MUSTANG $21,175; GT, $24,675; Cobra, $29,035. Front engine,
rear drive; 4 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The original pony car will be revamped next year, and it may
eventually stand alone in this shrinking market. Still, the Mustang
has enjoyed a slight resurgence in sales, and it comes in versions
from plain (3.8-liter V6) to muscular (4.6-liter V8). Each offers a
lot of performance for the price. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAGUAR XK8 $70,480. Front engine, rear drive; 4 seats.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With its lean body, ground-hugging profile and long hood, the
XK8 is, quite simply, a ravishing beauty. Inside, the sumptuous
cabin sets standards. And the 4-liter, 290-horsepower V8 is smooth
and powerful. Except for the price, what's not to like? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAMBORGHINI DIABLO ROADSTER VT $284,000. Mid-engine, all-wheel
drive; 2 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wedge silhouette, angular lines and side air intakes give
the Diablo the aggressive look of a Formula One race car, and with
a 492-horsepower V12 it nearly performs like one. Alas, with a
price so high, few will ever have the experience. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAZDA MX-5 MIATA $20,220. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first Miata revived the moribund roadster market, and its
many fans held their breath when Mazda announced a redesign.
They're breathing easier now, because the qualities that made the
car shine _ its light weight, its agility, the growl of its eager
4-cylinder engine _ have been made better.
</P>
<P>
   The styling remains simple and timeless, and there is 140
horsepower, up from 133. So nimble it feels like an extension of
the driver, the Miata may offer more fun per dollar than anything
else on the road. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MERCEDES-BENZ SLK230 $40,295. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quiet and weatherproof, with a hard top that draws a crowd when
it retracts into the trunk, the SLK pleases baby boomers nostalgic
for the SL roadsters of the 50s. The interior is packed with retro
touches like white gauges trimmed in chrome. The supercharged
4-cylinder is economical and fairly peppy, but the overall effect
is more luxurious than sporty. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MERCEDES-BENZ SL SL500, $80,495; SL600, $125,595. Front engine,
rear drive; 2 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along with the S-Class sedans, which will be replaced next year,
the SL roadsters are the last remnants of the ``old''
Mercedes-Benz: very expensive, very solid and just a bit uptight,
without the youthful feel of newer Mercedes models or the glamour
of, say, an XK8.
</P>
<P>
   Still, SLs are extremely refined, technologically advanced and
socially impressive. No wonder movie stars drive them. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE SPYDER GS, $21,850; GS-T, $27,080. Front
engine, front drive; 4 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A car long on pizazz but short on practicality, the Spyder has a
futuristic look and, with the GS-T's turbo version of the in-line
4-cylinder, spirited performance. Indeed, with so much power
running through the front wheels, the driver must pay attention to
keep the car on track. The back seat is not just tight _ it is
virtually unusable. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PLYMOUTH PROWLER $40,000. Front engine, rear drive; 2 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see and be seen, hardly anything gets more stares
than this nouveau street rod. The Prowler could scarcely be more
impractical _ there's no place to put anything _ and the
standard-issue V6 is nothing special. But the Prowler is built for
cruising, not commuting. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PONTIAC SUNFIRE SE, $19,995. Front engine, front drive; 4
seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sunfire packs the flashy styling and gutsy performance of
Pontiac's larger cars into a small, reasonably priced package.
Although it is a near-twin of the Chevy Cavalier, the Sunfire's
look is inspired by the Firebird. The ride is characteristically
Pontiac: firm, but not stiff. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PONTIAC FIREBIRD $24,830; Trans Am, $30,240. Front engine, rear
drive; 4 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like their Camaro counterparts, Pontiac's pony cars offer power
and performance at an attractive price. But the Firebird goes
further, with bold, outrageous styling. Like the Camaro, the car
has a shrinking market, and its future is uncertain. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PORSCHE BOXSTER $41,765. Mid-engine, rear drive; 2 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Boxster's proportions and bulging fenders mimic Porsches of
the past, but many of the touches _ like fan-shaped mirrors and
cat's-eye buttons _ are thoroughly modern. No speed demon, the
Boxster offers a nearly perfect balance of power and knife-sharp
handling. It is a joy to drive at any speed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PORSCHE CARRERA CABRIOLET $81,745. Rear engine, rear drive; 2
seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the other all-new 911s, the Cabriolet is a rear-engine
rocket ship that coddles occupants with luxury appointments and
electronic gadgets. Space is well used, with rear jump seats that
fold for more storage.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAAB 9-3 $37,050; SE, $42,050. Front engine, front drive; 4
seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the well-made, tight-fitting insulated top is up, it's easy
to forget you're in a convertible, and two adults can fit
reasonably well in the back. With Saab's traditional road-hugging
qualities, the 1999 9-3 is fun to drive, and the 185-horsepower
turbo-charged 4 has plenty of punch. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VOLKSWAGEN CABRIO $18,475; GLS, $22,790. Front engine, front
drive; 4 seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A perennial favorite of young women, the Cabrio remains a fun
and functional convertible _ and its back seat can actually
accommodate passengers. But they'd better travel light: A picnic
lunch is about all that will fit in the trunk. This is the last
season for the current Cabrio; it gets a makeover before next
summer.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VOLVO C70 $44,000 (estimated). Front engine, front drive; 4
seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Volvo's first convertible since 1956 goes on sale next month,
and, no, it doesn't look like a box without a top. The styling is
sleek and the appointments are elegant, but the C70 shows Volvo's
usual attention to safety, including roll bars that pop up behind
the rear headrests. The turbo 5-cylinder is spirited, but the car's
handling is uninspired.

ARGUMENTS OVER WHETHER SATELLITE COMPANIES ILLEGALLY AIDED CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top intelligence and security officials in the
Clinton administration are divided over whether two U.S. satellite
companies illegally gave space expertise to China.
</P>
<P>
   A classified report by the CIA concluded that the companies,
Loral Space and Communications and Hughes Electronics, did not
reveal information to China in 1996 that could harm national
security, government and congressional officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the intelligence arm of the State Department found just the
opposite _ that U.S. security had been jeopardized, the officials
said in disclosing the report's findings for the first time. The
State Department's damage assessment parallels the previously
reported conclusions of a Pentagon agency that is responsible for
preventing the transfer of militarily sensitive technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon agency's report in mid-May 1997, based on the work
of intelligence and rocket experts who are considered the
government's top specialists in the field, led the Justice
Department to open a criminal inquiry into Loral and Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting judgments of government intelligence and
security analysts muddy an already complicated inquiry by House and
Senate committees into accusations that China used sensitive U.S.
technology to improve the reliability of its nuclear ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the dispute underscores the significance of a
fight between the Justice Department and the Senate intelligence
committee that broke out again on Friday. In the second day of
wrangling over documents, Attorney General Janet Reno appeared on
Friday before the panel and again balked at turning over to
Congress the underlying analyses conducted by intelligence and
security agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Senate investigators said on Friday that because federal
agencies have conflicting views on the importance of Loral's
disclosure to the Chinese, they need to see the technical analysis
supporting each agency's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno renewed concerns that disclosing such details could
undercut the department's criminal inquiry. Reno promised to
reconsider this approach and get back to lawmakers within 30 days,
but Senators insisted on a speedier response, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general indicated she will reevaluate what
information she can furnish to the committee,'' Sen. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., who heads the panel, said after a three-hour closed
hearing with Reno and Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's hearing, Senate officials said Freeh provided
``significant new'' information about attempts by China to
influence the 1996 elections, but they refused to give any details.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic fund-raiser, Johnny Chung, has told investigators
that a large part of the nearly $100,000 he gave to Democratic
causes in 1996 came from the Chinese army. The money came through a
Chinese lieutenant colonel and aerospace executive whose father was
a Chinese general and a leader of the Communist Party, the
investigators say Chung told them.
</P>
<P>
   Senate officials said Freeh added new detail and texture to what
Congress had already been told.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials differ over how to comply with the
Senate's request for documents. Some officials are reluctant to
give up any potential evidence in a criminal request unless they
are heavily edited. Other officials say that senators have a
legitimate request.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet caused a stir on
Thursday when he refused to discuss with senators some information,
citing the Justice Department's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But by day's end, the Justice Department relented, and on Friday
allowed the CIA to give the panel the disputed document, a one-page
report that exonerated Loral and Hughes of hurting national
security.
</P>
<P>
   The overarching dispute focuses on what happened after a Chinese
rocket carrying a U.S. satellite blew up seconds after liftoff on
Feb. 15, 1996.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   International insurers insisted that China have an outside
review panel examine the causes of the accident. Loral headed the
industry team, which included experts from Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   The industry commission blamed the accident on an electrical
flaw in the electronic flight control system, documents show. But
the report, which was promptly shared with the Chinese, also
discussed other sensitive aspects of the rocket's guidance and
control systems.
</P>
<P>
   Loral executives have acknowledged that they failed to notify
federal officials before communicating with the Chinese, but have
insisted that no sensitive information was transferred.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department learned of the information sharing, and
asked at least three government agencies with some degree of
expertise in rocket technology or missile proliferation to review
the industry commission's report to see whether the document
revealed information that could help China improve its long-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's intelligence arm specializes in political
analyses. The CIA has experts in tracking shipments of missiles and
missile components, and some specialists in missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's main repository for technical rocketry is
the Pentagon's Defense Technology Security Administration, which
can tap into the vast technological resources of the branches of
the military, especially the Air Force.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One administration official said the Pentagon's review carried
the most weight, and that the other agencies were consulted to
ensure no information ``was accidentally overlooked.''

   Men's final features all-Spanish flavor
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ It will be Spaniard vs. Spaniard, good guy vs. good guy and
amigo vs. amigo in the French Open men's final Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The match between Carlos Moya and Alex Corretja will sorely lack
variety, not to mention drama-inducing antipathy, but it figures to
compensate with a furious outpouring of hugs, handshakes and
all-around warm fuzzies.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the late '60s, when the hail-fellow-well-met,
all-for-one-and-one-for-all Australians dominated Roland Garros,
has there been more mutual respect, closeness and affection between
the two combatants for tennis' most important clay-court prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is wonderful,'' Corretja said Friday after he made toast
of the toast of Paris, Frenchman Cedric Pioline, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
``Maybe we will have dinner together before. Carlos and I will be
friends if I win, or if he wins. We will find our game on the
court, but then we should make a big party together afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not normal.''
</P>
<P>
   But not abnormal, either. Four years ago, Spaniards Sergi
Bruguera and Alberto Berasategui met for the French title,
announcing to the world that Spain would have to be reckoned with
in Paris, and maybe elsewhere, in years to come. There's no arguing
for now which nation rules the terre battue.
</P>
<P>
   And half of today's women's final is also Spanish. Twice
champion Arantxa Sanchez Vicario plays thrice champion Monica
Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Moya, seeded 12th to Corretja's 14th, overcame countryman Felix
Mantilla's strong start to claim the first men's semi 5-7, 6-2,
6-4, 6-2. But if they held a playoff for third place, it's likely
Mantilla would make short work of Pioline, the 28-year-old from
nearby Neuilly-sur-Seine who, despite a largely underwhelming
career, has been a runner-up at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold this tournament here, in France,'' Pioline said, ``but
the Spanish are the best on clay. They are born and bred on it, and
you see the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Unseeded and outnumbered three to one in the semifinals by the
Iberian invasion, Pioline had battled through three five-set
matches en route to his encounter with the light-footed Corretja,
leaving him with dead legs and a weary brain. He wanted to defend
the national honor _ a standing-room-only crowd surrounded Court
Central to watch him try _ but he was unable to mount another
inspirational fight.
</P>
<P>
   He got ahead of Corretja in six of the Spaniard's service games
in a row and reached break point five times during one stretch yet
failed to convert any of them. Despite hitting just 43 percent of
his first serves, Corretja won 76 percent of his first-serve points
and never was broken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't fast enough today to upset Alex,'' Pioline said. ``He
really played very, very well. I wanted very bad to go to the
final, but I didn't have enough left in me. When you're tired,
you're not as focused and you make bad decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've lost, you can always say `if, if, if.' I had my
chances. It's true, I suppose, that I could probably work on
improving my fitness.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15th-seeded Mantilla, who had dropped only two sets in five
previous rounds, had no reason to be fatigued, yet his focus and
shot selection also went into a steep decline as the match wore on
and he wore down.
</P>
<P>
   Mantilla had won five tournaments in 1997 to establish himself
as a player to be taken seriously, but he had slumped this year
before his timely run at Roland Garros. And until the middle of the
third set against Moya, you had to believe his chances of reaching
his first Grand Slam final remained at least 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, nothing. He lost his touch, his serve and
perhaps his nerve.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-1 lead evaporated in a few short minutes as Moya reeled off
seven games in a row, breaking twice at love, for a 2-1 set
advantage, and breaking again to start the fourth set. Another
break in the seventh game left Mantilla in the dirt, and Moya
secured the victory by rallying from a jitters-induced 15-40
deficit in the final game.
</P>
<P>
   Moya, 21, had been a surprise as a finalist in the Australian
Open against Pete Sampras in 1997. Here, he was far less of a
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to lose in the final again,'' he said. ``I want
to be the winner, no matter who I play.''
</P>
<P>
   He easily defeated Corretja in the Monte Carlo quarterfinals in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I came here, I said I had good feelings, good
vibrations,'' Moya said. ``I don't say that if I don't feel it. I
don't fake.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked how he might react to facing Corretja again, with
far greater stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get on the court, you fight like crazy,'' Moya said.
``You run; you do everything; you try to step on him if necessary.
But it is always difficult to play against a friend. We know each
other so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Since neither player has won a major, the 39th different Slam
champion of the Open era will be crowned Sunday _ and the fifth
Spaniard. Bruguera had ended Spain's 21-year drought by winning
back-to-back at Roland Garros in 1993-94. France's only winner of a
major during the Open era, meanwhile, has been Yannick Noah here in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Noah was also the lone net-rushing player to have prevailed
since the golden age of the Aussies.
</P>
<P>
   Presumed to be a bygone age until now.

UNDERCOVER ANTI-DRUG OPERATION STRAINS U.S. TIES WITH MEXICO  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A flap over an undercover money-laundering
operation by American customs agents has escalated into a
full-scale diplomatic altercation that has strained the close ties
between the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The feud took a new turn Friday with the publication here of a
letter from Sen. Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to
President Ernesto Zedillo. In the May 26 letter the senator
expressed his ``deep disappointment'' over recent comments by
Zedillo that the operation violated Mexican law and sovereignty as
well as several bilateral cooperation agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he was ``astonished'' by Zedillo's criticisms, which
he said added to a string of ``broken promises'' by Mexico in the
fight against international narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Top Mexican officials were infuriated by the letter. Jesus Reyes
Heroles, Mexico's ambassador in Washington, blasted back on May 29
with a five-page response defending Mexico's anti-drug record and
renewing the attack on the undercover operation, which was
code-named Casablanca. That letter was also released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between the two countries flared last February after
Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, a top-ranking army officer who was in
charge of Mexico's anti-drug program, was arrested on charges that
he collaborated with the most powerful drug trafficker. Americans
officials were appalled to discover that drug organizations had
infiltrated Mexican justice at such high levels. A stormy debate in
Washington forced the Clinton administration to postpone its annual
assessment of Mexico's narcotics enforcement progress.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, Mexico is driving the dispute. The last
time Mexico objected this bitterly to an American action was in
1990, when American agents seized a Mexican medical doctor in
Mexico and took him to the United States to stand trial in the
killing of an American anti-drug agent. The doctor, Humberto
Alvarez Machain, was later freed by an American court.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people, including some 30 Mexican and Venezuelan
bankers, and three large Mexican banks have been charged with
laundering more than $110 million in narcotics proceeds as a result
of the three-year undercover operation by the U.S. Customs Service.
U.S. officials called it the most successful operation of its type
ever undertaken by American law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexican officials were embarrassed by the operation, which
seems to have exposed much more extensive money-laundering through
Mexican banks than they had acknowledged. It also deepened popular
suspicion in Mexico about the financial system at a time when
Zedillo is trying to push major banking reforms through a skeptical
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   American officials did not inform Mexico about the operation
while it was under way in order, they said, to protect undercover
agents and secret informants. The agents had a number of meetings
with suspects in Mexico and, through a front company based in Los
Angeles, relayed orders to Mexican bankers from Colombian drug
lords.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in May, Zedillo called the operation ``inadmissible
because it tramples on our laws.'' Mexico has said that it will
demand the extradition for trial here of American customs agents
who held meetings in Mexico as part of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Lott wrote: ``Mr. President, this is not `inadmissible' or a
`violation' of your sovereignty. It is a decisive action against
ruthless criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Reyes Heroles called Operation Casablanca ``an act of
a criminal nature similar to the crimes it was supposed to
uncover.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week President Clinton called Zedillo to explain why
American law enforcement decided to leave Mexican authorities in
the dark. But Mexican officials have dismissed the American
statements as inadequate.

   New WTA head &QL; 
relishes challenge
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PARIS _ He had sought, and found, a slower track in rural Oregon,
near Bend. His wife would run the family horse farm. He would teach
a law class and play the role of gentleman rancher.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City, fast-lane educated at Princeton and
Columbia and an 18-year veteran of the Washington, D.C., legal
whirl, Bartlett H. McGuire was ready, he thought, for a simple
regimen. He wanted to be where he could be just Bart, leading a
life of mainly leisure while pursuing his passions, squash and
tennis prominent among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they say,'' he noted, ``even if you win the rat race,
you're still a rat.''
</P>
<P>
   But guess who's back running with the rodents.
</P>
<P>
   In January, after an exhausting yearlong search for a CEO
resulted in the hiring of a guy who quit about 10 minutes after he
saw what he had gotten into, the Women's Tennis Association turned
its bloodshot eyes to McGuire, the WTA's legal consultant for the
previous decade. He decided it was his obligation to step into the
breach and help _ my words, not his _ save the organization from
itself. McGuire, who stands guilty of being noble or dumb, bid his
pastoral environs adieu and agreed to a two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, Bend. Hello, Stamford, Conn. Goodbye, horses. Hello,
rats.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire an able diplomat
</P>
<P>
   Tough job, this. The WTA has more warring factions than the
Balkans. Anne Person Worcester, the last boss, fought the good
fight for four years but left to have a baby, figuring childbirth
would be infinitely less painful.
</P>
<P>
   Why did it take a year to hook a replacement? Because a
unanimous vote by the board of directors was required, and roughly
half the board members wanted the post. Rick Carson of the PGA Tour
finally was chosen in a hard-won compromise, but once he got a look
at the morass, he quickly fled back to the safety of men's golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``An embarrassing situation,'' McGuire called it. ``I really
felt sorry for women's tennis because the product itself was
potentially so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its governing body being in near chaos, hamstrung by
conflicting interests, self-serving directors and no shortage of
petulant players screaming, ``Me! Me! Me!''
</P>
<P>
   But when McGuire took charge, he did so with his eyes open. He
accepted the posting on his terms, and he made everyone aware of
those terms. It would be his way or the highway _ for him. But to
date, things have gone swimmingly. He says the WTA, not
International Management Group or anybody else, is running women's
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   And he insists he's having ``a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be a wonderful time to be in charge of the women's
game. In terms of depth of talent and marquee names, the Corel WTA
Tour never has been stronger. Monica Seles' comeback, certified as
official by her appearance in today's French Open final, plus the
promise of Steffi Graf's return for a last hurrah in combination
with the emergence of the marketable Williams sisters as rivals for
Martina Hingis makes for acres of high cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates Houston tour stop
</P>
<P>
   Assuming nobody screws it up.
</P>
<P>
   That's his primary role _ not to let that happen. Secondly, he
said, he must ``make sure the quality of the game is reflected in
the marketplace.'' In his spare time, he will try to grow the tour.
That doesn't necessarily mean adding tournaments, alas, given
Houston's unfortunate lack of same. Rather, he intends to enhance
the visibility, and thus profitability, of what the WTA has going.
</P>
<P>
   Toward this end, McGuire formed a partnership with Arnon
Milchan's Regency Enterprises, producer of such films as L.A.
Confidential, City of Angels and Pretty Woman.
</P>
<P>
   Regency's mission is to package the WTA's Tier I and Tier II
events for distribution and sale to as many TV networks and
stations as can be reeled in worldwide. Completed is a deal with
Eurosport, which has signed on to televise the tour's European
events.
</P>
<P>
   Because the product is, as McGuire brags, a primo one, Milchan's
task shouldn't be difficult. The men's game would kill to be as
well-positioned.
</P>
<P>
   But, uh, about Houston, Mr. CEO aren't we America's largest city
lacking a women's tennis presence? And isn't Houston where Gladys
Heldman founded what became the women's tour?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Houston,'' McGuire said. ``I've spent a lot of time
there (he was a Compaq consultant for years), and I recognize the
importance of the market economically and historically.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we tend to be more concerned about having too many
tournaments rather than too few, they do come up for sale on a
regular basis. I would hope that Houston interests would step
forward and make themselves known. I'd definitely like for us to
return to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, come on down, Bart. We have all the hustle and bustle a
man can stand.

CLINTON URGES `TECHNOLOGY LITERACY' FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLERS 
 (ATTN.: N.J.)
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Mass. _ President Clinton called on states Friday to
impose a ``technology literacy'' requirement on all children in
middle school, declaring that ``students should feel as comfortable
with a keyboard as a chalkboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Congress squared off with him Friday over the spending
programs he proposed this year, Clinton said that he would seek
$180 million in next year's budget to train teachers in states that
adopt such a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't let a child graduate from middle school anymore
without knowing how to use new technologies to learn,'' he said, in
a graduation address at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   In a 26-minute speech as sunny and breezy as the day, Clinton
assured the graduates that they were living in ``a period of
renewal.'' He dwelled on the wonders of the information age, a
favorite topic for the president though he seldom uses a computer
himself and confessed to the graduates Friday that he was
``scientifically challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was vague about the nature of the proposed
middle school requirement. Joseph Lockhart, a White House
spokesman, said that the states would set their own standards but
that Clinton expected them to include such skills as knowing how to
communicate by computer using ``appropriate Internet etiquette''
and knowing how to use a spread sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Ten states already test technological skills, mostly among high
school students. Under the federal program Clinton proposed, the
government would provide financing for three years to help train
teams of teachers to train others.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Clinton arrived here to open the Thoreau
Institute at Walden Woods, a project of Don Henley, the former
drummer for the Eagles rock group who is a friend of the president.
The institute is intended to spread the work of Henry David
Thoreau, who built a cabin in the woods by the pond here to ponder
nature and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   As he recalled Thoreau's goal of living ``deeply and
deliberately,'' Clinton mused over the short walk he and Hillary
Rodham Clinton had taken before the ceremony. He provided a rare
glimpse of his view of the peculiar life in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back when we had real lives, we used to walk in the woods a
lot,'' he said. ``And so to be able to come here and only be able
to walk 200 yards so that our friends with the cameras could at
least get a good picture so the American people could get a real
feel for the magnificent work that's been done here _ it winds up
almost being more real to them than it is to us sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Before coming here, Clinton stopped for lunch at the home of
Rep. Joseph Kennedy II, on the 30th anniversary of the
assassination of his father, Robert F. Kennedy. Clinton visited the
house with Robert Kennedy's widow, Ethel, and other Kennedy
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   On its flight to Boston this morning with the president aboard,
Air Force One disappeared twice for a total of 56 seconds from the
Gibbsboro, N.J., radar of the Federal Aviation Administration. The
same radar briefly lost track of Air Force One on March 10, again
when Clinton was aboard. The aviation agency said it was
investigating.

STUDY SUGGESTS COMPETITION BENEFITS RELIGION
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN.: Tenn., Ala., Texas, Neb., N.D.)  (ja) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In American life, competition is widely regarded as
an almost unmitigated boon to the public good, producing great
feats of athleticism in organized sports and spurring creativity,
efficiency and consumer choice among businesses. In politics,
competition among candidates is considered vital to promoting a
full discussion of public issues.
</P>
<P>
   But can competition's benefits for sports, business and
government be similarly realized in organized religion?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, replies Rodney Stark, a professor of sociology and
comparative religion at the University of Washington, who recently
published the results of a study making that case. Among Stark's
findings was that the areas of the country that had recently
produced the highest number of Roman Catholic priests, seminarians
and conversions, relative to the size of the Catholic population,
were also areas where Catholics were a small minority.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, Stark says, that the ``less Catholic'' an area _ or,
put another way, the greater the competition there from other
religions and denominations _ the more commitment and innovation on
the part of the local diocese.
</P>
<P>
   Stark's findings resulted from his analysis of statistics from
recent editions of the Official Catholic Directory, an annual
compendium of information from Catholic dioceses in the United
States. The highest number of ordinations per 100,000 Catholics in
1994-95, he reported, took place in Knoxville, Tenn., a diocese
within whose boundaries Catholics are just 2 percent of the total
population. After Knoxville, he found, the leading dioceses for
ordinations relative to the Catholic population were Mobile, Ala.;
Amarillo, Texas; Lincoln, Neb., and Fargo, N.D., whose Catholic
populations ranged from about 3 percent to 25 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Stark said, the smallest number of ordinations as a
proportion of the Catholic population were in some Northeastern
dioceses where Catholics were a majority or a near-majority.
</P>
<P>
   Stark's finding that competition enhances commitment and
innovation in Catholic dioceses (he cites broadly similar results
concerning the use made of deacons and nuns in diocesan work)
appeared in the March issue of a journal called The Review of
Religious Research. Among those that have noted the article are the
Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown
University, which tracks trends within the church and publishes a
quarterly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Stark said his basic point was
reinforced by sociological studies showing that, for example, per
capita giving to Jewish organizations is highest among Jews who
live outside major Jewish population centers, and giving to
churches is often inversely proportional to the presence of those
churches' denominations within a particular community.
</P>
<P>
   This, he added, runs counter to the ``popular wisdom'' that a
religion or denomination does best where it is clearly dominant.
</P>
<P>
   In the conclusion to his article, Stark wrote, ``In the nation
as a whole, the Roman Catholic Church always has been a minority
faith forced to compete vigorously to hold its own _ which it has
proved very adept at doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some officials at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
said they had seen summaries of Stark's study. One of them, the
Rev. Timothy Reker, while noting that competition was ``not exactly
a high Gospel value,'' said Stark had identified a factor in how
people's religious identities are shaped.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other Catholic officials are keenly interested in
what other factors work to encourage men to consider the
priesthood, a particularly pressing issue at a time when American
dioceses are confronting a growing shortage of priests.
</P>
<P>
   Reker, executive director of the conference's Office of
Vocations and Priestly Formation, recently conducted two nationwide
surveys, among parish pastors and among priests ordained within the
last 15 years. The surveys, which will be released to the bishops
later this month in a report titled ``The Parish Background Behind
Priestly Vocations,'' singled out parishes that had produced three
or more priests in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft summary of the report, those parishes,
measured against parishes that had produced no ordinations in the
same period, were more likely to have two or more priests on duty,
maintain a Catholic elementary school and sponsor youth groups.
</P>
<P>
   The visible presence of priests is particularly important, Reker
said. For young men ``to imagine themselves as priests,'' he said,
``they have to see priests and interact with them.''

A STIFF BATTLE STANDS BETWEEN REAL QUIET AND RARE SWEEP

<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ For a second consecutive year, only the Belmont
Stakes stands between trainer Bob Baffert and Triple Crown history.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet goes into today's mile-and-a-half classic at Belmont
Park as a heavy favorite to become the first 3-year-old in two
decades to pull off the rare sweep. His stablemate, Silver Charm,
nearly accomplished the feat a year ago but couldn't hold off Touch

being made. A similar crowd is expected today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to disappoint the people this time,'' Baffert
promised.
</P>
<P>
   But Real Quiet isn't scaring away any competition. Twelve horses
are entered to face him, including his nemesis Victory Gallop, the
second-place finisher in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont Stakes is scheduled to be televised live on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   If Real Quiet wins today, owner Mike Pegram will be rewarded
with much more than a trophy and a place in history. VISA, as
sponsor of the Triple Crown Challenge, will pay him $5 million for
a sweep, and the winner's share of the Belmont is another $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Victory Gallop, Real Quiet's primary rivals appear to
be Classic Cat, who finished third in the Preakness; and fresh
horses Raffie's Majesty and Limit Out, who are based in New York
and didn't compete in the Derby or the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   The stage is set for a rematch worthy of the hype. Real Quiet
and jockey Kent Desormeaux won the Derby by a diminishing
half-length over Victory Gallop. In the Preakness Stakes, Real
Quiet whipped Victory Gallop by 2 1/4-lengths.
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert isn't taking anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Victory Gallop is a very, very good horse,'' he said. ``So
far, it's been like Affirmed and Alydar. Hopefully, it'll be the
same way (today). There's very little margin for error, though. If
we get in a tight jam, Victory Gallop can upset us.''
</P>
<P>
   Alydar, who chased Affirmed throughout the 1978 Triple Crown in
the sport's greatest rivalry, is the only horse to finish second in
all three races.
</P>
<P>
   The improbable Real Quiet, purchased as a yearling for only
$17,000 because of his crooked legs and angular frame, also will be
racing against history. Thirteen horses including Silver Charm have
won the first two legs of the Triple Crown only to lose the
Belmont, most of them falling victim to the fatigue of the
demanding five-week series.
</P>
<P>
   After his strong performance in the Preakness on a hot and humid
afternoon, Real Quiet was feeling the effects, too. In fact, the
colt was so knocked out Baffert elected to give him a week off, a
risky move for a trainer planning to run in the Belmont only three
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That came from my days as a quarter-horse trainer,'' Baffert
said. ``When you wanted to pick a horse's head up, you just walked
him around the barn for a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   The vacation time seemed to do the trick. Real Quiet bounced
back to life and quickly regained the weight he lost in the
Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   And he seems to have lost none of his aggressiveness or
enthusiasm, Baffert said. One positive sign: Real Quiet was
fighting exercise rider Larry Demore to such an extent in a routine
gallop yesterday morning that Demore developed a cramp in his left
hand from pulling on the reins.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Baffert thought Silver Charm could win, but he knew
he was pushing the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert had to work Silver Charm harder than he had ever trained
a horse to get him ready for the Santa Anita Derby and the Kentucky
Derby, because the colt was both lazy and behind schedule because
of an illness. On top of that, the Preakness was a ``blood and
guts'' race for Silver Charm, Baffert said, and took even more out
of him.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, Baffert looks at Real Quiet _ the colt he
once nicknamed ``The Fish'' because of his narrow body _ and sees a
horse who he believes is ready to forge a name in the Triple Crown
history books alongside Citation, Secretariat, Seattle Slew and
Affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes the Big Apple,'' Baffert said. ``He's got that ...
look. The energy level is there.''

COMMENTARY: FATHER GAVE TRIPLES NAMES THAT STILL CLICK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mendez triplets from Woodside, Queens, are camera
shy. This is unfortunate, because their father loves photography.
It is also too bad, because their names have a certain quality that
courts exposure. In fact, although they just graduated from college
Friday, their names are already in lights and on billboards
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   And on a few million cameras, too.
</P>
<P>
   They are their own camera club: Konica, Leica and Minolta
Mendez.
</P>
<P>
   Before they were born 20 years ago in the Philippines, their
father, Manuel, so liked a fine German camera that he picked the
name Leica for a daughter. When triplets arrived, he added Konica
and Minolta to the mix. Nikon was a brief contender, but grandma
nixed it. You wonder what would have happened if he had liked, say,
the Three Stooges or three-card monte.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little easier for them to live in Queens, where their
German, Japanese and Spanish names are just a few more exotic
monikers in the melting pot. At least they're not saddled with the
expectations placed on two brothers who were named Winner and
Loser, according to a police officer who swore he worked with them
in upper Manhattan years ago. Imagine, forever knowing which one
mom liked best.
</P>
<P>
   The Mendez sisters suffer no such envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought we were special because we were triplets,'' Leica
said. ``It's like a double joy to have triplets, so he named us
after something he liked.''
</P>
<P>
   The triplets said they were living in Bahrain when they first
got an inkling their names were different. Their father had moved
the family there to take a job in graphic design. They were about
10 years old when they were given what was otherwise a routine
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``In school, we were asked what the meanings of our names
were,'' Leica said. ``We were named after products. That annoyed me
a bit because I couldn't go up in front of the class and talk about
what my name meant.''
</P>
<P>
   The sisters got used to the reaction, which in some cases was
quizzical, but not for the expected reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was that everybody knew what Konica and Minolta
was, but not Leica,'' said Leica, she of the high end name. ``I
used to be bothered by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sisters nodded, then they broke into one another's sentences
like in a tag-team interview. ``In the Philippines,'' Minolta said,
``I had more renown as a photocopier.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a different reaction when they moved to Woodside a few
years ago and enrolled in Queensborough Community College. In a
consumer society, people know from brands. Konica and Leica, fine
arts majors, had to put up with incessant cracks from classmates
who wanted to know if they were into photography.
</P>
<P>
   Said Leica: ``I hate cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   Minolta became a business and marketing major, naturally, since
she had been pitching a product since birth. But brand recognition
often led some teachers to assume she was Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``My economics professor, the first time he heard my name, he
didn't stop talking about the Japanese economy,'' Minolta said.
``When we talked about the economy of Japan, they always talked
about products like Minolta cameras. It's funny, but my sales and
marketing teacher never mentioned anything to me about my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Among themselves, they call one another Koni and Mini, although
Leica is short enough to require no nickname. All in all, the
sisters said their names had given them the advantage of making an
unforgettable impression on whomever they met.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool,'' Minolta said. ``People say if they have triplets
they would name them after products like Mercury, Ford and some
other car.''
</P>
<P>
   But there have been those times when they longed for something
just a little plainer. Konica is partial to Marie or Claire.
Minolta was keen on Mary for a while. That just might be what they
call their children someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal names,'' Leica insisted. ``They're not going to go
through having some weird names.''
</P>
<P>
   When the sisters graduated Friday, many shutterbugs in the
audience toted their namesakes. Their father, however, did not,
since he replaced the Leica that inspired his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``He uses a Contax now,'' said Leica, who wants to go into
advertising after finishing college. ``They say it's better than a
Leica.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, she displayed the kind of brand loyalty that will
serve her well when she starts her advertising career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give Leica a kick in the butt, for lagging behind,''
she said. ``What's up with that? Keep up your reputation.''

EDITORIAL: THE PRESIDENT AS DEFENSE LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 6:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court made a disappointing call this week in
rejecting independent counsel Kenneth Starr's request for immediate
high court review of the Clinton administration's expansive and
dilatory privilege claims.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing the traditional appellate process is not a step to be
taken lightly. But Starr was right about the serious nature of his
inquiry and the nation's strong interest in a prompt resolution.
</P>
<P>
   It is fair to say that Starr moved too slowly in the earlier
part of his investigation. But he seems to be trying hard now to
bring matters to a conclusion. An uncooperative White House keeps
getting in the way. Now, so has the Supreme Court. But at least the
justices advised the lower appellate court to ``proceed
expeditiously,'' which it did Friday, scheduling oral arguments for
the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Almost lost in all the legal maneuvering over executive
privilege, attorney-client privilege and the administration's
invention of a new Secret Service privilege is the odd definition
of presidential leadership that gave rise to the Lewinsky
investigation in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, President Clinton has responded to the
swirling questions about possible criminal conduct _ including
lying under oath, tampering with witnesses and suborning perjury _
as if he were a typical suspect rather than the nation's most
important political leader. His approach to inquiries about his
contacts with Monica Lewinsky, or his financial dealings in
Whitewater, for that matter, has been to emphasize the personal
rights that allow him to resist the authorities. He has opted for
litigating every issue rather than clearing them up, and savaged
the prosecutor as if he did not head the department that sought his
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is surely within Clinton's legal rights as a
citizen, but it is not conduct that fits any useful definition of
presidential leadership or any reasonable plan for crafting an
admirable political legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Compare Clinton's behavior with the statesmanlike response of
President Jimmy Carter in 1979, when he was the subject of a
criminal investigation involving bank loans and his peanut
warehouse business. Paul Curran, the special counsel who conducted
that inquiry, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that he was able to
wrap up his work in just seven months, thanks in large measure to
Carter's full cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest choices now facing Starr is whether to compel
the reluctant Clinton to testify under oath. But it should not come
down to that. Other than Ms. Lewinsky, no one is in a better
position to help resolve what really happened than Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It should not take a subpoena to get him to step forward as a
teller of truth and as a national leader ready to shift the country
to new concerns.

SAM YORTY, 88, CONTROVERSIAL EX-MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Neb.)  (bl)  
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES, June 5 _ Samuel W. Yorty, the blunt-talking,
self-promoting mayor of Los Angeles who took credit for building up
the city yet deflected his office's responsibility for the Watts
riots in the 1960s, died Friday. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Yorty had suffered a stroke May 24, and two days ago to be
released from a hospital. He died at his hilltop home in Studio
City.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Nebraska, Yorty also served two terms in Congress, but
became a national figure because of his highly public tenure in Los
Angeles from 1961 to 1973 and for his unabashed, contrary ways.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described ``maverick mayor'' began his career as a
liberal Democrat and ended it as a conservative Republican. He was
elected mayor despite alienating his party by supporting Richard M.
Nixon, not John F. Kennedy, for president in 1960. He was called
``Travelin' Sam'' for seemingly spending as much time away from Los
Angeles as within the city's expanding sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam did what was unexpected,'' said Joy Picus, a long-time
civic leader. ``Sam did what would get him attention.''
</P>
<P>
   He presided over a city that was moving from Midwestern outpost
to gateway to the Pacific Rim. In the 1960 census, the year before
Yorty first took office, Los Angeles was still the most Protestant,
the most white and the most native-born of America's biggest
cities. Indeed, Yorty might have been better suited to be the mayor
of Los Angeles in the 1940s or the early '50s, said Kevin Starr,
the state librarian of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. had become a new city,'' Starr said. ``In movie terms, he
began his career in `Chinatown,' came to political strength during
`L.A. Confidential' and he was mayor during ``Dragnet.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fitting description for a man who was one of the first local
politicians to recognize the power of the camera. He appeared on
television as often as he could, and at one point he was better
known for appearing on the ``Tonight Show'' while playing the banjo
with Johnny Carson, another Nebraska native, on drums.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he hosted ``The Sam Yorty Show,'' and when it was
canceled he complained, ``They replaced my show with `Hee Haw!' ''
After he was defeated and left office in 1973, he had to settle for
being heard, not seen, and landed a job hosting a local radio
call-in show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Yorty's mayoralty,'' Mike Davis, a historian and author of
``City of Quartz'' (Verso, 1990), ``was the transition from a WASP
majority to the multicultural Los Angeles of Tom Bradley. Yorty's
death is symbolic of the passing of that whole period of L.A.
history when Midwesterns dominated the city and its culture.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1920s, so many Iowans settled in Los Angeles, that some
people called the city ``Iowa by the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel William Yorty had migrated from another Midwestern state,
Nebraska. He was born on Oct. 1, 1909, in Lincoln to Frank and
Johanna Yorty, who traced their roots and their hearts to Ireland.
Yorty grew up in Nebraska's capital, where his father, a former
farmer, ran a restaurant among other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Yorty's political heroes were William Jennings Bryan
and Woodrow Wilson. After graduating from high school, Yorty moved
to Los Angeles and began taking classes at Southwestern University
and the University of California, eventually earning a law degree. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He entered politics in the 1930s and, according to the book
``Los Angeles A to Z'' by Leonard Pitt and Dale Pitt (University of
California Press, 1997) ``initially a left-winger, he moved
steadily to the right and became a staunch supporter of the House
Un-American Activities Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   All told he ran for office 20 times, including unsuccessful bids
for governor, the U.S. Senate and the White House. In addition to
his three four-year terms as mayor, he served in the state
legislature, the city council and two terms in Congress in the
early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the year before he was elected mayor, Yorty shocked his
fellow Democrats by not endorsing the party's shining star, John F.
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a great mayor,'' said Harriet Weider, a former
aide to Yorty. ``But he was a contrarian and I think some of his
problems he brought on himself by his feisty independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Yorty reduced city property taxes and backed the building of
freeways, the Los Angeles Zoo, the Music Center, the convention
center and other projects. Yet his mayoralty was badly scarred by
the 1965 Watts riots, which left 34 people dead and hundreds
injured. When the flames were finally put out, Federal officials
blamed Yorty for not cooperating with their efforts to avoid
trouble and uprisings in America's inner cities. Yorty was sharply
critical of the federal government's anti-poverty programs.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1969 elections, Yorty was alienated from the black
community that had helped elect him before and he used race and
charges of left-wing influences to beat back the challenge of a
black city councilman, Tom Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to view Sam Yorty as a metaphor, more than an
individual,'' said Gerald Horne, a historian and author of ``Fire
This Time,'' (University Press of Virginia, 1995) a book about the
Watts riots. ``You have to view as a metaphor because he was not
alone in his shift to the right. This was part of a massive shift
that was taking place in U.S. politics.'' After an unsuccessful
stab at the 1972 presidential campaign, Yorty was defeated the
following year by Bradley, who would become Los Angeles'
longest-serving mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Yorty's political fortunes dropped, he remained
infamously quotable. In the 1980s he startled a Chamber of Commerce
luncheon by saying that ``the black people are really racist. They
vote for black people because they are black.''
</P>
<P>
   His success or failure in shaping Los Angeles remains a debate
for city historians, but it is widely agreed that his two loves
were running for office and having an audience.
</P>
<P>
   As he told the journalist Ed Ainsworth, who wrote a biography of
Yorty, ``Maverick Mayor:'' ``I would rather gave a speech than
eat.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yorty is survived by his wife, Valerie King Yorty, and two
granddaughters.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100. WASHINGTON, June 5
-- The following chart shows how senators and house representatives
voted on key bills and amendments this week. A ``Y'' means the
member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted
against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a
``P'' means the member voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: DISABILITY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 410-1, a measure that would allow
people receiving disability benefits to obtain Social Security
vouchers that could be used at job-placement, rehabilitation and
job-training centers. The measure also would extend coverage
available to disabled people returning to the work force from four
years to six. The measure was passed without debate. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: PRAYER
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 224-203, a constitutional
amendment that would have permitted prayer and religious displays
in public buildings, including schools. The amendment, which gained
a simple majority of votes but fell short of the two-thirds
majority required to pass, marks the first time in 27 years the
House has voted on school prayer. Supporters said the amendment
would restore the right to express religion in public places.
Opponents said the amendment was unnecessary because the 1st
Amendment already protects religious freedom. A ``yes'' vote favors
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: AGRICULTRE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 364-50, a bill to provide $1.9
billion for agricultural research, crop insurance and food stamps.
The bill includes $818 million in food stamp funding for certain
legal immigrants, which was challenged last month by the Republican
leadership. Supporters cited the importance of farmers' interests
and the restoration of benefits for legal immigrants. Opponents did
not want to reinstate food stamps to legal immigrants. A ``yes''
vote favors the bill.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 6:
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner virtually
threatened to move his team out of New York City this week, but his
intemperate words must not be allowed to chill a robust public
debate about whether and where to build new baseball stadiums and
how to finance them. ``I do not want to move the Yankees from New
York, but I must warn: He is bringing us dangerously close,''
Steinbrenner said in a formal statement.
</P>
<P>
   The ``he'' Steinbrenner wrongly castigated is Peter Vallone, the
City Council speaker and Democratic gubernatorial aspirant, who has
proposed a referendum on whether to spend public money for a new
stadium in Manhattan. While we part company with Vallone on his
referendum, urging taxpayers to examine these issues is a vital
part of his job description. Steinbrenner has no business trying to
intimidate him into silence.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Vallone and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have allowed their
differences on stadium issues to hobble negotiations on the city's
proposed $34 billion budget. The budget stalemate has its roots not
in the traditional give-and-take of city finances but in the
stubbornness of the mayor and the speaker. Most independent
analysts see the two sides as being closer than they sound. But on
Friday the mayor called the Vallone budget ``a joke,'' and Vallone
has complained that the mayor refused to negotiate because of the
Yankee Stadium fight.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani and Vallone could agree on a budget in the hard
times, it should be all the easier to shave a little here and add a
little there with a $2 billion surplus. There is more than enough
money in a $34 billion plan to pay down the debt and still make
room for longer library hours, expanded recycling, after-school
activities and other needed programs. But now that the Council has
adopted its own budget, the city is in unfamiliar territory where
the process and outcome are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Few ballparks in America are as steeped in history as Yankee
Stadium in the Bronx. We hope the Yankees continue to play in this
storied venue, in either a renovated or a new stadium. If that is
not the outcome of Steinbrenner's deliberations, there will be time
enough to weigh other sites in the Bronx and Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the referendum Vallone desires is unlikely to
enhance public discourse. Referendums are very blunt instruments.
More often than not _ witness California _ they turn nuanced issues
into bumper-sticker slogans. They relieve politicians of their
responsibility to lead. Referendum results often hamstring
government's ability to pursue effective policies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vallone is right to raise the issue of public financing.
Almost monthly there are encouraging signs that stadiums can be
financed entirely or primarily by the private sector. The Green Bay
Packers recently turned to their football fans nationwide and
raised more than $24 million for capital improvements through the
sale of $200 shares that cannot be traded and bear no dividend.
This week the Cleveland Indians raised $60 million by offering
publicly traded stock. The universe of private financing options is
a lot wider than Steinbrenner and the other lords of baseball let
on.

REAL QUIET RUNS FOR GREATNESS AT BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, the racing world presents its
ultimate drama at Belmont Park: Real Quiet, an ugly duckling foaled
with crooked legs who was sold for only $17,000 as a yearling,
races 12 rivals Saturday in a bid to win the Belmont Stakes and
complete his Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   It is a goal captured by 11 horses and missed by 13 who tackled
the punishing logistics: at the tender age of 3, to win the
Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont within five weeks'
time at three tracks in three states.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario was set with theatrical effect last year before
70,682 spectators, the largest number to watch a horse race in New
York in 20 years and the third-largest ever at Belmont Park. They
watched in wonder as Silver Charm tried to last the mile and
one-half of the Belmont Stakes, and failed by three-quarters of a
length when he was caught in the final 100 yards by Touch Gold. He
also failed to win the bonus of $5 million posted by Visa Corp. for
a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, racing gets another chance. It gets one more
natural drama with a compelling story line: Another horse from
California stands on the edge of history with the same trainer, Bob
Baffert, king of the one-liners and the winner of four of the last
five races in the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the drama reached to Wall Street Friday morning
when Mike Pegram, the owner of Real Quiet, rang the opening bell at
the New York Stock Exchange, and said: ``When we got this horse, we
called him the Fish. I didn't know he'd be a fish they couldn't
catch. But then again, I never dreamed I could make $5 million in a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram, who made a fortune in fast-food franchises, predicted
that his colt would deliver the dramatic ending that Silver Charm
did not deliver. And he intimated that Real Quiet might grow as a
racing hero who captures the public's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he suggested, referring to racing and its general
plight, ``we could put some more people in the stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear weather with temperatures in the 70s and a fast, dry track
were predicted for the race, prompting Belmont officials to hope
for another banner crowd at a track that drew only 6,784 fans
Friday. The day before, the New York Racing Association's Web site
registered 502,755 hits. And the press office reported that it had
issued more than 1,000 credentials to members of the news media
gathering to record the event.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 horses of the past who took the giant step and swept the
Triple Crown include three celebrated anniversary heroes: Citation
50 years ago, Secretariat 25 years ago and Affirmed 20 years ago.
The 13 who failed include some major stars, too: Carry Back in
1961, Northern Dancer in 1964, Spectacular Bid in 1979, Alysheba in
1987, Sunday Silence in 1989 and Silver Charm last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the day before the race, Real Quiet galloped once around the
Belmont strip, which measures a mile and a half, and his trainer
reported one more time that he was ready to take on all comers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse likes the track,'' Baffert said. ``He's likes the
Big Apple. But sometimes you need more racing luck than anything
else. It's just a waiting game now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Baffert spent his evening of waiting at a baseball game at
Yankee Stadium, throwing out the first ball and watching the
Yankees play the Florida Marlins. His horse was the 6-5 betting
choice breaking out of the No. 8 post position, and all he had to
do now was win.
</P>
<P>
   But his 12 rivals included one old foe, Victory Gallop, who ran
second in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness and was listed
as the second choice at 7-2. Third in the early betting, at 6-1,
was Grand Slam, winner of the Peter Pan Stakes two weeks ago, a
colt trained by D. Wayne Lukas, who won six straight Triple Crown
races before Baffert started his recent roll. In fact, Lukas won
the Belmont three years in a row starting in 1994 with Tabasco Cat,
Thunder Gulch and Editor's Note.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas will try to derail Real Quiet by running two horses in the
Belmont: Grand Slam and Yarrow Brae, winner of the Illinois Derby.
Both horses galloped Friday morning, and Lukas observed that they
were in good shape but declined to stir any waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no ripples on the water here today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop also cruised once around the track Friday,
satisfying his trainer, Elliott Walden, who said: ``He went good.
It seems to me he's where we want him to be. Before the Derby, he
was very enthusiastic, very willing to train, and he's the same way
this week, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Raffie's Majesty, the least experienced horse in the Belmont,
has raced only four times in his career and won twice. His trainer,
James Bond, sent the colt out for one lap around the oval at 5:15
in the morning, and then said, ``All we can do is keep him in good
health for the next 36 hours, and pray.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOKIE, Ill. _ For 80 years, workers at Fel-Pro Inc., a
manufacturer of automotive parts based here, have enjoyed some of
the lushest benefits in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   The list is long and varied: as much as 12 weeks of vacation;
scholarships; summer camp for employees' children; a fitness
center; tutoring; the state's first licensed day-care center; use
of a 250-acre corporate retreat, and even a $1,000 savings bond for
the birth of an employee's child.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention solid health, pension and profit-sharing plans
and a pro-nepotism policy that has meant that two-thirds of the
1,900 employees at the company's headquarters plant have had
relatives on the payroll at one time or another. Or such gestures
as a ham at Easter, a turkey at Christmas and candy for Valentine's
Day. Even the employees' neighborhoods benefit: groups in which
workers volunteer receive grants.
</P>
<P>
   Pay averages $12.50 an hour, what the company calls ``very
competitive'' wages for the industry, and workers receive an extra
day's pay on their employment anniversary and birthday. And any
threat to job security has been largely eliminated by a sizable
temporary staff, which acts as a cushion to slack periods. Small
wonder, then, that in a review by Fortune magazine last year of the
nation's 100 best companies to work for, Fel-Pro ranked fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They coddled and spoiled us,'' acknowledged David Beller, a
tool-and-die maker who has worked at Fel-Pro for 20 years. ``They
were very generous to their employees.''
</P>
<P>
   But circumstances have changed, as Beller's use of the past
tense implies. Last December, the owners _ members of the Lehman,
Weinberg and Morris families, descendants of the company's founder,
Albert Mecklenburger _ said they intended to sell Fel-Pro. In
January, word came of a takeover by the Federal-Mogul Corp., a
gritty Michigan company four times Fel-Pro's size.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since, a large cloud has, not surprisingly, formed
over this workers' paradise as employees confront the inevitable
unease and search for reassurance about their prospects under a
traditional corporate regime and its emphasis on maximizing
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's nervous,'' said Lucy King, 34, a longtime employee
in the packaging operations. ``We really don't know what to expect.
It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The skittishness is widespread _ and magnified by the jarringly
quick dispatch of a few dozen marketing, accounting and other
support people to Federal-Mogul's headquarters in Southfield,
Mich., or to unemployment lines. Indeed, several people who
initially agreed to be photographed for this article subsequently
declined, saying they felt uncomfortable in the current corporate
environment.
</P>
<P>
   It is fair to say that such feelings are new to the factory
here. Fel-Pro began in 1918 as Felt Products, which made a horse
blanket that fit under saddles before felt was widely used as a
sealant in automotive parts like gaskets. Over time, corporate
policy that may have begun as benevolence grew to become a way of
business that the company's fans say was as resolutely focused on
the bottom line as any leaner-and-meaner approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefits paid for themselves, with additional cooperation,
higher productivity,'' said Robert O'Keefe, a retired vice
president for industrial relations. ``We used to say we couldn't
not do it because it was an enhancement to our profits.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Workers take some comfort in various provisions of the $720
million stock-and-cash deal that the Fel-Pro families negotiated
with Richard Snell, the chairman of Federal-Mogul. Under the
agreement, various benefits will be maintained for specified
periods while others will be replaced by those of the new parent.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Snell said recently that ``the first agenda item'' in
negotiations with the families was Fel-Pro's special corporate
culture of near womb-to-tomb beneficence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, interviews with employees here found considerable
skepticism about how they will fare. They know that even as
Federal-Mogul tries to accommodate Fel-Pro, it is also digesting a
much larger acquisition of a British automotive supplier, T&AMP;N PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, workers seemed resigned to losing most of the lesser
fringe benefits while hoping for the best on vital interests like
health insurance _ and keeping their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never say with a big company like Federal-Mogul,''
said Frank Donis, 26, who works in the paper unit and whose mother,
sister and an aunt all worked for Fel-Pro. ``If things go down, the
company's going to have to make adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   One source of unease is Snell's intention to build what he calls
an ``all-star'' team drawn from the top talent in the company; that
is, Federal-Mogul will identify its best workers and protect them
from layoffs. But job losses are coming: Federal-Mogul hopes to
shrink its worldwide payroll of 41,000 by about 10 percent, much of
it through attrition. The company has not, however, specified
Fel-Pro's share of the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Another unwelcome change: Kenneth Lehman, who served seven years
in various Peace Corps positions before joining the family business
and rising to co-chairman, will not join the Federal-Mogul board,
as intended when the deal was announced. The reason, Lehman said,
is that it might have presented a conflict: he is administrator of
family trusts, and being a board member could, for example, inhibit
sales by the trusts of Federal-Mogul shares because of his status
as a company insider.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a big challenge on their plates,'' Lehman said in
an interview the week after the deal closed in late February,
referring to Federal-Mogul management. ``They will be trying to
forge a new culture for a big new global company.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounding not entirely confident, Lehman added that if
Federal-Mogul was convinced that treating employees well improved
the bottom line, ``then hopefully they'll use us as a model.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not at all certain, judging from what typically occurs
in such situations, said Jim Sillery, senior consultant at Watson
Wyatt Worldwide in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of the acquirer tends to become dominant,'' he
said. ``Fel-Pro's benefits will begin to look a lot like Mogul's,''
he predicted, noting that agreements covering benefits were not
necessarily binding and were subject to interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Weatherly, a consultant at Towers Perrin in Chicago,
agreed. In the face of ``overriding'' pressure from auto makers on
suppliers to squeeze costs, Weatherly said, ``it really is hard to
see all the nice features of the Fel-Pro culture surviving.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, Fel-Pro workers' profit-sharing plans can be
rolled over into Federal-Mogul's 401(k) plan; medical and dental
coverage converts to Federal-Mogul's similar, and in some respects
better, plan in 1999. The summer day camp and wellness center will
remain for at least two years, and vacations will be capped at four
weeks, except for employees already entitled to more time.
</P>
<P>
   The Fel-Pro families have set aside proceeds from the sale to
maintain the scholarship program for five years.
</P>
<P>
   One clear plus, however, is that Federal-Mogul hopes to extend
its year-old stock option plan to Fel-Pro employees. The
Federal-Mogul board is expected to approve the move within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Another, some employees say, is expanded opportunity as part of
a $5 billion company. ``Maybe all the benefits aren't there, but
you can maybe get a job somewhere else in the country,'' said Larry
Jenrich, 35, an inventory analyst in the distribution center for
whom Fel-Pro paid for two years of college.

EDITORIAL: RISING STORM IN THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 6:
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia is incorrigible.
Forced to accept peace in Bosnia, he is now uprooting thousands of
ethnic Albanians from the Serbian province of Kosovo. His military
campaign, the largest since the end of the Bosnian war, threatens
to ignite a wider conflict in the Balkans. America and its European
allies urgently need to increase the pressure on Milosevic to
desist.
</P>
<P>
   For the last week, Serbian security forces using helicopters and
heavy artillery have terrorized ethnic Albanian civilians near
Kosovo's border with Albania. Their ostensible objective is to cut
off escape routes used by the Kosovo Liberation Army, an ethnic
Albanian guerrilla group that has gained strength in proportion to
the brutality of Milosevic's repression. Kosovo's 1.8 million
ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the province's population.
They have been denied civil rights since Milosevic revoked Kosovo's
autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's brutal tactics could draw Albania into the conflict.
Macedonia, with a large Albanian minority, could also face pressure
to intervene. It is even conceivable that Turkey and Greece might
enter the conflict as well. American security interests could
quickly come into play in such a Balkan brawl. Washington must
promptly reinstate the sanctions it lifted a few weeks ago when
Milosevic agreed to meetings with Kosovo Albanian leaders. It is
now clear that he had no intention of conducting those talks in
good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, because of Russian sympathies for Serbia, the
international sanctions are mild and may do little to persuade
Milosevic to refrain from further violence. America and its
European allies need to consider stronger measures. President
Clinton has properly declined to rule out a military response if
the violence escalates.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's habit is to maul his opponents as long as the rest
of the world lets him. When the pain of economic sanctions becomes
severe and the threat of force is real, he thinks about retreat. He
should know from the NATO bombing campaign that forced him to the
peace table in Bosnia that Washington's patience is not infinite.

SOFTWARE GLITCH DELAYS EAST COAST AIR TRAVEL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Air travelers up and down the Eastern Seaboard were delayed
Friday morning due to a software glitch affecting controllers
working the airspace around three New York airports. A separate
radar mishap later resulted in controllers' receiving incomplete
information about Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   The president's plane was heading from Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland to Hanscom Field in Bedford, Mass., when air-traffic
controllers lost some of the information on the radar screen
regarding the plane. The partial loss of information, which
occurred at 8:11 a.m., lasted for 24 seconds, and occurred again 6
minutes later for 36 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Eliot B. Brenner said the president was never in
any danger. Controllers stayed in radio contact with Air Force One
the entire time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outage occurred at the $8 million Gibbsboro, N.J., radar
facility, one of 44 such systems installed around the country in
the past two years. In March, when Clinton was flying to
Connecticut, the same radar had a similar malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   FridayFriday's problem with the New York-area radar meant that
air-traffic controllers working in the airspace around the area's
three airports _ John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark _ did not
receive critical information on their radar screens. While the
blips of planes were showing up, information including the airline,
type of aircraft, flight number, altitude, and speed was lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to slow the system down, putting ground stops in some
cities and spacing out planes in flight,'' said FAA spokeswoman
Arlene Salac. The trouble began shortly before 5:30 a.m., when
officials were finished testing new software and tried to bring
back up the old software. By 7:30 a.m. the problems were resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA had no immediate information on the number of flights
delayed. ``We were digging out for quite a while,'' Salac said.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Logan Airport yestereday was experiencing ``no
repercussions'' as a result of the New York computer failure,
according to Georgeane Tacelli, a spokeswoman for MassPort.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a flare gun ignited inside a French tour operator's
suitcase only minutes before he was to board a flight at Miami
International Airport on Wednesday, investigators said Friday. They
said it could have caused an air disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Baggage handlers noticed smoke billowing from the suitcase as it
was sitting on a baggage cart about to be taken to a US Airways
flight to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Guy Cauvin, 55, a French citizen living in Germany, was
arrested and charged with transporting hazardous materials. Friday
</P>
<P>
   ``Had that thing gone off in the cargo hold in the suitcase,
everyone on that flight would have perished,'' Assistant US
Attorney Wilfredo Fernandez said.

ARIZONA REP. BOB STUMP ANNOUNCES BOB HOPE `DEATH' REPORT IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The testimonials to Bob Hope by grieving members of
Congress were so vivid that one could almost imagine the
95-year-old entertainer were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   He was.
</P>
<P>
   A thoroughly embarrassing string of events, even by
congressional standards, began Friday afternoon when House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Tex., introduced Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz., for
an ``announcement I think will be of great interest to this body.''
</P>
<P>
   Stump stepped to the microphone on the floor of the House and
said, ``Mr. Speaker, I have the sad responsibility to tell you this
afternoon that Bob Hope passed away.''
</P>
<P>
   At that very moment, Hope was in California ``eating a late
breakfast and preparing to go hit a couple of golf balls,'' said
his publicist, Ward Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Hope, who celebrated his 95th birthday a week ago, laughed when
he heard the report, and said, ``They were wrong, weren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional faux pas emanated from an Associated Press
article being prepared in the event of Hope's death. The article
was inadvertently displayed on the news service's Web site Friday
and relayed to Armey by congressional staff.
</P>
<P>
   Armey wanted Stump to make the announcement because the Arizonan
is close to Hope and his family. Stump, a World War II Navy veteran
who attended one of Hope's comedic performances at Pearl Harbor in
1943, helped push through legislation naming Hope an ``honorary
veteran'' last year.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said there had been rumors of Hope's demise before this
one, ``but not to this degree, not announced by Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by reports of his death before a performance eight
years ago, Hope replied, ``Does this mean I don't have to go on?''
</P>
<P>
   After Stump's announcement, House Minority Whip David Bonior,
D-Mich., said on the floor, ``I would add these comments to my
friend from Arizona that we are all saddened by his passing. He has
provided so much joy and happiness to this planet and to our
servicemen and women in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Tex., also paid homage to the
not-so-departed Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Phones began ringly madly at the United Service Organizations,
which Hope helped make famous with his entertainment programs for
armed forces personnel overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were from all over the place, people worried about him,
media people, board members, friends of Bob Hope,'' spokeswoman Pat
Messer said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Armey stepped back onto the floor to apologize for an
``announcement that was erroneous regarding a report that Bob Hope
had passed away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret the announcement, and I look forward to many more
happy memories from a wonderful entertainer and a distinguished
American,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee then returned to amend her earlier tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that, I will gleefully acknowledge that I do not have to
offer sympathy to the family of Bob Hope, and I am joyful about
that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stump tried to telephone Hope and got the comedian's
daughter, Linda, instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said he was alive and well and wondered about the story,
and I told her exactly what had happened,'' Stump said. ``I said we
were sorry and that I hoped Mr. Hope got a kick out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Gersh, editor of AP Multimedia Services, said the
untimely &UR; obit was miscoded by human error so that instead of
showing up only on an internal display where an editor could work
on it, the preparedness was posted to the AP's Web site, The WIRE.
</P>
<P>
   The AP, like other news organizations, prepares obituaries on
celebrities so copy can be moved quickly when they die. &QL;

FOES OF REWRITING CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAWS CITE FIRST AMENDMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forces opposed to rewriting the nation's
campaign-finance laws are denouncing the effort as a siege on free
speech and are threatening the most widely supported overhaul plan
by questioning its constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning images of big government muzzling voices and building
barbed-wire fences to stem the spread of ideas, foes of changing
the way the nation finances elections are vowing to fight from the
halls of Congress to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment is not an idea that should be tossed aside
like a piece of garbage,'' said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas,
the House majority whip, expressing the sentiment of other GOP
leaders and a coalition of interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   With the House considering a dozen campaign-finance proposals,
nothing is likely to stir impassioned rhetoric and jeopardize major
changes in the law more than constitutional concerns.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how strictly the goverment can regulate political
spending, which exceeded $2 billion in the 1996 federal elections,
including the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular campaign-finance bill, sponsored by
Representatives Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, and
Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat, has sparked opposition from a
range of special interests over a provision that would regulate
independent spending by groups other than political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Under a landmark Supreme Court ruling, organizations such as
labor unions, corporations, and nonprofit groups are not required
to report how much they spend or where they get the money to fund
``issue advocacy'' campaigns, which attack candidates without
directly calling for their election or defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The high court decided in the 1976 case, Buckley v. Valeo, that
the government has the right to regulate ``express advocacy,''
which specifically calls for electing or defeating a candidate. The
justices said the regulations, which set contribution limits and
require candidates to disclose the source of their campaign money,
was justified to prevent corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But the court also said free-speech guarantees would be violated
by measures that restrict spending aimed at swaying public opinion
without directly influencing elections. ``So long as persons and
groups eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the
election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free
to spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his
views,'' the justices wrote.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated $150 million was spent in 1996 on issue-advocacy
campaigns, many playing decisive roles in the elections. The
antiabortion National Right to Life Committee, which spent about $2
million in 1996 on issue advocacy, has vowed to challenge in court
any limits on independent spending, as have the American Civil
Liberties Union and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numerous provisions of the Shays-Meehan bill ignore the
Supreme Court rulings that provide broad protections for citizens
groups to comment on the positions and voting records of federal
politicians,'' said Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the
National Right to Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Even strong supporters of the Shays-Meehan bill worry about the
measure's constitutionality. ``I fear that it will be hard to sell
to the Supreme Court,'' said Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio
Democrat who helped craft the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But other supporters of the bill assert that the high court
ruling left open the door for regulating issue advocacy and
establishing spending limits if the integrity of the election
system was threatened by a flood of undisclosed spending by
individuals and independent groups.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Supreme Court ruled that ``limiting corruption
provides a constitutionally sufficient justification for
contribution limits,'' the court could find that preventing
corruption also justifies expanding regulations on spending,
according to the Shays-Meehan backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment protects speech,'' said Representative
Scotty Baesler, a Kentucky Democrat who is running for the Senate.
``It does not protect corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-based National Voting Rights Institute has filed
lawsuits in several states and municipalities aimed at asking the
Supreme Court to reconsider its Buckley decision that prohibits
regulating independent spending.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent House debate, Representative Asa Hutchinson, an
Arkansas Republican who is sponsoring a bipartisan freshmen bill
that would impose less-stringent regulations on campaign spending
than the Shays-Meehan bill, said changes are necessary to ensure
that big money does not control elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``By claiming to argue for free speech,'' Hutchinson said, ``the
opponents of reform are cynically attempting to make sure that big
money not only talks, but it screams.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said his bill, which is backed by President Clinton and a
coalition of groups such as the League of Women Voters and Common
Cause, has the support of a majority of House members, although no
vote has been scheduled. The measure also must survive a rare,
parliamentary process in which it could be killed if any of the 11
competing proposals receives more votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, a bill identical to Shays-Meehan passed last year
with 53 votes, but died when supporters could not muster the 60
votes needed to overcome procedural hurdles raised by Republican
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of the Shays-Meehan bill facing stiff opposition
is a ban on the unlimited and unregulated contributions known as
``soft money.'' The two major parties spent more than $260 million
in soft money in 1996, much of it on issue advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee has alerted its members
that the proposed ban would unconstitutionally nullify ``the right
of political parties to engage in unrationed issue advocacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meehan said such a ban is constitutional and in the public
interest. He said his bill would allow politicians ``to take a step
away from the well-heeled special interests and take a step toward
restoring the one-voice, one-vote principle upon which the country
was founded.''

TRACKING THE FLOW OF CASH ABROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)   (ART ADV: Graphic comparing cash flow and total return for emerging
market funds will be sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or 1927.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7)  
 (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling this year's overseas markets volatile is a bit like
saying India and Pakistan are having a neighborhood cook-off.
</P>
<P>
   How have fund investors reacted to the spinning markets? By
piling into hot European funds, bailing out of plummeting Latin
American stock funds and _ surprisingly _ plowing enormous amounts
of cash into the debt of emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings come from data on estimated regional fund cash
flows for the first four months of 1998 from Lipper Analytical
Services, the research firm in Summit, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   For those who think that going against the grain can lead to
outsized profits, such cash-flow figures can be useful in deciding
when to buy or sell.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had directed a net total of $2.6 billion into European
funds in 1998, through April 30. Moreover, flows into European
funds were consistently positive each month.
</P>
<P>
   That bespeaks enormous positive sentiment, according to Michael
A. Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical _ perhaps too much. ``At
some point,'' Lipper said, ``the enthusiasm for Europe may be
overplayed.''
</P>
<P>
   European funds, as tracked by Lipper Analytical, posted gains in
all four months. In February alone, they returned 8 percent. ``If
you have not invested in Europe as a sector bet, it's probably too
late,'' Lipper said, but he added, ``if you own Europe, I don't
think you have to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, that loud whoosh you hear is the sound of investors
pulling money out of Latin American stock funds. Such funds have
had net outflows every month since June 1997. During the first four
months of 1998, investors pulled out $609.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   But consider this: Latin American stock funds have experienced
negative returns in just one of the first four months of 1998: a
10.5 percent loss in January. Since then monthly returns returns
have been positive. That helps lead Lipper to believe that such
funds are oversold.
</P>
<P>
   More curious is the bullishness on emerging-markets debt funds.
Investors have put a net of $559.4 million into such funds in the
first four months of the year. Only in January did they withdraw
money. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an absolute constitutional right to earn 7 percent on
high-quality paper,'' Lipper joked. ``If the U.S. government isn't
going to deliver that, and corporates aren't going to, Brady bonds
do,'' he added, referring to the bonds developed in 1989 by
then-Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady to reduce Latin America's
foreign bank debt.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are likely to be lulled by two facts: First, Brady
bonds, which are heavily bought by emerging-markets bond funds, are
denominated in dollars and hence are seen as immune to currency
meltdowns. Second, the United States Treasury guarantees repayment
of the principal _ though not the interest.
</P>
<P>
   But owning individual bonds is different from owning a bond
fund, which is still subject to the price fluctuation of its
fixed-income portfolio. In October 1997 alone, for example, such
funds lost 9.7 percent on average, according to Lipper Analytical.
</P>
<P>
   Cash flows for emerging-markets stock funds have been erratic.
Investors yanked out $246.6 million in January, only to invest a
net of $457.4 million in February. Then they pulled out $162.6
million in March and sank $146.3 million into the funds in April.
</P>
<P>
   All told, there was a net cash inflow of $194.5 million. Which,
of course, has likely set up investors for the most recent
downdraft. Many investors were probably looking for a classic
rebound from last year's emerging-markets selloff, Lipper said, and
are instead experiencing a double-dip selloff. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the push for plain-English prospectuses. The State
Street Research and Management Co., which manages $16.3 billion in
mutual fund assets, has gone another step: to plain Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already translated the prospectus for its Alpha
fund, as well as an educational brochure, and Chinese translations
are in the works for four other funds, too.
</P>
<P>
   The translations follow from State Street's simplification of
its English prospectuses a year ago, said Joan Miller, senior vice
president for retail marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We translated from lawyer's English to plain English and then
into other languages because there's no way to translate some of
the legal terms used in ordinary prospectuses,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Why Chinese? As a group, Chinese-Americans are better educated,
save more and earn more than the average United States household,
Ms. Miller said. She added that the response to the Chinese
prospectus was ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   State Street is also pushing ahead with plans to translate
prospectuses for six funds into Spanish. No plans have been made
for other languages _ yet.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH NOT KEEPING SCORE?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Okay, so the solution may be too simplistic. But grant the
Massachusetts Youth Soccer Association this much: At least the men
and women who rule our Saturday mornings are trying to save us from
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   It's no easy mission.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to eliminate keeping score in soccer tournaments
for kids under age 10 has brought the Wrath of the Righteous down
upon the heads of those who govern children's soccer in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   They're Marxists, killing competition.
</P>
<P>
   They're welfare-state Liberals, destroying incentive.
</P>
<P>
   They're do-gooders, promoting self-esteem above
self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they're just parents, as horrified as the rest of us by
what they see from the sidelines. The coach who browbeats a boy who
can't practice for two hours on a school night because his mother
subscribes to the quaint notion that he should eat his supper and
do his homework. The coach who dispatches his wife to the practice
fields of neighboring towns to scout the opposition. The coaches
who meet in pre-draft caucuses to compare detailed game notes on
9-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   If only the problem stopped with the coaches. But what about the
soccer mom who demands that the coach send in her boy whenever a
teammate misses a goal? Or the soccer dad who runs along the
sideline swearing at his own son? Or the parents who hurl
invectives at the teenage referees?
</P>
<P>
   It's ugly out there on the soccer field. And the Little League
diamond. And the CYO basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, eliminating keeping score will not end the excesses
of adults any more than it will stop children from counting the
number of goals scored. There is not a ``non-results oriented
competition,'' from sports to board games, that does not end with a
healthy child asking, ``Who won?''
</P>
<P>
   What the rule change by the Massachusetts Youth Soccer
Association might accomplish, however, is to force us to focus on
the larger issues. &UR;  &LR; Why, for instance, do we insist on ranking
children before they've had the time to learn the game? How are
children under age 10 to develop the skills necessary to excel if
they are classified as ``B'' players by overzealous coaches their
first or second season on the field?
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery why the coach of kindergartners who wears a
rubber pig nose and feathered chicken legs to practice wins the
affection and the attention of his team of 5-year-olds, while the
bellicose father on the other side of the field can't get his team
to listen. Why, then, is the coach of middle-schoolers who welcomes
a slow-moving but plucky kid back into the lineup after a broken
leg the exception rather than the rule?
</P>
<P>
   What is undermining childhood in America is not our refusal to
hold our children to high standards; it's deceiving them and
ourselves into believing that a score alone _ whether on the soccer
field, on the SATs or the Boston Latin School admissions exam _ is
what separates winners from losers.
</P>
<P>
   That's the lesson Julia McLaughlin's father taught her when he
insisted that her test score alone entitled her to a seat at Boston
Latin. That's the lesson we teach a computationally challenged
child when we force him into an upper-level math class, lest his
course load fail to impress Harvard. That's the lesson we teach our
tone-deaf daughter when we insist she continue violin classes.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that, by adolescence, most children have
abandoned team sports and music lessons? They're burned out.
</P>
<P>
   To compound matters, this faith in the inviolability of winning
scores is awfully selective. In Xenia, Ohio, this spring a student
with a 3.8 grade point average was barred from joining her high
school's National Honor Society. Amanada Lemon, 18, had been
invited to join her school's chapter until a five-member faculty
council learned she had a 9-month-old daughter. She had the
required score, the teachers said, but she lacked the requisite
character. So much for the sanctity of objective standards.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mock the decision to eliminate score-keeping in the
early years of youth soccer; it's tempting to ridicule the blanket
award of trophies to 6-year-old T-ball players. Is it so much
harder to acknowledge that all skills, in the classroom and on the
playing field, take time to develop and to teach our children that
we are willing to give them the time it takes?

HUNTING FOR HEADHUNTERS THROUGH SALES OF STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 7) 
(ART ADV: Graphic on executive search firms that go public is being
sent to NYT graphics clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or 1927.)  
 (bl)  
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When most companies go public, the aim is to recruit
shareholders. Now, recruiters may be going public partly to help
recruit recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts point to six executive search firms that are
either planning or considering initial public offerings, including
the two leaders, Heidrick &AMP; Struggles and Korn/Ferry International.
Capital needs such as new computer systems for sophisticated
searches or a war chest for acquisitions are mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than the cash the offerings raise, the most important
payoff may be the ability to use lucrative stock option plans to
lure top talent in an industry where compensation does not vary
widely from one firm to another.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that adds up to an attractive proposition for investors
is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the executive search business is booming,
because of a strong economy and the great emphasis many
corporations place on recruiting the most suitable executives for
top posts rather than automatically promoting from within. Revenues
of the top 10 firms in the field grew 23 percent last year, and
half of them have seen revenue more than double over the past five
years, according to Hunt-Scanlon Advisors, which publishes a
newsletter called Executive Search Review.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in similar businesses where the assets all go home at
night _ like consulting, advertising and money management _ have
gone public with some success. And the one major executive search
company to follow their lead in recent years, LAI Ward Howell, has
done well so far, rising from its offering price of $12 last July
to $19.50 on Friday. (LAI filed plans in May for a secondary
offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.)
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of reasons for investors to look twice at
executive search company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Korn/Ferry went public once before, in 1972, and
did not enjoy it. The company was small and the stock thinly traded
and volatile; the founders, Lester Korn and Richard Ferry, found
the bobbing of the stock price a maddening distraction. They
repurchased all the stock in 1974 and went private again; their
experience made others in the industry shy of public offerings for
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Korn/Ferry is considering going public again now, said president
and chief executive Michael Boxberger, because the company wants to
expand its business to the Internet and finance growing technology
needs. But Korn/Ferry also wants to use its stock to attract and
retain staff.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that objective can be a concern for investors, too.
Executive search firms have high turnover rates, providing the
potential to seriously burn investors if a firm is hit by a wave of
defections.
</P>
<P>
   And earnings can be difficult to forecast. ``This is a very
relationship-oriented business, and it often takes years to develop
relationships with clients,'' said Susan Chadick, a partner at
Gould, McCoy &AMP; Chadick, a small executive search firm in Manhattan.
``Our product doesn't unfold on a predictable basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Jacob, an analyst at IPO Value Monitor, said: ``Going
public is a good move for the companies, but it has a certain
degree of risk for investors. In most cases, these companies have
fairly uneven operating results _ that's just the nature of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   That is probably because most firms in the industry are small,
and as Korn/Ferry's 1970s sojourn illustrates, size is an important
concern. Boxberger said his company is now big and global enough to
make its earnings fairly predictable.
</P>
<P>
   By some measures, however, the executive search business remains
a cottage industry, and one beset by worrisome trends under the
surface. According to Scott Scanlon, editor in chief of Executive
Search Review, many firms not only lack the financial and marketing
capacity to be publicly-traded entities, but they also have poor
training programs for new hires. ``This is an industry that hasn't
made an effort to attract young talent, but that could sorely use
it,'' Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, it now takes the average recruiter longer
to fill an assignment, and the number of successfully completed
assignments is dropping.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, executives at some of the largest search firms
continue to resist the idea of going public. The recruiting concern
Spencer Stuart recently lost two top executives to Heidrick &AMP;
Struggles. But Joseph Griesedieck, chief executive of Spencer
Stuart, said the company's 115 partners voted unanimously last
month to remain private, partly because of concerns over the
potential loss of client confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that publicly traded search firms may
have an edge on the recruitment front.
</P>
<P>
   At Strategic Legal Resources, a Manhattan search company that
places high-level executives as well as lawyers, Jay Horowitz, one
of its founders, said stock options had definitely helped lure new
employees since Strategic Legal was acquired earlier this year by
Staffmark Inc., a publicly traded staffing company.
</P>
<P>
   ``These options have huge appeal. I can pay people one-half to
two-thirds of the salaries they wanted,'' Horowitz said. ``And
that's because people feel like they're part of something in a
publicly traded company.''

FOR BETTER EARNINGS, TRY BIGGER WRITE-OFFS

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7)  
 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While the stock market ended last week on a high
note, pleased with the mix of economic reports, one little-noted
piece of data had ominous implications for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate write-offs, as a percentage of the reported earnings
per share of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, surged in the
first quarter to 14 percent. Of the $10.25 a share that the S&AMP;P 500
companies reported in earnings for the quarter, write-offs totaled
$1.44 a share.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than just a blip. Gabrielle Napolitano, vice
president for investment research at Goldman, Sachs, has collected
such data for 10 years. She says write-offs have never been higher
than they are now.
</P>
<P>
   This is unusual given that we are in an economic boom. Some of
the write-offs are a result of mergers, in which companies deduct
acquisition charges. The Asian crisis is another factor: 35 percent
of the first quarter's write-offs related to commercial banks'
loan-loss provisions.
</P>
<P>
   But an alarmingly large chunk of the write-offs _ 15.3 percent _
were nonrecurring charges related to the purchase of so-called
in-process research and development. That was up 70 percent over
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Why alarming? The rise may indicate that increasing numbers of
companies are using an arcane accounting rule to artificially
bolster their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever one company acquires another, some of the assets are of
little value to the combined companies. That is especially true for
technology or pharmaceutical concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting rules allow the acquiring company to write off
immediately against earnings the total value of the in-process R&AMP;D
that its management considers worthless. It is a nonrecurring
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Why should this matter to an investor? Because it affects a
company's earnings. Since the one-time charge reduces the value of
the acquired assets, it also lowers depreciation expense in future
years. And depreciation charges shrink earnings.
</P>
<P>
   So when a company takes a one-time write-off for purchased R&AMP;D,
future earnings look better than they would have had the company
depreciated those assets over time. And if the assets turn out to
be not so worthless after all, any income they produce drops
straight to the bottom line, unimpeded by depreciation expense.
</P>
<P>
   Howard M. Schilit, president of the Center for Financial
Research and Analysis in Rockville, Md., notes that these
write-offs not only are much more prevalent today, but that they
now amount to big money. ``We're seeing a lot of companies that put
absurd amounts _ even 95 percent of the purchase price of an
acquisition _ into in-process R&AMP;D write-offs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the peculiar case of Applied Materials Inc., a formerly
high-flying maker of semiconductor equipment. In the quarter ending
in January, it paid $32.2 million to a company in a licensing
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than consider the fee an operating expense, as Schilit
said would be typical, Applied Materials called it in-process R&AMP;D,
even though no acquisition had transpired. That accounting improved
the company's operating cash flow by 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies do more of these things when their business
weakens,'' Schilit said. ``If things are humming, they don't need
to reach.'' The company was closed Friday and did not return a
phone message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the same quarter, the company's margins fell
significantly. In the April quarter, sales dropped 10 percent.

RADAR DATA VANISHES TWICE ON AIR FORCE ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some radar data from Air Force One carrying
President Clinton disappeared mysteriously from air traffic
controllers' screens twice Friday morning as the plane flew over
New Jersey, the second time this year that the presidential jet has
trailed off the same radar system.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration insisted that ``in neither
incident was safety compromised'' on Friday, noting that a
controller initiated voice contact with Air Force One to keep track
of its flight. The agency promised to investigate, saying that
similar radar glitches have occurred on other flights around the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The lapses occurred Friday while Air Force One was en route from
Andrews Air Force Base to Bedford, Mass., where the president was
to give a commencement speech at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. First, a text block of data vanished from the screen
for 24 seconds; then a while later, the same data disappeared for
36 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was being tracked with data from an FAA long-distance
radar in Gibbsboro, N.J., about 15 miles southeast of Philadelphia,
and the controller handling the jet was stationed in Ronkonkoma,
N.Y., which handles high-altitude traffic in the region. The radar
lapses involving Air Force One were not related to a software
problem at another FAA office earlier in the day that delayed
hundreds of passenger flights.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the anomaly remained in dispute, but FAA officials
confirmed that the Gibbsboro, N.J., radar is the same one that lost
track of Air Force One on March 10 when the plane also partly
vanished from controllers' screens.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers say they believe there is a problem with
the Gibbsboro radar, which was brought online in September. The
Federal Aviation Administration, however, believes that the problem
is a generic flaw of the radar system used nationwide, because it
becomes confused if it sees two airplanes over the same spot of
land, at different altitudes. The agency says it has no way to
correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This phenomenon is not particular to the New York area or to
this radar,'' said Eliot Brenner, the chief spokesman for the
agency. ``It is seen at other locations around the country, and
controllers are well aware of it and trained to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, ``when it's the president's aircraft, you want everything
to work properly,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever it doesn't, the incident is quickly publicized. On
January 28, also departing Andrews, Air Force One came within 2.36
miles of a US Airways flight bound for National Airport. That was
not because of a radar failure, though.
</P>
<P>
   The radar involved Friday morning works mainly by sending out an
electronic question to planes in flight, and receiving responses
from an on-board radio device called a transponder. The transponder
sends a radio message back, giving the plane's name, model,
destination and altitude.
</P>
<P>
   The radar system records which way the antenna was facing when
it received the answer, and thus knows the direction of the plane;
it also keeps track of the time the response was received. Since
radio waves travel at a known speed through air, knowing the time
means knowing the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Then the system displays on the screen a text block, giving all
that information, and a symbol depicting the plane's estimated
location.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that if two airplanes are over the same spot,
while they may be miles apart in altitude, the radar does not know
that. It sees in only two dimensions, bearing (compass direction to
the plane) and range (distance to the plane). When it gets two
signals back simultaneously, it often garbles or loses one of them,
according to FAA radar experts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Friday morning, parts of Air Force One's text block were
absent on two radar sweeps at about 8:11 a.m. A sweep takes 12.5
seconds, so that gap was 25 seconds. The plane was about 23 miles
northeast of the Gibbsboro radar at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 8:17 a.m., some data was lost for three consecutive
sweeps, or 37.5 seconds. By then the plane was about 65 miles
northeast of the radar.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA said it did not know yet how much of the data was lost.
In each instance, the agency said, the controller handling the
plane made certain by voice contact that the president's plane was
still flying.
</P>
<P>
   In case of brief radar failure, separation of aircraft is still
likely because the planes are operating at a fixed speed over a
fixed route, and like a line of cars traveling down the highway,
their position relative to each other changes much more slowly than
their position relative to a fixed object. Also, in clear weather
they can see each other, and all passenger planes carry
anti-collision radar.
</P>
<P>
   Radar experts say events like the two that happened to Air Force
One on Friday morning are very common, especially in places where
air space is congested, and thus where two planes are likely to be
over the same spot. At the Professional Airways Systems
Specialists, the union that represents the electronics technicians
who keep radars running, Henry Brown, who is based on Long Island,
N.Y., said, ``If you were to ask the FAA for all the sweeps they
miss in a month, you wouldn't have room for the data.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason they make a big deal out of it is it's Air
Force One,'' he said. ``We're talking about technology here,'' he
said. ``Stuff goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But controllers say that a data block disappearing from radar is
a shock. ``Your heart goes from your chest up to your throat,''
said Dean Iacopelli, an official of the controllers union, the
National Air Traffic Controllers Association, at the office in New
York that handles lower-altitude flights. ``You say, `American 001,
are you still with me?' And they say, `We're still here,'''
Iacopelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it's American 001, nobody seems to care,'' he said.

ILLIQUIDITY, THE OTHER PORTFOLIO RISK
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, June 7.) 
(ART ADV: Graphic of stocks in which Dreyfus has shares is being
sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.) 
(js) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bull market in stocks has been long and lovely, but even
unsophisticated mutual fund investors understand the nature of
market risk. If the prices of many stocks in a fund's portfolio
drop, fund holders will lose, too.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding a fund's exposure to liquidity risk, however, is
quite another matter. Liquidity risk is the possibility that the
price of a stock will drop, and therefore may push down the fund's
net asset value, when a manager tries to sell a large position. Or
that the price will climb, forcing a manager to pay too much when
buying a large chunk.
</P>
<P>
   Unless investors have examined a fund's holdings in each stock
and compared them with the total shares outstanding in the company,
it is tough to fathom such risk for a particular fund.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not much of a concern in large-cap stock funds,
liquidity risk can wreak real havoc in micro-cap funds, which
invest in fledgling companies with market values of $250 million or
less. Positions in such companies are much harder to get in and out
of without roiling the market.
</P>
<P>
   How damaging can illiquid stocks be to a portfolio? Plenty, as
shareholders in two Dreyfus small-cap stock funds, Premier
Aggressive Growth A, with $264 million in assets, and Aggressive
Growth, at $77 million, are finding out.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these two funds are textbook examples of the perils of
illiquidity. So far this year, through Thursday shareholders in
Premier Aggressive Growth have lost 13.5 percent; those in
Aggressive Growth are down 18 percent. As a benchmark, the Wilshire
Small-Cap index is up 10.8 percent. Last year, Premier Aggressive
Growth was down 13 percent; Aggressive Growth lost almost 16
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive, yes. Growth, no.
</P>
<P>
   Performance like this may explain the April news that the funds'
manager since August 1995, Michael Schonberg, was being joined by
Paul LaRocco, late of Founders Asset Management in Denver, who was
named the primary manager. Mellon Bank Corp. owns both the Founders
and Dreyfus fund companies.
</P>
<P>
   For the two-and-a-half years that Schonberg ran the fund alone,
he bought speculative technology or biotechnology companies with
few shares outstanding. He even borrowed money to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
   LaRocco takes a different tack, favoring bigger-name stocks with
$1 billion to $5 billion in market value. In an interview, he said
he is still running the funds as aggressive-growth vehicles. ``But
we will broaden the funds' holdings out a little,'' he said.
``Mid-cap stocks are a good place to be here. As earnings growth
among large-cap stocks slows, investors will move down the
market-cap range.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus did not make Schonberg available for an interview last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Even if LaRocco is a brilliant stock-picker, the beleaguered
Dreyfus fund holders are not likely to recoup their losses soon.
That is because escaping a portfolio of illiquid stocks is like
exiting a crowded theater after somebody has yelled ``Fire!''
</P>
<P>
   How illiquid are some of the holdings? Frighteningly so.
According to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, the
median market capitalization of the larger of the two funds,
Premier Aggressive Growth, is a Lilliputian $157 million. Across
the micro-cap fund category, only 20 percent of funds have a median
market capitalization this small or smaller.
</P>
<P>
   The median market cap of Aggressive Growth is even smaller, at
$87 million. Only 10 percent of micro-cap funds in Morningstar's
universe have median market values that tiny.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 percent of Premier Aggressive Growth's assets are
in stocks that trade at $5 a share or less. In the Aggressive
Growth fund, 20 percent fall in that range.
</P>
<P>
   Another measure of both funds' high risk levels can be found in
the concentration of fund holdings. As of April, Premier Aggressive
Growth held 70 stocks; each of the top six holdings accounted for
between 4 percent and 7 percent of the fund's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive Growth was even more concentrated, at 54 stocks. Its
No. 1 holding, a cosmetics and medical technology concern called
Chromatics Color Science International, accounted for almost 13
percent of the fund's assets. That's staggering, given that a top
holding in a fund typically accounts for 2 percent to 3 percent of
assets.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Dreyfus is making a big bet on Chromatics Color Science, a
company that was brought public in 1993 by Investors Associates, a
brokerage firm that closed last year after a number of state
securities regulators revoked its license. Chromatics Color Science
closed at $10.75 on Friday , down from $17.25 in March. Dreyfus
owned 1.5 million shares as of March, more than 10 percent of the
shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The bet on Chromatics is not the only big gamble fund holders
have made. Almost 30 percent of the assets in Premier Aggressive
Growth are stocks of obscure companies in which Dreyfus owns more
than 5 percent of the shares outstanding. In the Aggressive Growth
fund, 67 percent of the assets are stocks of companies in which
Dreyfus owns more than 5 percent of shares.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in March, Dreyfus owned 23 percent of Atlantic
Pharmaceuticals, a development-stage biotechnology company that
closed at $5.75 on Friday, has no sales and lost $14 million since
1994. Dreyfus also owned 16.4 percent of Oncormed Inc., another
money-losing biotechnology concern, that finished the week at
$3.125 a share. Then there's Advanced Photonix, which says it
manufactures ``proprietary solid-state large-area avalanche
photodiodes. '' Some 14 percent of the stock, now at 87.5 cents a
share, was owned by Dreyfus as of March.
</P>
<P>
   This concentration in illiquid stocks is fine when the fund
manager is buying. As the buying wave rises, so does the stock's
price. This in turn raises the fund's net asset value, making the
bet look smart.
</P>
<P>
   But when the buying dries up, trouble begins. If the stock does
not have positive earnings or other good news to support it, the
price begins to flag. The bigger the position, the harder it is to
get out. Which is precisely the predicament that LaRocco finds
himself in at Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Hale, an equity fund analyst at Morningstar who follows
Dreyfus funds, said: ``This portfolio is not something you can
change that quickly. He will rotate as he can out of most of the
micro-cap stuff as the market lets him.''
</P>
<P>
   LaRocco has two choices. He can unload the positions he
inherited en masse and start fresh. Or he can hope that a surge in
investor ardor for micro-cap stocks will allow him to sell his
positions piecemeal without scorching the market. He has already
started to sell some. This may explain why Premier Aggressive
Growth is down 13 percent since early April, when LaRocco took
over, and Aggressive Growth has lost 15 percent. ``The sooner these
funds have restructured their portfolios,'' Hale said, ``the better
their risk-return profile will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the funds sell many stocks at a loss, any gains
going forward under their new manager may be offset. That is the
only silver lining to the liquidity cloud hanging over these mutual
funds.

FCC PREPARING TO SCALE BACK SCHOOL INTERNET PROGRAMS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While President Clinton was speaking enthusiastically Friday in
favor of a program to help schools and libraries connect to the
Internet, the Federal Communications Commission, under pressure
from Congress, was preparing to scale back the program, officials
close to the commission and to Congress said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 schools and libraries have submitted applications
for Internet grants totaling $2.02 billion. But under the plans
being considered by the commission, the program would almost
certainly get less than $1.7 billion this year, and possibly less
than $1.4 billion, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Big long-distance phone companies contribute most of the money
that goes into the program. The commission and lawmakers are
concerned that fulfilling all the applications from schools and
libraries could lead to higher long-distance telephone rates. But
while some members of Congress want to cut off funds to the program
completely, FCC officials want to shrink the program more modestly.
Referring to the school and library program by its Washington
nickname, Clinton said Friday, ``I say we cannot afford not to have
an e-rate,''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of poor schools and libraries and rural health
centers are in desperate need of discounts,'' the president said,
giving a commencement address at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Cambridge. ``If we really believed that we all belong
in the Information Age, then, at this sunlit moment of prosperity,
we can't leave anyone behind in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The president has set a goal of connecting every classroom to
the Internet by 2000, and he said Friday that by this time next
year ``we will have connected well over half our classrooms,
including 100 percent of the classrooms in the nation's 50 largest
urban school districts.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC collected $625 million for the schools and libraries
program in the first half of the year. If the commission does not
vote to change the program by Tuesday, the FCC will collect an
additional $690 million in the third quarter and as much as $705
million in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That would meet all of the grant applications. The commission
must vote by Tuesday because the third quarter begins on July 1 and
the commission has said that phone companies must know their
obligations by next week in order to prepare and modify their
billing systems.
</P>
<P>
   But few people at the FCC believe that the commission will allow
the schools and libraries fund to grow to meet the outstanding
demand.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because the commission, led by William E.
Kennard, a Democrat, as chairman, has insisted since last year that
the schools and libraries program not increase the price of phone
calls for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve that goal, the commission has pegged the
long-distance companies' contributions to regulated reductions in
the charges, known as access fees, that the companies pay to local
phone companies to begin and end calls. Some of the access fee
reductions are meant to be flowed through to consumers in the form
of lower rates, and the major long-distance companies say they have
done so.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T and MCI are also about to begin telling their customers
that the government is making consumers pay more to support schools
and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's bills have stayed at, say, $20,'' an FCC official
said. ``But instead of $20 they see $19 plus $1, and they focus on
the plus $1.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The commission is scheduled to create $700 million to $800
million in additional annual access charge reductions on July 1.
That works out to $175 million to $200 million in quarterly
savings.
</P>
<P>
   The commission collected $325 million for the fund in the second
quarter. If that rate was increased to reflect the July 1 access
fee reduction, the FCC would collect for the rest of the year at a
rate of $500 million to $525 million a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a majority of the five-member commission had agreed on
a plan to collect $524 million a quarter at least until the end of
the year, people close to the commission said Friday. That would
have yielded a total budget for the calendar year of $1.67 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, the four high-ranking members of Congress
wrote to Kennard urging the FCC to stop collecting for the program
altogether, destroying the $524 million consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The schools and libraries plan, which has its origins in the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, is part of a larger program that
also supports telecommunications service in poor and rural areas,
known as universal service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission's efforts to implement the universal service
provisions of the act have been a spectacular failure, and _ more
importantly _ a raw deal for consumers,'' wrote the four members of
Congress: Rep. Thomas Bliley Jr., a Republican from Virginia who is
chairman of the House Commerce Committee; Rep. John Dingell,
D.-Mich., who is the ranking minority member of that committee;
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and Senator Ernest Hollings, D.-S.C., and the ranking
minority member of that committee.
</P>
<P>
   People on Capitol Hill said Friday that the commission was
floating a plan to collect $375 million for the fund each quarter,
for a 1998 total of $1.38 billion. A spokeswoman for the commission
declined to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Kennard said: ``Ending this effort is not in the
best interest of the American people. We need to find a way to
insure that this effort continues. I am committed to this.''

U.S. READY TO RESUME SANCTIONS OVER KOSOVO STRIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has reversed course and
is ready to impose new sanctions on Yugoslavia to punish President
Slobodan Milosevic for his attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo,
senior American officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, British officials said they would move ahead
with European sanctions, would press NATO to plan possible military
action and would push the U.N. Security Council for a resolution to
justify such a use of force.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they are moving to impose sanctions but
that the decision will not formally be made before a White House
meeting of senior officials on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Kosovo, the southernmost province of Serbia,
threatens to reignite the ethnic and religious conflicts in the
Balkans that NATO introduced troops to stop in Bosnia. There are
fears that Albania and Macedonia could be drawn into a larger war
or even break up if Milosevic is not prevented from an ethnic
cleansing of the Albanian majority in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians from Germany and Switzerland are joining the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The move to impose sanctions is a reversal of an American
initiative taken last month by the special envoy Robert Gelbard and
Richard Holbrooke, the architect of the Dayton accords that ended
the war in Bosnia, who had been asked to help break the logjam over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had pushed European allies to suspend sanctions on
Milosevic, who agreed to meet with Albanian separatists but then
unleashed the largest assault since the Bosnian war ended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, in particular the British and the Germans, felt
that Milosevic had manipulated the Americans, promising to open a
dialogue but not promising it would lead to any results.
</P>
<P>
   Friday a senior American official did not dispute that judgment,
saying: ``There is a perception that Milosevic is using the talks
as a device to continue his campaign and not using them as a means
to find a peaceful solution to the problem. So the trend away from
sanctions has now been reversed.''
</P>
<P>
   British officials said that London had already concluded that a
stronger policy is needed to try to deter further violence by
Milosevic against the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, they said, the British government will push the
European Union's foreign ministers to introduce tough economic
sanctions, in particular a ban on new foreign investment that the
Clinton administration suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ban would be the most important measure because it
affects the economy most directly. It will prevent foreign
companies from taking part in sales of national companies that
Milosevic uses to finance his government. It is the European ban
that matters the most, because there has been very little American
investment in the rump Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American officials said a formal imposition of the
investment ban might have to wait until Wednesday, when the
Americans meet the British and other members of the Contact Group
on Yugoslavia _ Germany, Italy, France and Russia. The foreign
ministers of those countries plus Russia, Canada and Japan will
meet in London on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that Washington favored a rapid NATO
study of all military options, but stressed that no decisions had
been made, expressing concern that Congress would be unlikely to
support any further American deployments in the Balkans.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday members of the Senate Armed Services Committee
pressed Gelbard to set a date for withdrawing American troops from
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Holbrooke persuaded Milosevic to engage in talks with
ethnic Albanian leaders from Kosovo who favor independence through
peaceful means. In exchange, Washington convinced the Europeans to
suspend the implementation of an investment freeze on Yugoslavia,
angering many of its European allies who had reluctantly agreed to
go along with sanctions and who thought they were being suspended
too easily.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hooper of the Balkan Institute said Friday: ``I think
Holbrooke played into Milosevic's hands by bringing him carrots and
giving the stick to the Kosovo Albanians. Milosevic took those
concessions as a green light to proceed, and cracked down harder on
the Kosovars and in Serbia itself, withdrawing autonomy from
universities and moving against independent media.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a National Security Council official in the first
Clinton term who is now at the University of Maryland, said that
Holbrooke had erred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Richard Holbrooke has a special rapport with Milosevic
and used it to great effect in Dayton and at other times,'' he
said. ``But in this case I think he misread Milosevic, who had no
interest in real dialogue. The suspension of the sanctions in
return for a procedural victory was ineffective, as the escalation
of the past week has shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who works in the private sector, was not immediately
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A huge crackdown by Milosevic's forces on the mainly ethnic
Albanian population of Kosovo has killed dozens of people, caused
thousands of refugees to flee into Albania and has displaced as
many as 40,000 people, Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown caused ethnic Albanian leaders of Kosovo, led by
Ibrahim Rugova and received last week by President Clinton at the
White House, to cancel a session of talks with Yugoslav officials
scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were concerned that talking to Serb officials
while the fighting continued would undermine their own credibility
and the search for a peaceful solution, while further consolidating
the popular appeal of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which Milosevic
is trying to wipe out.
</P>
<P>
   After having pressed the Albanian Kosovo leaders to continue the
talks despite the crackdown, American officials said Friday that
they ``understood'' the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense is that the Kosovar Albanians have some
justification in not wanting to talk right now,'' an American
official said carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke and Gelbard, working with the full approval of the
Clinton administration, had pressed to start the Rugova-Milosevic
dialogue, the first time Milosevic has talked to a Kosovo leader in
nearly a decade. Without dialogue, they argued, there could be no
peace, and efforts by European leaders to start such a dialogue had
failed.
</P>
<P>
   If Milosevic did not deliver, they and other American officials
said, the investment ban could easily be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belgrade is on notice we will not accept a sham dialogue,''
Gelbard said to the senators on Thursday, warning Milosevic that
suspended sanctions ``can be quickly reinstated and that we will
work with the allies to develop additional measures if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   That moment has now come, American officials said. &QL;

RICH CANDIDATES WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Herb Kohl is a low-key, soft-spoken member of
the US Senate's millionaire caucus. The son of immigrants, he
parlayed a Milwaukee grocery fortune into political success in
1988, winning the Wisconsin seat he has held ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But he almost lost his first race when his wealth and
inexperience became issues. ``We wanted him to respond to the
attacks, but he said no,'' recalls his campaign consultant, David
Doak. ``Herb thought that wealthy newcomers had to behave
differently in politics. And even though that election was very
close, he was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Doak belongs to another millionaire caucus, the Gephardt-Kennedy
consortium of political consultants. Three hired guns, whose
political training took place under the aegis of the Missouri
congressman and the Massachusetts senator, were at triangular odds
in the June 2 California gubernatorial primary. Doak backed the
winner, Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis. His former partner, Bob
Shrum, produced the thousands of ads purchased by former airline
tycoon Al Checchi, and Bill Carrick was media guru for
Representative Jane Harman.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spent about $12 million, raised from other people. Harman
coughed up about $15 million, mostly from her husband's checkbook.
Checchi laid out $40 million from his own fortune, built on
corporate makeovers of Marriott, Disney, and Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive primary in American history tested a New
Testament truism, from the Book of St. Matthew, 19:24: ``It is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Future political consultants will rewrite their pitch: ``You're
a much better candidate than Checci or Harman, Mr. or Ms. Potential
Client. I suggest a closer look at that camel's favorability
ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it cost Checchi $60 per vote, last week's defeat may
have been a bargain. Most nominees for governor of California
contract Potomac Fever and consider running for president, a task
that requires serious money.
</P>
<P>
   California has spawned 15 such candidacies in the past 50 years.
Earl Warren, a two-time governor, was a national candidate in 1948.
Richard Nixon, who ran for governor in 1962, ran nationwide five
times. Ronald Reagan ran four times, Pat Brown gave it a
favorite-son feint in 1960. Pat's son, Jerry, ran for president
three times. Pete Wilson, the incumbent, ran in 1996, actually in
1995, since he never made it to the New Hampshire presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Brown is now mayor-elect of the city of Oakland, many
acres of which Harman and Checchi could have purchased for a
reasonable price with the amount they spent on political ads.
</P>
<P>
   The next rich candidate will probably demand better commercials.
When Checchi campaigned in the streets of San Francisco, several
voters said to him, ``You're so much better than your
commercials.'' This observation contradicts the essence of American
advertising: The ad is supposed to be better than the product.
</P>
<P>
   No one can make millions without some charm or originality, but
Checchi's first ads lacked either. Cliche-ridden strolls on the
beach talked of thoroughly poll-tested bromides that few real
voters talked about. He wanted ``a 10 percent cut in state
bureaucracy'' as a way to finance school aid, even though
California has one of the lowest per-capita state payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   When Checchi turned negative, attacking Harman, the few real
voters he encountered saw no resemblance to the villain in the
30-second melodramas they had seen. His ads made Checchi seem like
Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff put together.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson Doak learned from Senator Kohl will be tested in
future campaigns by rich candidates. A humbler, or at least less
arrogant, camel can saunter through the eye of that needle. Others
will look at last week's voting, assuring themselves that they will
be smarter than Harman or Checchi. Steve Forbes, who ran for
president in 1996, will not be discouraged and plans to renew his
membership in the Mensa Society.

SHIRLEY POVICH, 92, SPORTS COLUMNIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shirley Povich's sports column ran in The Washington
Post Friday, which was not unusual, since his columns have appeared
in The Washington Post for 74 years, or since he began working
there in 1924, at age 19. Povich's column Friday, headlined
``Recent Baseball Feats Require Footnotes,'' was literary yet
earthy, opinionated yet generous, topical yet filled with
historical perspective, and a pleasure to read, none of which was
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   What was different was that it was his last.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Povich died of a heart attack Thursday night at his home
in Washington. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   ``While he retired `officially' in 1974,'' an editor's note that
preceded Friday's article said, ``he continued to write columns for
the newspaper.'' There were more than 15,000 of them over seven
decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the final column, which he wrote on Wednesday, Povich
questioned, among other things, whether Mark McGwire, the hulking,
slugging first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals who has hit 414
career home runs, is a greater home-run hitter than Babe Ruth. That
seems a growing sentiment, but it was not a popular one with
Povich, who covered Ruth and his exploits. ``To judge McGwire a
better home-run hitter than Ruth at a moment when McGwire is
exactly 300 home runs short of the Babe's career output is, well, a
stretch,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And he underscored the opinion about Ruth with a first-hand
anecdote that almost no one but Povich could have provided:
``Walter Johnson once said when asked to compare the Babe's swats
with those hammer blows of Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx and Hank
Greenberg: `Lemme say this, those balls Ruth hit got smaller
quicker than anybody else's.'''
</P>
<P>
   Povich, 5 feet 6 inches, trim and always neatly attired, was
widely admired by generations and was considered one of the best
sports columnists in the country. ``If it hadn't been for his
friend Red Smith,'' Jerome Holtzman, the Chicago Tribune sports
columnist said, ``Shirley would have been regarded as the best
sports columnist in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In his unobtrusive manner, and with a quiet New England way of
speaking that this Maine native never lost, Povich was also
considered one of the finest gentlemen in the sometimes inelegant
world of sports. He was known, read and enjoyed by a wide range of
people _ including presidents, starting with Calvin Coolidge.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, The Washington Post was the fourth paper in
circulation in a five-paper town. Katherine Graham, whose father,
Eugene Meyer, bought the Post in 1933, became the publisher herself
years later. She once claimed that Povich, then writing his ``This
Morning'' column six days a week, ``was responsible for one third
of our readership.''
</P>
<P>
   Povich, like many fine newspaper columnists, was on the side of
the underdog. He regularly took the owner of the Washington
Redskins, George Preston Marshall, to task for not hiring a black
player. On one occasion Povich wrote: ``Jim Brown, born ineligible
to play for the Redskins, integrated their end zone three times
yesterday.'' Marshall finally did hire a black player, Bobby
Mitchell, in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Povich and his wife, the former Ethyl Friedman, whom he met on a
blind date in 1930, were married for the last 66 years. He is
survived by his wife and three children: David, a lawyer in
Washington; Maury, the television talk show host, and the youngest,
Lynn, a managing editor with MSNBC. ``It was a very male family, as
you might expect, but being the only girl, Dad really tried not to
leave me out of things,'' Lynn Povich said.
</P>
<P>
   Povich won numerous prizes for his writing, from the Grantland
Rice Award to election to the writers' wing of the Baseball Hall of
Fame. He was cited for outstanding service as a World War II war
correspondent with the Marines in the Pacific in 1945. But surely
the strangest acknowledgment he ever received was when he found
himself listed in the initial volume of ``Who's Who in American
Women,'' in 1958. The editors had lifted a paragraph on him from
``Who's Who in America,'' although it plainly said he was married
to Ethyl. ``The next year,'' he recalled with amusement, ``they
dropped me, like they used to do in the New York Social Register if
you had married a stripper _ the snobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The name Shirley for a boy was not uncommon in Maine. He was
born on July 15, 1905, in Bar Harbor to parents who were Orthodox
Jewish immigrants from Lithuania. His father later owned a
furniture store in Bar Harbor. Povich was the eighth of 10 children
and was named for a grandmother, Sarah, or ``Shirley,'' as it was
loosely translated into Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, he got a summer job caddying at a country club that
catered to wealthy vacationers who owned mansions in Bar Harbor.
Edward McLean, then the Post's publisher, suggested that Povich,
17, come to Washington where there would be two jobs for him, one
as caddie on McLean's personal golf course at $20 a week and the
other as a copy boy at the paper at $12 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Povich, who had never been on a train, had never been out of
Maine and had never owned a pair of long pants, accepted. His first
task was to carry the bag of McLean's friend, Warren Harding,
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the Post, Povich rose first to police reporter and then to a
position in the sports department, all while studying law at
Georgetown University. His first byline came on Aug. 5, 1924, above
a report on the Washington Senators. In 1926, at age 21, he was
named sports editor, the youngest sports editor of a metropolitan
daily in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   And he went on from there, covering events as diverse as the
famed Dempsey-Tunney ``long count'' heavyweight championship fight
in 1927 to the Olympics to Babe Ruth's ``called shot'' in the 1932
World Series. (``He didn't really call the shot,'' Povich said of
Ruth. ``He was pointing at the pitcher, Charley Root, for
quick-pitching him and was calling him names.'') At 91, he attended
a Washington Bullets National Basketball Association game. He was
never enamored of basketball, and wrote: ``They don't shoot baskets
anymore, they stuff them, like taxidermists.''
</P>
<P>
   Povich said the following to Holtzman, in the book ``No Cheering
in the Press Box'': ``Despite the fact that I was a precocious
young sports editor, I would describe myself as a late bloomer.
Maturity came late to me. I was about 30 when I discovered I wasn't
a clear thinker. I was a hero worshiper, a romanticist, highly
sentimental and entirely impractical. I was constantly overwriting,
often attempting to make the event and the game more exciting and
dramatic than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1969 autobiography, ``All These Mornings,'' Povich
described how he suffered two fractured vertebrae on Okinawa in
World War II. He was taken off a ship that was headed for combat
and was transferred, despite his reluctance, to a hospital in Pearl
Harbor. Many who went ahead on the ship, including the legendary
war correspondent Ernie Pyle, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leading a charmed life,'' Povich wrote, ``for reasons
unknown to anyone before or since.'' &QL;

-- The following chart shows how senators and house representatives
voted on key bills and amendments this week. A ``Y'' means the
member voted for the measure; an ``N'' means the member voted
against the measure; a ``?'' means the member did not vote; and a
``P'' means the member voted ``present.''
</P>

   THERE ARE NO SENATE VOTES THIS WEEK.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: DISABILITY
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 410-1, a measure that would allow
people receiving disability benefits to obtain Social Security
vouchers that could be used at job-placement, rehabilitation and
job-training centers. The measure also would extend coverage
available to disabled people returning to the work force from four
years to six. The measure was passed without debate. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: PRAYER
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 224-203, a constitutional
amendment that would have permitted prayer and religious displays
in public buildings, including schools. The amendment, which gained
a simple majority of votes but fell short of the two-thirds
majority required to pass, marks the first time in 27 years the
House has voted on school prayer. Supporters said the amendment
would restore the right to express religion in public places.
Opponents said the amendment was unnecessary because the 1st
Amendment already protects religious freedom. A ``yes'' vote favors
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: AGRICULTRE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 364-50, a bill to provide $1.9
billion for agricultural research, crop insurance and food stamps.
The bill includes $818 million in food stamp funding for certain
legal immigrants, which was challenged last month by the Republican
leadership. Supporters cited the importance of farmers' interests
and the restoration of benefits for legal immigrants. Opponents did
not want to reinstate food stamps to legal immigrants. A ``yes''
vote favors the bill.

<TEXT>
<P>
   What's a mutual fund director to do? Lately, when independent
directors have stood up to fund managers, they've gotten their ears
boxed. And when, to some eyes, the directors have let fund managers
go their own way, they've gotten their ears boxed again.
</P>
<P>
   Consider events of the last two years, a period in which the
fund industry has experienced some of its most rapid growth ever:
</P>
<P>
   _ When the independent directors of two fund families, the
Navellier and Fundamental funds, asserted their legal authority to
remove portfolio managers at some of those funds, they swiftly
found themselves the targets of nasty proxy battles waged by the
fund managers _ and, in the case of the Navellier directors, a
shareholder lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   _ When the Securities and Exchange Commission brought charges
against the managers of the Parnassus fund and the Rockies fund,
contending violations of securities laws, it also charged the
funds' independent directors with failing to properly value
securities owned by the funds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago,
questioned the independence of directors after finding that among
the 82 largest fund families, the more that directors were paid,
the more that shareholders shelled out in expenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a lawsuit brought by a shareholder of the Brazil fund, a
closed-end fund managed by Scudder Kemper Investments, a federal
judge in Manhattan agreed with the plaintiff that outside directors
who received compensation for sitting on the board of more than one
fund in the same family might not be independent at all.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, if ever, since the current system of mutual fund
oversight was laid out in the Investment Company Act of 1940 have
fund directors been under fire on so many fronts at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, you've got innumerable parties, including the
SEC, emphasizing the importance of the independence of directors,''
said Robert J. Zutz, a partner in the Washington office of the
Kirkpatrick &AMP; Lockhart law firm and a specialist in mutual fund
law. ``But on the other hand, where to the greatest degree
imaginable, directors have exercised their independence, they get
caught up in these unfortunate situations. Ultimately, it could
cause a director to pause and take the consequences into account
before deciding to act.''
</P>
<P>
   To almost any degree that directors hesitate, individual
investors stand to lose. Shareholders in most publicly traded
corporations can expect various parties _ institutional investors,
independent watchdog groups and securities analysts, to name a few
_ to help a company's board keep an eye on what insiders are doing.
But the fund industry leaves the job almost solely to independent
directors _ a disparate bunch. At even the biggest fund families,
they can range in background from experienced corporate managers
and directors to the friends or college buddies of the top
executives of the fund management company.
</P>
<P>
   Their authority, moreover, is unique in American business,
because of the peculiar legal fictions that define mutual funds. In
theory, a fund is owned by its shareholders, who hire independent
directors to run it. The directors select companies to manage the
fund, to underwrite the sale of shares and to provide services to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, of course, the entire operation is run by one fund
company _ Fidelity or Merrill Lynch, Navallier or Fundamental _
which not only provides all those services, but is the brand name
that brings shareholders to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent years, as even some of the most mediocre fund
companies have generated spectacular returns, the balance of power
has kept shifting farther from fund directors and toward the
companies that conceive, market and manage mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in and around the fund industry say that is just
fine. After all, they note, funds have piled up $5 trillion in
assets _ doubling in size in just the last three years _ with
barely a whiff of the scandals seen in the banking, savings and
loan, brokerage and insurance industries. But around the fringes of
the fund business, the strain is starting to show.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many mutual fund companies are so new that the industry has
just not had enough time and experience to sort out the rules and
responsibilities,'' said John A. Hill, chairman of First Reserve
Corp., an energy investment firm. He also serves as an independent
director of the Putnam funds and has sat on the boards of several
publicly traded companies. ``Some mutual fund boards are aware of
the issues,'' he said, ``but many others are not very aware at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, for its part, has acknowledged that some aspects of
mutual fund governance need examination. But the commission appears
to be edging quite gingerly into the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proper role of a fund's board has become a bit
controversial lately,'' allowed SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. in
an address in May to fund industry executives. This fall, he said,
the SEC will be the host for a round table intended ``to air the
issues and to work toward a consensus on whether changes are needed
in the current system.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the SEC has been flooded with requests from fund
companies, corporate governance experts and academics to
participate in the round table, SEC officials said. But until that
discussion takes place, many directors may be wondering if taking
decisive action is more likely to harm than help investors.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that is the question raised by events surrounding
Navellier Aggressive Small Cap Equity, once a $250 million fund
that saw its assets shrink by three-quarters last year as the
fund's manager battled with its independent directors.

NEW PORSCHE 911 DIFFERS IN STYLING, COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Porsche has done it again; if you thought the last 911 was good,
if you thought (as I did) that the Boxster was about as perfect a
car as you'd want, prepare to change your mind. A brief tour of the
new 911 _ Type 996 _ would indicate that ``best'' title has a new
car under it.
</P>
<P>
   The new 911, a 1999 model, comes as Carrera Coupe or Cabriolet
with a 296-horsepower (258 ft/lb torque), 3.4-liter, six-cylinder,
water-cooled, boxer engine. It is the first water-cooled engine in
a 911 and employs two radiators with electrically powered fans. The
new Carrera with six-speed manual gearbox is $65,030, with
five-speed Tiptronic, $68,450. The convertible is $74,460 with
manual, $77,880 with Tiptronic. Tiptronic is Porsche's dual-mode
automatic that either works as full automatic or is shifted
manually with fingertip controls on the steering wheel. As usual
with Porsche, the option list is long, offering the possibility of
ordering something unique _ and exceedingly expensive. The basic
equipment ought to satisfy most drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Coupe comes with an electrically operated sunroof; the
Cabriolet's ragtop folds out of sight automatically in 20 seconds
at the touch of a button.
</P>
<P>
   The car differs substantially from its predecessor model in
styling, comfort, and handling. Acceleration is still
neck-snapping; cornering ability is phenomenal. A day's tour in a
new 911 leaves one panting for more time behind the wheel. The
911's rude habit of educating drivers through sudden oversteer was
corrected several incarnations ago; the newest model introduces a
level of forgiveness unheard of in a Porsche with the latest in
traction control and antiskid electronics.
</P>
<P>
   And this year Porsche offers a wheeled accessory _ a mountain
bike. Actually two mountain bikes, the S for $2,250 and the FS for
$4,500 _ if you forget to refuel in your exuberance behind the
wheel, now you can pedal in style for a can of gas. I do not know
if Porsche offers a matching gas can with the Porsche crest, but
maybe they should.

 UNDATED: independent directors.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louis G. Navellier, a money manager based in Incline Village,
Nev., founded the fund in 1993. Three years later, Louis Navellier
proposed merging the fund into a separate fund group that had a
different set of independent directors _ steps that he said would
reduce operating expenses through economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   But the directors of Aggressive Small Cap Equity opposed the
move, and the difference of opinion quickly grew ugly.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which said Louis Navellier refused to provide
information about his management company, dismissed him in March
1997 and hired Massachusetts Financial Services, proprietor of the
MFS family of mutual funds, to manage the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Navellier, who said he provided the board with all the
information to which it was entitled, fought back. Under the
Investment Company Act, the directors were required within 120 days
to get shareholder approval for the manager change. With a campaign
of mailings and phone calls, Louis Navellier rallied enough
investor support to block the move. The directors rehired him _ and
subsequently resigned.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult, though, to declare anyone a winner. During the
battle, most shareholders simply moved their money out of the fund,
whose assets have dwindled to $60 million. And now, Louis Navellier
has joined with several of his loyal shareholders in a class action
suit against the former independent directors, their lawyer and
MFS, seeking to recover up to $14 million in capital gains taxes
that shareholders incurred last year.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants and others in the fund industry have asked why
the SEC did not support what the independent directors believed was
an attempt to protect shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the Navellier directors did precisely what they
were supposed to do: They raised the issues and went to
shareholders to vote on them,'' said C. Meyrick Payne, a senior
partner at Management Practice, a New York consulting firm that
works with independent directors. ``But there was a moment when you
wondered whether the SEC should have been a little more
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Barbash, director of the commission's division of
investment management, which regulates mutual funds, declined to
comment on the Navellier case. But in general, he said, the agency
seeks to avoid taking any action that could influence how
shareholders vote in a proxy contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC tries to play referee and make sure everybody plays
fair,'' Barbash said. ``We'll throw a flag if someone is clearly
violating the rules. But a proxy contest is not a situation where
the SEC should come in and say something that will change the
outcome of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If Navellier were an isolated case, it might be dismissed as an
anomaly in a rapidly growing, diverse industry. But another
confrontation is occurring at the Fundamental funds, a New
York-based family of six funds with total assets of about $170
million. And in this case, shareholders may be faced with an even
less appealing set of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamental's history has not been full of investing success;
its volatile funds tend to careen between the top and bottom
performance quartiles. Fundamental's New York Muni, its largest
fund, is the only municipal bond fund of any type to lose money in
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Believing that investors in the funds had suffered enough, their
directors voted last year to seek a replacement for the company
that has long managed the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Vincent Malanga, president of Fundamental Portfolio
Advisors, the fund manager, supported the move; in fact, he found a
potential replacement, Tocqueville Asset Management, which oversees
a family of funds operating under the Tocqueville name. The board
concurred, and, as an interim measure, a manager from Tocqueville
began managing the Fundamental funds last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the fund's filings with the SEC, the board soon
discovered that the manager had been routing portfolio trades
through a Tocqueville-related brokerage firm, a potential violation
of securities regulations. Tocqueville dismissed him, but the four
independent Fundamental directors split on whether to go ahead with
the plan to hire Tocqueville permanently. The two directors who
opposed the hiring resigned.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Malanga and his firm were charged by the SEC
with failing to disclose the risks involved in special securities
owned by one of the Fundamental funds in 1993-94; the firm, without
admitting or denying the allegations, recently settled a
false-advertising complaint by the National Association of
Securities Dealers over the same issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now Malanga has turned against Tocqueville; he wants
shareholders to replace all the board members with a new group
that, presumably, would again name him the funds' manager. The
directors responded by throwing out Malanga and his firm June 1 and
hiring Toqueville to take over the funds _ a move that requires
shareholder confirmation within 120 days.
</P>
<P>
   Given the situation, even the most educated shareholders might
have trouble deciding what is in their best interest. As with the
Navellier funds, many have decided to flee rather than to choose
sides; assets have dropped by nearly one-third over the last year.
And while a consequence of that decision for investors is to lock
in losses, some in the industry say it is the best way to
discipline fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that if a fund company is not looking out for
shareholders, we get to vote with our feet,'' said Gregory
Sullivan, a principal at Sullivan Bruyette Speros &AMP; Blayney, a
McLean, Va., investment adviser. ``There are a lot of alternative
funds for us to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   The system, of course, is set up to provide checks and balances
other than pitched battles and mass redemptions of shares. But if
shareholders can get hurt when a fund's directors and its managers
are at loggerheads, they can also suffer if everyone gets too cozy.
</P>
<P>
   That is the assertion in a lawsuit that threw the fund industry
into a tizzy last year. The lawsuit, brought by a shareholder of
the Brazil fund, contends that directors of the fund were likely to
put the interests of Scudder, its manager, ahead of those of
shareholders, because the directors received tens of thousands of
dollars for overseeing scores of other Scudder funds as well.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Robert Sweet of U.S. District Court in Manhattan, in
refusing to dismiss the complaint, said that ``the close and
financially rewarding relationship with Scudder is sufficient to
call into question the independence and disinterest of these
directors.'' The case is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   The industry mainstream was shocked by the judge's ruling. ``I
think he was off his rocker,'' said Thomas R. Smith Jr., a partner
at the New York law firm of Brown &AMP; Wood, and co-chairman of an
American Bar Association task force that wrote a legal guidebook
for fund directors. ``The whole structure of the '40 Act provides
that serving on more than one board will not make you'' an insider,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC took no formal position in the case. ``Our view is that
the amount of money a director is making does not make him
independent or not independent,'' said Barbash. ``But shareholders
should be told how much the directors are being paid.'' That
information is included in a fund's SEC filings.

 UNDATED: SEC filings.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fund companies have less direct control over fund directors than
one might assume. Independent directors themselves usually select
nominees to fill vacancies, and nominees must be voted on by
shareholders. Independent directors also set their own salaries and
hire their own outside lawyers. And while the law requires only
that 40 percent of a fund's board be independent, in practice they
constitute a majority on nearly all fund boards.
</P>
<P>
   Fund directors also say they regularly stand up to a fund's
managers. ``I'd say that every year we have some issue,
particularly involving the contracts to manage the funds, where we
have some disagreement with the manager,'' said Hill, the Putnam
director.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that directors are always pushing for lower
fees. ``We have to make sure that the fees the funds are paying are
competitive enough to keep the players in the game,'' said Stephen
West, a lawyer at the New York firm of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell who
serves as an independent director of the Pioneer and Winthrop Focus
funds. ``The competition for managerial talent is enormous, which
has caused the cost of running the business to explode.''
</P>
<P>
   As the fund industry has boomed in size, fund companies have
seen their profitability soar. In part, the growth comes from
having more assets to manage. But an oft-cited Morningstar study
found that newer funds charge higher management fees than older
funds. And in another study, Morningstar found that directors were
paid more by fund families with higher expenses, raising ``serious
questions about the role independent trustees play in protecting
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Signals from the SEC have been mixed on this front. Regulators
have warned that they will be quick to question the directors of
fund companies that consistently get higher-than-average management
fees but produce below-par performance. Yet Levitt told fund
executives in May that ``directors don't have to guarantee that a
fund pays the lowest rates, but they do have to make sure that fees
fall within a reasonable band.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has been more consistent in challenging directors whom
it judges have failed to oversee fund managers' conduct. It has
recently brought enforcement cases against the Parnassus fund, a
mutual fund, and the Rockies fund, a closed-end fund, charging
independent directors with failing to adequately police how the
fund's managers valued certain stocks. The charges are being fought
by the directors and the fund companies involved.
</P>
<P>
   While a different form of corporate governance might be able to
better assure the independence and competence of directors,
shareholders don't seem to be banging down the doors for change.
Still, some new ideas might come up at the SEC round table this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the rest of the world, and in unit trusts in the
United States, fund directors are not responsible for setting a
fund's management fee. Free from questions about the economics of a
fund's management contracts, directors could spend their time
monitoring a manager's business practices _ how brokerage
commissions are allocated, whether investment guidelines are being
followed and the like.
</P>
<P>
   And shareholders are now being given more leeway to directly
influence the governance of their funds. In May, the SEC reversed a
longstanding precedent, ruling that directors of closed-end funds
must adhere to results of votes on shareholder proposals to replace
the manager of a fund. (A closed-end fund operates much like a
mutual fund, except that its finite number of shares are traded on
a stock exchange.)
</P>
<P>
   The industry may also take a fresh look at some existing,
alternative governance plans. The boards of the American Express
IDS funds, for example, employ full-time officers separate from the
officers of the management company. That structure emerged after a
struggle for control of the funds' managers in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the board is confronted with issues that raise questions
about whether a fund's assets are being properly used and managed,
that structure adds an additional safeguard,'' said Leslie Ogg,
president of Board Services Corp., the independent company that
oversees the operations of the American Express IDS funds.
</P>
<P>
   Even that structure does not guarantee that directors will stand
up to management on all issues. For that, Ogg said, responsibility
ultimately lies with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does take a strong SEC to make independent directors
effective,'' Ogg said. ``In the end, as a director you've got very
little economic leverage. You've only got your prestige. That's the
point where a director has got to be able to say that he has the
support of regulators in acting independently.''

SHREWD AND CYNICAL COMEDY DEBUTS ONB HBO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEX AND THE CITY &QC; 
Starring: Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis,
Cynthia Nixon &QC; 
On: HBO &QC; 
Time: The two-episode premiere is Saturday at 9:45. The regular
timeslot for the series will be Sundays at 9 p.m. &QC; 
Rated: TVMA  &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cupid has deserted the New York of ``Sex and the City,'' a
nighttime landscape of clubs and galleries where men and women vie
for what George Costanza on ``Seinfeld'' called ``hand.'' Slippery
bachelors and ``modelizers'' narrowly avoid depth and commitment,
while beautiful, successful women wake up to discover they are 41
and lonely. He takes her home to see his Ross Bleckner painting,
she angles for breakfast at Tiffany's.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes on ``Sex and the City,'' a shrewd and very
cynical comedy that premieres tonight at 9:45 on HBO. Created by
Darren Star, the man behind ``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Melrose
Place,'' it's an original series that is quite different from
Star's sudsier ventures, particularly with its de-emphasis on
ongoing story line. The concept, based on Candace Bushnell's
columns for the New York Observer, has Sarah Jessica Parker's
Carrie Bradshaw writing about the Manhattan dating scene by using
her own experiences and those of her three close friends. She's a
self-labeled ``sexual anthropologist,'' and she goes on nightly
field trips to note the mating habits of the wealthy and maybe
bring home something resembling romance for herself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.3l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With all the late-night clubbing and yuppie attitude, the New
York of ``Sex in the City'' looks more like the 1980s versions
portrayed in books and movies like ``Bright Lights, Big City'' and
``Slaves of New York.'' Parker and her 30-something friends are
fairly obsessed with the rules of chic culture, gathering regularly
to engage in racy and ironic talk about whether the man or the
woman has the power in a given situation, and what role money plays
in the game. Along with Parker's Carrie, the women are Kristin
Davis's naive Charlotte, Cynthia Nixon's intellectual Miranda, and
Kim Cattrall's predatory Samantha. In tonight's episode, the
weakest of the three sent for review, Carrie experiments with the
typically male approach to sex, trying to have no feelings
afterward. In the second episode, the women deal with modelizers
(men who date only models), and in the third, called ``Valley of
the Twentysomething Guys,'' they mix it up with a few slackers.
</P>
<P>
   Parker deploys Carrie's thoughts in a witty voice-over, and
occasionally she breaks the fourth wall to comment on the action.
``Are men in their 20s the new designer drug?'' she wonders. While
Carrie's big ideas are explored in each episode, ``Sex and the
City'' is also savvy enough to smile wryly on its heroine's
journalistic tendency to invent trends: ``Were women in New York
really giving up on love and throttling up on power?'' Carrie asks,
preparing for her next column. ``What a tempting thought.'' Parker
is perfect as a woman who is attractive enough to run with the
beautiful people, but self-conscious and cautious enough to be
gathering observations for a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' is sure to offend some, with its retro and
not very politically correct approach to the battle of the sexes.
It takes a grim view of single living, generally putting the women
at a disadvantage _ unless they are contriving revenge of some
sort. Almost none of the characters is particularly likable _
unless he or she is angling for something. What's refreshing about
``Sex and the City'' is that it pushes to a darkly comic extreme
the situations that already fuel the many urban-singles sitcoms on
network TV, particularly those with female leads like ``Suddenly
Susan'' and ``Caroline in the City.'' More social satire than
sitcom, it looks openly at relationships steeped in ambivalence,
fear, and the games people play.

U.S. GIVES UP LAST VESTIGE OF CONTROL OVER BASIC INTERNET
STRUCTURE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY HARMON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration renounced the last vestige of control
by the U.S. government over the Internet's basic structure on
Friday, acknowledging that the computer network had grown too big,
too global and too commercial to be overseen by any one nation.
</P>
<P>
   That last vestige is the distribution and management of Internet
addresses, an issue that has become the focus of increasingly
heated debates and litigation as companies, institutions and
individuals found that the land rush to cyberspace was being slowed
because all the best addresses had already been snapped up.
</P>
<P>
   In a long-anticipated policy paper, the administration said it
would turn over the management of the Internet's address system to
an international nonprofit group that could represent a range of
constituencies from large corporations struggling to protect their
trademarks and market their products on line to Saturday night Web
surfers.
</P>
<P>
   The final policy dispenses with many of the more controversial
government mandates that had produced widespread opposition to
early drafts of the report. Instead, adopting a scheme that could
become a general model for Internet self governance, the government
will abdicate the sticky task of building a consensus across
national boundaries, private and public sectors, and big and small
businesses to the as-yet-unformed group.
</P>
<P>
   While governments are not soon likely to abandon attempts to
control aspects of the Internet within their territories that
violate moral or cultural values _ pornography, pedophilia,
gambling and invasion of privacy are the most popular targets _ the
ultimate futility of localized efforts to place limits on a global
network is widely expected to result in more and more Internet
self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who gets what address on the Internet does not
strike at the core values of any one group or culture, but it has
become an increasingly contentious issue. That is because while
real estate in cyberspace is theoretically unlimited, the
government has only authorized the use of a handful of ``top-level
domains,'' the suffixes at the ends of Internet addresses that are
supposed to denote what type a site is.
</P>
<P>
   The ``.edu'' domain, for example, is restricted for use by
schools and universities, while ``.gov'' is available only to
governments, and ``.mil'' can be used only by the military.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``org'' is supposed to denote nonprofit
organizations, and ``.net'' is given out only to Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves everyone else, from the largest corporations to your
Aunt Mae, vying for a domain address that ends in ``.com,'' which
the government invented in 1990 to denote commercial sites. That
was before the World Wide Web was invented, and no one dreamed that
the demand for Internet domain addresses would be so great.
</P>
<P>
   In a frantic electronic land-grab that began about three years
ago, those seeking to stake out an on-line identity have rapidly
scooped up many of the most desirable domain addresses. This has
already resulted in wild speculation. Last week, it was reported
that Shopping.com had paid $750,000 in cash and stock to buy its
domain name from the person who had registered it for $70.
</P>
<P>
   The yet-to-be-established oversight group would have the
authority to designate dozens of new top-level domains _ like
``.web'' or ``.store,'' for instance _ and would arbitrate disputes
between address-seekers.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet analysts said that the process itself represented a
significant first step toward the creation of a governing body for
the Internet independent of governments, trade associations, or
international bodies like the United Nations or the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Although it makes some traditional policy makers nervous,
self-governance is a model that is gaining support from a broad
spectrum of Internet users, including Ira Magaziner, the senior
White House advisor who oversaw the rocky evolution of the domain
name policy articulated in Friday's report.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, America Online's chairman, Steve Case, called for the
formation of an ``Internet Alliance'' to ``avoid outrageous local
and national laws that would strangle the growth of the medium.''
And European Union Commissioner Martin Bangemann has proposed an
international charter to deal with issues like data encryption.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of various forms of self-governance argue that the
medium is changing too rapidly to be effectively monitored by
typical governments and is too far-flung to be constrained by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is in the best interest of the Internet and the
best interest of the United States for this medium to grow and
become ubiquitous,'' Mr. Magaziner said. ``And the government's
getting out of the way of its management is the best way to achieve
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatched almost 30 years ago by the Defense Department as a
closed conduit for military and academic communications, the
network, under various names, has spawned prodigious progeny.
Today, the Internet is a global nervous system linking 30 million
host computers and an estimated 102 million users, according to
Matrix Information and Directory Services in Austin, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   And while the United States has long dominated the Internet, its
fastest growth is now in countries like the Netherlands and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's earlier plan drew criticism that despite
its assertions to the contrary, the United States was seeking to
exert too much control over how the Internet was run.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the plan's harshest critics were particularly
pleased with the Commerce Department's final report.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly shows the U.S. government heard the international
community and listened to them,'' said Don Heath, president of the
Internet Society, which has long overseen the technology of the
network. ``They showed they understood the dynamics of the
Internet, the need for bottom-up, grass-roots consensus building.
This is a victory for the Internet and a victory for
self-governance.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been withdrawing from the Internet since the
network began its exponential growth in the early 1990s. In 1992,
the government agreed to let commercial traffic use the Internet's
main pathway, known as the backbone. In 1995, it relinquished the
administration of the backbone to commercial entities.
</P>
<P>
   But it has always retained control of the critical function of
assigning addresses. Under a five-year contract with the National
Science Foundation, all registrations for the major Internet
domains are currently performed exclusively by Network Solutions of
Herndon, Va., which charges first-time registrants $70.
</P>
<P>
   When the Commerce Department issued a draft domain name policy
in January, many would-be competitors complained that it protected
Network Solutions' monopoly. Under the new plan, such companies
could compete with Network Solutions when its contract expires on
Sept. 30 _ if the nonprofit organization authorizes such
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent case the Prema Toy Co., which owns the trademarks
on the character Gumby and his horse, Pokey, sued a 12-year-old Web
designer whose parents had registered ``pokey.org'' because the
boy's nickname is Pokey.

HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS DELAYED BY FAA COMPUTER CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of flights were delayed early Friday
morning, some for more than an hour, as a computer system used by
controllers at an air-traffic control center on New York's Long
Island crashed during a software upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The problems arose as computer specialists from the Federal
Aviation Administration, working on the midnight shift, were
testing new software intended to fix a glitch in the computer
system that handles traffic around Newark (N.J.) International
Airport. But the technicians could not install the software
properly, and when they switched back to the old software, air
controllers' screens froze, said FAA spokesperson Arlene Salac.
</P>
<P>
   Some screens lost the data identifying planes by name, type,
destination and altitude. That forced the controllers to reduce
sharply the number of planes in the air to a number they could
track in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that from about 5:30 to 7:30 a.m., well into the
morning rush, controllers at the Terminal Radar Approach Control,
in Westbury, N.Y., had very limited data on their screens.
</P>
<P>
   Some screens froze, some showed only what the controllers call a
``splat,'' a set of digits that alternates between showing air
speed and altitude, but not identity, airplane type or destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the volume isn't too high, you can work airplanes
like that,'' said Dean Iacopelli, an official of the controllers'
union at the control center. ``Assuming good weather, which was
today, you could probably do two to four, but four would be about
the most you'd want to be fooling around with,'' said Iacopelli, of
the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure occurred at a time of day when a flood of planes
belonging to Federal Express, United Parcel Service and DHL arrives
at airports in the New York region, as well as red-eye passenger
flights from the West Coast, Iacopelli said. As a result, some
flights had to be told to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the worst nightmare, but it's a nightmare,'' said
Iacopelli. ``We've lost a pretty big tool of ours.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to preliminary data from the FAA, 153 departing planes
were delayed at Newark, for an average of 41 minutes and a maximum
of 86 minutes; 64 departing planes were delayed at New York's La
Guardia Airport for an average of 24 minutes and a maximum of 37,
and 5 planes were delayed at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, for
an average of 36 minutes and a maximum of 77. No delays were
reported at New York's Kennedy International Airport, which is also
handled by the Westbury control center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 24 planes arriving at La Guardia were delayed for
an average of 15 minutes. The FAA figures did not count airplanes
that were held on the ground in distant locations until the problem
was fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many other problems they've had,'' Ms. Salac said, ``they
don't know exactly what caused it.''
</P>
<P>
   But an official of the union that represents electronics
technicians at the control center where the problem occurred said
the cause had been identified. The official, Jimmy Anderson, of the
Professional Airways System Specialists, said that the software
engineers were trying to install a software patch on about 50
different workstations over a network, and that some of the
workstations accepted the new software while others were
``write-protected,'' like a floppy disk that has been set up not to
accept new data. Then they tried to run the system with two
different versions of the software, said Anderson, who worked the
midnight shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting all these printouts, `incorrect program
version, incorrect program version,''' Anderson said. In the end,
he said, managers decided to fix the problem terminal by terminal,
rather than shutting the whole system down for two or three minutes
and fixing them over the network.
</P>
<P>
   Software at the control center has been upgraded dozens of times
without problems. But around the country, the FAA has often created
major failures in its complicated, tightly linked systems when
trying to upgrade them.
</P>
<P>
   The patch in this case was for a new system called the
Convergence Runway Display Aid, which is supposed to make it easier
for controllers to let planes land and take off using two crossing
runways.

GERMANS MOURN VICTIMS, NOTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL EXCELLENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Harmut Fricke never used to think twice about hopping
on a high-speed Inter City Express train for business trips. But in
the wake of Germany's largest postwar train crash, Fricke was
wondering Friday whether to get on any train at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, I never had a strange feeling about getting on a
train,'' said Fricke, a 50-year-old tax consultant, watching a
gleaming, snub-nosed ICE train slide into Berlin's main train
station, Bahnhof Zoo. ``But my confidence is a little bit shaken.
So-called `German technological perfection' might not be so
perfect, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   As investigators pored over the twisted remains of the ICE 884
that crashed Wednesday, killing at least 96, Germany was plunged
into grief. Across the country, flags hung at half staff. Train
workers wore black armbands. Mourners laid flowers near the crash
site in the town of Eschede.
</P>
<P>
   But the country also is lamenting another loss: the once
unshakeable belief that Germany could create fast _ and safe _
trains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ICE is more than just a train. It is a symbol, almost a
myth,'' noted the Stuttgarter Zeitung, a daily newspaper in
southern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   From washing machines to vacuum cleaners, German industry has
prided itself on products that reflect the new Germany itself:
efficient, safe, and reliable. But when it came to automobiles and
trains, Germany added speed to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Germany and its industrial competitor, France, have
sought to create fast trains that could speed up travel on Europe's
far-ranging rail system. The German ICE can travel at 173 miles per
hour; France's TGV hits 186 miles per hour, railway officials say.
</P>
<P>
   This week's train crash has thrown these values into question.
The French and the Japanese, who also have high-speed trains, are
watching the investigation closely, wondering what the results will
mean for their rail service.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the crash was that a rear wheel broke off 3
or 4 miles before the train derailed and slammed into a road
overpass. Tons of concrete crashed into the train's middle section.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know if it was a failure of the train, the
tracks, or whatever,'' said Christian Hopper, a spokesman for
DeutscheBahn, or German Rail.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, German Rail idled 60 of its 104 ICE trains,
delaying hundreds of passengers. On the arrival board in Berlin,
nearly every arriving train had been marked either ``cancelled'' or
``delayed.''
</P>
<P>
   But few passengers complained. Instead, they stared at the
massive TV screen in the waiting room that bore a sobering message
of regret from German Rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grieve for the dead of Eschede, and we'd like to offer our
sympathies for people who got hurt and the families of the
victims,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, 133 million passengers have ridden on Germany's ICE
trains. While not used as extensively as cars or planes, trains are
used far more in Europe than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And train travel in Europe remains far more safe than driving.
In 1995, there were 44,000 road fatalities in the European Union
and 936 rail deaths, according to Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
   But that is little comfort to Silvia Kienitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't get on an ICE,'' sniffed the Berliner, who came to
the train station here to see a friend off. ``German technology
isn't as great as everybody thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash came as Germany was already deep into national
self-reflection, in an election year that is seeing the economy
steadily worsen. And the accident was the worst since June 1945,
when a train wreck claimed 102 lives.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the tangled train wreckage and the broken bodies were
everywhere, on the television and in the newspapers. Germans, as
they waited for trains, or waited in cafes, couldn't help but
reflect on the tragedy and the questions it raised.
</P>
<P>
   Some wondered why Germany needed to be so obsessed with speed.
``Why do things have to be faster and faster all the time?'' asked
Ursula Gensicke, 72, as she waited for her local, slow train
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankfurter Rundschau agreed. ``What to do?'' editorialized
the left-wing newspaper. ``Travel less. Go slower. Change the means
of transportation. Stay at home. All thinkable, some of it
feasible.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed promises to become a political issue this summer, when the
Bundestag, or parliament, will discuss a proposed new
Berlin-Hamburg train. The Green Party hopes to halt the project,
arguing faster trains simply aren't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But many Germans said that while they've lost their illusions
about safety on fast-speed train, they haven't lost their faith in
train travel, overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite this horrible accident, the train is the most secure
means of transport,'' said Gila Altman, the transport spokesman for
the Green Party. ``We can't be 100 percent sure of it, but that
doesn't mean we should look for another technology.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, the nervous Harmut Fricke decided to board his
train, an ICE to Hannover, not far from the scene of the crash.

   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ Blaming an industrywide slump in
semiconductor prices and the Asian currency crisis, Diodes Inc.
said Friday it expects to post ``significantly lower''
second-quarter earnings than it did in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to say precisely how far this quarter's results
will fall, said spokesman Philip Bourdillon. ``We chose to say
`significantly' _ that's as precise as we can go at this point with
three weeks left in the quarter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to release the second-quarter results during
the week of July 27.
</P>
<P>
   Those results will reflect a downward trend the company also saw
in its first quarter, when per-share earnings fell by 3 cents from
fourth-quarter 1997 results to 22 cents ($1.2 million).
</P>
<P>
   Second quarter 1997 net income had been $1.2 million, or 23
cents per diluted share, on sales of $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because these adverse market conditions are still with us and
have in fact been more severe in the first two months of the second
quarter, we expect second-quarter earnings to be significantly
lower than earnings in the first quarter,'' company President
Michael Rosenberg said in a statement from Westlake Village
northwest of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock closed Friday at 7 3/4 (one-eighth, down 3/4
(three-quarters).

   CHICAGO-THEATER (Chicago) _ Even though the second-largest,
after New York, Chicago's theater community is probably the
nation's most tightly knit, arguably its most adventurous and
almost certainly its most important incubator of young talent. By
Bruce Weber. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY-SEASON-PLAYS (New York) _ There were occasions during
the recent New York theater season, which is celebrated by the
presentation of Sunday night's Tony Awards, when the gasp sound
flew out of audiences who had achieved a rapt, respectful communion
with what was happening on the stages before them. The inspirations
for these abrupt responses, which are surely more gratifying to
actors than even standing ovations, are wildly varied and, taken

   BALZAC-FILMS (Undated) _ Suddenly, movie makers are landing on
Planet Balzac. On Friday, two films on the French writer Honore de
Balzax, representing two extremes of his oeuvre, are opening. One
is ``Passion in the Desert,'' an impressionistic allegory that has
been adapted by the American director Lavinia Currier for her first
feature from an eight-page short story of 1830. The other is a new
adaptation of ``Cousin Bette,'' the sprawling 1847 drama of manners
that is one of Balzac's best-known novels; this movie is the first
to be directed by the Tony-winning theater director Des McAnuff
(``Big River,'' ``The Who's `Tommy' ''). By Jean Nathan. (Moved).

   AMERICAN-DANCE-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ One of the most significant

little-known contributions of black choreographers to American
modern dance. The festival, in Durham, N.C., will continue the

   ARIANNA-OPERA (New York) _ ``Arianna,'' which will be given its
first American performance Sunday by the Opera Theater of St.
Louis, is not exactly a new work and not exactly an old one. Quite
who wrote it is also in doubt. According to the title page of the
score, it is a ``lost opera by Claudio Monteverdi ... composed
again by Alexander Goehr,'' the English composer who, now 65, has
steadily been gaining a reputation for music at once serious and
playful, beautiful and quirky, as this is. By Paul Griffiths.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HEADLINE-OPERA (Undated) _ The fad for headline opera, a genre
that began so promisingly in 1987 with John Adams's ``Nixon in
China'' and fizzled last year with Michael Daugherty's ``Jackie
O,'' seems to have passed. Breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that
we have been spared operas based on O.J., Tonya and Paula. Yet a
new recording of ``Harvey Milk'' (Teldec 0630-15856-2; two CDs),
with music by Stewart Wallace and libretto by Michael Korie, shows
that the attempt to link the opera house to the nightly news may
have been a missed opportunity rather than a cynical marketing
strategy. By David Schiff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRAHMS-BIO (Undated) _ Some biographers see clearly. They keep
their affections in tow and tell the unpleasant facts. Jan
Swafford's ``Jo- hannes Brahms'' (Alfred A. Knopf) does this, at
least to a point. What Swafford writes about Brahms and the people
around him rarely flinches from the fact that the great German
composer was in many ways not a nice man at all. By Bernard

course. It's about the Senate racket hearings, the civil rights
movement, presidential campaigns, power plays and the Vietnam War.
But the personal side of Kennedy, who was assassinated in Los

   SEINFELD-SCRIPTS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ As they say on television,

quintessentially self-involved quartet from ``Seinfeld'' went the

D'AMATO ROUSES GOP WITH CROSSOVER ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six years after vowing not to run for office again, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato accepted the unanimous nomination of state Republican Party
leaders for a fourth term Friday, then launched into a rousing
speech salted with traditionally Democratic themes and appeals to
crossover voters.
</P>
<P>
   On the concluding day of the party's two-day convention in
Manhattan, D'Amato's high-test performance seemed intended to
energize party workers who had grown bored with the crisply
orchestrated event and to remind his supporters about the dangers
of complacency, particularly when the top of their ticket, Gov.
George Pataki, is well ahead in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, D'Amato seemed supremely confident, strutting into the
convention hall like a triumphant homecoming king to the brassy
strains of the theme music to ``Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as party operatives led raucous chants of ``Six more
years'' and ``Al gets it done,'' D'Amato recounted a list of
accomplishments that he said made him the most effective senator in
Congress _ from getting mass transit funds for New York City to
helping women with breast cancer to closing a polluting incinerator
in Nassau County. It seemed clear from his speech and those
nominating him that effectiveness would be a core theme for his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day in and day out, people are saying: `You know what? We may
not agree with Al D'Amato on lots of issues _ even my mother
doesn't _ but you want to know something? He is a fighter, he cares
for the people, he makes a difference,''' said D'Amato, who
discarded his prepared text to speak extemporaneously for much of
the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the delegates unanimously designated Bruce
Blakeman, the presiding officer of the Nassau County Legislature,
as candidate for state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the convention nominated Pataki for a second term
as governor; Mary Donohue, a state Supreme Court justice, for
lieutenant governor; and Dennis Vacco for a second term as attorney
general. Unlike the Democrats, who are facing primaries for every
statewide seat except comptroller, the Republicans will have none.
</P>
<P>
   Though the hall at the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers was
filled with party officials from across the state, D'Amato's
remarks in many ways seemed intended for an audience outside the
building: the centrist, suburban swing voters who could determine
the outcome of a close race.
</P>
<P>
   His 30-minute speech was notably devoid of any attacks on the
Democratic Party or the three Democrats seeking to run against him
_ Geraldine Ferraro, Mark Green and Charles Schumer. Though he made
passing reference to traditional Republican issues like crime and
taxes, he talked more emotionally about fighting for the
environment, against insurance companies and on behalf of women.
There was no mention of abortion, which D'Amato would ban, and no
attacks on the New York State United Teachers, the powerful
teachers' union, which he had made a target months before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care whether it's Democrats or epublicans that I have
to work on, and with,'' he said. ``Party politics should not stop
us from doing the business of the people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But D'Amato's would-be Democratic rivals derided the
Republican's bipartisanship and centrist talk as hollow
opportunism. Schumer, a congressman from Brooklyn and Queens,
accused D'Amato of aligning himself with ``right-wing extremists''
in Congress to cut Medicare and education funding and block gun
control. Ferraro, the former congresswoman and vice-presidential
candidate, described him as ``squarely in the pocket of the special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   And Green, the New York City public advocate, said, ``We need a
senator who thinks that economic security is more than an
overflowing campaign war chest.'' D'Amato has raised more than $17
million for his campaign, and the party held two fund-raisers
Thursday night that were expected to raise $1 million more for the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato called the attacks on his ethics ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato helps his friends _ oh, shocking,'' he said with
high-pitched mock horror to the delegates. ``That must be something
that is anti-American. Well let me tell you something. If a friend
comes and if an industry that is vital to New York and to this
nation needs help, you better believe it I'm going to stand up.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ELMONT, N.Y. _ Horse racing is ``the sport of kings,'' but Mike
Pegram, the multimillionaire who owns Triple Crown aspirant Real
Quiet, seems anything but aristocratic.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He typically wears jeans, cowboy boots and a golf shirt, almost
never wears ties. He drinks Budweiser often and French champagne
only when ``there's a woman involved.''
</P>
<P>
   He's a college dropout who's so unsophisticated that some New
York racing writers have called him ``a character out of Hee Haw.''
The blue-eyed Pegram contributes to the image by describing
himself, in a country drawl, as ``a little guy racing the back
roads.''
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seems possible those roads have led to New York and a
$5 million bonus from Visa if Real Quiet captures the Triple Crown.
The 3-year-old colt can do it by winning the 1{-mile Belmont Stakes
today at 4:27 p.m. CDT (Ch. 13).
</P>
<P>
   Pegram has invited some 200 friends and relatives to accompany
him at the Triple Crown coronation. He's providing hotel rooms and
catered meals.
</P>
<P>
   He knows what it's like to be a hanger-on. He was here last year
as Bob Baffert's friend, cheering on Silver Charm, the winner of
the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram is very much a man of the people. While the other owners
were up in their booths at Churchill Downs, he watched the Derby
from the ground floor, huddling with the masses in front of a
television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having trouble getting in position to see it,'' he said.
``I had to yell, `Hey, I got a horse in this race.'''
</P>
<P>
   He would not allow the post-Derby picture-taking ceremony to
begin until his entourage had assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth holding up the winner's circle to get my friends
in it,'' he said. ``When you've got the fastest horse and you have
your friends with you, you're on top of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't forgotten those on the bottom. Upon arriving in
Long Island on Wednesday, he headed for the Ronald McDonald House
to promote care for ill and needy children. Last week, he announced
he would donate all royalties from Real Quiet's merchandising
rights to Ronald McDonald House Charities.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram, 46 and a divorced father of two grown children, grew up
in Princeton, Ind., and has been a sports fan since his boyhood
days, when he ``skipped school to go to Churchill Downs.''
</P>
<P>
   He also played basketball and baseball and was scouted by
major-league teams before a severe hamstring injury ended his
athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, he moved with his father, Jim, to California and
opened a couple of McDonald's franchises. He began racing horses in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram relocated to the state of Washington, where he put
together a string of 22 McDonald's while continuing his racing
business. When he entered a quarter-horse deal in 1987, Baffert was
the trainer, and the two men became friends.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram soon persuaded Baffert to switch to thoroughbreds, and
they began assembling a moderately priced stable that has expanded
to 60 horses.
</P>
<P>
   Until Real Quiet began making noise, Pegram's most notable horse
was Isitingood, who broke Dr. Fager's revered record of 1:32 for a
mile. By the way, Pegram has a penchant for giving his horses
provocative names, such as Straight to Bed and Zippersup.
</P>
<P>
   As for Real Quiet, he was bred in Florida and cost Pegram only
$17,000. Real Quiet's sire, Quiet American, was no Triple Crown
threat; his biggest win was the NYRA Mile at Aqueduct. Real Quiet's
dam, Believe It, earned only $31,000 in her racing career.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the colt's pedigree unexciting, he was scrawny,
with crooked legs. Said his breeder, Colombian-born Eduardo
Gaviria: ``It was the cheapest price I ever got for a horse, but I
was happy. I was almost sure he was going to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Most horsemen are happy to see Pegram succeed with a horse
everyone thought would fail.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he would feel about Real Quiet completing his triple
play, David Cross, who trains Belmont entry Classic Cat, said, ``I
would love to see the owner win it.'' Then he added, for emphasis,
``the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a jab at Baffert, the trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Cross and other horsemen resent the fact that Baffert shows up
later at the barn than most trainers and is quick to claim credit
for his horses' success. His wisecracking ways and showmanship also
annoy the sport's traditionalists, such as the 62-year-old Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in some of his antics,'' Cross told the New
York Daily News. ``I think it makes a mockery of things. Some of
his statements are pretty stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody has harsh words for Pegram, who charms people with
his self-deprecating humor.
</P>
<P>
   He loves to mention his fondness for cold beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't drink coffee,'' he said. ``I start the morning with
Diet Coke and work my way on up.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't enjoy his recent flight from Phoenix (where he owns a
home), because the flight attendant cut him off after two beers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said my face was red,'' Pegram said. ``I said, `Your face
is supposed to be red when you're leaving Arizona.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram's partying ways occasionally activate a case of gout. But
of course, that doesn't stop him. He's having too much fun.
</P>
<P>
   As he put it: ``Every morning, I wake up and look in the mirror
and I say, `I'm the luckiest (guy) God put on this earth. Who could
be having more fun than me?'''

RETIRED JUDGE, 89, RETURNS TO COLLEGE
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph DiFede hunched over a desk in his spartan
chambers at State Supreme Court in the Bronx and began mulling over
why, at this stage of his life, he decided to become a candidate
for a master's degree in history at the University of Rochester. He
is 89.
</P>
<P>
   A former judge of the New York State Supreme Court who has been
a hearing officer since retiring in 1985, he may have been inspired
by another former judge, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. When Holmes was
in his 90s, so the story goes, he learned ancient Greek so he could
read Plato in the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that was what drove me, or maybe it was that I don't
like to leave things unfinished,'' he said. ``I did all the course
work for the degree in the 1930s, but I never followed through and
wrote a thesis. Maybe it's that I have more free time now, or maybe
it's that as you grow older you look back and think of what you'd
like to do that you didn't get around to doing earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   So Friday, DiFede stood before a panel of two unsmiling
historians and a political scientist on the third floor of the Rush
Rhees Library on the Rochester campus. It took him about 20 minutes
to explain his paper on the ambiguities and contradictions of the
Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, better known as the
Taft-Hartley law. Then he was grilled for about 40 minutes, coolly
explaining such esoterica as Provision 883 and its political
nuances.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph DiFede, who was born in Sicily and moved with his family
to Rochester in 1924, had graduated from the University of
Rochester with a degree in mathematics in 1933 and planned to do
graduate work in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 1933 was the year that Roosevelt took office,'' he said.
``That was a very exciting time, and math seemed just too
confining. I've always been interested in history and current
events, so I dropped math and from 1933 to 1935 I did the course
work for an M.A. degree in history.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, DiFede was elected to the state Assembly in Rochester,
but as a Democrat in a Republican district he was defeated the next
year. He earned a law degree and a doctorate at St. John's
University, specializing in labor and administrative law. He was
chief labor officer for the military government in Italy during
World War II. In 1955 Gov. Averell Harriman named him chairman of
the New York State Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   From that time on, DiFede was wrapped up in politics (he ran
unsuccessfully for New York City controller in 1961) and was
appointed a judge in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   After retirement, he began thinking about that unfinished M.A.,
and this year wrote to Thomas Jackson, the president of the
University of Rochester, asking whether he could use a law review
article he had written some years ago as a thesis.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, came the reply, but he would have to present the article
to the history faculty and defend it.
</P>
<P>
   After the defense, he was asked to step into the hallway while
the professors deliberated _ for a minute. ``It never takes long
when it goes well,'' said Robert Westbrook, chairman of the
department of history.
</P>
<P>
   The three professors marched into the hallway and congratulated
the graduate. ``Now,'' said Westbrook, ``we'd like to have you
enter our Ph.D. program.''

<P>
   MONTCLAIR, N.J. _ They filled the brand new Yogi Berra Stadium
Friday to watch a team that did not exist until this year and that
plays in a league few have even heard of.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The game was baseball, and for the fans who turned
out to see the fledgling New Jersey Jackals take on the
Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs, that was enough to fill every seat.
</P>
<P>
   Minor league baseball, a game that used to evoke languid summer
afternoons on pine board bleachers in some smiley rural corner, has
moved in force into the teeming suburbs of metropolitan New York.
It is nourished by nostalgia for a simpler version of a game
dominated by major league millionaires, and is financed by wealthy
businessmen with time and money to play out a childhood dream.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, 15 professional minor league teams, of widely
varying quality and affiliation, have been formed or have moved
into the populous region loosely bounded by Albany, Hartford and
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   At their home opener Friday night, the Jackals had Berra
himself, the baseball sage and their stadium's namesake, to throw
out the first ball. But he was about the only link to the more
famous franchise in the Bronx, and that seemed to suit the fans
just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 15 minutes from home, I bought a season ticket for $8 a
game and I'm practically sitting on the field,'' said George Rauth,
who brought his 8-year-old grandson. ``It would cost me $8 just to
park at Yankee Stadium.'' (It's $6, to be precise.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, major league owners helped create the minor-league boom
by forcing their farm teams to acquire newer, safer stadiums or
move. Municipalities, eager for new tax revenue or just hoping to
put a few more people on downtown streets after dark, have courted
the new teams with money and tax breaks. Nine new stadiums have
been built in the region since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra Stadium was built by Floyd Hall, the chairman of
Kmart Corp. and a resident of Montclair, who spent $15 million on
the ballpark and an attached complex of two ice rinks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the 172 minor league baseball clubs affiliated with
Major League Baseball sold 34.7 million tickets last year, compared
with 30 million in 1950, when there were 400 teams.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the region's 15 new teams are affiliated with the
major leagues, which has trademarked the term ``Minor League
Baseball.'' The others belong either to the 3-year-old Northeast
League, or this year's rookie, the Atlantic League, whose five
teams have only three stadiums among them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden interest? Team owners and club managers point to
a robust economy, the bargain basement admission prices and easy
access. Above all, they credit the mood of baby boomers as their
nests fill up.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound too philosophical, but for years our
society had gotten away from the family doing things together, and
people want to get back to that,'' said Peter Kirk, a partner in
three minor league teams in Maryland who is recognized as an expert
in marketing minor league baseball. ``It's nostalgia for the old
ball game, and minor league baseball is just tapping in to that.
It's something the family can do together.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What the casual fans get for the $2 parking and $8 box seats is
an intimate ball park with seating for 4,000 fans that is so close
to the game that the manager's hollering reaches the stands, along
with an atmosphere designed to have almost as much circus as
baseball to it. Children race the clumsy mascot around the bases
between innings (the mascot always loses), comedy acts like Myron
Noodleman, professional nerd, or Brackney's Mad Cap Mutts entertain
during the seventh-inning stretch, and commercial promotions erupt
at all times under the guise of crowd participation games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They come here and they see a dog catching Frisbees between
innings'' _ that would be Brackney and his dogs _ ``and you give
all the kids a baseball bat and that kind of makes it for them,''
said Tony Torre, general manager of the New Jersey Cardinals, a
farm team of the National League's St. Louis Cardinals, which moved
to New Jersey from Hamilton, Ontario, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans at Friday night's game in Montclair also brought
bitter memories of the 1994 baseball strike and its canceled World
Series. Winfield and Tracy Parsons, sitting in the $6 bench seats,
came in part to show their sons Scott and Daniel a game played by
hungry young dreamers earning an average of $900 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely had it with the majors, a bunch of overpaid
crybabies,'' said Parsons, who teaches at Montclair State College.
``I want my kids to start getting their baseball experience in a
place like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parsons favored the practical. ``Where else can I take my
family out for an evening of good, clean fun for $26? The movies
cost more than this.''

   Dutch may be only way to go
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Going Dutch seems to have taken on a whole new meaning lately.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it has been the abundantly talented Netherlands team
that somehow finds a way to fall short of expectations at the World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Going Dutch, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, fans of this traditional power bemoan the
apparently unstoppable 1974 Dutch team that sailed into the World
Cup final only to turn in a nervous, sloppy performance and lose to
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the Dutch again looked unbeatable, but once
into the Cup final again collapsed in a 3-1 loss to Argentina.
Similar disappointments occurred in 1982 and 1986.
</P>
<P>
   And ever since, going Dutch in the World Cup has meant going
belly up when the pressure was on.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the Netherlands enters the World Cup on a
tremendous roll, with a new coach, a veteran team, a superstar
scorer in Denis Bergkamp and an overall confidence that should help
it finally live up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   One opposing coach even has said of this Dutch team that it now
has an, ``over-my-dead-body'' approach to the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, then once-proud Mexico seems to have taken
on the role of the team that needs life support.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it is the Mexicans who have gone Dutch. They are
spiraling out of control downward, with no apparent hope for a
turnaround in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a contender for the Cup and ranked as high as
No. 4 in the world, Mexico has struggled so badly of late that
earlier this week it even lost to VfL Wolfsburg, a mediocre German
Bundesliga team that had finished 14th in the First Division this
year. The score was 4-1. A humiliating rout.
</P>
<P>
   In previous World Cup tune-up matches, Mexico was embarrassed
5-2 by Norway and lost to a pair of under-23 teams, one from
Argentina and the other from Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how this sudden and spectacular free fall has occurred
for Mexico is anyone's guess. It never should have happened.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that looked as talented as ever only a few months
ago, with such proven stars as goalie Jorge Campos and goal-scorer
Carlos Hermosillo. Only last year it was a team that was creative
and successful in every way en route to taking control of the
CONCACAF World Cup qualifying group.
</P>
<P>
   But even before coach Bora Milutinovic was replaced by Manuel
Lapuente earlier this year, things began to unravel. Defense turned
weak and few opportunities were converted into goals.
</P>
<P>
   One Mexican national newspaper already has called for the team
to pull out of the World Cup altogether and come home now to avoid
further humiliation. Another Mexican newspaper had only a one-word
headline following the loss to VfL Wolfsburg: ``Pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are looking grim for the proud Mexican team.
</P>
<P>
   But what Mexico's apparent collapse means for the remaining
teams in Group E is that the Dutch should only gain confidence
during the first stage, while Belgium likely will distinguish
itself as the second-best team in the group and South Korea might
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans, in fact, considers themselves as contenders
to win the group, but realistically they should set lower
standards. Like winning their first-ever World Cup game.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally a tough if overmatched team, South Korea has but
two draws to show for what will be its fourth World Cup appearance.
Since it is co-hosting the next Cup in 2002 with Japan, the Koreans
will be inspired to prove they belong.
</P>
<P>
   However, the team most likely to step into Mexico's position as
a second-place contender in the group behind the favored Dutch is
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that always seems to be underrated, but has
reached at least the second round of the World Cup four consecutive
times. In 1986, Belgium was but one spectacular Maradona goal away
from upsetting Argentina and making it to the final.
</P>
<P>
   Now, coach Georges Leekens has picked up the offensive pace and
emphasized more daring passing. The biggest reason Leekens changed
strategies for this defensive-minded team was because the Belgians
were drawn into the Dutch group and the Dutch have dominated
Belgium the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dutch favored, the South Koreans still a bit
overmatched and Mexico on the slide, the opportunity for another
appearance in the second round certainly is there for Belgium if it
can get the offense rolling.

100 MEDIA TYPES MOB NOMO AT FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hideo Nomo's first official duty as a Met took place
atop the third-base dugout at Fenway Park Friday night, where the
Japanese pitcher sat with his legs dangling while more than 100
reporters, photographers and camera operators crowded around the
steps. It was a strange scene, made stranger by the Red Sox fans
who barely uttered a word, but it was also a glimpse at what
Nomomania can mean for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added another marquee name from the Los Angeles Dodgers
when they acquired Nomo and reliever Brad Clontz for the struggling
starter Dave Mlicki and setup man Greg McMichael late Thursday and
then unveiled him before their first interleague contest of the
season. It was an odd place for a news conference, but the Mets,
who have seriously boosted their image since getting Mike Piazza,
Nomo's catcher with the Dodgers, last month, trumpeted their new
player in an unusual manner because there was no other place to
accommodate such a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be here,'' Nomo said through an interpreter. ``I
needed a change of scenery. I'm being reunited with people who
understand me. This is a contending team and we have a chance to do
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Nomo be critical to the Mets' pursuit of a postseason
berth? Is he better than the pitcher who was 2-7 with a 5.05 earned
run average so far this season? The Mets feel that Nomo can
resurrect a career that included the Rookie of the Year Award in
1995, which is why they were eager to trade for the 29-year-old
right-hander, even though they have routinely praised Mlicki's
repertory and will miss McMichael in the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had told me we had Mike Piazza and Hideo Nomo, I would
have called you crazy,'' general manager Steve Phillips said. ``I
wouldn't have believed you.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine, who has scheduled Nomo to start against
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on Tuesday at Shea Stadium, added,
``There's probably 20 days he's going to go out there for us. We've
had 10 of those days taken up and we've won one game. I'm very
confident he is going to win more games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are confident because they believe Dave Wallace, a
senior adviser who used to be Nomo's pitching coach in Los Angeles,
can help him, they believe the presence of the first-year Met
Masato Yoshii, a Japanese pitcher who is Nomo's best friend, will
be a positive influence, and, besides, they do not think that
Nomo's season has been a total fiasco. A close analysis of the
statistics reveals that Nomo has not performed as terribly in 1998
as the numbers seemingly indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo allowed seven earned runs in two-thirds of an inning
against the Cubs. Eliminate that performance and his ERA with the
Dodgers would have been 4.16. He also had three starts in which he
gave up only six earned runs in 23 innings, yet was 0-2 with a
no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time for him to get back,'' Piazza
said. ``He's not going to go out there and throw a no-hitter the
next time out. You got to walk before you can run. We just need him
to be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nomo was asked why he has slumped this season, he said,
``Simply put, I'm getting hit.'' When he was asked if he knew why
he has had a subpar season so far, he answered, ``If I knew the
answer, I would be shutting people out.'' Nomo would not address
why his relationship with the Dodgers soured so dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   After watching videotapes of Nomo, Wallace said, ``Your sense is
that not much has changed. He's a true professional. Maybe it's
psychological.''
</P>
<P>
   One general manager said that Nomo has lost velocity on his
fastball and scouts indicated that he has struggled with the
command of his forkball, but the same general manager added, ``It's
taking somewhat of a chance, but most people would be willing to
take that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo had calcium deposits removed from his right elbow last Oct.
7, but Phillips said the Dodgers provided a full physical report on
him and the Mets do not consider the injury an issue. The Mets were
somewhat fortunate to get Nomo, who is wearing the No. 16 last worn
by Dwight Gooden, because the Orioles and Indians were both
negotiating heavily with the Dodgers before dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad I'm in a situation where we have the chance to
win,'' Nomo said. ``The ultimate goal is to get to the World
Series.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE HERO NEEDS HELP THIS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Michael Jordan seemed unusually testy yesterday
morning. Perhaps it was the pressure of trailing the Utah Jazz in
the NBA finals after losing the opening game of the series. But it
could very well have been the questions about whether his skills
were eroding.
</P>
<P>
   When one reporter asked whether Jordan was confident, given the
fact that the Chicago Bulls had been extended to a seventh game by
Indiana and beaten Wednesday by the Jazz, Jordan rolled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the question is more relevant than Jordan may want to
admit. He can no longer take over games at will and with each
successive performance appears more and more vulnerable. Jordan
needs help. He may have difficulty accepting it.
</P>
<P>
   Like the typical hero, Jordan responds to impending doom by
assuming an even greater responsibility. There's a thin line
between heroism and selfishness. But who can criticize Michael
Jordan?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has saved the day, carried the load, so many times. He
helped bring five National Basketball Association championships to
a city that a decade ago felt it might never win one. Now, driven
by his mission, Jordan may be the last to grasp his barely
discernible slide from deity to mortal.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls coach Phil Jackson tried to get Jordan out of the game at
a crucial juncture Wednesday night, but Jordan talked his way back
in. When Jordan was promptly beaten by Jeff Hornacek, Utah's
injured guard, Jackson snatched him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling incident occurred after Scottie Pippen
culminated a great rally by nailing a 3-pointer that tied the score
with 2 minutes 34 seconds left in regulation. Jordan had scored on
the Bulls' two previous possessions.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to the bench, Jordan could be seen yelling at
Pippen for failing to recognize that Jordan had a mismatch in the
post on Hornacek. In previous championship runs, such combustion
has served as octane for the Bulls. This time, the Bulls lost in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an inner strength and confidence,'' Jordan said. ``One
game does not deteriorate that.'' He added: ``One game does not
dictate how this series is going to end. If you want to write us
off, go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because of Jordan, everyone is reluctant to write off
the Bulls. Now the issue is not one game but an accumulation of
games and years of improbable expectations met and exceeded.
Meanwhile, the Bulls' bench sits and seethes and listens. Utah's
bench is heralded; Chicago's bench, outscored by Utah's, 22-8, is
cited as the reason the Bulls' empire may be about to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would their bench be coming off their bench if they had
Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman?'' said Scott
Burrell, a backup Bulls forward. ``We have three of the greatest
players ever; you can't look for a lot of minutes on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Chicago is to win a sixth championship, Jackson knows he
must find minutes somewhere. Even if they come out of Jordan's
stash.
</P>
<P>
   Stamina, a great ally throughout Jordan's career, is giving way
to fatigue. He is shooting 37 percent in the fourth quarters of his
last six playoff games. He made three fourth-quarter turnovers in
Game 4 against Indiana; a 24-second violation in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   As great as Oscar Robertson was, one lingering scene from the
end of his career was Jo Jo White and Don Chaney running him into
the ground in the NBA finals. There are similar memories of other
athletes: Muhammad Ali being punished by Larry Holmes, Willie Mays
falling down in the field as a Met.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is seasons away from that sort of dramatic decline,
though in an ideal world he would retire after this season and
leave memories of triumphant heroism.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls management would love for Jordan to return; so would the
NBA. But for Jordan, the work environment would very likely be
dramatically altered: no Pippen, no Rodman, no Jackson. Jordan
might be reduced to a novelty act with no hope of winning a
championship. Just playing to be playing. Gunslinging.
</P>
<P>
   Allow Jordan the chance to fall and burn, then hope he rises
from the ashes like the phoenix to bring forth a final
championship.
</P>
<P>
   This quest represents the last great challenge of Jordan's
career. The nature of it is unlike anything Jordan has faced.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it so daunting is that the force Jordan must overcome
is Jordan. The pride, the ego, the vanity of the hero giving way
ever so slightly to a supporting cast that may well be a life raft.
</P>

NEW PORSCHE 911 DIFFERS IN STYLING, COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Porsche has done it again; if you thought the last 911 was good,
if you thought (as I did) that the Boxster was about as perfect a
car as you'd want, prepare to change your mind. A brief tour of the
new 911 _ Type 996 _ would indicate that ``best'' title has a new
car under it.
</P>
<P>
   The new 911, a 1999 model, comes as Carrera Coupe or Cabriolet
with a 296-horsepower (258 ft/lb torque), 3.4-liter, six-cylinder,
water-cooled, boxer engine. It is the first water-cooled engine in
a 911 and employs two radiators with electrically powered fans. The
new Carrera with six-speed manual gearbox is $65,030, with
five-speed Tiptronic, $68,450. The convertible is $74,460 with
manual, $77,880 with Tiptronic. Tiptronic is Porsche's dual-mode
automatic that either works as full automatic or is shifted
manually with fingertip controls on the steering wheel. As usual
with Porsche, the option list is long, offering the possibility of
ordering something unique _ and exceedingly expensive. The basic
equipment ought to satisfy most drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Coupe comes with an electrically operated sunroof; the
Cabriolet's ragtop folds out of sight automatically in 20 seconds
at the touch of a button.
</P>
<P>
   The car differs substantially from its predecessor model in
styling, comfort, and handling. Acceleration is still
neck-snapping; cornering ability is phenomenal. A day's tour in a
new 911 leaves one panting for more time behind the wheel. The
911's rude habit of educating drivers through sudden oversteer was
corrected several incarnations ago; the newest model introduces a
level of forgiveness unheard of in a Porsche with the latest in
traction control and antiskid electronics.
</P>
<P>
   And this year Porsche offers a wheeled accessory _ a mountain
bike. Actually two mountain bikes, the S for $2,250 and the FS for
$4,500 _ if you forget to refuel in your exuberance behind the
wheel, now you can pedal in style for a can of gas. I do not know
if Porsche offers a matching gas can with the Porsche crest, but
maybe they should.

BOXING'S `D-DAY' SHOT DOWN BY VIRUSES, PREGNANCY AND CHILD
SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The night of fights at Madison Square Garden, once
one of boxing's glamorous stages, had been advertised as ``D-Day''
_ a mix of bouts that included Evander Holyfield, the heavyweight
champion, Roberto Duran, an aging legend, and Christy Martin, the
world's top-rated female boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite weeks of promotion, the fights had failed to generate
much excitement, and Friday the event unraveled completely after a
series of strange developments: two fighters tested positive for
hepatitis, a female boxer turned out to be pregnant and promoters
were ordered by a Florida court to withhold any payment to Duran
because he owed thousands of dollars in unpaid child support.
</P>
<P>
   And so barely 24 hours before D-Day was to start, boxing and
Garden officials stepped in to cancel Saturday's event and postpone
the fights indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The concluding episode to the troubled event proved yet again
the sport's ability to provide the unexpected and to provoke
questions about basic safety.
</P>
<P>
   Don King, one of the fight's promoters, said he fully expected
some people would believe the problems were staged so he and others
might limit the financial damage of a loser of a fight card.
</P>
<P>
   For the Garden, which had a riot break out in the ring during a
major night of fights two years ago, this was the latest setback to
its bid to make boxing a profitable enterprise in the city.
Instead, Garden officials were left to announce refunds, while
Showtime, the cable television network, was canceling orders for
tens of thousands of pay-per-view orders.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the night, one of the more unusual tales of the
tape read this way: Henry Akinwande, the World Boxing Association's
top heavyweight contender and the man set to take on Holyfield, had
been diagnosed with hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver
damage and which can be transmitted through blood; Ray Mercer,
another heavyweight, had been diagnosed with hepatitis A, a milder
form of the disease that his manager said he contracted by eating a
salad; Maria Nieves Garcia, the fighter slated to box Christy
Martin, was found to be 21 weeks pregnant; and Duran, the
46-year-old Panamanian, was set to see a state court judge in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring the best boxing to New York City,'' said Paul
Munick, the Garden's director of athletics. Munick cited several
recent successful events, but conceded ``it's got its ups and
downs.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest financial losers for the moment are the fighters.
Holyfield will not receive his $10 million purse, and Akinwande
won't get his $2.5 million. The Garden, as well as Don King
Productions, the promoters, will not collect the gate receipts and
concession revenues they were going to share. And all money spent
by the promoters and Showtime, the television company that was
offering the fight on pay-per-view for $39.95, will only have value
if the fights are staged again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this is just a small hiccup, Akinwande will be able
to fight, and all this will create more interest for the fight,''
said Mark Greenberg, an executive vice president of Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   The only other heavyweight fight canceled so close to fight time
was the February 1996 bout between Tommy Morrison and Arthur
Weathers, which was canceled hours before the match when Morrison's
blood test revealed that he had tested positive for the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, whose share of weird boxing moments includes having
part of his ear bit off by Mike Tyson and having a paraglider drop
into the ring in the seventh round of his fight against Riddick
Bowe in 1993, said he was headed back to Atlanta to see his two
children compete in a track meet, while Akinwande, who could be out
of boxing for as long as six months, returned to his training camp
in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's disappointing,'' Holyfield said. ``I've been
training hard for 13 weeks. This kind of thing is worst when it
happens the day before the fight. I can't control what happens. You
just have to roll with the punches. That's part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Athletic Commission, the state's regulatory
agency, administered a blood test to Akinwande on Tuesday
afternoon, checking him for HIV, as well as hepatitis B and C,
according to Tony Russo, the commission's executive director.
California, Texas and Maryland are the only other states that test
boxers for hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Donald Kaminsky of the Albert Einstein Medical
Center, who studied Akinwande's blood sample for the commission,
the disease was at the infectious stage, and could be transmitted
through body fluids or blood. Hepatitis B, which is contracted by
roughly 300,000 people in the United States annually, is typically
passed along through sex or dirty hypodermic needles, but can also
be transmitted by something as innocent as a shared toothbrush.

AIG BOOSTS HOLDINGS IN 20TH CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DEBORAH ADAMSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Four years ago, when 20th Century Industries found
itself in dire straits following the rush of claims after the
Northridge Earthquake, another insurer helped keep it afloat.
</P>
<P>
   American International Group, or AIG, a New York-based
commercial insurer, gave $200 million to 20th Century in exchange
for preferred stock and warrants. If the preferred stock was
converted into common shares and warrants were exercised, AIG would
own 40 percent of the Los Angeles-based insurer.
</P>
<P>
   This week, AIG disclosed it had bought 557,500 20th Century
common shares in the open market at prices ranging from $28.25 to
$29. Adding the shares to ones AIG had been buying in the last few
months, plus the preferred stock and warrants, AIG now controls
37.9 million shares _ or 43.2 percent _ of 20th Century.
</P>
<P>
   AIG shows no signs of slowing down. In April, it disclosed in
SEC filings that it could boost its stake to more than 50 percent,
effectively gaining control of 20th Century. Furthermore, an
agreement limiting AIG's ownership of the insurer expired in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're buying into it a piece at a time,'' said Steve
Cesinger, managing director at Greif &AMP; Co., a Los Angeles-based
investment banking firm. ``It would save (them) 30 to 40 percent in
stock premiums.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, by slowly buying a controlling interest one
handful of shares at a time, AIG is paying below the premium price
it would have paid if it had announced a takeover and bulk
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century spokesman Ric Hill said the company can't stop
anyone from buying shares, but its ``preference is that the current
level of ownership interest be maintained.'' AIG officials declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with 20th Century may prefer to keep the company in
their hands, but there's not much they can do to deter AIG,
Cesinger said.
</P>
<P>
   With AIG effectively controlling 43 percent of the company, and
with two directors on 20th Century's board, any type of ``poison
pill'' shareholder amendments would be tough to get passed.
</P>
<P>
   Among many variations of the ``poison pill'' defense is to allow
existing shareholders to buy newly-issued shares at a severely
reduced price. That increases the number of shares outstanding a
potential buyer would have to purchase, making it prohibitively
more expensive to acquire the company.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters are court decisions challenging the
validity of ``poison pill'' tactics, Cesinger said. Critics say the
maneuver protects incumbent management, not shareholder interests.
</P>
<P>
   Since AIG's investment, 20th Century has rebuilt itself from
near insolvency. Its stock _ plunging to as low as $8 from $27 in
less than year after the 1994 quake _ closed at $29 on Friday, near
its 52-week high of $29.875.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, 20th Century is raising its dividend to
16 cents a share, an increase of 60 percent and a return to
pre-quake levels, the company announced Friday. It will be paid on
June 26 to shareholders of record as of June 16.
</P>
<P>
   Net income for 1997 reached $111 million, a 50 percent increase
from 1996. Last year, revenues were $863.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   AIG earned $3.3 billion on revenues of $28 billion in 1997.

100 MEDIA TYPES MOB NOMO AT FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hideo Nomo's first official duty as a Met took place
atop the third-base dugout at Fenway Park Friday night, where the
Japanese pitcher sat with his legs dangling while more than 100
reporters, photographers and camera operators crowded around the
steps. It was a strange scene, made stranger by the Red Sox fans
who barely uttered a word, but it was also a glimpse at what
Nomomania can mean for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added another marquee name from the Los Angeles Dodgers
when they acquired Nomo and reliever Brad Clontz for struggling
starter Dave Mlicki and setup man Greg McMichael late Thursday and
then unveiled him before their first interleague contest of the
season. It was an odd place for a news conference, but the Mets,
who have seriously boosted their image since getting Mike Piazza,
Nomo's catcher with the Dodgers, last month, trumpeted their new
player in an unusual manner because there was no other place to
accommodate such a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be here,'' Nomo said through an interpreter. ``I
needed a change of scenery. I'm being reunited with people who
understand me. This is a contending team, and we have a chance to
do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Nomo be critical to the Mets' pursuit of a postseason
berth? Is he better than the pitcher who was 2-7 with a 5.05 earned
run average so far this season? The Mets feel that Nomo can
resurrect a career that included the Rookie of the Year Award in
1995, which is why they were eager to trade for the 29-year-old
right-hander, even though they have routinely praised Mlicki's
repertory and will miss McMichael in the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had told me we had Mike Piazza and Hideo Nomo, I would
have called you crazy,'' general manager Steve Phillips said. ``I
wouldn't have believed you.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine, who has scheduled Nomo to start against
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays Tuesday at Shea Stadium, added, ``There's
probably 20 days he's going to go out there for us. We've had 10 of
those days taken up, and we've won one game. I'm very confident he
is going to win more games.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Mets are confident because they believe Dave Wallace, a
senior adviser who used to be Nomo's pitching coach in Los Angeles,
can help him, they believe the presence of the first-year Met
Masato Yoshii, a Japanese pitcher who is Nomo's best friend, will
be a positive influence, and, besides, they do not think that
Nomo's season has been a total fiasco. A close analysis of the
statistics reveals that Nomo has not performed as terribly in 1998
as the numbers would seem to indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo allowed seven earned runs in two-thirds of an inning
against the Cubs. Eliminate that performance, and his ERA with the
Dodgers would have been 4.16. He also had three starts in which he
gave up only six earned runs in 23 innings, yet was 0-2 with a
no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some time for him to get back,'' Piazza
said. ``He's not going to go out there and throw a no-hitter the
next time out. You got to walk before you can run. We just need him
to be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nomo was asked why he has slumped this season, he said,
``Simply put, I'm getting hit.'' When he was asked if he knew why
he has had a subpar season so far, he answered, ``If I knew the
answer, I would be shutting people out.'' Nomo would not address
why his relationship with the Dodgers soured so dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   After watching videotapes of Nomo, Wallace said, ``Your sense is
that not much has changed. He's a true professional. Maybe it's
psychological.''
</P>
<P>
   One general manager said that Nomo has lost velocity on his
fastball, and scouts indicated that he has struggled with the
command of his forkball, but the same general manager added, ``It's
taking somewhat of a chance, but most people would be willing to
take that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo had calcium deposits removed from his right elbow last Oct.
7, but Phillips said the Dodgers provided a full physical report on
him, and the Mets do not consider the injury an issue. The Mets
were somewhat fortunate to get Nomo, who is wearing the No. 16 last
worn by Dwight Gooden, because the Orioles and Indians were both
negotiating heavily with the Dodgers before dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really glad I'm in a situation where we have the chance to
win,'' Nomo said. ``The ultimate goal is to get to the World
Series.''

ARIZONA'S EX-WELFARE FAMILIES WALKING AWAY FROM FREE HEALTH
BENEFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Thousands of Arizona's former welfare families are
walking away from free state health-care benefits, and no one is
sure why.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; While bureaucrats debate what to do, these former welfare
families are increasingly dependent on costly emergency room care
at taxpayers' expense _ even though most remain eligible for state
insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's welfare reform began a year earlier than most states,
but researchers already are tracking this unexpected effect
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   They blame it on lack of education and parents who assume that
when they lost welfare benefits, medical benefits went with them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, some critics say, state officials aren't eager to stop
a trend that saves money in the short run _ about $30 million just
from July 1997 through April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also suggest that former welfare parents are sick of
red tape and too overwhelmed with new job responsibilities to make
health insurance a priority.
</P>
<P>
   More than 48,000 former welfare recipients, mostly children, are
missing from the state's health-care rolls, said Diane Ross,
assistant director of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment
System.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a strong job market, Ross is skeptical that all these
former welfare parents _ the majority of whom quietly disappear
from the system with no follow-up _ found jobs that provide health
insurance or pay at least $10 an hour, which would make an average
family ineligible for free health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have asked more questions, given more information,''
Ross said about welfare reform. ``We should have sent information
that said, `If you found a job you still may be eligible for
Medicaid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That never happened. Not in Ross' agency and only sometimes in
the Department of Economic Security's offices responsible for
welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Former welfare mother Sonya Wilkins spent seven months without
insurance before she found a job as an accounting clerk at a health
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a sickly person,'' Wilkins said. ``I thought, `I felt
well, I don't need it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, her children continued to get food stamps, which
meant they automatically remained covered by state health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so automatic when you apply for AFDC (Aid to Families
with Dependent Children),'' said Wilkins, 34, who lives in Pinal
County. But now it requires busy parents to set aside time, find
transportation to the agency, and fill out a new application.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've never done it before, it's a step people don't get
around to doing, unless you have sick kids,'' Wilkins said. ``Some
parents may not realize their kids can still qualify for AHCCCS.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross doesn't believe the state is slow to move because it is
saving money in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was an intentional plot, but we all could
have done more to make sure people clearly understood,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   But the former director of Pinal County Public Health
Department, a county especially hard hit by uninsured former
welfare families, thinks short-term savings are a big reason for
the slow reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude is if we don't enroll people, we won't spend the
money,'' said Chuck Teegarden, who now heads Pinal County Cities in
Schools, a non-profit family resource center.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, county taxpayers not only fund state health
programs that provide preventive and non-emergency care and mental
health counseling, but they also foot the bill when uninsured and
untreated poor people end up in emergency rooms for far costlier
care, Teegarden said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Arizona Physicians IPA, AHCCCS's largest health
care plan, say the cost of treating an ear infection in an
emergency room can be five to 10 times more expensive than
treatment in a physician's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``County taxpayers should never pay twice,'' Teegarden said.
``This is insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents walking away from these benefits also might be eager to
distance themselves from the bureaucracy that once ruled their
lives, Teegarden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She must face the same people who kicked her off welfare and
ask to re-enroll her child (in Medicaid),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Public health researcher Leighton Ku said parents might be so
worried about maintaining a job, food and shelter that health care
doesn't matter until there's an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have chaotic and difficult lives, and this is not a
priority,'' said Ku, a senior researcher with the Urban Institute
in Washington, D.C., who studys the problem.
</P>
<P>
   People with jobs can no longer afford to sit around for hours at
state agencies, which are usually only open during working hours,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Everyone expected state welfare reform to spur a decrease in
the number of Arizonans getting public assistance _ and it has, by
28 percent in just the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials never expected thousands of these families
to drop out of the state's free health care program at the same
time, said Vince Wood, an assistant director for DES.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he can't explain why it didn't trigger a quick
response from his agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an answer to that,'' Wood said. ``We're trying to
study the impact of welfare reform, but it's new, and it's going to
take time.''
</P>
<P>
   But if parents decide not to sign up for free health benefits,
it's their decision and the state should respect it, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   He also added: ``We have a responsibility to educate them (about
health care benefits), and maybe we're not doing a good enough job
educating.''
</P>
<P>
   But as more families drop out, state bureaucrats still seem to
be waiting for each other to come up with a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Sketchy plans for an outreach program are just being formulated
between AHCCCS and DES officials.
</P>
<P>
   Plans could include home visits and phone calls to former
welfare parents, training for front-line social workers or
additional staff in DES offices to help families maintain health
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of better-written letters to replace the
computer-generated letters DES now uses to communicate with welfare
families.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has happened yet.
</P>
<P>
   In Pinal County, health and human service agencies burdened by
uninsured families are no longer waiting for state agencies to act,
Teegarden said, and ``recently decided to take the bull by the
horns.''
</P>
<P>
   They've recruited Arizona Public Service Co. to fund posters and
brochures to reach uninsured families and alert welfare families of
their eligibility before they drop off the rolls. They are
recruiting people to help parents fill out applications.
</P>
<P>
   Ku's national research shows that states are responding in
different ways at different speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, (1997), South Carolina's governor sent home a letter
with every school child asking parents to make sure they sign up
for Medicaid if they are eligible, he said. The letter included a
simplified application that could be mailed in. But Wisconsin,
which led the nation in welfare reform, isn't much further along
than Arizona, Ku said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Wisconsin, only in the past few months have people become
alarmed,'' Ku said.
</P>
<P>
   And it's common to find battles among state agencies over
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mix in missions,'' Ku said. Welfare reform workers
are eager for rolls to drop and families to become independent;
health workers are eager to ensure that people's health problems
are prevented or cured before they become emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Sen. Cindy Resnick, who works for the University of
Arizona Rural Health Office, is tired of the state's slow response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is there's a bunch of kids clearly eligible
for medical programs who are falling off the rolls,'' she said,
``and all we're doing is finger-pointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation needs strong leadership,'' Resnick said.
``Someone to say, `I don't care who you are, let's sit down and end
this.' '' &QL;

JOBLESS RATE STAYS AT 4.3 PERCENT AS WAGES GROW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reporting figures that both workers and investors
can love, the Labor Department Friday said the nation's
unemployment rate remained at 4.3 percent in May, the 28-year low
it hit in April, while wages continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The news surprised many economists, who had said the economy
could not sustain such a low jobless rate. In surveys, economists
had predicted an increase of about 225,000 jobs in May, but
businesses created nearly 300,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, strong job growth prompts investors to sell stocks and
bonds on fears that the economy is growing too quickly and that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. But instead, the Dow
Jones industrial average rose 167 points Friday, or 1.88 percent,
to close just under 9038. Bond prices rose as well.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark US Treasury bond rose 13/32 of a point, or $4.06
on a $1,000 bond. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction
of price, declined to 5.79 percent from 5.81 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond market is celebrating forcefully,'' said Gary
Ciminero of Independent Economic Advisory, a Providence consulting
firm. ``The bond market is very, very happy, and that is probably
what is driving the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   However, David Kelly of Primark Decision Economics in Boston
found signs of inflation in Friday's report. The government said
wages rose 0.3 percent in May, a modest gain from April. But
compared to a year ago, wages were up by more than 4 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should make people a little nervous,'' Kelly said. ``It
raises deeper questions for the Federal Reserve about how long the
economy can continue to grow so fast without some inflation
penalty.'' He said wages are growing at their fastest pace since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Fed chairman Alan Greenspan testifies before Congress next
Wednesday and may indicate how he reads the job numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk job growth is usually a sign for investors to sell bonds.
They fear that businesses will have to pay more for labor, forcing
them to raise the prices of their goods. Inflation, in turn, cuts
the value of the stream of interest payments they have purchased by
buying bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation may also prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates, which slows the economy and potentially hurts the value of
investments.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts cited several factors that might have prompted
investors to ignore this logic Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, not all sectors of the economy fared well. Job
growth was strong in service and retail businesses, but
manufacturers actually cut 26,000 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Asian financial crisis was probably to blame
for the manufacturing cutback. Currency and stock market downturns
in Southeast Asia mean that the entire region has less money to
spend on US products, and that it is able to sell its own products
in the United States at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   That trend will probably keep the US economy from growing too
fast in future months, analysts said, and could persuade the Fed
that an interest rate increase is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reasonable to suspect that at least some of the recent
declines in manufacturing employment and (working) hours are
related to Asia's economic problems,'' said Katharine G. Abraham,
commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the Asian situation written all over it,'' Ciminero
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, fears about wage growth are being offset by recent
news on productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Rising productivity means businesses are doing more work with
the same amount of labor and materials, and it suggests that wages
can also rise without sparking inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported Thursday that productivity grew at an
annual rate of 1.1 percent in the first three months of the year.
That is considerably lower than the 1.8 percent rate of 1996 and
1997, but it is better than the 0.2 percent estimate for the first
quarter of 1998 the government had initially reported.
</P>
<P>
   Stock and bond prices may also be rising because a large amount
of money is &UR;  &LR; chasing a fixed number of investment opportunities,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Ciminero said the Dow may be benefiting as investors flee Asia
for safer US securities.
</P>
<P>
   And Kelly noted the US government is running a surplus, meaning
it needs to borrow less, and some corporations are buying back the
debt they have issued. ``There is a lot of investment money out
there and not a lot of debt'' to buy, he said.

ALLSTATE SUES FOR FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Allstate Insurance Co., the focus of a federal
investigation into its handling of damage settlements from the
Northridge Earthquake, has filed a $1 million lawsuit against a Los
Angeles-based firm for allegedly having homeowners file false
claims after the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Northbrook, Ill.-based Allstate's suit maintains that the scheme
by Building Permit Consultants involved large numbers of
Northridge-area homeowners and cost it and other insurers millions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The suit identifies John, Juliana and James Kaldawi as the
operators of Building Permit Consultants. None of them returned
numerous messages left for them Friday at the company's office and
at John Kaldawi's home in suburban Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   John Kaldawi, a former engineer with the city of Los Angeles'
Building and Safety Department, was convicted in 1995 of soliciting
a $10,000 bribe from someone who wanted to build an auto body
repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to three years probation and fined $5,000,
according to court filings.
</P>
<P>
   The civil fraud suit filed May 27 in U.S. District Court in Los
Angeles claims he subsequently started Building Permit Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate alleges that after the January 1994 disaster, Building
Permit Consultants called and mailed notices to homeowners telling
them they could get insurance money for damage even if their homes
came through untouched. Those that agreed to the plan had to sign a
contract stipulating they would share the proceeds with Building
Permit Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   So far, homeowners who participated appear to be off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe that all this could have happened without
the homeowners not having any clue,'' said Peter H. Klee,
Allstate's attorney. ``The fact of the matter is Allstate is
reluctant to sue its own customers unless there is a substantial
amount of evidence. And from a customer-relations standpoint it is
reluctant to (sue).''
</P>
<P>
   The suit comes after it was revealed last month that federal
investigators were looking into charges that Allstate altered
documents to save money on homeowner claims after the quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've strongly and consistently denied those allegations,''
said company spokesman Peter Debreceny.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>
TRENT LOTT LEADS SENATE TO TUNE OF CORPORATE AMERICA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I keep waiting for Senator Trent Lott to step up and do
something for which I can admire him. And I'm still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the syrupy Mississippian keeps tanking on me. His
latest cave in the direction of Big Money is his
triple-gainer-back-flip-with-full-twist on behalf of the tobacco
lobby. No better example exists of the perfidy of campaign
contributions' influence on the political process than the rescue
effort captained by Lott in the face of reform as championed by
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   To Big Tobacco, the Senate majority leader's real name is
Thanks-a-Lott. When it comes to grabbing campaign dough with both
hands, Lott has no equal. And Corporate America knows it. And loves
it. Where else can you purchase such bang for your buck as in the
majority leader's office?
</P>
<P>
   Even the stout-hearted McCain seems weary of the chore of
summoning his 99 colleagues to a higher cause than servicing the
tobacco lobby, whose swath, through this and previous Senates, has
been wide, and deep, and effective.
</P>
<P>
   The most hilarious line of the week came from Trent-as-in-bent
Lott hisself: ``The well has been poisoned tremendously by what has
been going on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's the guy, caught red-handed tossing cyanide into the water
supply, and he's griping about the contamination of ye olde welle?
Follow the money from the tobacco lobby, and you see that the
lion's share ends up in Trent's greasy mitts, his and his fellow
bag-jobbers. They live off Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, alas, seems not to realize that his place in history will
depend on what he does to improve life for the majority of
Americans, not by gutting some improvement that would reduce
cancer, or bring tobacco company desperadoes to book. Why doesn't
he get it?
</P>
<P>
   Lott is elected by the majority party's members in caucus. But
his role is to serve the American people in leading the upper
branch of the national legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Trent, what do you want on your tombstone?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Here lies Trent Lott,
</P>
<P>
   Of campaign loot, he raised a lot?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is that all there is? That you were the last big fixer of your
era? That you had a chance to halt the process by which tobacco
executives hooked 3,000 teenagers a day? And that you blew it?
Because you wanted a few hundred thousand more bucks in your
political action committee's coffers? Is that all there is? Your
lousy PAC?
</P>
<P>
   Brokering compromises, cutting deals, packaging this-and-that
for the benefit of passage, those are the kinds of sausage-making
compromises that are the meat and drink of legislative leadership.
</P>
<P>
   We're not looking for courage above-and-beyond the call of duty
here. We all understand that the demands of party usually pull
politicians down from the ranks of the archangels. But does Trent
have to go into the tank every time some lobbyist flips open a
checkbook? Is there nothing this guy will stand for?
</P>
<P>
   There must be someone in Lott's office who opens his mail, or
who talks to the good people of Mississippi who phone in, or who is
charged with making nice, and furnishing coffee to the many
distinguished delegations that file into his important office.
</P>
<P>
   Don't they hear what's on people's minds? Don't they blanch when
they realize their boss is doing another deal at the behest of the
latest wicked interest with cash on the barrelhead? Doesn't it
bother them?
</P>
<P>
   I hope one of Lott's munchkins clips for him the following
letter I received Friday as a result of a Wednesday column
describing McCain's uphill struggle to wean his fellow senators,
many Democrats as well as most Republicans, from the teat of
tobacco largesse. The letter comes from a woman whose last name I
will withhold, but her sincerity shines through:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Sir:
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive the paper, but at 6:30 in the morning I'm not about to
chance waking my husband looking for my stationery. I'd like to
thank you for the column on John McCain and his adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 73 years old, stopped a very minor smoking habit (one pack
a week) about 35 years ago, but still have serious lung problems.
Other members of my family have not been so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recently my sister Marge succumbed to lung disease. My brother
Joe, a Korean veteran, also stopped too late. In a third cemetery
is my sister, Betty. Buried with her is her daughter, Lynn. Four
victims of cigarettes. All died needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see the ads for a new `coffin nail,' I think it stands
for guaranteed pulmonary cancer. How fitting a name.''
</P>
<P>
   That's from Dorothy in Watertown. And it begs for someone in
authority to make a change in the way people get hooked.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of us loved nicotine. Thrilled to the way it scrambled our
brainpan, titillated our intestines, stung our lungs. Yes, it was
great. But very dangerous. Carried a huge price tag, down the road.
</P>
<P>
   But we all know a lot more now. It's time we took advantage of
all the new science, and the new politics, to make a change in the
assembly-line delivery of new cancer victims to the tobacco lobby.
</P>
<P>
   That's what we look to Washington for. And we're happy to follow
a Sun Belt conservative named McCain, who has the public interest
at heart. We do not like to see a Senate majority leader going in
the tank for Big Tobacco, and trying to con us with mealy-mouthed
excuses.
</P>
<P>
   He's the chief cook and bottle washer in the Senate. And all
he's done on this issue is cave in to the businessmen who write him
the big checks.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't that be some epitaph?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Here lies Trent.
</P>
<P>
   He was bent.
</P>
<P>
   He was always for rent.
</P>
<P>
   To the highest bidder he went.''

drug peyote is part of his religion, a ``sacrament'' that helps him
to spiritually purge his soul and cleanse his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little to enjoy about peyote,'' said Mercado, 37,
of Kearny. ``It's a very hard road. If I was looking for personal
enjoyment, I'd drink beer, which I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Pinal County Superior Court judge saw it differently,
ruling this week that Mercado was essentially hiding behind the
cloak of religious immunity to veil illegal activities and that he
should forfeit a quantity of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado claims that he is a member of the Native American Church
and that, as such, he has a right to possess peyote, a cactus pod
containing mescaline. Church members believe the drug allows them
to commune with God.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling that revolved around whether a single peyote button
should be returned to Mercado, Judge William O'Neil wrote that
Mercado failed to prove that he embraced the peyote religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, he presents himself far more as some carny offering
cotton candy for any and all to use,'' O'Neil wrote in Tuesday's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado called the judge's statements ``spiritual bigotry'' and
``blasphemy'' and said he plans to appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like ruling that the sun's not shining here, that the
Gila River doesn't flow by our property and that I don't believe in
this medicine _ because I do,'' Mercado said. ``It's a little
strange to be told that you don't believe in something. It kind of
upsets me to hear that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This peyote is good medicine for those who believe in it, and
God created it, and I trust in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The peyote button in question was found inside Mercado's
``medicine bag'' and seized by police during a traffic stop on Jan.
8, 1997. No criminal charges ever were filed against Mercado in
connection with the seizure, and he subsequently petitioned the
state for its return.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1996, the state returned to Mercado the same peyote
button and about 1,000 hallucinogenic cactuses that had been seized
in a 1995 raid at his remote ranch.
</P>
<P>
   What followed this time was a year-long court battle, during
which Mercado set out to prove that he really did believe in and
practice the peyote religion, while the state sought to discredit
that.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona law allows the use of peyote in connection with the bona
fide practice of a religious belief, as an integral part of a
religious exercise and in a manner not dangerous to public health.
</P>
<P>
   The Native American Church generally is recognized as the only
organization that has a bona fide claim that peyote is a sacrament
in its rituals.
</P>
<P>
   But a church leader testified in court that Mercado was not
among its 250,000 members and that his actions in growing peyote _
because he believes it is becoming extinct _ are contrary to church
tenets. Church members believe peyote is a supernatural plant that
either manifests itself or grows where God chooses and is not to be
cultivated or planted by humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Mercado testified his belief that it could become extinct;
that the supernatural power that it possesses could somehow be
lost; in short, that the very supernatural power he claims to
worship is subject to natural laws,'' O'Neil wrote. ``This is
hardly the stuff of which religion is made.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil also wrote that Mercado's own writings indicate that he
widely advocates peyote use and that ``he promotes its use, not its
worship or worship through its use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no testimony encouraging others to follow a system
of beliefs, but rather to try peyote,'' O'Neil wrote. ``If the
claimant has a religion, it is a convenient wrapping of one talking
the talk but not walking the walk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mercado, who has used peyote for half his life in spite of
the nausea it causes, says that's simply not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for very few people overall,'' Mercado said. ``But for
those that it is important, it's essential. That's why it's
religious. We rely on it.'' &QL;

FANS SHOULD ROOT FOR REAL QUIET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Bet on Real Quiet? Not for the promise of a $4.40
payoff. Not unless you're looking for a souvenir ticket on the
first Triple Crown winner in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Root for Real Quiet? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   If you're watching the Belmont Stakes on TV at home today, your
money safe in your pocket, cross your fingers for Real Quiet and
jockey Kent Desormeaux, who will need a little luck to find a clear
and straight path in a 13-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   Don't cheer for them just because, as the horse-racing marketing
men will say, the sport needs a reminder of the glorious '70s and
Triple Crown winners Secretariat, Seattle Slew and Affirmed. The
sport has had plenty of stars _ has Cigar been forgotten already? _
and racetracks continue to fail. Besides, wouldn't it be refreshing
if marketing isn't the focus for once, if this is the rare sports
accomplishment that isn't turned into a Nike commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Cheer for them because when Real Quiet and Desormeaux win,
they'll annoy the sourpusses on the Belmont Park backstretch, where
the tree-lined roads are named for Triple Crown winners, where
they're ready to cry, ``There goes the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nonsense, this stuffy notion that Real Quiet _
crooked-legged and late blooming, not even the most promising
2-year-old in his Santa Anita Park barn _ is somehow unworthy of
the title Triple Crown winner.
</P>
<P>
   John Veitch, trainer of Alydar _ the horse who ran second three
times to Affirmed, the last horse to sweep the Triple Crown _ said
last week Real Quiet would need an asterisk next to his name if he
made that august list.
</P>
<P>
   The allusion was to Roger Maris, whose audacity in beating Babe
Ruth's home-runs record prompted baseball to type an asterisk into
the history books, noting that Maris' season was eight games longer
than Ruth's. What the Maris-bashers didn't grasp was that he wasn't
claiming to be the greatest baseball player of all time, he was
only proposing to break one of his records.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Real Quiet rider, trainer and owner aren't claiming
he's the equal of Count Fleet, Citation or Secretariat. They're
only proposing to match one of those great horses' achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Triple Crown winners were immortals. The first,
Sir Barton, lost six races in 1918 before his first victory, just
as Real Quiet lost six in a row last year. Try to find Omaha and
Whirlaway on anybody's list of all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   But now (begin ital)we're(end ital) being sourpusses.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet isn't getting enough credit for what he's done so
far.
</P>
<P>
   The bashers say he's only 4 for 14. But he simply isn't a
sprinter, and if you subtract his races of a mile or less last
summer and fall, he's 4 for 8 with losses excusable for traffic
trouble, a horribly muddy track, a layoff and a front-runners'
track bias. He's 3 for 4 in Grade I races.
</P>
<P>
   The bashers say he beat injury-weakened fields in the Kentucky
Derby and Preakness. But he beat the Santa Anita Derby winner, the
Blue Grass winner, the Florida Derby winner, the Arkansas Derby
winner and the reigning Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   So what if Lil's Lad missed the race? He was beaten by Halory
Hunter in the Blue Grass; and Real Quiet beat Halory Hunter. So
what if Coronado's Quest missed the race? He wasn't entered because
he's a mental basket case; since when is that an excuse? When you
boil it down, the only good 3-year-old that Real Quiet didn't beat
_ or beat somebody who beat them _ is Event of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Derby prospects get hurt every year. Usually they get
hurt in January, February, March and April. The difference this
season is that the Lil's Lads and Event of the Years stayed healthy
longer, so when they went to the sidelines, they were more sorely
missed.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Slew beat nobody important on the way to his 1977 Triple
Crown. And, surely, there have been years with as many injuries as
this when nobody was good enough to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, why isn't Real Quiet applauded for racing as often as a
stakes horse can and still winning the war of attrition? With more
sturdy horses like him, it would be a healthier sport.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to think Real Quiet is a victim of prejudice. His
owner, Mike Pegram, is beer-bellied and ribald. His trainer, Bob
Baffert, comes from quarter horses, the wrong side of the tracks,
and his immediate thoroughbred success makes some people
suspicious. The colt himself made his mark in California, far from
the power centers of the racing press. When he ran second to
stablemate Indian Charlie on an unfavorable surface in the Santa
Anita Derby, few of the reputation-makers were on the scene to
appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   As Los Angeles-based writer Jay Privman points out, if the
Triple Crown hopeful were Rick Pitino-owned Halory Hunter, the
third-best 3-year-old on the (begin ital)East(end ital) Coast this
winter, the attitude would be much different.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, California product Silver Charm suffered no such
disrespect here in 1997, but he was a striking gray colt with a
pun-friendly name and the first horse in eight years to threaten
the Triple Crown. Real Quiet, without the charisma, suffers in
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all for the racing establishment, the physically flawed
Real Quiet was purchased for a mere $17,000 by a man with little
interest in becoming a breeder. He's hardly an advertisement for
the national industry of Kentucky. The bluebloods (begin
ital)shouldn't(end ital) root for him.
</P>
<P>
   Should you? You bet your asterisk. &QL;

JOBLESS RATE STAYS AT 4.3 PERCENT AS WAGES GROW
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reporting figures that both workers and investors
can love, the Labor Department Friday said the nation's
unemployment rate remained at 4.3 percent in May, the 28-year low
it hit in April, while wages continued to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The news surprised many economists, who had said the economy
could not sustain such a low jobless rate. In surveys, economists
had predicted an increase of about 225,000 jobs in May, but
businesses created nearly 300,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, strong job growth prompts investors to sell stocks and
bonds on fears that the economy is growing too quickly and that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. But instead, the Dow
Jones industrial average rose 167 points Friday, or 1.88 percent,
to close just under 9038. Bond prices rose as well.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark US Treasury bond rose 13/32 of a point, or $4.06
on a $1,000 bond. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction
of price, declined to 5.79 percent from 5.81 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond market is celebrating forcefully,'' said Gary
Ciminero of Independent Economic Advisory, a Providence consulting
firm. ``The bond market is very, very happy, and that is probably
what is driving the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   However, David Kelly of Primark Decision Economics in Boston
found signs of inflation in Friday's report. The government said
wages rose 0.3 percent in May, a modest gain from April. But
compared to a year ago, wages were up by more than 4 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should make people a little nervous,'' Kelly said. ``It
raises deeper questions for the Federal Reserve about how long the
economy can continue to grow so fast without some inflation
penalty.'' He said wages are growing at their fastest pace since
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Fed chairman Alan Greenspan testifies before Congress next
Wednesday and may indicate how he reads the job numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk job growth is usually a sign for investors to sell bonds.
They fear that businesses will have to pay more for labor, forcing
them to raise the prices of their goods. Inflation, in turn, cuts
the value of the stream of interest payments they have purchased by
buying bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation may also prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest
rates, which slows the economy and potentially hurts the value of
investments.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts cited several factors that might have prompted
investors to ignore this logic Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, not all sectors of the economy fared well. Job
growth was strong in service and retail businesses, but
manufacturers actually cut 26,000 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the Asian financial crisis was probably to blame
for the manufacturing cutback. Currency and stock market downturns
in Southeast Asia mean that the entire region has less money to
spend on US products, and that it is able to sell its own products
in the United States at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   That trend will probably keep the US economy from growing too
fast in future months, analysts said, and could persuade the Fed
that an interest rate increase is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reasonable to suspect that at least some of the recent
declines in manufacturing employment and (working) hours are
related to Asia's economic problems,'' said Katharine G. Abraham,
commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has the Asian situation written all over it,'' Ciminero
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, fears about wage growth are being offset by recent
news on productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Rising productivity means businesses are doing more work with
the same amount of labor and materials, and it suggests that wages
can also rise without sparking inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported Thursday that productivity grew at an
annual rate of 1.1 percent in the first three months of the year.
That is considerably lower than the 1.8 percent rate of 1996 and
1997, but it is better than the 0.2 percent estimate for the first
quarter of 1998 the government had initially reported.
</P>
<P>
   Stock and bond prices may also be rising because a large amount
of money is &UR;  &LR; chasing a fixed number of investment opportunities,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Ciminero said the Dow may be benefiting as investors flee Asia
for safer US securities.
</P>
<P>
   And Kelly noted the US government is running a surplus, meaning
it needs to borrow less, and some corporations are buying back the
debt they have issued. ``There is a lot of investment money out
there and not a lot of debt'' to buy, he said.

CLINTON URGES FEDERAL INCENTIVES TO GIVE INTERNET ACCESS TO
CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE _ Standing before graduates of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, President Clinton Friday issued a call to
schools across America to open up the miracles of the information
age to children, offering federal incentives to states willing to
require computer literacy among their students.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, delivering the commencement address to 2,400 graduates
and their parents on sun-dappled Killian Court, said computers
should provide all children with opportunity rather than leaving
poorer students behind for lack of equipment and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from hard experience that unequal education hardens
into unequal prospects,'' Clinton said. ``We know the information
age will accelerate this trend. History teaches us that even as new
technologies create growth and new opportuniy, they can heighten
economic inequalities and sharpen social divisions.''
</P>
<P>
   As a partial and modest remedy, Clinton unveiled a proposal for
a $180 million teacher training program, in which the federal
government would provide middle schools with approximately $20,000
each to train a teacher as a so-called technology expert. That
teacher would then be expected to train other teachers and pass
their knowledge along to their students, White House officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commencement address, delivered on a chilly morning near the
banks of the Charles River, launched Clinton through a whirlwind
day in Greater Boston _ a day in which he looked sadly back at the
assassination of Robert F. Kennedy and ahead to the promise of
future generations of students.
</P>
<P>
   From MIT, the president attended a lunch at Representative
Joseph P. Kennedy II's house in Brighton to commemorate the 30th
anniversary of the shooting of RFK. In the late afternoon, Clinton
flew by helicopter to Lincoln and spoke at the grand opening of the
Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods. He flew home from Hanscom Air
Base at about 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, wearing a black gown from his alma mater, the Yale Law
School, was the first sitting president to deliver a commencement
address at MIT. He spoke to the largest graduating class in the
school's history.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton cited an effort at the nearby East
Somerville Community School, where teachers trained in technology
are using equipment supplied by Time Warner Cable to give students
in grades 1 through 8 ``an early and enormous boost in life.''
Clinton said the program is so successful that students came to the
school over winter break to work on computer projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That small miracle can be replicated in every school, rich and
poor, across America,'' Clinton said. ``Yet, today, affluent
schools are almost three times as likely to have Internet access in
the classroom. White students are more than twice as likely as
black students to have computers in their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   In his teacher training proposal, Clinton said he would provide
funding for states that make computer literacy a requirement in
middle school. White House officials said 10 states, including
Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, have computer training
requirements in high school, but the goal was to provide training
to younger students.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his aides urged Congress to ward off efforts by
telecommunications companies to gut the so-called E-Rate, which
provides poorer school districts, libraries, and rural health
centers discounted telephone rates to help them hook computers to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we really believe that we all belong in the information
age, then at this sunlit moment of prosperity we can't leave anyone
behind in the dark,'' Clinton said. ``Every child in America
deserves a chance to participate in the information revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments before Clinton's address, about 80 protesters decrying
US sanctions against Iraq gathered near the ceremonies. The
protesters, who included Harvard Afro-American studies Professor
Cornel West and Kathy Kelly, co-founder of Voices in the
Wilderness, did not disrupt the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   At Walden Pond, Clinton joined rock musician Don Henley, as well
as Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry in dedicating the
new Thoreau Institute, which is meant to honor and advance the
legacy and spirit of conservationist and author Henry David
Thoreau, who penned the book ``Walden.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us hope and pray that Walden Pond will flourish,'' Clinton
said. ``Let us hope and pray that people will come to these woods
forever from now on, to learn not only more about themselves and
their relationship with nature, but the proper order of human
society and the responsibility of every citizen to preserve it.''

ON MATHEMATICS, A LOVE STORY AND A NOBEL PRIZE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching a couple hundred newly minted MBAs parade happily down
the street last week, I thought the life of business must be as
much prone to love as any other, but there are relatively few
incentives to talk about it. The closest thing to a business love
story in the tall case of new books beside my desk is
``Financier,'' the biography of Andre Meyer, by Cary Reich. Its
subtitle is ``A Story of Money, Power and the Reshaping of American
Business.''
</P>
<P>
   Reissued recently as part of a series on business pioneers,
Reich's subject is the financial strategist who in the 1950s, '60s,
and '70s built Lazard Freres into a powerhouse among investment
banks. Fifteen years after it first appeared, it's still is an
exceptionally good read _ if you're interested in why Avis
Rent-a-Car turned out so well, for example, or in the Agnelli or
Englehard families. (The affable author, one of the best business
journalists in New York, died suddenly of pancreatic cancer in
March at 48.)
</P>
<P>
   The legendary Meyer had a typical French marriage of a certain
sort: a discreet, devoted wife and an eye that wandered widely over
the years, from chanteuse Claude Alphande to Jacqueline Onassis.
Bella Meyer faded into the background; she survived her husband
(who died in 1979) by only six months.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a different sort of marriage is chronicled in ``A
Beautiful Mind,'' by Sylvia Nasar, a reporter for The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of the business pages may remember Nasar's story ``The
Lost Years of a Nobel Laureate'' in late 1994. It described the
descent into madness at the age of 30 of a mathematical economist
named John Nash and the eventual remission of his disease, in time
for him to shake the hand of the Swedish king for contributions he
had made to economics nearly 40 years before. It was a particularly
memorable story because it took pains to locate Nash and his
illness in the context of his birth family.
</P>
<P>
   Now the story has made a swell book. It is not as much about
game theory that Nash helped pioneer as about the ways that
mathematicians lead their lives, and about schizophrenia. The
person who holds it all together is a pretty young physicist named
Alicia Larde, who married Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Nasar seems to have talked to anyone and everyone who knew Nash
over the years. But energy aside, her great strength is as a
storyteller engaged in the ways of the human heart. Her book is a
latter-day ``Shine'' for followers of economics, with a
mathematician rather than a concert pianist at its center _ and a
moderately happy ending that is not fake.
</P>
<P>
   John Forbes Nash Jr. was born in 1928 in Bluefield, W. Va., a
rugged Appalachian coal town where his father was an electric
utility engineer. His Protestant parents were routinely demanding;
in 1945, his talent for mathematics already obvious, Nash went off
to the Carnegie Institute of Technology; by the middle of his
junior year he had been accepted for graduate study at Harvard,
Princeton, Chicago, and Michigan. He chose Princeton, then, as now,
the mathematical center of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Already there were signs of the otherworldliness that was to
plague him. As a teenager he danced with chairs, played unfunny
practical jokes, and made clear his attraction to other boys. As a
young adult, he careened back and forth between men and women. But
he also possessed unmistakable talent, and at Princeton it
blossomed for a time into genius.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's first paper was called ``The Bargaining Problem,'' and it
was a clear-headed examination of the circumstances that might lead
parties to a deal to prefer to cooperate or to compete. In short
order he had set himself up in opposition to John von Neumann, the
reigning genius of Princeton, whose book with Oskar Morgenstern,
``The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior,'' had electrified the
community of mathematical economists.
</P>
<P>
   It was in his thesis that Nash described the concept that bears
his name: Nash equilibrium, or the situation in which each player
has adopted the strategy that serves him best in consideration of
the strategies of all others. That carefully delineated bit of
mathematics, and a further contribution to the theory of games,
were sufficient to win him a series of distinguished appointments:
to think tank Rand Corp., the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. He fathered a
son by his mistress, then married vivacious Alicia Larde, whom he
met in his course on advanced calculus for engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's antics increased in intensity and frequency. One winter
day in 1959, he walked into the common room at MIT and announced to
no one in particular that that day's New York Times contained a
message from a superior race in another galaxy that only he could
understand. Nasar's book chronicles the long bigger saga of the
paranoid schizophrenia that plagued Nash for the next 30 years,
that severed his links with virtually every one of the communities
that had sustained him: the schools, fellowships, departments,
friendships, children, and, in 1963, his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But Nash's wife continued to care for him even after they were
divorced. The bout of hospitalizations eventually ended. His mother
was dead, his sister unable to take him on. So in 1970, she offered
to let Nash live with her in Princeton, reasoning that a quiet life
on the edges of an academic community would be better for him than
any other regime.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't easy, either; as ``the boarder,'' he took meals with
his ex-wife, her mother, and his adolescent son. But in time the
simple, sheltered routine began to pay off. Nash haunted the
Princeton libraries like a wraith, scribbling on blackboards,
poring over religious texts; his second son grew up. (Well-raised
by his mother, Nash's first son had become a registered nurse.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, along a lengthy front, economics had begun moving
toward the austere mathematical structures that Nash and others had
erected in the late 1940s. The relevance of his early work to the
description of everyday dilemmas had become clear. Colleagues had
begun campaigning for Nash's election to the Econometric Society _
and, in Sweden, for a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, reporter Nasar is at her best. She captures the
furious competitiveness that accompanies the award of major prizes
like the Fields Medal for mathematics, and penetrates the swirl of
rumor that had surrounded the award of the 1994 Nobel.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that conservatives in the Swedish Academy had
staged a last-minute attempt to prevent the award to Nash on the
very morning the announcement was to be made. Only narrowly did it
fail. In the end, Nash was well enough accept the prize _ and even
to resume working, in a limited way.
</P>
<P>
   As to the claims for the centrality of John Nash's work, who
knows? Certainly developments in game theory have begun to change
our world, by pointing to alternatives to the concept of ``perfect
competition'' of economists. Nasar ends her book with a chapter on
what Vice President Al Gore had called ``The Greatest Auction
Ever,'' the sale of some $7 billion worth of public airwaves to
cellular phone companies in 1994 under procedures devised by
followers of Nash. Arrangements such as these are, of course,
precisely the activities at which the financier Andre Meyer
excelled. Before there was mathematically driven financial
engineering, he was a financier. Whether the formalization of the
Nash equilibrium has diminished the requirement for character and
judgment in business remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the worlds of business practice and
economic theory are coming closer together. And that the rules
governing human conduct are the same in each.

NUCLEAR MINEFIELD OF WHAT TO DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also sent in category code ``a'')

 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ``Thinking the unthinkable'' is how the nuclear priesthood
refers to it. The Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests have reignited
fierce debates over doctrine. Do nuclear weapons make the world a
more dangerous or a safer place? Can or should the United States
try to prevent other nations from acquiring nuclear bombs?
</P>
<P>
   ``A profound test is under way of classical theories of
deterrence and international relations,'' said Michael Krepon,
president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, at a packed seminar on
the subject in Washington this week.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the United States exploded the atomic bomb in
1945, a small group of U.S. military intellectuals _ the
``thermonuclear Jesuits,'' as Fred Kaplan, in his 1983 book ``The
Wizards of Armageddon,'' called them _ quickly understood that
nuclear weapons made much of earlier U.S. military thinking
obsolete. Beginning at Yale University and later shifting to the
Rand Corp. in Southern California, Bernard Brodie, a political
scientist and naval strategist, invented nuclear strategy, the
military establishment's new catechism.
</P>
<P>
   For the four years that the United States had a nuclear
monopoly, it could afford the luxury of visionary ideas. Shortly
after the war, it proposed the abolition of nuclear arms, but that
was vetoed at the United Nations by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Absolute Weapon,'' published in 1946, Brodie wrote that
the main function of nuclear weapons was deterring wars, not
fighting them. Nonetheless, he, Albert Wohlstetter, Herman Kahn,
Thomas Schelling and others soon began systematically contemplating
their use. In the 1950s and early '60s, they coined the chilling
phrases ``counterforce'' and ``second strike'' for the nuclear
doctrines they devised.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first public policy expressions of the new strategic
thinking surfaced in 1957, says Schelling, a professor of economics
and public affairs at the University of Maryland. That year, the
Gaither Commission warned President Eisenhower that U.S. nuclear
weapons were highly vulnerable to a surprise attack from Moscow.
Hence, the panel argued, the Soviets might be tempted to strike
first in the hope of wiping out the U.S. bombers that could carry
nuclear bombs to their targets. To deter such an attack, the United
States needed to make sure it could hit back with a second strike.
</P>
<P>
   So the United States upgraded the Navy's Polaris submarine
program and replaced its Atlas and Titan missiles. The new
Minuteman missiles, smaller and solid fueled, were theoretically
less susceptible to attack because they could be protected in
underground silos and fired instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Washington also began a national civil defense program that had
children diving under their desks in ``duck and cover'' drills and
what Schelling calls the ``fall-out shelter-in-the-backyard
craze.''
</P>
<P>
   As President Kennedy's Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara
raised the contentious issue of how many nuclear weapons were
enough to deter an attack. In succession, he gave two different
answers that led to the doctrine of deterrence that still dominates
much of U.S. strategic thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1962, McNamara said that
U.S. strategic forces should be aimed at Russian forces, not
cities. This counterforce doctrine ushered in the era of what was
known as flexible nuclear response and the end of all-out
destruction or ``massive retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he refined, or as some said, backed away from
that doctrine, however, by urging President Lyndon Johnson to
ensure that if the Russians launched a surprise counterforce
strike, the United States would still have enough forces to destroy
the Soviet Union's military controls, 30 percent of its population
and half its industrial base. What he called ``mutual assured
destruction,'' was quickly derided by critics by its acronym, MAD.
But for McNamara, it was the only hope of limiting the military's
insatiable appetite for more and more arms and of providing a
stable balance of nuclear terror.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s and early '70s, says Spurgeon Keeny Jr., the
president of the Washington-based Arms Control Association,
military analysts grew concerned not just about the arms race
between the superpowers (known as vertical proliferation) but also
about horizontal proliferation, the spread of nuclear weapons to
nonnuclear countries. To counter vertical proliferation, the
superpowers signed the so-called SALT II agreement and the ABM
Treaty in 1972, which capped the growth of strategic missile
launchers and effectively banned missile defense systems. Defense
systems were not only exorbitantly expensive but dangerous as well:
if a country was sure that its own arsenal was shielded from
attack, it might be tempted to take out its opponent's.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the horizontal problem, the United States signed
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1968 and imposed export
controls on the sale of nuclear technology. Under the treaty,
nations pledged to forgo developing nuclear weapons in exchange for
help with their civilian nuclear energy programs. They also agreed
to international inspection of their nuclear facilities. Only five
countries _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France
and China, those that had already tested nuclear weapons _ were
recognized under the treaty as declared nuclear weapons states.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cold War ended, some arms controllers argued that even
more progress could be made to curb both vertical and horizontal
proliferation. At first those hopes seemed justified, argued
William Potter, director of the Monterey Institute's Center for
Nonproliferation Studies in California. The Russians and Americans
signed two more arms control treaties. Meanwhile, by the time some
185 signers met to debate and approve the permanent extension of
the Nonproliferation Treaty in 1995, Belarus, Ukraine, and
Kazakhstan had agreed to forgo nuclear weapons development and to
remove nuclear warheads from their soil. South Africa had given up
its seven nuclear devices. Argentina and Brazil had also
relinquished a nuclear option, and international inspection
standards of atomic sites were strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Potter says such accomplishments prompted a ``false sense of
security.'' What many analysts now fear is what Potter called an
``erosion of the basic consensus underlining the Nonproliferation
and Test Ban Treaties: that having nuclear weapons does not enhance
a country's security.''
</P>
<P>
   Jayantha Dhanapala, a Sri Lankan disarmament expert and a senior
U.N. official, argues that horizontal and vertical nuclear weapons
policies are linked. He cites the Canberra Commission on the
Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, on which he served, which said in
1996 that stopping proliferation was ``inextricably linked to the
continued possession of nuclear weapons by a handful of states.''
As long as the nuclear powers resisted disarmament, as opposed to
arms limitation, Dhanapala said, the perception that nuclear arms
enhanced political status and security would remain what he called
a source of fatal attraction. He says all nuclear nations should
disarm.

</P>
<P>
   Some theoreticians and policy makers agree that horizontal and
vertical proliferation are linked but come to the opposite
conclusion. Kenneth Waltz, an American political scientist who
teaches at Columbia, defends nuclear weapons as having deterred a
nuclear war for more than 40 years. He argues that their spread
would also deter atomic conflicts between other countries _ if it
works here, it will work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hypocrisy of the Americans' position is astonishing,'' he
said. ``We tell Pakistan and India, neither of which ever signed
the NPT and therefore is violating no international commitment,
that nuclear weapons are bad for them and that it's bad to test,
when we and the Russians have done far more tests over the years
than we had any scientific or technical reason to do.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mearsheimer, a political science professor at the
University of Chicago and a Waltz disciple, said that while he was
not in favor of the Indian and Pakistani tests, ``I would argue
that a conflict between them is less likely if they openly have
nuclear weapons than without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Schelling says most military theorists and policy makers reject
the Waltz-Mearsheimer thesis. ``Even if the occurrence of conflict
may be less likely,'' he said, ``the consequences of failure would
be horrendous.'' But equally unrealistic, he maintains, are calls
for the nuclear powers to relinquish all nuclear weapons, as the
Canberra Commission urged and as the writer Jonathan Schell
advocates in a new book, ``The Gift of Time'' (1998). ``I live in
the real world,'' said Schelling, who adds that countries under the
U.S. nuclear umbrella have felt secure even without their own
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Potter argues that the fatal flaw with respect to deterrence and
proliferation theories is that both depend on rationality. ``You
assume cool and calculating determinations of how your interests
are maximized,'' he said, ``which discounts the probability of
miscalculation, accident or sheer panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Betts, a political science professor at Columbia, echoes
the consensus that emerged at the Washington meeting, that neither
deterrence doctrine nor the treaties and agreements would be
radically affected in the short run by India's and Pakistan's
tests.
</P>
<P>
   But Betts argued that the tests had highlighted the
contradiction between the written U.S. pledge to disarm (in the
Nonproliferation Treaty) and the longstanding commitment not to
disarmament but to arms reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The tests could also reopen long-simmering Cold War debates,
like whether the United States now needs ballistic missile defenses
in a proliferating world. ``In some ways, the situation for India
and Pakistan is comparable to where we were with the Russians in
1950,'' he said. Thus their choices could have profound
implications for the future of arms control. ``If they choose
proliferation and the debates lead to international paralysis or
inaction,'' he said, ``I would bet we'll see some defections among
those who have renounced nuclear weapons in the next few years.''

GIANT KILLER JUMPS INTO FRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Even for the trainer nicknamed The Giant Killer,
this would be quite a feat.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Jerkens will challenge Triple Crown hopeful Real Quiet
with lightly raced Limit Out today. He said, ``I'm trying to fight
a battleship with a canoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Limit Out's 1:20 2/5 victory in the 7-furlong Bay Shore at
Aqueduct earned the highest speed figures for any horse in the
Belmont Stakes field, but he has never gone farther than a mile or
run in a Grade I race.
</P>
<P>
   Jerkens, 69, a Hall of Famer based here, is best known for
springing upsets: Onion and Prove Out over Secretariat, Beau Purple
over Kelso three times, Handsome Boy over Buckpasser. But he said
the chance to spoil a Triple Crown bid isn't important.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just trying to get the money (for) your horse,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerkens, a student of racing history, believes the Belmont
distance is the best reason to think the result will be different
than in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. Before the Derby, there
were questions about Real Quiet's breeding for 1\ miles, and the
Belmont is 1{ miles.
</P>

   ``(Training great) Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons said a mile and a
quarter is about as far as a horse could go just on his class,''
Jerkens said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Jerkens said he's watched Real Quiet since
that colt's arrival at Belmont on Wednesday and said, ``He looks
good. He doesn't look like he's tailing off (physically).''
</P>
<P>
   On the town: Real Quiet owner Mike Pegram _ there's a
contradiction in terms _ went to the New York Stock Exchange Friday
morning and rang the opening bell. No, he didn't wear a tie.
</P>
<P>
   That was the latest appearance by the Real Quiet team at various
New York events. Bob Baffert and family were scheduled to throw out
the first ball at the Yankees-Florida Marlins game Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to enjoy the good times,'' Pegram said.
</P>
<P>
   Track records: The only jockeys making their Belmont Stakes
debuts in today's race are Jean-Luc Samyn (Limit Out) and Calvin

   D. Wayne Lukas (Grand Slam, Yarrow Brae) is the only trainer in

   JOB GAINS SURGED IN MAY; UNEMPLOYMENT STAYED LOW
</P>
<P>
   The government said employers added nearly 300,000 jobs to the
economy last month, unemployment held steady at a 28-year low of
4.3 percent and pay continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The data provided powerful evidence that the American economy's
seven-year-old expansion remains vibrant despite Asian tremors,
market jitters and fears that the country is running out of
workers.
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER BORROWING SURGES
</P>
<P>
   The pace of borrowing by U.S. consumers more than doubled in
April to $5.5 billion, compared with a month earlier, to total
$1.25 trillion, the Federal Reserve reported. Credit card borrowing
alone rose $2.3 billion, quadruple the rate in March.
</P>
<P>
   GM WORKERS STRIKE
</P>
<P>
   A strike over job security by 3,400 General Motors workers
halted work at a components factory in Flint, Mich. The strike
could cripple production at 17 of GM's 29 North American production
factories within a week. The two sides, which faced a similarly
tense labor showdown in 1997, when seven different strikes were
staged at factories across the country, were scheduled to negotiate
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   SHIFT IN INTERNET CONTROL
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said it would turn over the
management of the Internet's address system to an international
nonprofit group. The decision would remove the last vestige of
control by the U.S. government over the structure of the global
computer network. Management of Internet addresses has become the
focus of heated debates and litigation.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE PASSES DEEPER TAX CUT PLAN
</P>
<P>
   The House narrowly approved a plan to cut taxes and spending far
more deeply than last year's bipartisan balanced budget deal. The
House plan calls for about $100 billion in tax cuts in the next
five years, offset by spending cuts of the same amount. The primary
tax cut would be a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty, the
provision in the tax code that requires many two-income couples to
pay more than they would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   VW BACKED FOR ROLLS PURCHASE
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of Vickers voted overwhelmingly to sell Rolls-Royce
Motor Cars to Volkswagen for $703 million, rejecting bids from BMW
and a group of Rolls enthusiasts, who had hoped to keep the famed
luxury car brand in British hands. The deal still needs the
approval of Rolls-Royce PLC, the aircraft engine company, over use
of the Rolls name.
</P>
<P>
   NO FURTHER CUTS, MOTOROLA SAYS
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Motorola, Charles Galvin, said it did not
expect any additional job cuts beyond its announced plans to
eliminate 15,000 positions, or 10 percent of its work force, in the
next year. Galvin also said the company, a leading maker of
cellular phones and pagers, expects the semiconductor market to
shrink by 2 percent this year, a sharp contrast to forecasts of a
17 percent growth rate at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   BELGIAN BANK BIDDING BRAWL
</P>
<P>
   Fortis Group raised its bid for Generale de Banque to about
$13.4 billion, topping a $12.6 billion offer from ABN Amro Holding
NV. The move elevated the intensity of an unusual bidding battle to
form one of Europe's biggest financial services companies in
advance of European monetary union next year.
</P>
<P>
   VIVENDI SELLS ELECTRAFINA STAKE
</P>
<P>
   Vivendi, the French municipal services, media and
telecommunications conglomerate formerly known as Compagnie
Generale des Eaux, sold its 24.6 percent interest in Electrafina,
an energy and communications company, to Groupe Bruxelles Lambert
for $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOMAKERS CRITICIZE CRASH TESTS
</P>
<P>
   American, European and Japanese automakers told a safety
conference that increasingly high-speed government and insurance
industry crash tests were preventing auto engineers from designing
sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and large cars that would be
less dangerous to other motorists.

AFTER DAYLONG SIEGE, SUSPECT LINKED TO CHESIMARD SURRENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a 23-hour siege punctuated by police bursts of
tear gas and water from high-pressure hoses, a robbery suspect once
active in a black militant group surrendered Friday and ended a
standoff that shattered the calm of a New Jersey coastal town, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Donald Bunting, an ex-convict identified as a
friend of fugitive Joanne Chesimard, emerged from his barricaded
apartment in Bradley Beach at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman used the standoff, which had turned a
blue-collar neighborhood of converted bungalows into a paramilitary
camp, to criticize the Clinton administration for not pressing
Cuban President Fidel Castro to surrender Ms. Chesimard to the New
Jersey authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this has not been at the top of a president's
agenda,'' Whitman said in a letter to the White House released
after Bunting was taken into custody. ``But, while it may be clear
that Castro and Chesimard may be perfect together, the United
States should have no part in supporting his corrupt regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chesimard, whom police once called the ``soul'' of the Black
Liberation Army, took refuge in Cuba in 1984, five years after
escaping from a New Jersey prison while serving a term for the 1973
murder of a New Jersey State trooper, Werner Foerster.
</P>
<P>
   Foerster was slain execution-style with his own weapon after a
gunfight with Ms. Chesimard and two companions on the New Jersey
Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   The state police described Bunting as a member of the Black
Liberation Army in the late 1960s and early '70s and said he had
corresponded with Ms. Chesimard in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Bunting, 48, was charged with armed robbery and attempted armed
robbery in an Asbury Park case and weapons violations for two
handguns recovered in Bradley Beach.

STIFF SUSPENSIONS ISSUED IN ANGELS-ROYALS BRAWL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Measured by the suspensions that Gene Budig, the American League
president, issued to members of the Anaheim Angels and the Kansas
City Royals Friday, last month's brawl between the Yankees and the
Baltimore Orioles was only a preliminary. Budig suspended managers
Terry Collins of the Angels and Tony Muser of the Royals for eight
games each and nine players for one to four games for their roles
in a game filled with beanballs and fights on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Budig, continuing to crack down on such incidents, fined the
managers and players and also fined three coaches: Joe Maddon of
the Angels and Rich Dauer and Jamie Quirk of the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials of the American and National leagues, the
number of player suspensions resulting from the game _ 22 _ was the
most in at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Five players were suspended after the Orioles' Armando Benitez
hit the Yankees' Tino Martinez with a pitch on May 19, triggering a
brawl at Yankee Stadium. Benitez had the longest suspension, eight
days.
</P>
<P>
   The latest disciplinary action stemmed from two brawls during
the game in Kansas City, which featured five hit batters. Chris
Haney and Jim Pittsley of the Royals hit Phil Nevin in the fifth
and seventh innings, respectively; Rich DeLucia of the Angels hit
Dean Palmer in the eighth; Scott Service of Kansas City hit Darrin
Erstad in the ninth, and Mike Holtz of Anaheim hit Jose Offerman in
the bottom of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Benches emptied and brawls erupted after Nevin was hit in the
seventh and Offerman in the ninth. Twelve players were ejected from
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents had their origin in a home-plate collision last
year between Nevin, when he played for Detroit, and Mike Sweeney, a
Kansas City catcher. According to a lawyer with firsthand knowledge
of the circumstances, Nevin and Sweeney resolved their differences
the next day but did so unknown to some of the Royals pitchers.
Haney presumably was one of those who did not know and hit Nevin.
Pittsley, another one, also did not know that Haney had already hit
Nevin, so he plunked him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Budig noted the responsibility of the managers in Tuesday's
incidents, which resulted in the ejection of 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American League has a right to expect much from its field
managers,'' he said. ``They are, after all, the ones who chart the
strategy of the game for their players and the ones who determine,
in large measure, player attitudes and actions. Managers are
expected to be strong leaders and epitomize the highest degree of
accountability on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Budig, who coincidentally attended the game, said he was
distressed to see what he called ``utter disregard for player
safety,'' adding, ``There was a clear breakdown in leadership, and
the managers must assume much of the responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-game suspensions for the managers match the penalty
incurred by Benitez, who ignited the brawl at Yankee Stadium. Four
other players received suspensions of three or two games for that
incident.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest action, Budig suspended Kansas City's Felix
Martinez, who was sent to the minor leagues after the brawl, for
five games, and Jack McDowell of Anaheim for four games. Other
Angels players suspended were Nevin for three games, DeLucia and
Holtz for two each and Frank Bolick and Damon Mashore for one each.
Two other Royals players, Pittsley and Service, each incurred a
two-game suspension. The players were fined $1,000 or $500 for a
total of $7,500.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This is not the first time that both managers were suspended for
their part in the same on-field fight. In fact, the most recent
incident also involved Collins, when he was managing the Houston
Astros. Collins and Davey Johnson of the Cincinnati Reds were
suspended along with four players for a fight on Sept. 5, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The last time both managers were suspended following an American
League game was also in 1995. The managers were Terry Bevington of
Chicago and Phil Garner of Milwaukee, who had been suspended with
Tony LaRussa of Oakland after a 1993 brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of nine players surpasses the seven players who
were suspended in 1993 following a fight between the Orioles and
the Seattle Mariners. In a 1984 incident, managers Joe Torre of
Atlanta (three games) and Dick Williams of San Diego (10 games)
were suspended and 17 players were disciplined, though only five
were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   None of the suspensions will begin until next Friday, and they
will be served consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   The league had two reasons for the delay. It wanted to wait
until after the seven-day appeal period had elapsed and avoid the
interrupted three-game suspension that the Yankees' Darryl
Strawberry concocted so that he could play against Boston two weeks
ago. The league also didn't want to interfere with the interleague
schedule that began Friday night and runs through next Thursday.

 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The night of fights at Madison Square Garden, once
one of boxing's glamorous stages, had been advertised as ``D-Day''
_ a mix of bouts that included Evander Holyfield, the heavyweight
champion, Roberto Duran, an aging legend, and Christy Martin, the
world's top-rated female boxer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite weeks of promotion, the fights had failed to generate
much excitement, and Friday the event unraveled completely after a
series of strange developments: two fighters tested positive for
hepatitis, a female boxer turned out to be pregnant and promoters
were ordered by a Florida court to withhold any payment to Duran
because he owed thousands of dollars in unpaid child support.
</P>
<P>
   And so barely 24 hours before D-Day was to start, boxing and
Garden officials stepped in to cancel Saturday's event and postpone
the fights indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The concluding episode to the troubled event proved yet again
the sport's ability to provide the unexpected and to provoke
questions about basic safety.
</P>
<P>
   Don King, one of the fight's promoters, said he fully expected
some people would believe the problems were staged so he and others
might limit the financial damage of a loser of a fight card.
</P>
<P>
   For the Garden, which had a riot break out in the ring during a
major night of fights two years ago, this was the latest setback to
its bid to make boxing a profitable enterprise in the city.
Instead, Garden officials were left to announce refunds, while
Showtime, the cable television network, was canceling orders for
tens of thousands of pay-per-view orders.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the night, one of the more unusual tales of the
tape read this way: Henry Akinwande, the World Boxing Association's
top heavyweight contender and the man set to take on Holyfield, had
been diagnosed with hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver
damage and which can be transmitted through blood; Ray Mercer,
another heavyweight, had been diagnosed with hepatitis A, a milder
form of the disease that his manager said he contracted by eating a
salad; Maria Nieves Garcia, the fighter slated to box Christy
Martin, was found to be 21 weeks pregnant; and Duran, the
46-year-old Panamanian, was set to see a state court judge in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring the best boxing to New York City,'' said Paul
Munick, the Garden's director of athletics. Munick cited several
recent successful events, but conceded ``it's got its ups and
downs.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest financial losers for the moment are the fighters.
Holyfield will not receive his $10 million purse, and Akinwande
won't get his $2.5 million. The Garden, as well as Don King
Productions, the promoters, will not collect the gate receipts and
concession revenues they were going to share. And all money spent
by the promoters and Showtime, the television company that was
offering the fight on pay-per-view for $39.95, will only have value
if the fights are staged again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this is just a small hiccup, Akinwande will be able
to fight, and all this will create more interest for the fight,''
said Mark Greenberg, an executive vice president of Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   The only other heavyweight fight canceled so close to fight time
was the February 1996 bout between Tommy Morrison and Arthur
Weathers, which was canceled hours before the match when Morrison's
blood test revealed that he had tested positive for the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, whose share of weird boxing moments includes having
part of his ear bit off by Mike Tyson and having a paraglider drop
into the ring in the seventh round of his fight against Riddick
Bowe in 1993, said he was headed back to Atlanta to see his two
children compete in a track meet, while Akinwande, who could be out
of boxing for as long as six months, returned to his training camp
in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's disappointing,'' Holyfield said. ``I've been
training hard for 13 weeks. This kind of thing is worst when it
happens the day before the fight. I can't control what happens. You
just have to roll with the punches. That's part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Athletic Commission, the state's regulatory
agency, administered a blood test to Akinwande on Tuesday
afternoon, checking him for HIV, as well as hepatitis B and C,
according to Tony Russo, the commission's executive director.
California, Texas and Maryland are the only other states that test
boxers for hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Donald Kaminsky of the Albert Einstein Medical
Center, who studied Akinwande's blood sample for the commission,
the disease was at the infectious stage, and could be transmitted
through body fluids or blood. Hepatitis B, which is contracted by
roughly 300,000 people in the United States annually, is typically
passed along through sex or dirty hypodermic needles, but can also
be transmitted by something as innocent as a shared toothbrush.

USC REACHES CWS FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. - USC ended LSU's recent dominance of what was once
its own private tournament and at the same time wiped aside any
lingering questions about West Coast college baseball by knocking
the Tigers out of the College World Series Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you hope to survive?'' was one of the questions put to
USC coach Mike Gillespie last weekend after LSU bombed homer after
homer, a record eight in all, in beating the Trojans in a
first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   Safe to say the Trojans are surviving just fine after marching
through the loser's bracket with three successive wins, the last
two over two-time defending champion LSU, including what Gillespie
called a ``near perfect'' 7-3 victory on Friday at Rosenblatt
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With it, the Trojans reached the championship game for a record
14th time and today will face Pac-10 rival Arizona State for the
CWS crown.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second successive year two teams from the same
conference have met in the title game - last year LSU and Alabama
of the Southeastern Conference battled in the championship game -
but it's hard to imagine two more bitter foes going after the same
ring. In recent years there have been two on-the-field brawls
between USC and ASU, and earlier this season Arizona State coach
Pat Murphy complained bitterly about the Trojans stealing his
signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been allegations that we know their signs,''
Gillespie said Friday. ``We don't. I'm just hoping our guys know
our signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie has flashed all the right ones since that 12-10
opening-round loss to LSU, and he made all the right moves again on
Saturday, enough for LSU coach Skip Bertman to note, ``SC is at the
top of its game. They're hitting on all cylinders. Murphy better
watch out. His team has been sitting for two days (since knocking
out Long Beach State, 14-4, on Wednesday night) and (USC's)
momentum really helped them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior right-hander Mike Penney shut out LSU on four hits over
seven innings and benefited from three home runs, two by Jason
Lane, who also pitched the final 1 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never seemed to make any mistakes,'' LSU's All-American
first baseman Eddy Furniss said of Lane. ``It was masterful
pitching. We put the ball in play against him, but not with much
authority. We haven't run into dominating pitching all season, but
he shut us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Seth Etherton did on Thursday in a 5-4 victory that got
the Trojans to Friday's elimination game.
</P>
<P>
   Penney was tagged for a three-run homer in the eighth by
designated hitter Jeff Leaumont -- ``One of the few mistakes he
made all day,'' Leaumont said - but by then the Trojans had opened
a seven-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who leads the CWS in hits with 12, slugged a two-run homer
in the fifth to highlight a three-run inning against LSU's Doug
Thompson, Morgan Ensberg homered with no one aboard in the sixth
and Lane hit his second to lead off the seventh - his first
two-homer game as a Trojan - and knock out Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd had my number the whole series,'' Lane said of Thompson,
who hurled three scoreless innings in the first-round meeting. ``I
just tried to stay back, and he hung a curve. I was able to get the
good part of the bat on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Penney, who had pitched in relief in two earlier games, reeled
through the first four innings, allowing only two baserunners,
which was a key, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nerves were a factor early on,'' Penney said, ``and I'm
normally a slow starter. After the first inning I thought, `Hey, I
survived it,' and then I just tried to keep my team in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   If Penney was nervous at all, Bertman didn't notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been playing with a lot of excitement, a lot of
enthusiasm,'' the LSU coach said, ``and Mike Penney took that away.
USC is clearly better than we are right now . . . over the last 48
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's All-Pac-10 showdown, freshman Rik Currier, who struck
out 12 and pitched four-hit ball in a 7-1 victory over Mississippi
State last Tuesday, will start for USC; Ryan Mills, well-rested
after beating Miami, 9-2, last Sunday, will start for Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans and Sun Devils split their six regular-season games.
Mills was 1-1 against the Trojans, getting rocked for five runs on
six hits in three innings in a 6-3 loss March 15, then three weeks
later striking out 15 and allowing only three hits in an 18-3 romp.
Currier was the losing pitcher in another ASU runaway, 24-4, on
April 11.
</P>
<P>
   But, as ASU's Murphy pointed out, ``They didn't have (Eric)
Munson then, and to me he's the best hitter in college baseball.
They've got the momentum, they've won three in a row, we've got our
work cut out.'

MAN AVOIDS DEATH PENALTY TRIAL WITH PLEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Avoiding what would have been the first federal death
penalty trial in Manhattan in more than four decades, a Connecticut
man made a plea bargain in federal district court Friday, admitting
he burned his fiancee to death while she was locked in the trunk of
his car, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Deric Frank, 23, of Norwalk, Conn., pleaded
guilty to one count of interstate kidnapping, conspiracy and three
charges related to domestic violence and violating an order of
protection. If a jury had convicted him of the kidnapping charges,
Frank could have faced execution.
</P>
<P>
   But Frank agreed to a brokered arrangement of life in prison
without the possibility of parole, said Shirah Neiman, deputy
United States attorney for the southern district of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Frank admitted that he abducted his fiancee, Shaneika Price, 24,
on March 11 in Stamford, Conn. Frank had often beaten and menaced
Ms. Price, prosecutors said, and on the day before her murder, she
had obtained an order of protection against Frank.
</P>
<P>
   He locked her into the trunk of his car and drove to New York,
to an access road to the Cross Bronx Expressway. He then lighted
the car on fire, burning his girlfriend alive.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they believed that the last federal capital
case in Manhattan was in 1954, ending in the execution of Gerhard
A. Puff, who killed an FBI agent.

CHURCH-STATE SEPARATION THIN AT CHARTER SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The line between church and state shrinks to a
pinstripe at a Higley charter school. While the school runs on
taxpayer dollars, its big red-white-and-blue sign proudly
proclaims: ``In God We Trust.'' At a Phoenix charter school, a
picture of the Virgin Mary hung for a time in the school office.
And in Mesa, a charter school placed an advertisement encouraging
students to attend Mormon seminary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When it comes to separating religion and government, there are
charter schools that walk that fine line and others that have
clearly crossed it.
</P>
<P>
   National and local critics say that such violations cannot be
tolerated in schools that are run privately but are funded
publicly. Charter-school supporters say mistakes are bound to
occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think horrible things are happening in charter schools,''
said Eleanor Eisenberg, executive director of the Arizona Civil
Liberties Union. ``Religion is one of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   If religion is cropping up on signs and in advertising, what's
to say it isn't seeping into Arizona classroom, she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, believe that isn't happening. They contend the
religious overtones that have percolated to the surface in Arizona
-_ many of which were corrected as soon as they were discovered _-
are part of the growing pains charter schools must go through as
they find their place in today's educational marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to live and learn,'' said Mary Gifford, a charter
school advocate who works for the conservative think tank, the
Goldwater Institute. ``We're going to have to roll with the punches
and let the market correct itself.''
</P>
<P>
   As a graduate of Mountain View High School, she remembers an
incident more than a decade ago where she was asked to fill out a
religion-type card. Her mother complained and the practice was
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But no one called for the public district school to be closed.
It's a different story when charter schools make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask that the charter be revoked,'' Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   She realizes that the incidents damage charter schools in some
people's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this type of (religious) thing scare some people away? Of
course,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But every time a problem arises at one school, it makes all
charter schools take a magnifying glass to themselves, Gifford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Take Life School College Preparatory in Mesa. In May, an
advertisement the school took out in the ``Beehive,'' a Church of
Latter-Day Saints publication, was passed along to various media
outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The ad listed 10 reasons LDS parents should choose Life School.
</P>
<P>
   ``1. Select an LDS Mentor. Your child will be with this master
teacher every day for several years if you wish,'' the
advertisement states.
</P>
<P>
   The ad worried even those who embrace charter schools, including
Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's superintendent of public instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Alverson, Life School's executive director, sent her an
apologetic letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have instructed the paper to pull our ad immediately,'' he
wrote in the letter dated May 18. ``If our advertising misleads the
general public to think we are, somehow, offering religious
instruction, then we are in the wrong and need to change the way we
advertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Alverson said this week he may have approached the line, even
looked at it but he skirted it when he placed the ad in the
``Beehive'' more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a public school,'' he said. ``Advertisements and what
happens in the classroom are two different animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Alverson wanted to show off his schools and what they have to
offer. So he took out ads in a Mormon publication, a Catholic
newspaper and a Jewish one as well as nonsecular publications,
similar to what his competition, Mesa Public Schools, has done.
</P>
<P>
   Never did he envision his actions would make news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet every charter school looked at the way it markets itself
after the Life School ad,'' Gifford said.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the country, the problems have been more
blatant.
</P>
<P>
   In California, a lawsuit recently was filed against a
New-Age-type charter school claiming it was promoting religious
perspectives in the classroom. Teachers apparently were asked to
undergo specialized training that smacked of religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to see national problems when it comes to
charter schools violating the separation of church and state,''
said Joe Conn, a spokesman for the Washington D.C.-based Americans
United for Separation of Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some schools are going as far as they can with this. That
raises very serious legal issues,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Conn said that laws governing charter schools should be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John Huppenthal, R-Chandler, doesn't see it that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think generally people should be cautious about these
things,'' said the charter-school proponent. ``But the remedies are
more likely to be at the administrative level than the statutory
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra Larsen, executive director of the State Board for
Charter Schools also cautions against over-reaction. Many of the
problems are caused by naivety, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There's the story of a charter school that wanted to advertise
by placing fliers on cars parked at churches. They were advised not
to by the charter board. &UR; Instead, market broadly, they advised.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was NFL-YET Academy in south Phoenix. During a visit
last spring, Gifford, who used to be the state charter board's
executive director, noticed a prayer and a Virgin Mary picture in
the school office. She told school officials it might be
misconstrued and workers removed the item.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people who get into the charter school business
really want to help children and parents,'' Larsen said. ``People
``People don't do it (promote religion) intentionally but it's part
of what they believe in and they don't think it's harmful. When
it's charter schools, you have to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, it's complaints from parents that make officials aware of
the possibility of religion making it's way into charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   One of them alerted the State Board of Charter Schools about the
sign in front of Eagle's Aerie School in Higley. ``In God We
Trust'' it says, underneath the school name and a picture of an
eagle.
</P>
<P>
   Unsure if such words were appropriate, the charter board sought
advice from the Attorney General's Office. It's OK, experts
decided. Basically, it's similar to the ``Pledge of Allegiance''
that includes the line: ``One nation under God,'' Larsen explained.
</P>
<P>
   However, there have been other complaints against the same
school. Parents who volunteer on the playground apparently referred
to each other as ``sister,'' a common practice in the Mormon faith.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldwater Institute's Gifford called school director Tim
Peak at the time and asked him to put a stop to it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Peak, who admits many Arizona charter schools are predominantly
filled with LDS children, said in no way is religion part of the
school day at Eagle's Aerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's against the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The school, like it's name and sign suggest, is strong on
Americanism.
</P>
<P>
   But several parents still have concerns about the school. None
of Patty Wilson's children will be back at Eagle's Aerie in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   They got tired of being asked if they are Mormon, which they are
not, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening is they're trying to take public money and
open a private school,'' Wilson said. ``It isn't right.''

STEWART HOPES TO ESTABLISH A SLOW RACE; BOAT HAS FASTER
EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ With his straightest poker face, pole sitter
Tony Stewart says he is plotting a comfortable race pace for the
True Value 500K.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 qualifier Billy Boat says he is anticipating a flat-out
sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Who's zooming whom?
</P>
<P>
   Front-row starters Stewart and Boat _ and a handful of drivers
who routinely have been breaking the 220-mph barrier _ will have
312 laps to decide if the True Value 500K becomes a shootout at 8
tonight on the revamped 1.5-mile Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and Boat emerged as odds-on favorites in the Pep Boys
Indy Racing League Series event after two hot laps of qualifying
yesterday afternoon. Originally scheduled for Thursday night,
qualifying was washed out by a rainstorm and rebooked yesterday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by an ambient temperature of only 66 degrees after a
muggy, mid-90-degree day Thursday, Stewart bagged the No. 1
qualifying spot with a top lap of 224.448 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get around here,'' said Stewart, 27, who exited
the Indy 500 last month with a blown motor while in the lead. ``I
was thinking what I wanted to eat for lunch after I got done
qualifying. It's a tribute to the job they've done on this
racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was referring to the massive revamping done to TMS since
April 22, when the 24-degree banked turns were torn up and
reconfigured, and the entire track repaved.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's run, which took only 24.059 seconds, was a record
breaker on several fronts. It erased the TMS qualifying mark of
216.494 mph Stewart set last June, when the format also included a
pit stop and tire change.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's lap also is the fastest pole-speed run by a ``new
formula'' IRL car, a package featuring specification chassis and
normally aspirated V-8 engines introduced in January 1996. The
prior IRL pole record was Boat's four-lap average of 223.503 mph
set at the 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway last month.
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who held the pole before Stewart bumped him off here,
settled for the outside spot of the two-car front row at 223.547
mph.
</P>
<P>
   But more than two hours after the conclusion of qualifying,
Stewart fired another shot. The reigning series champion ripped off
a lap of 225.696 mph during the day's final practice _ a speed that
is the fastest by a ``new formula'' IRL car but not a record
because it was not posted during qualifying or the race. The
previous record was Boat's 224.573 mph on the first lap of his
four-lap qualifying run at IMS.
</P>
<P>
   With all that, Stewart insisted he was not going to run his race
car into the blacktop once the green flag falls at 8 p.m. Stewart
posted the fastest circuit of last year's race, at 218.094 mph, on
lap 97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really concerned at the start about setting the
pace,'' said Stewart, driver of the No. 1 Glidden/Menards Special
Dallara/Aurora. ``I'll run what I think is comfortable, and I'm not
going to look at a stopwatch to do it. I'll just run what I feel
the car is happy with. If that's fast enough to lead the race,
we'll lead. If someone wants to go a little quicker at the
beginning, we'll let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be Boat's cue to scoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I foresee this being a sprint race,'' said Boat, 32, driver of
the No. 11 Conseco Dallara/Aurora owned by four-time Indy 500
champion A.J. Foyt. ``I think you're going to be running as hard as
you can every lap, because as long as your race car doesn't go
away, the racetrack lets you run hard. You're going to have to be
flat out as much as you can if you're going to run up front.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who exited the Indy 500 with a drive line problem, said
running flat-out figures to take its mechanical toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably won't see 224 mph laps in the race, but I think
you'll see 220s,'' Boat said. ``There's no doubt we'll be running
faster here than we did at Indy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen drivers in the 28-car field _ four short of the full IRL
complement of 32 _ broke Stewart's old qualifying record of 216.494
mph. Robbie Buhl, Stewart's teammate, will start on the inside of
Row 2 after a lap at 223.104 mph in the No. 3 Johns Manville
Dallara/Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   Arie Luyendyk, who was awarded the victory in this race last
year after an all-night scoring review, will start fourth in the
No. 5 Sprint PCS/Radio Shack G Force/Aurora after a lap at 221.166
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a good starting position,'' said Luyendyk, the two-time
Indy 500 champion who won here at the expense of Boat. ``They're
(Stewart's team) still 3 mph quicker than we are. But the race is
going to be a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who was denied his first IRL victory by the revamped
scoring, insisted that TMS does not owe him a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we definitely have a lot of incentive going into this
race,'' Boat said, ``to try to win.''

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PUTS BULL TROUT ON THE THREATENED LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB TAYLOR  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSOULA, MONT. _ The Endangered Species Act reached higher into
mountains of the Columbia Basin Friday when the bull trout was
listed as threatened by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the brawny fish as
threatened in parts of Montana, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit, who made the announcement, said
the agency is considering extending the listing to include bull
trout in Puget Sound and Olympic Peninsula, as well as along parts
of Montana and the Idaho-Nevada border. In addition, Babbit said
the government is planning to study whether the westslope cutthroat
trout are also in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting bull trout, which require especially cold, clean
water for spawning and rearing, would entail leaving more trees
near timberland streams, screening of irrigation pumps, leaving
more water in rivers in late summer and providing passage around
dams.
</P>
<P>
   Babbit announced the listings from the bank of the Big Blackfoot
River, the legendary trout stream from Norman Maclean's novella,
``A River Runs Through It,'' then pulled on waders to go fly
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dammed our rivers,'' Babbit said, as he explained the
causes of the bull trout's decline. ``We diverted them, split them
with roads and culverts, pumped them dry. We mined their headwaters
and left acid waste to bleed into them for decades after exhausting
the mine. We logged them from mouth to source, removing shade,
shelter, nutrients and insect habitat, letting the barren banks
erode and silt up spawning gravel beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove vast cattle herds into and up their waters. We
dumpled chemicals and sewage and slaughterhouse waste into them.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, the secretary said, we must repair the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will resist, Babbitt said. But he added, ``I think
we're getting past that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Farm Bureau is worried irrigators could face
government demands to leave water in streams. And some timber
industry officials grumbled that they were already doing things for
the fish.
</P>
<P>
   But the flood of regulatory action surrounding the bull trout
sparked nothing like the anger that greeted the listing of the
northern spotted owl eight years ago, nor the anxiety that met
salmon listings in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The states of Montana and Idaho, along with the Plum Creek
Timber Co. and an assortment of agencies and landowners in the bull
trout's range, are already working on habitat protection and
planning, Babbitt noted.
</P>
<P>
   Pacts with state agencies assure that the listings will not
prevent bull trout fishing, Babbitt noted, as he waved his Montana
fishing license. Most fishing rules across the region call for live
release of the bright orange or red speckled fish.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal actions extend fish-protections to the upper
streams and lakes of the Columbia and Klamath basins, beyond lower
reaches to which dwindling salmon and steelhead already are
bringing the influence of the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   In Blackfoot, a partnership of ranchers, local industries and
fish and wildlife agencies has spent $1.5 million improving stream
habitat during the last seven years. The remedies have shown some
improvement. Bull trout numbers are up 57 percent; cutthroat trout
have exploded to more than seven times their former abundance. And
fly fishermen are spending an estimated $7 million annually to fish
the Blackfoot alone.
</P>
<P>
   The job is far from finished, but, ``we've got the river turned
around,'' said Paul Roos, who runs Pro Outfitters, which provides
guiding and gear for fishers here and in other rivers in Montana,
the fly fishers' nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Far from accelerating the listing, the Interior Department
stalled it for most of the last six years, sometimes by saying
listing was warranted by bull trout declines but precluded by other
agency priorities. The agency was pushed to action by repeated
proposals and lawsuits from several environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to litigate every step of the way,'' said Mike
Bader, executive director of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies.

<P>
   Texas Instruments Inc., a leading producer of computer chips, is
in talks to sell its memory-chip operations to Micron Technology
Inc., people close to the talks said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While the discussions are preliminary and it is always possible
they could fall apart, the sale would be a significant move for
Texas Instruments, whose earnings have been hurt by overproduction
and declining prices in the notoriously fickle market for dynamic
random-access memory chips, or D-RAMs.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would allow Micron Technology, one of the nation's
leading chip makers, to buy much-needed market share to challenge
foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet known what price Texas Instruments is seeking or
how any deal would be structured. The company, based in Dallas, is
involved in two joint ventures and has chip-making operations of
its own. Analysts estimate revenue for the company's memory-chip
business at $850 million for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long pushed Texas Instruments to sell its D-RAM
business. The price of D-RAM chips, which are commonly used in
personal computers and other devices, has fallen to $3 each from
more than $8 a year ago. The D-RAM business accounts for roughly 10
percent of the company's sales.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments has already taken some steps away from the
business. In March it sold its 33 percent stake in a joint venture
with Acer Inc., Taiwan's largest computer maker, after a nine-year
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help them to get out from under a loss that is killing
their stock price and focus on other business,'' said James
Barlage, a senior semiconductor analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   A sale, he said, would allow Texas Instruments to focus instead
on its digital signal processor business, a rapidly growing market.
Digital signal processors are specialized chips used in cellular
telephones, computer networking equipment, toys and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Both Texas Instruments and Micron Technology declined to comment
on whether they were in talks.
</P>
<P>
   But Micron Technology, which is based in Boise, Idaho, has said
lately that it wants to expand its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Adams, portfolio manager of the Berger 100 mutual fund,
met with a Micron Technology executive on Thursday in New York who
told him the company was ``looking to make an acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly makes sense for both sides to make the deal
work,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle that Micron Technology faces is financing, analysts
said. The company does not have enough cash to acquire the
business, Barlage said, and would most likely consider debt
financing, possibly a convertible bond offering.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Texas Instruments closed at $50.8125 Friday, down 6.25
cents; Micron Technology closed at $24.0625, up 31.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry watchers have speculated for nearly a
month about whether the companies were in talks. Texas Instruments,
which analysts say is also looking to acquire other properties, was
the subject of market speculation on Thursday when analysts said it
could be a possible buyer of Integrated Circuit Systems, based in
Valley Forge, Pa. Integrated denied it was in talks with Texas
Instruments.

 &HT;    Motorola Investors, analyst skeptical about Motorola
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Tx. Analysts and the investors were skeptical Friday
about Motorola Inc.'s restructuring plan, which includes slashing
its work force by 10 percent _ 15,000 workers _ in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   After rising in early trading Friday, shares of the company fell
56 1/4 cents to $50.93 3/4 to close near the company's 52-week low
of $50.62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts warn that a restructuring begun last year in the
company's Semiconductor Products Sector, based in Austin, has yet
to show benefits. They wonder if the one announced late Thursday
will be more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said it was downsizing in
an effort to save $750 million over the next year. It also will
consolidate its semiconductor manufacturing and cut low-performing
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola blamed the cutbacks on weak pricing and lower demand in
Asia. The company got 26 percent of its 1997 revenue of $29.8
billion from Asia, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNBC news on Friday morning, chief
executive officer Chris Galvin said the company had expected a 17
percent growth rate for the chip industry instead of the 2 percent
drop now forecast for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said Motorola will trim ``pockets of the company'' around
the world. ``We very much regret the impact that this will have on
selected employees at Motorola,'' he said on CNBC. ``We'll handle
the people situation with the traditional Motorola sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Austin operations, where it has about 10,000
workers, are expected to be hard hit. Motorola's Semiconductor
Products Sector is based in Austin and the company has five chip
plants here. Two of them are more than 20 years old and another is
16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday how many workers in the area would be
fired and what parts of the semiconductor sector would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the company said temporary workers might be let
go first and that senior employees would be offered severance
packages. Announcements on cuts are expected to come as early as
Monday as managers at the company met Friday to discuss the
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company's actions will help its prospects, but
some said Motorola's retooling, including the semiconductor
restructuring begun last year, have been sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Modoff, an analyst at Alex Brown, said investors are
taking a ``wait-and-see'' approach to the stock. His company
recommends holding. ``People have heard this before. Obviously,
people aren't buying into this as they have in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the Merrill Lynch brokerage firm said signs are
positive for the corporate restructuring, ``however, a
semiconductor sector renewal plan was implemented about a year ago,
and we have yet to see tangible benefits from that plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor plan was aimed at making the company more
responsive to customers and bringing products to market faster.
</P>
<P>
   In semiconductors, Motorola is the fourth biggest supplier in
the world. It leads in one category, microcontrollers. Those are
chips that are embedded in autos, for example, to control braking
and accleration. In its Thursday announcement, Motorola said it
would continue to concentrate on microcontrollers.
</P>
<P>
   In other chip categories, however, it ranks third or fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Motorola and Lucent Technologies said they
would team up on a new generation of digital signal processors,
chips that translate sound and vision into a digital format. It is
expected to be a high growth market.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been working on a broad corporate plan that
would give it a more customer-focused approach. It has yet to
reveal details of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola also faces intense competition in its cellular and
wireless phone businesses. Ericsson and Nokia have eaten away much
of Motorola's market share in cellular. Motorola has been slow to
bring wireless products to market.
</P>
<P>
   Will Strauss, president of Forward Concepts Market Research,
said the company's management faces a tough Asian market as well as
its own sprawling size in turning its fortunes around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to turn an aircraft carrier,'' Strauss said.
``It's a very slow thing and the Asian economic situation really
rubs salt into the wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss and other analysts predicted Motorola would close some
of its older chip production factories and spin off some of its
slow-performing businesses while concentrating on its satellite,
digital signal processor and digital wireless products.
</P>
<P>
   Investment firms including Merrill Lynch revised their estimates
for the current quarter after warnings from the company that it
would not meet the expected 20 cents a share earnings for the
second quarter. In a report issued Friday, Merrill Lynch said the
company's problems ``were worse than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola engineers and chip designers looking for jobs may find
their best prospects at smaller firms, said Kim Butler, president
of Greywolf Consulting in Austin. ``In Austin, a lot of the
opportunities are with smaller design centers and start-up
companies rather than the larger firms,'' he said. ``There are also
a lot of opportunities on either coast, especially in California
and Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   At larger companies, Samsung, with has about 1,000 Austin
employees, isn't hiring, said Bill Cryer, a spokesman. ``Right now
we're at a plateau,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AMD Inc., on the other hand, is hiring product test and
development engineers, semiconductor design engineers and process
engineers, said spokesman Robert Durand.

 &HT;    Catholic Church examines its response to Priests' misconduct
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- For 2,000 years, symbolic devices have
been essential to the Catholic Church and its rituals for the
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The ring of the bells, the smell of the incense, the light
radiating through stained-glass windows and the priest's bright
vestments touched the senses, transforming ceremony into spiritual
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Today one of the church's most sacred symbols wears the stain of
scandal. The priest's white collar that once was a sign of trust
and virtue has become an emblem of a breach of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no more pedestals left for priests,'' said Bishop
Robert Lynch. ``Priests must behave differently now _ even the good
priests. Times have changed, and people look at us differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Lynch took control of the Diocese of Palm Beach when
its bishop, J. Keith Symons, resigned after admitting he sexually
molested five boys decades ago. Three of them have reportedly come
forward and acknowledged their abuse to the church.
</P>
<P>
   The highest U.S. Catholic to be forced from office for molesting
minors, Symons adds another disgrace to a troubled ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American bishops have made some progressive steps toward
dealing with this crisis,'' said Jason Berry, author of Lead Us Not
Into Temptation, a 1992 book on clergy sexual abuse. ``I don't
think they understand the depths of the decay. I think the bishops
view this as a public relations problem that will pass in time as
many problems have for the church through the centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Symons is a reminder that the clergy are vulnerable
to the same evils that infect the rest of humanity. Lynch said the
church has turned again to symbolism to demonstrate that the
priesthood is not deity and not far removed from the faithful
masses.
</P>
<P>
   Confessionals are now being built with clear glass windows
instead of heavy curtains, he said. Communion rails no longer
separate priests and their altar from parishioners. And more and
more, priests are taking off their collars when going to public
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do things the same way we did 30 years ago,'' Lynch
said. ``We have to earn the respect of the people through honest
ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing onslaught of sexual misconduct cases has
complicated the already difficult task of recruiting young men to a
life of celibacy in the clergy, then keeping them in it.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 men worldwide have left the priesthood since
the 1960s, according to Georgetown University's Center for Applied
Research in the Apostolate. In the United States, the number of
priests has fallen to just under 50,000, a 17 percent decline since
the mid-1960s. Some breakaway Catholic reform groups predict that
by the year 2000, the number of married former priests will exceed
that of active ones.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the bishops have moved to used tougher screening
procedures for seminary candidates. Catholic students attend two or
three psycho-sexual workshops each year as part of the five- to
seven-year process of training for the priesthood. Psychological
examinations are required for admission to the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working harder to develop a high sense of
professionalism,'' Lynch said. ``Maybe Ronald Reagan said it best:
Trust but verify.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops also have developed a plan of action for handling
scandal. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1992 wrote
these guidelines for use in cases of sexual abuse:
</P>
<P>
   _ Respond promptly to all allegations of abuse where there is
reasonable belief that abuse has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   _ If such an allegation is supported by sufficient evidence,
relieve the alleged offender promptly of his ministerial duties and
refer him for appropriate medical evaluation and intervention.
</P>
<P>
   _ Comply with the obligations of civil law as it regards to
reporting of the incident and cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reach out to the victims and their families and communicate
sincere commitment to their spiritual and emotional well-being.
</P>
<P>
   _ Within the confines of respect for privacy of those involved,
deal as openly as possible with members of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge, however, that the guidelines are more symbolism
_ that they're more public relations than solutions to real
problems in the real world outside the sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Peters, of Palm Beach Gardens, has been doing battle with
the church over the sexual abuse inflicted by her uncle, a Jesuit
priest, close to 50 years ago. She said he molested her more than
100 times and also molested her four sisters as they grew up in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after suffering quietly for more than five decades, the
women informed the Maryland Provincial of the Society of Jesus in
Baltimore of their abuse. The Jesuits acknowledged the priest's
problems and sent him to the St. Luke's psychiatric center in
Suitland, Md., for therapy.
</P>
<P>
   After four months, he was released and given a job on the
Georgetown University campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't believe that after so much abuse, this was how the
church dealt with this,'' Peters said. ``It's incredible that he's
on a college campus in the company of women.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jesuits attorney did not return phone calls Friday, but Rev.
James R. Stormes, the Jesuits' provincial, defended the handling of
the case in a letter to Peters and her sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sympathize with the pain they are feeling,'' he wrote. ``He
is forbidden to exercise any public pastoral ministry. (He) has
complied generously and sincerely with the program of treatment and
supervision . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Denis L. Ventriglia, a Wilmington, N.C., attorney who represents
the women, said a monetary settlement is not why the women came
forth with their charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting to see whether or not the Jesuits will put in
writing that his collar will be removed permanently,'' Ventriglia
said. ``The reason being the collar engenders so much trust by
children and adults. It is a symbol that carries great power.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry believes the bishops have not yet confronted the root
issues that create the continuing turmoil within the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this mentality of institutional defenses that seems
to view the messengers of bad news as culprits rather than trying
to understand why the news is bad,'' he said. ``The priesthood is
not the institution it was a generation ago. Symons is another
episode in a continuing scandal of epic proportions. There is a
deep systematic problem in Catholic culture.''

 &HT;    Another bizarre twist for Holyfield
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- What is farce to the rest of the world is normal to
Evander Holyfield. He lives in a place where fools wearing fans
pounce from the sky and where ears are hors d'oeuvres. Around each
corner, abomination awaits.
</P>
<P>
   What's a little virus when you've survived being called a
walking heart attack?
</P>
<P>
   So, even as his Saturday night fight with Henry Akinwande was
collapsing, Holyfield kept to routine. It's all that maintains a
sane man in an insane position.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say he didn't have a violent reaction during a
quick huddle with his advisors late Friday morning beside the
Madison Square Garden training ring. The news of Akinwande's
hepatitis caused Holyfield to arch not one, but both, eyebrows. For
him, that was an emotional earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Holyfield climbed directly into the ring and began the
regimen of stretching and sweating just as if nothing were said.
</P>
<P>
   He shut out the buzzing of the conspiracy theorists around the
ring. Was it really a virus that had suddenly gripped the
challenger, they wondered, or had Akinwande actually tested
positive for poor ticket sales? Boxing always brings out the worst
kind of thoughts, no matter the blood evidence.
</P>
<P>
   All around this doomed fight card, medical science intervened.
Heavyweight Ray Mercer, on the undercard, also was diagnosed with
hepatitis. Maria Nieves-Garcia, the opponent for women's champion
Christy Martin, was found to be 21 weeks pregnant. Suddenly,
Madison Square Garden was turned into the world's largest free
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield pushed down the inevitable disappointment of Friday's
events. This was to be the $11 million payday at the end of 13
weeks of training, as well as some much-needed activity while
Lennox Lewis was out of reach. Still, outwardly, he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the guy things happen to,'' he said after the workout
without a cause. ``Personally, I didn't do anything. As long as
it's not my fault, it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He even joked about the lost wages. ``I would have won anyway,''
Holyfield said. ``I feel I should get the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, y'all will take up a donation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is not in understanding such a strange twist, but
in where to rank Friday among all the other bizarre Holyfield
happenings.
</P>
<P>
   This one, of course, would have to go below the night Mike Tyson
used Holyfield's ear for a chew toy. Below Fan Man flying into the
ring during the second fight against Riddick Bowe. Below the
diagnosis after his loss to Michael Moorer that briefly caused
Holyfield to retire with a supposedly defective heart.
</P>
<P>
   But probably above the scramble and cancellations that put him
in an Atlanta ring against Bert Cooper, who then knocked the
hometown champion on his rear. Above his only appearance at the
Garden, an ugly thing halted when Bobby Czyz claimed he was blinded
by some substance on Holyfield's glove.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute nature of the Akinwande test and findings is
baffling, ready fodder for suspicious minds.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone else, the absurdity of Friday would strike like a
shovel between the eyes. For Evander Holyfield, it was just another
day at the office.

 &HT;    Hepatitis KOs Akinwande
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After wilting physically against Riddick Bowe and
looking harmless against Bobby Czyz, the munchkin of the
heavyweight division, Evander Holyfield, appeared headed for
retirement. What followed was a rebirth: consecutive dominating
wins over Mike Tyson, a five-knockdown avenging of a loss to
Michael Moorer and $62 million in purses won.
</P>
<P>
   It follows that when Holyfield's soap-opera career continued
Friday with the postponement of tonight's WBA and IBF title fight
against hepatitis-stricken contender Henry Akinwande, Holyfield's
disappoinment soon was replaced by thoughts that this might not be
a horrendous development.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Jim Thomas, said, ``Don't laugh. I've been hanging
around with spiritual people a lot and maybe because of that I
believe something good may come out of this. Things happen in a
strange way. What I'm hoping is that this event unclogs the logjam
and leads us to the fight we all want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Holyfield against Lennox Lewis to unify the
heavyweight championship. Negotiations for that bout fell apart
last winter because the HBO cable network, which held pay-per-view
rights, would not satisfy the purse demands of the two fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas planned to meet with promoter Don King late Friday night
about Holyfield's future.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the WBC champion, tentatively plans a mandatory defense
Sept. 26 against Zeljko Mavrovic.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield would like to meet Lewis in November or December,
which would necessitate Lewis-Mavrovic taking place earlier _ or
not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will be decided until the results of Akinwande's second
blood test are known early next week. He submitted a blood sample
Tuesday that came back positive for hepatitis B on Friday. The New
York Athletic Commission, one of seven state bodies that mandate a
screening for hepatitis, called off the bout because of the risk of
Akinwande spilling infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   If the results are negative, the fight could be rescheduled for
as early as next month. The camps of the two fighters will join
King and Showtime cable executive Jay Larkin next week to determine
whether to set a new date or cancel it. J.C. Courreges, Akinwande's
manager, said, ''If Henry is not going to be well for six months,
obviously we are not going to sue (Holyfield) if he wants to fight
somebody else. We are not his enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield also has a defense, mandated by the IBF, pending
against Vaughn Bean. But Larkin said, ''Nobody wants to see that
fight. Everybody wants Holyfield-Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   The WBA, which mandated the Akinwande fight, also could dictate
a defense against another contender.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield wasn't told of Akinwande's condition until about 11
a.m., after finishing his pre-workout prayer circle with camp
members.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been training for 13 weeks,'' he said. ''For this to
happen the day before the fight is disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he gave his blood sample 10 weeks ago. ``They
want to check me very early,'' he said. ``I'm the guy with the bad
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The joking reference was to Holyfield's misdiagnosed heart
ailment following a loss to Moorer in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield is no stranger to hepatitis. A blood sample taken
during training for the third Bowe fight showed he also had
contracted the virus, but had recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things happen to me,'' he said. ''You have to roll with the
punches.''
</P>
<P>
   All parties denied suspicions of doctored blood tests in light
of minimal interest in the fight. Madison Square Garden had
distributed over 8,000 tickets but sold only 4,000 after paying a
$3 million site fee. Some Showtime insiders say the network was
headed for a $5 million pay-per-view loss.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a concern to Holyfield. After concluding his wasted
workout Friday, he was asked about his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''My kids are running track (today),'' he said. ''So I guess I'm
going to a track meet.''

   There may be a wind tunnel in Hendrick Motorsports future.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word from team president John Hendrick, who adds that
if it does happen, it will be available for use by all Winston Cup
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't made a decision yet, but we are looking at the
expense and so forth,'' said Hendrick, brother of Rick Hendrick.
``We feel that it could work with all the teams that are here
(Charlotte), but we're not sure if we have the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup and Busch Grand National teams currently use the
Lockheed tunnel in Marietta or go to a similar site in Langley,
Va., to test the aerodynamics of their cars. The General Motors
tunnel near Detroit is available to GM teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the teams here, there is definitely a need,''
Hendrick said. ``As many times as we go in (during) the year, and
with all the teams here, it certainly will be more convenient than
others we've used.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 48 Winston Cup teams, 44 are in North Carolina. Of those,
34 are near Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie race
</P>
<P>
   With high profile rookies Kenny Irwin and Steve Park, most
people thought Jerry Nadeau and Kevin Lepage would be also-rans for
Rookie of the Year. Not any longer. Park has been out of action
since breaking his leg in Atlanta, and Irwin has struggled. Lepage
trails Irwin by six points, 128-122. Nadeau, despite missing three
events, is 30 behind Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Last dance
</P>
<P>
   Randy LaJoie makes his final Winston Cup start tonight in place
of Ricky Craven. Then he will pick up his Busch schedule, which
features stops at Fountain, Colo., Watkins Glen, N.Y., West Allis,
Wis., and Fontana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Busch
</P>
<P>
   Baseball-racing
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has invaded NASCAR. St. Louis slugger Mark
McGwire recently purchased a piece of Bobby Hillin's Busch teams
and induced five others to get involved. Joining McGwire are
teammate Gary Gaetti, Danny Shaffer, Andy Benes, Hal Morris and
Pete Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   The missing ingredient is a primary sponsor. Gaetti believes
McGwire's presence will take care of that. ``It's all about opening
doors,'' Gaetti said.
</P>
<P>
   New team
</P>
<P>
   Ken Schrader and Andy Petree Racing make their debut here
tonight, followed by seven events at Indianapolis Raceway Park,
Michigan Speedway, Bristol Speedway, Dover Downs, Charlotte Motor
Speedway, Gateway International and North Carolina Speedway.
Oakwood Homes is the primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The Earnhardt look
</P>
<P>
   Legendary NASCAR car owner Cotton Owens paid tribute to Dale
Earnhardt Jr. during a recent question-and-answer session. ``He's
got everything it takes. I like the look in his eyes. It's the same
look his dad has. He's going to be something special.'' . . .
Earnhardt is taking the same car, same motor and same setup that
took Park to victory in his final Busch season last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Craftsman trucks
</P>
<P>
   Kirk in jeopardy
</P>
<P>
   It's been a tough year for Dalton's Tammy Jo Kirk. The reason is
lack of sponsorship. As a result, she's made only three races, and
she's unsure about the future if things don't go well this weekend
at Texas and maybe Bristol June 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes money to run these things, and we just don't have the
money to do it,'' Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk ran 17 races a year ago for Geoff Bodine, but he folded the
team to support his son, Barry. ``The biggest thing that is killing
us right now is we don't have the guys here full-time to get the
trucks ready to go and these trucks right,'' she said. ``To run the
rest of the season, we need $30,000 a race, and it would still be a
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy
</P>
<P>
   Jack Sprague took an 18-point lead over Ron Hornaday into
Friday's Pronto Auto Parts 400 at Texas Motor Speedway. Sprague had
a string of 19-consecutive top-10 finishes over two seasons. That's
one short of Hornaday's all-time record.

 &HT;    Ford on the defense
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ One-third of the way into its first year of
Winston Cup racing, Ford's Taurus is winning, while becoming a
popular source of debate in the NASCAR garage area.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the top five drivers and six of the top 10 are driving
the Taurus. Ford drivers also were leading in the standings and
manufacturers' title chase until Jeff Gordon spoiled their party by
driving his Monte Carlo to victory in the Coca-Cola 600.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been tough to find anyone to predict this type of
success one year ago, when Ford began discussing the change from
Thunderbird to Taurus. But the Taurus has five victories _ three by
Mark Martin, two by Dale Jarrett _ in the first 12 races of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even surprised ourselves,'' said Travis Carter, who owns
the Fords driven by Jimmy Spencer. Spencer, 10th in the points
standings, never has finished better than 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet teams contend that the Taurus teams have taken full
advantage of concessions NASCAR gave to the teams when they
switched from Thunderbirds. The Chevy and Pontiac teams also
complained that the racing Taurus bears little resemblance to the
street version.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Evernham, Gordon's crew chief, has been one of the leading
critics of the new Taurus. He argues that the car has been given so
many rules concessions that it could prevent a Chevrolet driver
from winning the Winston Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I said that, and I'm not taking it back,'' Evernham said.
``It's still my opinion and my opinion only, but I believe Ford
still has an aerodynamic advantage with the race car over a
Chevrolet. But that's nobody's fault. They built a good car.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hmiel, manager and crew chief for Johnny Benson's Taurus
team, said it would have been unreasonable to expect a race car to
look identical to the street version.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's normally give and take'' Hmiel said. ``The
manufacturer shows up with something real wild, and NASCAR says,
'Well, we need to look at something a little bit less insane than
that.' We were prepared for that. We knew that we would eventually
get what we thought was a good race car out of it, because NASCAR
wants everything to be so competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said the complaining GM teams fail to consider one
important factor: There are more good Ford teams than GM teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong _ every team out there is good,'' Carter
said. ``But as far as on-the-edge-type race teams, I think Ford has
more of those teams right now, and, consequently, they're going to
win more races.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon doesn't appear to be getting much help in holding up the
Chevrolet banner. He won 10 races each in 1996 and 1997, and this
year has three of the five victories by Monte Carlos. Dale
Earnhardt and Bobby Hamilton have the other two, but they're now
13th and 15th in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has got a gift for driving a race car that nobody else
in this garage possesses,'' rival Chevrolet team owner Felix
Sabates said about Gordon. ``I know some of these drivers will get
mad at me for saying that, but it's the fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kid can drive a race car,'' Sabates said, ``and they've
got a great race team. The rest of the Chevrolets aren't going
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Too many Tauruses in the way.

 &HT;    Motorola Investors, analyst skeptical about Motorola
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Tx. Analysts and the investors were skeptical Friday
about Motorola Inc.'s restructuring plan, which includes slashing
its work force by 10 percent _ 15,000 workers _ in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   After rising in early trading Friday, shares of the company fell
56 1/4 cents to $50.93 3/4 to close near the company's 52-week low
of $50.62 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts warn that a restructuring begun last year in the
company's Semiconductor Products Sector, based in Austin, has yet
to show benefits. They wonder if the one announced late Thursday
will be more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., said it was downsizing in
an effort to save $750 million over the next year. It also will
consolidate its semiconductor manufacturing and cut low-performing
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola blamed the cutbacks on weak pricing and lower demand in
Asia. The company got 26 percent of its 1997 revenue of $29.8
billion from Asia, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with CNBC news on Friday morning, chief
executive officer Chris Galvin said the company had expected a 17
percent growth rate for the chip industry instead of the 2 percent
drop now forecast for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said Motorola will trim ``pockets of the company'' around
the world. ``We very much regret the impact that this will have on
selected employees at Motorola,'' he said on CNBC. ``We'll handle
the people situation with the traditional Motorola sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Austin operations, where it has about 10,000
workers, are expected to be hard hit. Motorola's Semiconductor
Products Sector is based in Austin and the company has five chip
plants here. Two of them are more than 20 years old and another is
16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday how many workers in the area would be
fired and what parts of the semiconductor sector would be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the company said temporary workers might be let
go first and that senior employees would be offered severance
packages. Announcements on cuts are expected to come as early as
Monday as managers at the company met Friday to discuss the
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the company's actions will help its prospects, but
some said Motorola's retooling, including the semiconductor
restructuring begun last year, have been sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Modoff, an analyst at Alex Brown, said investors are
taking a ``wait-and-see'' approach to the stock. His company
recommends holding. ``People have heard this before. Obviously,
people aren't buying into this as they have in the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the Merrill Lynch brokerage firm said signs are
positive for the corporate restructuring, ``however, a
semiconductor sector renewal plan was implemented about a year ago,
and we have yet to see tangible benefits from that plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The semiconductor plan was aimed at making the company more
responsive to customers and bringing products to market faster.
</P>
<P>
   In semiconductors, Motorola is the fourth biggest supplier in
the world. It leads in one category, microcontrollers. Those are
chips that are embedded in autos, for example, to control braking
and accleration. In its Thursday announcement, Motorola said it
would continue to concentrate on microcontrollers.
</P>
<P>
   In other chip categories, however, it ranks third or fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Motorola and Lucent Technologies said they
would team up on a new generation of digital signal processors,
chips that translate sound and vision into a digital format. It is
expected to be a high growth market.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been working on a broad corporate plan that
would give it a more customer-focused approach. It has yet to
reveal details of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola also faces intense competition in its cellular and
wireless phone businesses. Ericsson and Nokia have eaten away much
of Motorola's market share in cellular. Motorola has been slow to
bring wireless products to market.
</P>
<P>
   Will Strauss, president of Forward Concepts Market Research,
said the company's management faces a tough Asian market as well as
its own sprawling size in turning its fortunes around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like trying to turn an aircraft carrier,'' Strauss said.
``It's a very slow thing and the Asian economic situation really
rubs salt into the wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Strauss and other analysts predicted Motorola would close some
of its older chip production factories and spin off some of its
slow-performing businesses while concentrating on its satellite,
digital signal processor and digital wireless products.
</P>
<P>
   Investment firms including Merrill Lynch revised their estimates
for the current quarter after warnings from the company that it
would not meet the expected 20 cents a share earnings for the
second quarter. In a report issued Friday, Merrill Lynch said the
company's problems ``were worse than we thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola engineers and chip designers looking for jobs may find
their best prospects at smaller firms, said Kim Butler, president
of Greywolf Consulting in Austin. ``In Austin, a lot of the
opportunities are with smaller design centers and start-up
companies rather than the larger firms,'' he said. ``There are also
a lot of opportunities on either coast, especially in California
and Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   At larger companies, Samsung, with has about 1,000 Austin
employees, isn't hiring, said Bill Cryer, a spokesman. ``Right now
we're at a plateau,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AMD Inc., on the other hand, is hiring product test and
development engineers, semiconductor design engineers and process
engineers, said spokesman Robert Durand.

COUNCIL AT WAR WITH MAYOR OVER NEW YORK CITY'S BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Combining a righteous resolve with the nervous
bravado that comes from venturing into the unexplored, the City
Council adopted its own $34 billion budget Friday, triggering what
is likely to be a protracted confrontation between the usually
compliant Council and the city's combative mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The war of words and dollars was well under way before the day's
end. Even as Council members were casting their votes on the second
floor of City Hall, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was holding forth on the
first floor, letting loose a string of adjectives _ ``damaging,''
``illusory,'' ``make-believe,'' _ to describe the Council's version
of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most irresponsible budget I have seen as the mayor
of New York City,'' he said of the first budget ever passed
independently by the City Council. He said that he would do
everything he could, including freezing city financing, to stop the
Council plan from bloating the city's deficit several years from
now.
</P>
<P>
   But Council Speaker Peter Vallone, who is juggling his
governmental duties with his campaign to become governor, dismissed
Giuliani's criticisms as the rantings of a mayor offended by the
bicameral relationship between the executive and the legislative
branches. And he issued an assessment that directly contradicted
the mayor's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most fiscally responsible approved budget that we
have ever seen,'' said Vallone, his words echoing throughout the
City Hall rotunda. It includes what the speaker calls the largest
tax cut in city history, but also provides more money for
libraries, museums and various programs affecting housing and child
care than the mayor's proposed budget does.
</P>
<P>
   Where the truth, or the future, lies in a budget process that
should have been a lot simpler _ the city has a $2 billion surplus,
not a deficit _ remained unclear Friday night. The Council would
actually spend $49 million less in the coming fiscal year than the
mayor proposed, but because the Council would eliminate the
income-tax surcharge, the city would lose substantial revenue in
future years, Giuliani argued. He would extend the surcharge but,
modestly _ compared with the Vallone plan _ cut the personal income
tax over three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mayor and the speaker both indicated Friday that they would
use the powers granted to them by the City Charter to derail each
other's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was expected to make the first move by issuing a new
estimate of city revenues, designed to disrupt the calculations the
Council used to develop its budget. He can also subsequently veto
the budget in whole or in part. But the Democratic-controlled
Council, which approved its budget by a vote of 43-7, can easily
override his veto. Then the mayor could impound the budget, meaning
he could refuse to spend money as the Council dictated.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have the option of taking the matter to court, but
there are time constraints: by law, the budget must be adopted by
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   As the Republican mayor and the Democratic speaker volleyed in
press conferences throughout the day, the unlikely shadow of George
Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the New York Yankees, loomed
over the remnants of their fractured relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone and his aides have maintained that budget negotiations
broke down with the Giuliani administration because of its
insistence that no deal would be made unless the speaker dropped
his plans to test one of the Mayor's pet plans through a referendum
question on November's ballot: whether city taxes should finance a
new ballpark for the Yankees on Manhattan's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has argued that the referendum would hurt his efforts
to prevent Steinbrenner from moving his team out of the Bronx, and
out of the city entirely. Steinbrenner, while indicating his great
interest in moving the Yankees to Manhattan, announced several
weeks ago that he would stay out of the debate until after the
fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday night, Steinbrenner changed his mind, and suddenly
a resident of Tampa, Fla., had injected himself into the budgetary
process of New York City. He accused Vallone of using the stadium
issue as a ``political baseball'' in his quest to defeat Gov.
George Pataki in November.
</P>
<P>
   Decrying what he called the speaker's ``barrage of hostile
threats,'' Steinbrenner issued a threat similar to ones he has
issued so many times over the last decade: ``I do not want to move
the Yankees from New York, but I must warn: he is bringing us
dangerously close.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the mayor and Howard Rubenstein, Steinbrenner's spokesman,
denied Friday that they had prevailed upon the team owner to issue
the statement. And a person close to Steinbrenner said that his
advisers urged him to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he made a mistake, but he thought he had to defend
Rudy, who's hanging out there,'' said the person, who requested
anonymity. ``I was against it. I thought everyone should shut up
until after the election.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vallone responded by announcing that he was more determined than
ever to push for the referendum _ which might also prompt a higher
voter turnout that could help his political aspirations. He
reiterated that the Council passed its own budget ``because we
would not be held hostage on the single issue of Yankee Stadium _
an issue that has nothing to do with this year's budget priorities
but everything to do with the mayor's personal agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner's comments briefly overshadowed the Council's
unprecedented action, and forced Giuliani to contend with
persistent questions about whether a referendum-related ultimatum
from his administration had caused budget talks to collapse. He
declined to answer those questions directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of versions of what this person said to that
person, people yelling at each other, jumping up and down and
negotiating,'' the mayor said. ``The reality is that irrespective
of any issue with the stadium, this budget is way out of the realm
of reason.''
</P>
<P>
   That concept _ of a budget beyond reason _ became the
administration's official reason for why budget talks had broken
down. And the mayor attributed its irresponsible nature to
Vallone's gubernatorial aspirations. ``This is the kind of thing
that happens,'' he said, ``when people do election-year budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani then delivered a withering critique of the Council's
budget. He said that Council leaders had used extraordinarily
optimistic projections regarding Wall Street's health to calculate
tax revenues for the next several years.

EX-LORAL ROCKET SCIENTIST SAID TO HAVE HELPED CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn., Singapore)   (Eds., this story, eliminated earlier from NYTNS budgets, is now
restored.)  
(lb) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO and JEFF GERTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The scientist at the center of an investigation of
whether two U.S. companies improperly helped China improve its
rockets told the Chinese in 1996 that he would do everything he
could to make their rockets the most reliable in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wah Lim, a Chinese-born American citizen, was a
senior vice president and engineer at a unit of Loral Space and
Communications when he wrote a cordial letter to China Aerospace
Corp. in April 1996, two weeks before a technical review he oversaw
was provided to the Chinese company without U.S. government
permission and contrary to Loral policies.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are investigating whether the review, an
analysis of a Chinese rocket-launch failure that destroyed a Loral
satellite, violated export-control laws and damaged national
security by giving the Chinese information that would enable them
to improve their missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation caused Justice Department prosecutors in
February to oppose President Clinton's approval for China to launch
another Loral satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Loral officials insist that the unauthorized and perhaps illegal
disclosure to the Chinese was just a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But both the warmly worded letter by Lim, in which he promised a
fruitful joint effort to figure out why the Chinese rocket had
exploded two months earlier, and other internal Loral documents
portray a corporate mind-set in which the priority was to fix a
serious problem of concern both to the American company and to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese rocket carrying the Loral satellite crashed into a
hill 22 seconds after liftoff in February 1996. The Chinese thought
they had figured out the cause, but their insurance companies
wanted a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Lim. The Loral physicist, an intensely private man of 53
who grew up in Singapore and came to the United States on a
Fulbright scholarship, was so highly respected by the Chinese that
Liu Jiyuan, the chairman of China Aerospace, asked Loral executives
to put him in charge of the review.
</P>
<P>
   Although his mandate was narrowly defined, his letter to Liu
during the early stages of the review and other internal Loral
documents suggest that he may have had broader objectives: to offer
concrete recommendations to improve the reliability of China's
troubled Long March rocket program.
</P>
<P>
   Since many of Loral's satellites are launched in China, such a
goal was in the company's best financial interest as well. But
China Aerospace launches rockets with both commercial and military
applications, and improvements in the ability to launch rockets
accurately and reliably could aid not only its business of sending
communication satellites into space but also its testing and
delivering of nuclear weapons from ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   So the Loral documents underscore the risks of the Clinton
administration's policy of promoting the transfer of sophisticated
U.S. technology to countries like China at the same time as trying
to prevent that technology from being used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the Chinese, Lim said he felt ``truly honored
for having been asked'' to head the review team and noted that an
important goal of the review was ``using this failure as an
opportunity to ensure that the Long March launch vehicles have the
best reliable record in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lim added, ``We, at Space Systems/Loral would like China Great
Wall to be a strong supplier of launch services and we will do
everything in our power to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, to an important business partner, offered other
expressions of encouragement as well, including Lim's confidence
``that your company will take their share of the world market for
satellite launch services.''
</P>
<P>
   A week and a half earlier, in a strategy report, Lim had
outlined four objectives for the review team, including
recommending to China Aerospace and its launching subsidiary, China
Great Wall, ``any other areas of improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Before writing that outline, Lim had received a security
briefing by Loral officials instructing him on what kinds of
information the Chinese could receive, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ground rules imposed by the U.S. government on Loral,
the company was allowed to help the Chinese mount its satellite on
the Chinese rocket. But the company, according to its written
briefing, was forbidden to disclose ``launch vehicle/satellite
detail design'' or ``information that will enhance the launch site
facilities or launch vehicle/mission capabilities'' of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his role in the technical review, Lim, who now heads
the technology and development arm of Hughes Space and
Communications Co. in Southern California, is the central figure in
the Justice Department's criminal investigation into whether Loral
and Hughes, whose scientists also worked on the review, illegally
transmitted information to the Chinese that may have helped its
missile program.
</P>
<P>
   According to a confidential 21-page letter by Loral's lawyers to
the State Department in June 1996, Loral acknowledged that the
company should have asked the State Department to approve the
activities of its review team, calling it ``a serious mistake'' not
to have done so.
</P>
<P>
   The letter stated that ``it is not clear there was any
violation'' of law because of the transfer of technical data to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   It also acknowledged that the issue of whether illegal
assistance was given to the Chinese in the ``testing, manufacture
or repair'' of the rocket ``is more problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   What was also problematic was the way in which the report by
Lim's review team made its way to the Chinese, according to the
confidential letter.
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, 1996, Lim approved a press release by the Chinese
anticipating the release of his team's report four days later.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Nick Yen, an aide to Lim, faxed a draft
version of the report to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, Lim apparently got cold feet. He decided to
seek the approval of Loral's general counsel, Julie Bannerman,
before sending the Chinese the final version of his report.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Bannerman read the report, she ``became concerned that
export control laws had not been properly considered,'' and asked
Loral's expert outside counsel for advice, the Loral letter said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she tried to block the transmission of Lim's report
from Loral's Beijing office to the Chinese on the morning of May
10, she was too late. It had been faxed to the Chinese one hour
before _ by Yen, but with a cover letter written by Lim.
</P>
<P>
   Lim declined to be interviewed. But his lawyer, George Newhouse,
declared that his client is innocent of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a nice man, a quiet, low-key individual, a scientist,
not a lawyer or an expert in export-control laws,'' Newhouse said.
``And now he finds himself in the eye of the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Gerald Solomon suggests there may be more to it. The
New York Republican and chairman of the House Rules Committee wrote
Defense Secretary William Cohen asking 22 questions about whether
the scientist was properly given security clearances or was a
security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Lim's lawyer took exception to the insinuation that his client
compromised U.S. national security _ either intentionally or
unintentionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a spy,'' said Newhouse. ``He is a 100 percent
red-blooded American. To suggest he would betray his country or do
anything in any way to damage American national security interests
is not only wrong but offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse declined to discuss any of the specifics of the current
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lim was born in China to a landed, Catholic anti-communist
family. At the age of 4, he fled with his family to Singapore after
the communists took power.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, his father became an investment banker and the
family enjoyed a comfortable life. Lim majored in physics at the
University of Singapore in 1967, and came to the United States on a
Fulbright scholarship, getting a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from
the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Like other scientists, Lim advanced by moving throughout the
aerospace and defense industries. From 1973 to 1982 he managed the
group at Honeywell, Inc., that successfully introduced the
ring-laser gyroscope for commercial airlines.
</P>
<P>
   For the next seven years, he was responsible for the development
of advanced guidance and navigation systems for strategic missiles
at Northrop Grumman Corp. Until early 1997, he was senior vice
president of technology and operations at Loral, when he left to
work for Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Lim rests, at least in part, on interpretations of
technical information understood best by rocket scientists like
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Loral says that it was simply trying to help the insurance
companies assess whether China's own inquiry into the accident had
reached the correct conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials have said that Lim's review team went
beyond confirming to the Chinese what the problem was and gave them
insights into the cause of the explosion and the way to prevent
future accidents.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   New Software Finds Crack in Microsoft Armor  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Hoping to loosen Microsoft's ironclad grip on the personal computer
desktop, a tiny Seattle company will unveil an onscreen menu bar
Monday that bypasses Windows with direct links to programs and the
Internet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Pixel Co.'s product, called MySpace, does not replace
Windows. Instead, it sits directly below the Windows taskbar, in
the border around Windows that usually is black. MySpace launches
itself when the PC is started up, before Windows is loaded, and it
remains on the screen at all times.
</P>
<P>
   The innovation also will give PC-makers the ability to display
their brand names continuously onscreen, something that Microsoft
has prevented through its strict licensing agreements that govern
the use of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, say industry experts, it could even serve as a
gateway to an operating system other than Windows, such as one
based on Sun Microsystem's Java software.
</P>
<P>
   PC-makers can program buttons on the MySpace bar to launch
applications or take users directly online. For instance, a
PC-maker could program buttons linked to its own troubleshooting
features inside the computer or to the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   MySpace also can be used to run hardware components such as the
PC's CD player or telephone answering machine. It takes several
steps to run those components through Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Because MySpace uses an area of the screen not used by Windows,
Pixel officials say Microsoft cannot legally oppose it. Nor can the
software giant rig Windows to prevent MySpace from starting or
disable it because the program works directly with the PC's video
software.
</P>
<P>
   Pixel will sell the product to PC-makers, but it also plans to
make a free version available this fall over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``That's important because all my investors had to be
convinced that this couldn't be turned off by some funny code in
Windows,'' said Tom O'Rourke, chief executive of Pixel.
</P>
<P>
   The first big PC-maker to embrace MySpace will be Packard Bell _
which owned Pixel (then called Ark Interface II) for four years
before spinning it off last month to a group of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell will incorporate the control bar into all of its
systems in a phased rollout starting this month. Pixel officials
hope to line up other PC-makers during the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think other companies will use it because it's a way
to have an interactive relationship with your customers,'' said Mal
Ransom, who heads up marketing for Sacramento-based Packard Bell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Industry experts say Microsoft is not likely to oppose Pixel's
new technology in light of the antitrust suit that looms over the
software giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Microsoft didn't like anything that changed the
desktop, but they can point to this as a way they provide
opportunities to innovate,'' said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga
Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   In another example of a PC-maker attempting to customize the
desktop, Gateway announced last week that it would offer some
customers direct links to Gateway's Internet service and the
opportunity to choose Netscape's browser over Microsoft when they
start their computer for the first time. If MySpace succeeds, it
will be sweet revenge for O'Rourke, who founded Ark Interface nine
years ago and has been bloodied by Microsoft. In the mid-'90s, he
devised a graphical interface for Packard Bell that lay on top of
Windows, letting users go directly to multimedia programs and
service features that came with their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, including market leader Compaq, had similar
Windows ``shells,'' which helped them differentiate their systems
and create brand identity. But Microsoft saw the trend as a threat
and rewrote its contracts to bar the interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke got the idea for MySpace from ESPN, which routinely
shrinks the size of a game to make room for announcements at the
bottom of the TV screen. O'Rourke asked his chief technology
officer, David Nason, to see if there was a way that the empty
space below Windows could be used in a similar way.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Not only was it technically feasible, but it also looked
legally possible. ``Bill (Gates) had spent all of his time
defending his territory with 10-foot high, 10-foot thick walls, but
the area outside Windows was open,'' O'Rourke said.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Wells May End Free Checking  
   
 By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
About 150,000 Wells Fargo customers received letters earlier this
week informing them that they may have to start paying fees next
month on what many had believed were lifetime free checking
accounts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The move has angered many customers, especially senior citizens
who thought they were promised such accounts when they banked with
First Interstate Bancorp and were assured that their agreements
would stay in effect after Wells Fargo took over First Interstate
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992 when I reached 55, First Interstate told me I could
get lifetime free checking,'' said Bruce Freeman, a retired
political science and economics teacher who lives in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   When Wells acquired its Los Angeles rival in 1996, Freeman said
he went to his new Wells branch and was told, ``Quote unquote _
`Don't worry. We'll honor First Interstate's obligations.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was surprised when he recently received a ``Dear Valued
Customer'' letter from Wells Fargo with this note: ``We've recently
reviewed our fee-waiver policies and decided to discontinue the
arrangement that provided you with a fee waiver.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of next month, he and about 3 percent of the
bank's 5 million retail customers were told that their accounts
would be subject to $7 to $9 in monthly fees unless they met
certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
   These included a daily minimum balance of at least $1,000 in a
checking account or $3,000 in linked checking and savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Those on Social Security (about a tenth of those who received
the form letter) also can escape monthly fees if they simply have
their recurring government payments deposited directly in their
checking accounts. In many cases, such payments are far less than
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this waiver information was not included in the
bank's recent letter to Freeman and an estimated 15,000 to 20,000
other seniors. Wells called it an oversight and said it is
informing those customers about the waiver when they phone in to
inquire about the upcoming changes to their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Most banks are raising fees and adding new ones to make sure
that all customers pay for the services they use. In Wells Fargo's
case, the wide array of services includes access to more than 4,400
automated teller machines, 1,800 branches, 24-hour telephone
service and online banking.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers and consumer groups were quick to criticize Wells
Fargo for allegedly reneging on previous promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like the banking-industry version of bait and
switch,'' said Jon Golnger, a director of California Public
Interest Research Group. ``We would warn those who think they have
special deals to look at the fine print; the terms and conditions
may change at any moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see promotions about free checking for life, be aware
that your life might be longer than your bank's,'' added Gail
Hillebrand, senior attorney for Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kim Kellogg insists that neither First
Interstate nor Wells Fargo ``ever made written promises that
accounts would be free for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wells Executive Vice President Jim Ketcham said,
``If customers have proof or can explain a situation where Wells or
its predecessor made a promise, then we will honor it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg said she told Freeman yesterday that even if he does not
have his $550 monthly Social Security check deposited directly, he
can continue to receive free checking.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeman said this was not what he was told when he received
the notice and called the bank last Tuesday. ``I was put on hold
for 35 minutes before talking to an agent and another half hour to
talk to a supervisor,'' he said. ``Both told me their hands were
tied.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Disney Inks Deal to Provide Web Content to Excite's Site  
   
 By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Excite Inc. said yesterday that it will carry a variety of content
from Walt Disney Co. Web sites, confirming that the Magic Kingdom's
online plans are anything but Mickey Mouse.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the end of June, Excite's site _ known mostly for its search
engine and free e-mail _ also will have news, sports and
entertainment from Disney.com, ESPN SportsZone and ABCNews.com,
which all are owned by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   The nonexclusive agreement with Redwood City-based Excite is
expected to be the first of many that Disney will ink with Internet
service companies in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is making good on Chairman Michael Eisner's comment in
late &UR;  &LR; April that ``we will be aggressive competitors on the
Internet, as you enter the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Disney plunked down $250 million to buy
Starwave, the Bellevue, Wash.-based Web development company that
created SportsZone and ABCNews.com. Its technical innovations range
from developing electronic-commerce sites to creating intricate
Java programs &UR;  &LR; that let ESPN users replay game footage.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner's comments and Disney's acquisition initially were
interpreted as proof that it would follow Microsoft, AOL, Netscape
and others in creating a major ``portal'' site on the Internet,
where consumers log on to shop, manage their money, play games,
exchange e-mail and peruse news.
</P>
<P>
   A Disney spokeswoman declined to comment on the company's Web
portal plans, but analysts assert that it does not need to build an
all-in-one ``supersite'' to distribute its content widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their content is so strong ... they can depend on other sites
(to carry it). They don't need to become a full-service provider,''
said analyst David Simons, of Digital Video Investments in New
York. ``Besides, Disney can effectively promote its online services
on its TV shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Excite and Disney did not disclose terms of their deal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, published reports speculated that Disney
was on the verge of buying a 40 percent stake in Excite for about
$400 million, but officials from both companies denied that such a
deal was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Zapata _ a Texas
oil-company-turned-fish-processor founded 45 years ago by former
President George Bush _ unsuccessfully offered $1.7 billion in
stock to buy Excite.
</P>
<P>
   Excite shares rose $2.28, to $58.25, in trading yesterday.

 Antitrust Suit Againt Intel Imminent   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Federal Trade Commission is expected to launch an antitrust
action on Monday against Santa Clara-based Intel Corp., the world's
largest maker of computer chips.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like their colleagues at the Department of Justice, who last
month filed an antitrust suit against software behemoth Microsoft
Corp., the trade commissioners have set their sights on a mammoth
high-tech target. Intel, a $25 billion company, commands more than
90 percent of the market for microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Intel used that dominance to stifle
competition by cutting off rivals' access to crucial information
about its microchips _ the brains that run a computer system.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Intel argues that it is not a monopoly, and it has no
obligation to share its intellectual property with its legal foes.
Intel officials met last week with FTC commissioners and staff in
an eleventh-hour attempt to forestall the suit. ``We made our best
argument, and we'll just have to see,'' Intel chief counsel Tom
Dunlap said Friday. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The commissioners are expected to vote about Intel in a closed
meeting at noon Monday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since the FTC launched a probe against Intel in September, the
chipmaker has provided the commission with more than 4 million
documents chronicling its business dealings. FTC investigators have
questioned executives at Intel, and at the chip firms that compete
with it and the computer makers that buy its chips.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts and antitrust lawyers don't expect the FTC
case to hurt either Intel's way of doing business or its bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   A narrow suit on patent rights ``is nonthreatening to Intel,''
said Joe Moore, a securities analyst with Goldman Sachs and Co. in
New York. &UR;  &LR; ``It's not pricing, or contracts, or keeping competitors
out of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC and the Department of Justice share the enforcement of
the nation's antitrust laws, and decide between themselves which
cases each will pursue.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Justice Department, along with 20 states'
attorneys general, is giving Microsoft a broad challenge to whether
it can fold new features, such as a Web browser, into its core
operating system, the FTC is more likely in the short term to look
only at the relatively obscure issue of whether Intel manipulates
markets by deciding who can use its chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect Intel will say, `Oh gosh, if you redefine the laws,
we'll go ahead and share the information.' It's not critical to
Intel's long-term success like the browser is to Microsoft,'' said
Nathan Brookwood, semiconductor analyst for Dataquest, a San Jose
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is already fighting the issue in a federal court in
Alabama, where workstation maker Intergraph has sued it. Intel had
supplied Intergraph with advance information about its chips, which
Intergraph used to make its new corporate computers. But after
Intergraph sued Intel in a patent dispute, Intel withheld
information about its upcoming chips _ an action that Intergraph
says threatened its core business.
</P>
<P>
   Intergraph chief executive James Meadlock said Intel engaged in
unethical behavior and ``strong-arm tactics to force us into
submission.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel counters that it had the right to withhold information
from Intergraph, which had altered the once-friendly relationship
by filing the patent lawsuit. ``It's our fundamental belief that it
is not a prudent act to continue to ship your intellectual property
_ your secrets _ to a company that has made you a defendant in
intellectual property litigation,'' said Intel spokesman Chuck
Mulloy.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, U.S. District Court Judge Edwin L. Nelson ruled in
April that Intel probably did abuse its power, and he ordered the
company to give Intergraph the information. Intel is complying with
the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the preliminary injunction was issued by the court in
Alabama ... the likelihood of FTC action shot up to 100 percent,''
said Rich Gray, an antitrust and intellectual property lawyer at
the San Jose firm of Bergeson, Eliopoulos, Grady and Gray.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Intergraph case, the FTC is likely to examine
similar disputes Intel has had with Digital Equipment Corp., Compaq
Computer and the Acer Group.
</P>
<P>
   A legal battle between Intel and Houston-based computer maker
Compaq was settled several years ago, and Intel settled its suit
with Digital earlier this year. Intel's dispute with Acer, a
Taiwanese computer company, never reached the courts.
</P>
<P>
   While the FTC's initial suit is expected to be narrow, the
agency is continuing to investigate Intel's business practices.
Industry watchers identified several other areas in which the FTC
may move against Intel farther down the road:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Intel Inside: &LR;  In the most successful marketing campaign ever
undertaken by a chip maker, Intel pays a share of the advertising
budget for computer makers using its chips. Competitors say Intel
may have withheld those advertising dollars _ a key to a computer's
profitability _ if the PC maker chose a rival chip.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Design clampdown: &LR;  Competitors say Intel abruptly switched the
design of its Pentium chip so other chipmakers couldn't clone it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Cornering a market: &LR;  Opponents claim Intel used its clout in
the microprocessor market to crowd out smaller firms that make
chipsets, which work with the main chip to process information.
Intel vaulted from holding 25 percent of that market in 1995 to 90
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Moving into new markets: &LR;  Although the FTC approved Intel's
acquisition of the graphics chipmaker Chips and Technologies in
January, the agency also said it would continue to monitor Intel's
push into the graphics market.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest threat to Intel may be the ruthless nature of the
marketplace rather than the FTC. Over the past year, Intel was
caught flat-footed while rivals developed cheaper chips, leading to
the rise of sub-$1,000 PCs, and analysts say other firms are doing
a better job of making chips for consumer electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, slowing PC sales and the Asia currency crisis have
dragged Intel's once-soaring profitability back to earth. The
company has reported flat earnings for the past year, and expects
the trend to continue in its next quarterly report, slated for the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's stock has fallen along with its earnings. It closed
Friday up $1.63 at $69.81, still a far cry from its 52-week high of
$100.50.

   Odds are, Real Quiet will make history
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ELMONT, N.Y. _ One reason there is often a quiet time in horse
racing is because of the division of speaking parts. The trainers
do 90 percent of the talking, the jockeys take 10 and the horses
none.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet is a heavy favorite today to claim his page in racing
lore, along with 600 grand for winning the Belmont Stakes and the
Visa bonus of $5 million for sweeping the Triple Crown. The
pressure is where the money is, the confusion factor is ripe in a
field of 13, and the excitement is rising.
</P>
<P>
   All that appears to be missing is good old-fashioned melodrama.
There is no high-voltage rivalry on the menu, even though Victory
Gallop finished second to Real Quiet in the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness. Up to now, this latest Bob Baffert colt has not captured
our hearts or wallets, has not Silver Charmed us.
</P>
<P>
   If one could indeed get a tip straight from the horse's mouth,
it probably would be this: If you wish to double your money, fold
it and put it back in your pocket. Real Quiet is 6-5 on the betting
line, and who wants to risk a five to win a buck? This is not the
American way as most of us like to practice it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this 130th running of the Belmont doesn't lack the
trimmings of a grand race. At the Garden City Hotel, the marketing
director had put 50 cases of champagne on ice and boasted, ``I'll
sell more cigars this weekend than I (usually) sell in three
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the guests at the Floral Park Motor Lodge on the
Jericho Turnpike were checking in with a clerk who sat behind
bulletproof glass.
</P>
<P>
   What you see here is a microcosm of Real Quiet's journey, the
leap from commoner to high roller, or even royalty. If money was
all that mattered, the heavy wagering would be on Victory Gallop,
the Houston-owned horse, at 7-2; or Grand Slam, one of the two D.
Wayne Lukas entries, at 6-1; or Raffie's Majest, a 20-1 long shot
trained by James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   You assume Mr. Bond prefers to shake the field, not merely stir
it.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice play at 10-1 is Limit Out, the son of Northern
Flagship, trained by Allen Jerkens, who has a history of producing
upsets and colts that can travel a distance.
</P>
<P>
   This Belmont includes a father-and-son act, among the trainers,
not the horses. James Jerkens, Allen's son, has an even longer shot
in Thomas Jo, at 30-1. The colt was ordinary as a 2-year-old but
has won six of his past seven starts and has Chris McCarron, a Hall
of Fame jockey, on his back.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the above information is offered with the usual
disclaimer: It is possible to bet on these and other quadrupeds and
actually lose.
</P>
<P>
   The backers of Real Quiet are confident that a good many
disbelievers will be converted today. Kent Desormeaux has seen the
Kentucky-bred colt deliver two flawless races. He was even
impressed with Real Quiet's poise during a short but bumpy flight
from Louisville to John F. Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He balanced himself with his head against the roof,''
Desormeaux said, ``and his feet on the floor. He has nerves of
steel.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lungs and legs will have a higher value today. This
is why Gary Stevens, riding Victory Gallop for only the second
time, will lay off the pace, saving his mount for a late surge.
This is where a jockey trusts his instincts. Real Quiet wasn't bred
for a mile and a half, but if he gets to the front he has the heart
to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet would emerge as the 12th Triple Crown winner today,
or the seventh colt to fail after winning the first two legs. So
the hay is in the barn, as football coaches are fond of saying, and
the handicappers are reviewing their notes. Where is the early
speed? Who will set the pace?
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a race anyone is likely to steal, partly because it
is in broad daylight in front of 70,000 or so fans, and partly
because it is a long road home. But the turns are soft, and this
should help the favorite and the second choice.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens replaced Alex Solis after Solis was faulted for taking
Victory Gallop too wide, twice, in the Kentucky Derby. Having won
at Belmont on Thunder Gulch in 1995, Stevens finished second on
Silver Charm a year ago, as Touch Gold blew past them at the wire.
No need to ask him about the agony and the ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is bright with a nice gift for a phrase. When he rode
the favored Indian Charlie in this year's Derby, he says he knew
when he paraded to the post his horse wouldn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very, very quiet,'' he said. ``Usually, he's full of
himself. When they sing My Old Kentucky Home, you know there's
going to be an eruption from the crowd at the end. So I grabbed
some mane, but there was no reaction from him.''
</P>
<P>
   At the three-eighths pole, he knew he was running for second
money. He had to settle for third.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tired horse,'' Stevens said, ``feels like a car engine
that's running out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't go to Solis for advice because there is a code among
jockeys _ you don't seek help from someone who lost his ride for
reasons other than an injury. At the Preakness, Stevens knew the
race would be lively. Victory Gallop's ears were up and moving and
he responded to the slightest tug on the reins. Sitting on the colt
for the first time, Stevens felt comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt like my old Porsche,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the only descriptions of Real Quiet, the horse who
would be king, are not flattering. He wasn't a pretty baby, and was
bought at auction for $17,000, racing's version of a five-and-dime
store.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins today, he will look mighty handsome.

TOY COMPANY SERIOUS ABOUT SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Toys are not a game at JAKKS Pacific Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere at JAKKS' Pacific Coast Highway headquarters in
Malibu is hushed, with employees going quietly about their business
amid the World Wrestling Federation action figures, dolls and
die-cast toy trucks the 3-year-old company makes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a no-nonsense, low-key and even modest operation that
mirrors where JAKKS sees itself within the overall toy market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the Mattel and Hasbro with less zeros at the end of our
revenues,'' said President, Chief Operating Officer and co-founder
Stephen Berman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, JAKKS has been adding a few zeros to its bottom line of
late. First-quarter sales ending March 31 jumped nearly 111 percent
to $11 million from $5.2 million in the year-ago period. Net income
rose 127 percent to $461,861, or 8 cents per diluted share, from
$203,417 (5 cents).
</P>
<P>
   For the entire fiscal year 1997, earnings more than doubled to
nearly $2.8 million, or 52 cents a share, from about $1.2 million,
or 34 cents a share. Sales were $41.9 million, more than triple the
$12.1 million generated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Those extra zeros have also gotten the company noticed by
Business Week: JAKKS was No. 55 in the magazine's list of top 100
growth companies.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a company that steers away from toys with blazing,
but short-lived, popularity in favor of products with smaller but
steady sales _ known as ``evergreens.''
</P>
<P>
   And not bad for company co-founder Jack Friedman, who started
JAKKS in 1995 shortly after his ouster from THQ Inc., the
Calabasas-based maker of video game software that he founded in the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a dream come true,'' Friedman said about JAKKS.
``When you have a picture in your head and get there with few
bumps, it's exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Darren Barker, a research analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities
in Los Angeles, said he first took note of the company in February
while researching a comparable toy company in Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued, he began formally covering the publicly traded
company, and on May 6 issued a report with a ``buy''
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The company's reliance on a diverse line of evergreen products
as opposed to toys that are hot one minute and gone the next
provides sales and earnings stability, Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's unique for a company of their size,'' he said.
``If you look at Mattel and Hasbro, they're focused on developing
brands like this, and they're strong sellers year in and year
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other strengths are JAKKS' ability to effectively integrate the
companies it acquires and its conservative operating strategy,
whereby it carries minimal inventory and ships products from its
Hong Kong manufacturing facilities directly to customers, which
include Toys `R' Us.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an industry that is as faddish as toys are, you don't want
to get stuck with inventory,'' Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, who has 34 years of experience in the toy industry,
started JAKKS with Berman _ also a THQ alumnus _ in 1995 with the
acquisition of doll maker Justin Products. The company went public
in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, JAKKS has grown primarily by acquiring other
successful toy businesses. In February 1997, it bought die-cast toy
vehicle maker Road Champs for $11.7 million, and eight months later
acquired toy truck maker Remco and preschool educational toy
company Child Guidance for $13.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest single revenue source is its licensed
World Wrestling Federation action figures, a line that Friedman
said represents 40 percent to 50 percent of JAKKS' sales. He
expects the company to sell 15[OK1%on WWF figures this year.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman admits that his departure from THQ stemmed from his
failure to understand high-tech toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our games started to fare poorly and I was very frustrated,
not being a gamer myself and not being familiar with the
technology,'' he said of his experience at THQ.
</P>
<P>
   His forte is the traditional ``toy-toy,'' and he is in his
element at JAKKS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack is a toy guy,'' Barker said. ``The toy industry is
different from the video (game) industry.''
</P>
<P>
   So toys are not a game at JAKKS, and the company will continue
to focus on products that have steady sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Friedman and Berman would be perfectly happy if a JAKKS
toy becomes a blazing cultural phenomenon, like the Tickle Me Elmo
dolls from a couple of years back, or Mattel's ever-popular Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   When they talk about this possibility, they can't help veering
into game metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for home runs; we're looking for singles and
doubles,'' Berman said. ``And if a home run happens, we're happy.''

<P>
   The advertisement seemed innocuous enough. A few minutes into
the March 17 episode of ``Home Improvement,'' the ABC sitcom, the
TV screen flashed scenes of men and women rubbing their eyes as a
female voice sang the praises of a new brand of prescription eye
drops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like you have tried just about everything,'' the
voice cooed, ``but now there is Patanol.'' Not only did Patanol,
developed by Alcon Laboratories, soothe ``itchy allergy eyes for
eight hours,'' the ad assured viewers, but only a few people
``experience side effects, like a headache.''
</P>
<P>
   For the millions of Americans who suffer from allergies,
Patanol's promise of relief might have been, literally, too good to
be true. The Food and Drug Administration took one look at the
commercial and asked Alcon to take it off the air, saying that some
of its claims of effectiveness were exaggerated and that the side
effects were played down.
</P>
<P>
   But that hardly made Patanol exceptional. Of the 22 products
that have been advertised on TV since last August, the FDA has
found problems with 11 commercials _ including those for Pharmacia
&AMP; Upjohn's Depo-Provera contraceptive and Galderma Laboratories'
Metrogel lotion.
</P>
<P>
   All of that only underscores what federal regulators and the
pharmaceutical industry have wrought in the last year: a bold
experiment in directly marketing prescription drugs on TV to
American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Ads like the one for Patanol are something of a yawner in the
make-believe world created by Madison Avenue, where lizards scheme
to kill Budweiser frogs and half-naked superstars sell Nike shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But they are just the initial forays in what marketing experts
believe will be a steady march toward the kind of aggressive,
image-filled and patently manipulative advertising that so
successfully sells Americans everything from cars to cosmetics to
computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the FDA relaxed its barriers to television ads,
letting pharmaceutical companies identify their products by name
and describe their purposes. Since then, drug makers have rolled
out a record number of campaigns, both in print and on television.
</P>
<P>
   They are expected to shell out some $350 million for television
spots this year _ almost three times what they spent just two years
ago, according to IMS Health, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The best ads have worked their magic, making blockbusters of
drugs like Schering-Plough's Claritin brand of antihistamines,
which has grabbed 54 percent of its market.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry, eager to cash in on life-style drugs aimed at
aging baby boomers _ products like Merck's Propecia for fighting
baldness and Glaxo Wellcome's Zyban for kicking the tobacco habit _
is certain to press the FDA to loosen its guidelines when the
agency completes a review of its policies this summer.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the FDA, for all its storied fastidiousness about
protecting consumers from dangerous medications, has taken a
surprisingly wait-and-see attitude on advertising drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, pharmaceutical companies are reveling in
their new-found freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising directly to consumers is one of the most
successful movements ever in the pharmaceuticals industry,'' said
Neil Sweig, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Southeast Research
Partners, a brokerage firm in Boca Raton, Fla. ``It is the product
of advertising executives all over America who went to sleep each
night trying to figure out how to sell prescription drugs to the
public without upsetting the apple cart at the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy. The ads unleashed the last several months have
prompted an outcry from doctors and consumer advocates, who fear
that the commercials could confuse or mislead the public.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the frequency of dubious claims, the critics contend that
sales pitches for prescription drugs often offer false hope and
encourage people to march into their doctors' offices to demand
prescriptions for drugs they know almost nothing about. Some
physicians view the ads as a personal affront _ proof, they say,
that pharmaceutical executives see them as nothing more than highly
paid prescription writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big problem with some consumer prescription drug ads is that
they are so simplistic,'' said Dr. Gillian Shepherd, an allergist
and clinical associate professor at New York Hospital Cornell
Medical Center. ``The ads make like these drugs work on all people
and in every case. It simply doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical and many advertising executives tell a different
story. Consumer drug ads, they say, not only educate patients about
diseases and available treatments, they also persuade people to see
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some instances, the doctors may not know everything about
the drug,'' said Mark Schwatka, executive vice president of Grey
Advertising Inc., the creator of consumer drug campaigns for Glaxo
Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham. ``Some doctors could learn
something from these ads they can't stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of the FDA's decision last summer to relax its
restrictions, ads for antihistamines became as common as spots for
home-exercise machines.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1997, spending on consumer advertising for
prescription drugs rose by 125 percent from the previous year, to
$107 million, at Bristol-Myers Squibb; by 76 percent, to $122
million, at Merck, and by 57 percent, to $156.6 million, at Glaxo
Wellcome, the industry's biggest consumer advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough paid $55.8 million to promote Claritin
antihistamine, and reaped a 38 percent jump in U.S. sales, to $907
million.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the growth in ad spending for pharmaceuticals as an
industry has not been nearly as robust. Last year, the industry
spent $3.2 billion in the United States promoting all its
medications, up only 6 percent from 1996, according to Competitive
Media Reporting, a unit of VNU NV, a Dutch publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never spent much money on television to advertise
prescription drugs before last year,'' said Richard J. Lane,
president of the United States pharmaceuticals division at
Bristol-Myers Squibb. ``Before the FDA changed its rules, it was
difficult to get the message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a typical commercial, we want the consumer to remember what
we told them,'' he noted. ``But with a drug commercial, the
consumer must be persuaded to take action, see his doctor, make
that appointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the airwaves have been particularly busy with
commercials for prescription drugs, perhaps because the industry
senses that its freedom may not last. The FDA, as part of its
review, could reverse course and enact new restrictions, though it
is unlikely to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA first issued regulations in the late 1960s governing
consumer advertising of prescription drugs, but it wasn't until
1981 that the first ad appeared in the mass media _ for Merck's
Pneumovax, a pneumonia vaccine, in Reader's Digest. Little more
appeared before Arthur Hull Hayes, then the FDA commissioner,
declared a moratorium in 1983 on consumer prescription-drug
advertising to allow the the agency to re-evaluate the regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical companies waited for two years, but nothing
happened. Pressured by Congress, the FDA lifted its moratorium in
1985, with the initial guidelines still in place.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, the CBS television network, eager to capture
new ad revenue, released a set of rules all its own. CBS announced
that it would feel free to broadcast responsible prescription-drug
commercials, but would avoid those that tended to frighten or were
overly emotional. Four years passed before it broadcast its first
commercial for a prescription drug.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies proceeded to experiment gingerly with how far
they could push the envelope on commercials. The FDA was insisting
that television spots trumpeting a particular drug should also
include detailed information about side effects and risk.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid cramming so many words on the screen, drug companies
avoided the issue by mentioning only the brand and not its purpose,
or by running a commercial about the illness in general without
naming the drug.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Upjohn &AMP; Co., now Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, ran
television ads for Rogaine, its hair replacement drug, in the late
1980s without mentioning the name of the product. The spots used
beach scenes with the line, ``I always thought hair loss was as
inevitable as the tides.'' The ad then urged people to see their
doctors if they were concerned about thinning hair.
</P>
<P>
   By May 1997, several television ads had begun to use obvious
imagery to convey their products' purposes. Without mentioning
allergies, Hoechst Marion Roussel's commercial for Allegra, an
antihistamine, showed people surfing through wheat fields. After
seeing that ad and meeting with Hoechst executives to discuss it,
the FDA decided to loosen its guidelines for a trial period.
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth, companies would be allowed to identify their
products and describe their use, as long as they included several
elements: major risk information, an ``800'' number and an address
for consumers to obtain further information; a reference to a print
ad or Web site, and an appeal for consumers to discuss any medical
problems with their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it wanted to see whether companies would refrain
from making exaggerated claims or playing down risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were afraid that the pharmaceutical companies would stress
far too much the drugs' advantages and not enough of the risks,''
said Nancy Ostrove, chief of the marketing practices and
communications division at the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   That was the agency's objection to an ad for Propecia that Merck
recently ran in Time magazine, without a syllable about the drug's
possible side effects. The FDA said the omission was a violation of
its guidelines. It could also be fodder for liabilities lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Merck said the company believed the ad was not
required to contain risk information because its primary purpose
was to prod consumers to seek help. The FDA disagreed, Ms. Ostrove
said, and Merck made immediate changes.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, she said the agency had found much that was useful in
print ads for prescription drugs, but that it would be continuously
evaluating its policy on TV ads. ``If we find that the prescription
ads have negatively affected the patient-physician relationship,
then we will rethink our whole position,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the public, though it has embraced the most heavily
advertised drugs, has shown little interest in the debate. Yet
consumer rights groups have been among the most vocal critics, with
some urging a ban on TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a record number of new drugs introduced
recently on the market,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, executive director
of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, a consumer advocacy
group founded by Ralph Nader. The FDA, he said, had fallen behind
in reviewing ads, so a lot of mistakes can get through. ``The
combination of a misled doctor and a misled patient,'' he said,
``leads to the wrong prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies are not required to submit their consumer ads to
the FDA for prior approval. And when violations of FDA ground rules
are caught, the penalties are almost nonexistent. Companies pay no
fines and rarely have to issue corrective ads
</P>
<P>
   Even so, advertisers operate under much stricter rules for
prescription drugs than those enforced by the Federal Trade
Commission for over-the-counter medication. Unlike the FDA, for
example, the FTC encourages comparative ads.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with consumer ads for prescription drugs have not
sat well with many doctors. Of 5,000 polled by IMS Health on the
Internet in December, 61 percent favored reducing the number of
such ads or discontinuing them altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association has had problems with the ads,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these ads don't encourage patients to get back to
their doctors,'' said Dr. Nancy Dickey, president-elect of the AMA.
``Now we have come to understand that some of these ads can be
educational. And that's fine. But we don't want them to go the way
of floor wax and compare one drug to the next. The ads also have a
way of interfering with the doctor-patient relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, advertisers have refrained from making unfavorable
comparisons to rivals' products, but the prospect of such TV
slugfests clearly worries the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If companies try comparative ads, we would really scrutinize
those very heavily,'' Ms. Ostrove said. ``We would demand to see
the data from a controlled trial. We want the doctors to make
decisions between one drug and another. It's when the
pharmaceutical companies start pushing the envelope that everyone
could get upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Even naysayers acknowledge that prescription-drug ads have the
potential to benefit consumers, if, for example, they persuade them
to go to the doctor's office. And that often happens.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bristol-Myers Squibb's advertising campaign last
year for Pravachol, its drug for cholesterol reduction and stroke
prevention, urged consumers to see their physicians. And indeed,
some 8.8 million people sought treatment last year for
cholesterol-related therapies, up from 7.2 million in 1996,
according to IMS Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer prescription-drug campaigns are both a blessing and a
curse,'' said Shepherd of New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center.
``They are a blessing in that they increase awareness of a
specialty, as with the antihistamines for allergies, for example.
And the campaigns can bring patients into a doctor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   The curse? Patients often ask for drugs they don't need.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors may not like patients to request a prescription drug
they have seen on television, but, on the other hand, they're
willing to discuss the pros and cons with them.
</P>
<P>
   Of 3,000 doctors polled in the first quarter of this year by
Scott-Levin, a pharmaceutical market-research firm in Newtown, Pa.,
89 percent said they would discuss an advertised drug with a
patient even if they thought the ad for it had been misleading.
Such numbers make marketing executives salivate.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, many pharmaceutical executives want to
stretch the FDA's rules a little more. One sore spot is the
agency's requirement that the highly technical language about risks
and side effects that appear on a product's label also appear in
some print ad copy.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that such wording _ including Merck's warning that
its Propecia could interfere with the PSA test for screening
prostate cancer _ often befuddles people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still evolving with how we do these commercials,'' said
Lane of Bristol-Myers Squibb. ``But the language with the warnings
about the drugs needs to be more consumer-friendly. There's too
much technojargon. That doesn't foster the kind of dialogue we
want.''
</P>
<P>
   And for all the companies' current restraint, some advertising
experts believe Americans may eventually see commercials mocking
rival drugs, in marketing tussles similar to the famous battles
between Pepsi and Coke or between Peter Pan and Jif peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand that we are not selling Lay's potato chips,''
said Schwatka of Grey Advertising. ``Drugs are powerful stuff. But
consumers are definitely going to be seeing more ads for
prescription drugs. And they're going to be getting more
information about those drugs. Information does not go backward. It
only moves forward.''

METS BEAT RED SOX AFTER PIAZZA BRUISES HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The most distressing development of Friday evening for
the Mets occurred before the game was five minutes old. Pedro
Martinez drilled Mike Piazza in the left hand with a fastball,
quickly causing Piazza to grimace and the Mets to feel a little
queasy. Hideo Nomo arrives and Piazza gets injured: the Mets had to
wonder if this was some type of practical joke.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets said that Piazza's hand was bruised and that X-rays
taken at Children's Hospital showed no broken bones. By game's end,
they had turned a distressing night into a delightful one by
battering Martinez for four homers and cruising to a 9-2 victory
over the Red Sox in their first interleague game of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the best pitcher in the National League last season
while with Montreal, was done after four innings because Albert
Castillo, Piazza's replacement, John Olerud, Luis Lopez and Bernard
Gilkey stunned him by going deep at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez even heard boos from many of the disappointed 32,214
fans who were watching this interleague matchup with heightened
interest since it was the first time the Mets opposed the Red Sox
in Boston since the memorable 1986 World Series. The ``Darryl,
Darryl'' chants were born here for the former Met Darryl Strawberry
12 years ago, but there were no ``Pedro, Pedro'' chants Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Another impressive turn by Al Leiter was overshadowed by
Piazza's injury, which will almost certainly cause the catcher to
miss Saturday's game and perhaps a few more, and the power outburst
from a team that is still last in the major leagues with 39 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (6-3) stifled the Red Sox on one run and four hits in six
innings and limited them to one hit in 10 at-bats with runners on
base, ruining possible rallies before they ever started and ending
New York's three-game losing streak. He lowered his National
League-leading earned-run average to 1.72.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (6-2), who was belted for six earned runs and eight
hits, has dropped three of his last five starts. That includes a
13-7 victory over the Yankees last Sunday in which he was sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Mets claimed Piazza's status will be evaluated
on Saturday, they would be fortunate if the catcher does not have
to be put on the disabled list because he was almost hit in a more
precarious spot. Martinez's fastball tailed in on Piazza and got
him on the meaty side of the hand between the pinky finger and the
wrist. If Piazza had been plunked directly on the wrist, a more
fragile part of the hand, the damage could have been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez entered the game with a 10-2 career record and a 1.65
ERA against the Mets, his best statistics versus any NL team. But
the Mets had beaten Martinez twice last season, by 2-1 on June 3
and by 7-0 on May 28, though not exactly clobbering him: Martinez
gave up four earned runs in 13 innings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday night, after Gilkey lined a one-out double to right in
the first, Martinez came in tight and hit Piazza with a 2-2
fastball. It was immediately obvious that Piazza was in trouble. He
dropped the bat, trudged toward first and stopped halfway to the
base so trainer Fred Hina could examine him. It looked as if Piazza
was in pain, but he stayed in and even ran to second when Olerud
ripped a run-scoring single. But Piazza did not put on his shin
guards in the bottom of the first as Castillo replaced him.
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the third and a taut pitcher's duel emerging
between Leiter and Martinez, Castillo, of all players, stroked a
2-2 pitch over the Green Monster and over the screen in left.
Martinez is one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball and
Castillo has one of the ugliest swings in the game, but the home
run gave the Mets a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two pitches later, Olerud, who entered the game 0-for-9 with
five strikeouts against Martinez, deposited a homer in the right
field seats. Carlos Baerga lined the next pitch past the pitcher's
mound for a single. Four pitches had produced two homers, a single,
a 3-0 lead for New York and a conspicuous murmur throughout the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   It got even bleaker for Martinez in the fourth. Lopez, the No. 9
batter, poked a two-run homer into the Red Sox bullpen, his first
of the year and the fifth of his career. Two batters later, Gilkey
bashed a 1-0 pitch 429 feet into the screen in left-center, giving
the Mets a 6-0 bulge.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn countered with a prodigious homer off Leiter in the
fourth, and he hit another homer off John Hudek in the ninth. But
by then, Martinez had endured his shortest outing for Boston and
the Mets were simply waiting to learn about Piazza's X-ray results.

BRINGING HEADACHES TO LIFE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About a year ago, Ulla Kling-Atkinson was named to
the creative team developing an ad campaign for Zomig, a
prescription drug made by Zeneca Pharmaceuticals for migraine
headaches.
</P>
<P>
   It was a match made in the Madison Avenue version of heaven
because Mrs. Kling-Atkinson has chronic migraines herself. And it
was with the insight of a longtime sufferer, combined with her
experience in marketing over-the-counter drugs, that she developed
the image now being used to sell Zomig in print and television ads
_ that of an onrushing 18-wheel tractor-trailer with engine
roaring, horn braying and high-beam headlights glaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first idea was this is something that comes on, that you
can't stop, and you are totally helpless,'' she said. ``We tried
elephants, rhinoceroses, trains _ anything that came at you that
you couldn't control.''
</P>
<P>
   Focus groups told the team that animals were not as frightening
as runaway machinery. And trains failed to produce a real sense of
panic because people do not often think of themselves walking along
a railroad track into a train's path.
</P>
<P>
   But the truck was terrifying, and the flashing headlights were
an important subliminal trigger for people with migraines because
extreme sensitivity to light at the onset of an attack is common.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something called aura that comes on before you get a
migraine, and it can be either a sensation of flashing lights or a
sensitivity to light,'' said Mark Schwatka, executive vice
president of Grey Advertising, who oversaw the Zomig campaign.
``With the truck, there's a sense of: It's coming at me, the light
is shining, it's hurting my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising has always been about pushing the right button to
motivate buying. But as marketers and ad agencies apply what they
know about consumer products to help sales of prescription drugs,
they are finding a medically informed vocabulary for invoking
consumers' urges _ in this case, to go to the doctor and ask about
the new drug they saw on TV.
</P>
<P>
   In developing the brand image for Zomig, Schwatka said he
realized the need for what he called ``a relevant consumer
insight.'' He also needed to make Zomig stand out in a din of TV
advertising, including ads for its direct competitor, Imitrex,
which is made by Glaxo Wellcome. Imitrex has already made a mark by
pointing out that it does not cause drowsiness, something feared by
migraine sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were second in,'' Schwatka said. ``This feeling of
helplessness became the insight we led with _ the feeling that
something big and ominous and so much more powerful than you was
bearing down on you.''
</P>
<P>
   At every stage, focus groups of migraine patients were shown the
ads under development. By the time the final version was shown,
``they were cheering,'' said Mrs. Kling-Atkinson, who has developed
campaigns for Maalox and Desenex as well as other prescription
drugs and refers to herself laughingly as ``the drug queen.''
</P>
<P>
   One person's comment, she said: ``Whoever did this must have
migraines.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when it came time to cast an actress to play a migraine
sufferer _ a nonspeaking role _ she tried for authenticity, casting
a woman who gets migraines. The headaches affect ``your whole
well-being,'' Mrs. Kling-Atkinson explained, and she wanted the
actress to accurately portray someone bowed in pain.
</P>
<P>
   More than in commercials for nonprescription painkillers or
cough preparations, though, the ad makers had to temper the power
of their creation to stay within Food and Drug Administration
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the graphics are very strong, the language is
moderate,'' Schwatka said. For example, over serene images of the
headache sufferer on her sailboat, an announcer intones a stream of
warnings about not using Zomig if you have high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over-the-counter advertising is much more rough and tumble,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Mrs. Kling-Atkinson, like most other people
involved in the Zomig campaign, got their stripes. Earlier, she
created fashion ads, then switched to campaigns for steel and beer
before returning to fashion.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 6:
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago New York City police officers attending a
convention in Washington brought shame on their city when they
trashed their hotels, harassed other guests and cavorted, drunk and
naked, in public. Now New York firefighters have replicated this
behavior at home, staging a rampage at a restaurant in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The outrageous behavior occurred on Wednesday night at the
Bryant Park Grill behind the New York Public Library. The day had
begun as a celebration of heroism in which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
praised the firefighters as ``greater heroes than the Yankees'' and
cited two officers for valor in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 firefighters ended up afterward at the Bryant Park
restaurant, where many of them drank heavily for hours, their moods
growing uglier as the evening advanced. The firemen urinated
publicly, exposed themselves, ran through a women's restroom and
bloodied each other in violent fights. Patrons ran for cover and
the restaurant's managers stood by terrified, fearful of being
harmed if they intervened.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters were in uniform, leaving no question about
their identity. But despite several witnesses, the only person
immediately arrested was the restaurant's bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into the police officers' brawl in Washington
was slow off the mark and took almost a year to run its course.
Giuliani and Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen will need to do
better than that to quell public outrage. The firefighters who
participated in this latest brawl need to learn swiftly that
drunken hooliganism is a career-ending offense.

FIREFIGHTERS' BRAWL MORE BRUTAL THAN FIRST REPORTED
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A drunken brawl by New York City firefighters at a
Bryant Park cafe Wednesday night was more extensive and brutal than
first reported, senior law-enforcement officials said Friday. But
they acknowledged that it was unlikely that any of the participants
would face criminal charges unless the brawlers filed complaints
against one another.
</P>
<P>
   As three city investigations went forward, investigators said 50
to 100 firefighters, scores more than originally reported, had
battled one another for hours in scenes of chaos that left faces
bloody, teeth knocked out, bodies cut and bruised and uniforms
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the extent of the brawl became known, outraged city
officials had called it the worst breach of conduct by the
uniformed services in years, a night of debauchery in which
firefighters turned into a mob, urinating publicly, exposing
themselves and terrorizing the cafe's patrons and staff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite official expressions of revulsion and significant
progress Friday in identifying those present at the rampage,
however, law-enforcement officials said it appeared unlikely that
any of the brawlers would face criminal charges, though some might
face Fire Department sanctions ranging from fines to dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of any criminal action coming about are remote,''
a law-enforcement official said. I'd be surprised if any of these
guys came forward and said, `He punched me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained
that the brawlers could be prosecuted for assault only if someone
who was struck filed a criminal complaint. Moreover, he said, the
firefighters could not be prosecuted for lewd behavior or even
disorderly conduct unless witnesses could be found to identify
specific suspects and testify as to their actions.
</P>
<P>
   But as investigators for the Police and Fire departments and the
Manhattan district attorney's office pressed their inquiries, new
accounts from as many as 18 civilian witnesses and some
firefighters shamed by the conduct of their colleagues gave a
clearer picture of events in and around the Bryant Park Grill's
outdoor cafe on Wednesday night following a late-morning ceremony
at City Hall in which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, other officials and
hundreds of firefighters and their families gathered to honor
scores of firefighters for acts of heroism last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, investigators said the drunkenness and violence had
begun about 5 p.m. and lasted almost six hours. They said at least
half of the 50 to 100 firefighters present engaged in fights, many
of them apparently stemming from longstanding rivalries among fire
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Amid heavy drinking and smashed glasses and flowerpots, dozens
of fights broke out all evening as fraternity-like rowdiness
degenerated into ugly battles that sent combatants flying over
furniture and planters.
</P>
<P>
   Harassed patrons fled, but the 14-member cafe staff stayed on,
although they were too frightened to call the police for hours,
according to Donna Simms, the cafe manager.
</P>
<P>
   None of the firefighters was taken into custody. Most were
drifting away when the police arrived, and the officers were
unaware then that numerous fights had taken place, so they halted
no one.
</P>
<P>
   While the police appeared to be making little headway Friday,
fire investigators said they had interviewed 18 civilian witnesses
and had even received several anonymous calls from firefighters who
gave the names and fire companies of department members who had
been present at the brawling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will come forward,'' one investigator said. ``People are
talking. This is not going to be done by Sunday, and maybe not even
by Monday. But we are confident that we will find those
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen said he told his department's
internal investigators to conduct an ``aggressive, comprehensive''
inquiry ``to ensure that those who are responsible are punished
quickly and severely.'' He said the department would deal harshly
with members who withheld information, and said that ``special
consideration will be granted to any member who comes forward.''

ONCE AN OUTSIDER, RESTORATION FIRM HAS INSIDE TRACK
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 7)  
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP  (ja) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle was
born in the tumultuous year of 1968, with a bow to Jane Jacobs and
a commitment to the maverick ideas of community-based planning and
rehabilitation rather than bulldozing. Today, it finds itself where
its founders never expected to be: on the inside track.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilding and restoration of Grand Central Terminal? That's
Beyer Blinder Belle. The remodeling of Rockefeller Center? Beyer
Blinder Belle. The Ford Center for the Performing Arts, where
``Ragtime'' is playing? Beyer Blinder Belle again.
</P>
<P>
   Across 42nd Street from the Ford Center, Beyer Blinder Belle is
designing a hotel and entertainment complex for Forest City Ratner.
Allied with the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, it is one of
three teams competing for the new Pennsylvania Station concourse
that is proposed within the General Post Office on Eighth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny Swedish Cottage in Central Park bears the mark of Beyer
Blinder Belle, as do renovations at La Guardia Airport, new
approaches to the Williamsburg Bridge, a study of the Yankee
Stadium area, the revival of the Sun Building near City Hall, a new
museum in the South Street Seaport and master plans for Columbia
University and Governors Island.
</P>
<P>
   If Beyer Blinder Belle seems to be everywhere, it is because
preservation has become an integral part of development in the
years since the firm was founded by John Beyer (rhymes with spire),
now 65 years old; Richard Blinder (rhymes with tinder), who is 62
and John Belle, 65.
</P>
<P>
   Having backed into landmarks practice through rehab work, they
embraced it in 1979 by adding James Marston Fitch, regarded as the
dean of American preservation, to the partnership. Today, the firm
enjoys an influence out of proportion to its modest size. What
makes its emergence so remarkable is that the firm does not have a
recognizable style, even in the numerous buildings it has designed
from scratch, which include a slender, glass-clad 45-story
apartment tower at 300 E. 93rd St.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a Beyer Blinder Belle signature
project, unless it is the renovation of an iconic landmark like
Grand Central that leaves the public with little sense of modern
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've received more favorable comments on the terminal than on
any other aspect of our operations,'' said E. Virgil Conway,
chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ``There have
been a lot of changes but at the same time, the overall appearance
is one of restoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the greatest influence on their practice, the
founding partners do not cite a master architect or planner.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they point to Ms. Jacobs, a writer and Greenwich
Village activist, who declared in ``The Death and Life of Great
American Cities'' (1961) that ``cities need old buildings so badly
it is probably impossible for vigorous streets and districts to
grow without them'' _ apostasy to a design establishment that was
pursuing urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Toronto, where she now lives, Ms.
Jacobs recalled the emergence of Beyer Blinder Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking at the fabric of the community,'' she said.
``That was very welcome and very exciting, that there were
professionals who were, at last, doing that. Also, they recognized
that time is important in these things. A community can't just come
by waving a wand. It has history. History was, to the modernists,
an enemy. So this was a very radical realization. And an important
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyer Blinder Belle's grounding in community-based planning has
served it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at them as the firm that gets things through
agencies,'' said Laurie Beckelman, a former chairwoman of the
Landmarks Preservation Commission. ``But they also have compassion
and sympathy toward the community, and they can work with both.
They are not seen as slam-dunk, but as fair, reasonable and
balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how long this firm _ or any firm with so
many high-powered clients _ can maintain that reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the prices of success is that you begin to think like a
developer,'' said Barbaralee Diamonstein, chairwoman of the
Historic Landmarks Preservation Center. ``That may or may not be a
bad thing.'' Beyer Blinder Belle is to be ``congratulated and
cautioned,'' she said. ``They learned early on to merge the
historical with the commercial. They have obviously perfected that
and made it agreeable both to developers and to the public and
private organizations, commissions and institutions that have to
approve these things. A large aspect of architecture is
presentation, and they are virtuosi at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the firm's impressive presentation charting the many changes
over time to Rockefeller Center has done little to persuade
preservationists that it would be appropriate to enlarge the
storefronts along Fifth Avenue and diminish the red-granite setting
of Prometheus.
</P>
<P>
   Although the New York Landmarks Conservancy supports the plan,
it has come under fire from the Municipal Art Society, Historic
Districts Council and others.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Upper West Siders are attacking plans for a
41-story apartment tower by Beyer Blinder Belle that would adjoin
the YMCA on West 63rd Street, near Central Park West. It would rise
on the site of the former McBurney School, whose facade is to be
preserved. Besides the sheer size of the mid-block building,
opponents deplore the segregation of entrances to the lower-income
rental housing at the base and the high-priced condominiums above.
</P>
<P>
   And even Fitch questioned the firm's plans on behalf of Donald
Trump to strip the St. Moritz Hotel on Central Park South to its
steel skeleton and erect a new facade that would evoke, but not
duplicate, the original. (Debate over that project became moot in
April when Trump lost the property to the hotelier Ian Schrager.)
</P>
<P>
   The future probably holds more quandaries of this kind: Is
preservation best served by rigorous replication of historic
features or by new construction, sympathetic in spirit, that
sometimes involves the demolition of existing architectural fabric?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much easier to be doctrinaire when there's less at
stake,'' said Hugh Hardy, of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, a
firm whose restoration work includes the New Amsterdam Theater.
``Their success will inevitably lead them into facing increasingly
difficult issues which have as much to do with the marketplace and
the client base as with the inherent ideology of the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is evidently relished by the younger partners who
are gradually assuming the reins at Beyer Blinder Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've redefined what is meant by preservation,'' said Richard
Southwick, 44, a partner since 1993. ``It may mean moving a
building down the block or building a new theater where two older
theaters stood.''
</P>
<P>
   (The historic Empire Theater was rolled 170 feet along West 42nd
Street as part of the Forest City Ratner project. The Ford Center,
designed with Kofman Engineering for Garth Drabinsky, incorporates
significant elements from the Lyric and Apollo Theaters, but both
playhouses were razed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest and most enriching architecture is that which
layers the new and old, allowing each to express itself honestly,''
said Frederick Bland, a 52-year-old designer. In 1978, he became
the first partner at Beyer Blinder Belle outside the original trio.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing so precious that it cannot accommodate some
new use,'' Beyer said. This may not be pure preservationist
orthodoxy, but Beyer Blinder Belle has long prided itself in being
a bit out of step. ``Controversy contributes to our credibility as
architects who are always reaching, always trying,'' Beyer said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It seems fitting that this partnership should have emerged from
the 1960s, when so many conventions were upended.
</P>
<P>
   As the decade began, all three men were in Cambridge, Mass.,
unknown to one another. Beyer, a native of Weehawken, N.J., and
Blinder, who grew up in New York City, were in different classes at
the Harvard University Graduate School of Design. Belle, who had
come from Cardiff, Wales, by way of London, was working for Jose
Luis Sert, an architect, planner and dean of the Harvard design
school.
</P>
<P>
   When Le Corbusier came to Harvard in 1960 to unveil his design
for the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, Beyer and Blinder and
Belle attended the event, having no idea at the time _ as they
nibbled cookies baked in the shape of Le Corbusier's ``Modulor''
man icon _ that they were standing in the same room as their future
partners.
</P>
<P>
   They did not get to know one another until the mid-'60s, when
all three worked in the New York office of Victor Gruen. It was
then that they felt the tension between their instincts and those
of their colleagues. ``A lot of the profession was going in the
direction of urban removal,'' Belle said.
</P>
<P>
   So they set up shop on their own at 31 Union Square West. ``We
weren't in the mainstream,'' Beyer said. ``We were doing
nitty-gritty stuff in the Bronx,'' like the 1,000-unit Jose de
Diego-Beekman Houses in the Mott Haven section.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly didn't burst on the scene,'' Blinder allowed.
``We grew and evolved.'' One early client, Robert Bonham, was a
developer of low-income co-ops in the Bronx who went on to become
the president of the South Street Seaport Museum. Through their
planning and design work at South Street, the partners got to know
Fitch, whom they invited to join the firm when he retired from
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our bridge to Ellis Island,'' Blinder said of Fitch,
who gave the firm the needed credibility to pursue that commission.
The $25 million renovation and restoration of Ellis Island as the
National Museum of Immigration, undertaken with Notter Finegold &AMP;
Alexander, put Beyer Blinder Belle squarely on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Island was one of several factors weighed by the MTA
selection committee that was looking for architects to replan Grand
Central. ``The terminal needed to be preserved and restored but it
also needed to be changed a bit,'' said Peter Stangl, the former
chairman of the MTA. ``John Belle shared that vision, even though
he has strong preservation principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial aspect of the project was the decision to
build an entirely new staircase on the east side of the concourse,
balancing that on the Vanderbilt Avenue side. ``That was kind of
shocking to the traditionalists,'' Stangl conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But not to Fitch. ``The logic of the plan suggested that there
would have been a balancing stair there,'' he said. ``That's the
essence of Beaux-Arts philosophy. We found working drawings that
showed that a staircase could be put in. We found steel connections
all prepared for the stair.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 89, Fitch retired last month from active practice.
He was succeeded in the partnership by James Rhodes, 52, who was
named on Tuesday. The other partners are Douglas McR. McKean, 42,
and Richard Metsky, 40. Marilyn Marullo, 46, is the administrative
officer, a position equivalent to partner.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, eight partners and two associate partners own a
stake in the firm, whose gross annual billings amount to $15.5
million. There are about 100 employees. In the latest ranking,
Beyer Blinder Belle was the 18th largest firm in the New York
chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
</P>
<P>
   From a peak of 150 employees in the mid-'80s, the firm shrank to
fewer than 50 during the depth of the recession in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept most of our senior staff,'' Ms. Marullo said,
``although we had them working on the boards.'' Those who remained
took pay cuts. The firm depended on public works and other
``bread-and-butter'' projects, said Maxinne Rhea Leighton, the
managing director of business development.
</P>
<P>
   Only six blocks from its original home, Beyer Blinder Belle
occupies the second floor of a loft building at 11th Street and
University Place. A 60-foot-long display wall bisects the space at
a 45-degree angle, leading to the ``crit pit,'' a large room where
wide-ranging critiques occur almost every Tuesday morning over
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Its partners take pride in being more New York-oriented than
many of their competitors. ``They say they're on their way to Kuala
Lumpur,'' Belle noted, ``and we're on our way to the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going through subway cards like crazy,'' Blinder added.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm's national profile will surely grow. One project on
the drawing boards involves the potential recreation of Thomas
Walter's original 1859 design for the U.S. Senate Chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is active in planning, renovating private homes and
corporate interiors. It is also cultivating business in new
construction, McKean said, on the grounds that ``we know how
buildings are put together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of a signature style has its liabilities and
strengths,'' Metsky said. ``It may be a liability in getting a
commission for a new building. But the strength is in our ability
to group together to solve complex problems. A nonsignature
building doesn't have to be done by one hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being divided among specialists, projects are given
to teams of generalists who follow the work from the earliest
sketches to the last punch list. The advantage is that even junior
architects can gain broad experience. The disadvantage is the
potential for burnout, particularly on jobs like Grand Central that
go on for years.
</P>
<P>
   No one is expecting Beyer or Blinder or Belle to burn out
anytime soon. ``As long as they want to practice architecture, it's
open to them,'' McKean said, adding that the name of the firm will
not change.
</P>
<P>
   As to the future, Belle looks forward to standing in a completed
Grand Central and overhearing one commuter ask another: ``Doesn't
the east staircase look better now that it's been restored?''

PATAKI SAYS LILCO DIRECTORS `ROBBED' SHAREHOLDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki accused Long Island
Lighting Co.'s directors Friday of ``robbing their shareholders''
of $67 million by paying ``secret'' bonuses to executives,
including $42 million to the chairman, Dr. William Catacosinos.
</P>
<P>
   Using very harsh language, the governor castigated the payments
as ``disgraceful'' and ``outrageous.'' He demanded that the money
be returned and that LILCO's directors and executives resign from
their successor company, Marketspan. He also called for
investigations by the state attorney general and the Public Service
Commission, and both agencies said they were starting to comply.
</P>
<P>
   But a Marketspan spokesman denied any wrongdoing. ``I think
there's a misunderstanding regarding these funds,'' said the
company's senior vice president for public affairs, Joseph
McDonnell, who was one of the recipients of a payment. ``Various
figures have been lumped together, and then it gets inflammatory.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell said that three-quarters of the benefits paid to LILCO
executives were retirement benefits paid out early and that the
remainder had been approved by LILCO's board of directors in 1994
to help ensure that employees would stay on if the agency were to
have a change of ownership. He noted that the payments had been
reported in LILCO's annual statements.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing for
LILCO for the year ending March 31, the existence of the benefits
policies are cited, but not with total dollar amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's charges were made in a news release issued in Albany as
the New York state Republican Convention was winding down.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure about the payments comes at an awkward moment for
the governor, who had just succeeded in reducing Long Island's
electricity bills, which under LILCO were the highest in the
continental United States. Just a week ago, the state's Long Island
Power Authority carried out his $7 billion plan to buy most of
LILCO's electricity service and use tax-free bonds to enable a 20
percent cut in customer rates.
</P>
<P>
   The governor stressed that the dispute over the payments would
not affect the power authority's takeover, its bonds or the lowered
billing rates, which took effect May 29.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute makes for a bumpy beginning in the power
authority's fledgling relationship with Marketspan, which holds
long-term contracts to provide the electricity and operate the old
LILCO system for the authority. Marketspan was formed by the merger
of LILCO's other divisions _ including its management, power plants
and gas system _ with Brooklyn Union Gas holding company.
</P>
<P>
   And the disputed payments could also cause internal friction in
the new LILCO-Brooklyn partnership because Brooklyn Union
executives did not get any special payments like the ones for
LILCO's executives.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki showed real flashes of anger in his accusations. ``Not
content with ripping off its own ratepayers for decades,'' he said,
``now LILCO's board and management are robbing their shareholders
in one last extraordinary secret act of greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki continued, ``I encourage the shareholders to demand that
Catacosinos resign immediately as chairman of the new company,
along with those members of LILCO's board and management who are
now at the new merged company.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Joining the attack was the governor's appointee as chairman of
the power authority, Richard Kessel. ``The decision to trigger
payments,'' Kessel said, ``was omitted from disclosure documents
provided to LIPA prior to the closing, and LIPA believes LILCO took
purposeful steps to keep LIPA from discovering this information
prior to the closing.''
</P>
<P>
   The power authority's initial review showed that the payments
came from stockholder funds, not from rates paid by electricity
customers, Kessel said. In addition to the $42 million for
Catacosinos, a total of $25 million was paid to 25 other LILCO
executives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell declined to comment on whether Brooklyn Union
executives knew in advance about the benefits paid to their new
partners or whether they were upset by it.

JURORS IN DEATH PENALTY CASE ARGUE VIOLENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two jurors nearly came to blows Friday as a Brooklyn
jury was unable for a third day to decide whether a former jail
guard should be sentenced to death for killing three people, a
court officer told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The report of the heated emotions in the jury room in state
Supreme Court came in the first death penalty trial under New York
state's 3-year-old capital-punishment law.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Darrel Harris, who was honored as a hero for
saving another jail guard during an inmate riot a decade ago, was
convicted by the same jury on May 19 of first-degree murder for
shooting two people in the head and fatally stabbing the third
while robbing a Bedford-Stuyvesant social club in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now the jurors are deciding whether to sentence Harris, 40, to
death by lethal injection or to life in prison without the
possibility of parole. The panel's deliberations will resume
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The only communication from the jurors Friday came in the
morning, when they asked the judge, Acting Justice Anne Feldman, to
repeat the legal instructions she gave them on Wednesday, just
before they began their deliberations on the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in midafternoon, Feldman announced that something was to
be ``put on the record.'' One of the court officers, Gary Thompson,
then gave an account of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was outside the jury room and I heard a heated argument
going on,'' he said, adding that this had occurred about 12:45 p.m.
``I heard some chairs moving around.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he entered the room. ``One juror was standing up
and being held back by a couple of male jurors,'' he continued,
recalling that the man being restrained was ``yelling and cursing''
and that the man he appeared to be cursing at was cursing back.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he had told them to ``relax,'' and assured them he
understood that they had been under stress but ``you've been
getting along for two and a half, three weeks'' and ``you really
got to try.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They relaxed, calmed down and apologized to each other,'' he
said, suggesting that the deliberations had then resumed. He did
not identify the angry jurors or what they had said to each other.
</P>
<P>
   One of Harris' lawyers, Russell Neufeld, then argued that the
confrontation indicated that there ``must be significant
differences within the jury,'' despite what he called the
``extensive'' deliberations that had taken place, and he asked the
judge to dismiss the jury and sentence Harris herself.
</P>
<P>
   The capital-punishment law says that if a jury is unable to
agree unanimously on a death sentence or on life in prison without
possibility of parole, the judge is to decide the sentence, with
the maximum allowed being 25 years to life in prison for each
murder. In Harris' case, that would mean parole would not be
possible for at least 75 years if the terms are ordered to run
consecutively, which lawyers say would be most likely.

SAM YORTY, 88, CONTROVERSIAL EX-MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for general rewrite throughout; changes background of Frank
Yorty from Irish to Dutch in 12th graf; adds some additional
biographical reporting)  (bl)  
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Samuel William Yorty, the blunt-talking,
self-promoting Mayor of Los Angeles who took credit for building up
the city yet denied any responsibility for the Watts riots in 1965,
died Friday. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Yorty had suffered a stroke on May 24, and two days ago asked to
be released from a hospital. He died at his hilltop home in the
Studio City section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Yorty also served two terms in Congress, but became a national
figure because of his tenure in Los Angeles, from 1961 to 1973, and
for his unabashed, contrary ways.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described ``Maverick Mayor'' began his career as a
liberal Democrat and ended it as a conservative Republican. He was
elected mayor despite alienating his party by supporting Richard
Nixon, not John Kennedy, for president in 1960. He was called
``Travelin' Sam'' for seemingly spending as much time away from Los
Angeles as within the city's expanding sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam did what was unexpected,'' said Joy Picus, a long-time
civic leader. ``Sam did what would get him attention.''
</P>
<P>
   He presided over a city that was moving from Midwestern outpost
to gateway to the Pacific Rim. In the 1960 census, the year before
Yorty first took office, Los Angeles still had the most residents
who were Protestant, white and native-born of America's biggest
cities. Indeed, Yorty might have been better suited to be the mayor
of Los Angeles in the '40s or the early '50s, said Kevin Starr, the
state librarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. had become a new city,'' Starr said. ``In movie terms, he
began his career in `Chinatown,' came to political strength during
`L.A. Confidential' and he was mayor during `Dragnet.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fitting description for a man who was one of the first local
politicians to recognize the power of the camera. He appeared on
television often, and at one point, was well known for playing
banjo on the ``Tonight Show'' while the host, Johnny Carson, played
drums.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he was host of a local television program, ``The Sam
Yorty Show,'' and when it was canceled he complained, ``They
replaced my show with `Hee Haw'!'' After being defeated and leaving
office in 1973, he had to settle for being heard, not seen, and
landed a job as a host for a radio call-in show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Yorty's mayoralty,'' Mike Davis, a historian and author of
``City of Quartz'' (Verso, 1990), ``was the transition from a WASP
majority to the multicultural Los Angeles of Tom Bradley. Yorty's
death is symbolic of the passing of that whole period of L.A.
history when Midwesterners dominated the city and its culture.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1920s, so many Iowans had settled in Los Angeles that
some people called it ``Iowa by the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Yorty had also come from the Midwest. He was born on Oct. 1,
1909, in Lincoln, Neb., to Johanna, an Irish immigrant, and Frank
Yorty, who was of Dutch descent. Yorty grew up poor in Nebraska's
capital, where his father, a former farmer, ran a restaurant, among
other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Yorty's political heroes as a boy were William Jennings Bryan
and Woodrow Wilson. After graduating from high school, Yorty moved
to Los Angeles and attended Southwestern University and the
University of California, eventually receiving a law degree.
</P>
<P>
   At age 27, he entered politics, running successfully for the
state Assembly in 1936. In World War II, he served in the Army Air
Corps and became a captain in the intelligence unit.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After losing a Los Angeles mayoral election at the end of the
war, he was elected again to the Assembly in 1948, and then won a
seat in Congress, in 1950. Through the years, his politics became
more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   According to the book ``Los Angeles A to Z'' by Leonard Pitt and
Dale Pitt (University of California Press, 1997) ``initially a
left-winger, he moved steadily to the right and became a staunch
supporter of the House Un-American Activities Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the year before he was elected mayor, Yorty shocked his
fellow Democrats by not endorsing the party's shining star, John
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a great mayor,'' said Harriet Weider, a former
aide. ``But he was a contrarian and I think some of his problems he
brought on himself by his feisty independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Yorty reduced city property taxes and backed the building of
freeways, the Los Angeles Zoo, the convention center and other
projects. Yet his mayoralty was badly scarred by the 1965 Watts
riots, which left 34 people dead and hundreds injured. When the
flames were finally put out, federal officials said Yorty's
attitude toward the inner city and his failure to heed the warning
signs contributed to the riots. In turn, Yorty criticized the
federal government's anti-poverty programs for promoting false
hopes for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1969 elections, Yorty was alienated from the black
population that had helped elect him and he used race and
accusations of left-wing influences to beat back the challenge of a
black city councilman, Tom Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   What made Yorty's campaigns against Bradley especially
disappointing to many was the memory that when Yorty first ran in
1961 he had widespread black support and had opened his
administration to more racial minorities than any other mayor up to
that point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yorty ran unsuccessfully for the 1972 Democratic nomination for
president, and was defeated for mayor the next year by Bradley.
This time, Yorty ran as a Republican. All told, Yorty ran for
office 20 times, including unsuccessful bids for governor and the
U.S. Senate, and yet another bid for mayor, in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to view Sam Yorty as a metaphor, more than an
individual,'' said Gerald Horne, a historian and author of ``Fire
This Time'' (University Press of Virginia, 1995), a book about the
Watts riots. ``You have to view him as a metaphor because he was
not alone in his shift to the right. This was part of a massive
shift that was taking place in U.S. politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Yorty was called ``Saigon Sam'' for his support of U.S.
involvement in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Yorty's political fortunes dropped, he remained
infamously quotable. In the 1980s he startled a Chamber of Commerce
luncheon by saying that ``the black people are really racist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They vote for black people because they are black,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yorty's political nadir was the `69 campaign against
Bradley,'' said Mike Davis, the historian. ``In a city that has had
some pretty dirty campaigns, that was the low point.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His success or failure in shaping Los Angeles remains a debate
for historians, but it is widely agreed that his two loves were
running for office and having an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather give a speech than eat,'' Yorty is quoted as
saying in ``Maverick Mayor'' (Doubleday and Company, 1966), a
biography by Ed Ainsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Yorty is survived by his wife, Valerie King Yorty, and two
granddaughters.

NEWS ANALYSIS: MAYOR THINKS VOTERS MIGHT DEFEAT NEW STADIUM
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If a referendum is held in November on whether city
money should be used for a new ball park for the Yankees, it
wouldn't be hard to imagine the motifs opponents would use in their
campaign commercials attacking the project: a tormentingly long
traffic jam, backed by a soundtrack of car horns and coughs. A
procession of public schools disfigured by age and neglect. Or
perhaps an unflattering photo of George Steinbrenner, with dollar
signs cavorting around him.
</P>
<P>
   Such provocative images are hard to fight, and that may help
explain why Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is crusading against the
referendum. Giuliani strongly believes that the city should
consider building a stadium on the West Side, but he understands
that in such a referendum, the naysayers here, as in similar votes
elsewhere, would tend to have the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor maintains that a stadium would yield considerable
benefits to the city over the long term, increasing tax revenues
and revitalizing a moribund part of Manhattan without causing
traffic problems. Those arguments, though, might be felled by more
visceral appeals to a populace wary of more congestion and
concerned about whether the city should be spending more on schools
and the rest of its infrastructure. (Not to mention the views of
baseball aficionados who loathe Steinbrenner and say the Yankees
should never leave their historic homeland of the Bronx.)
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the referendum grew more heated on Thursday when
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, all but threatened to
move the team out of New York unless the City Council speaker,
Peter Vallone, abandons his proposal for the referendum.
Steinbrenner appears to feel that the referendum might cripple
plans for a Manhattan stadium. The mayor does too, and in recent
days he has refused to negotiate with the City Council over the
next budget unless Vallone gave up on the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday the mayor acknowledged that he would
lose a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that people would vote against it,'' Giuliani said,
referring to the stadium. He later added: ``I wasn't elected mayor
of New York City to follow the popular will in every poll every
time. I was elected the mayor of New York City to exercise my
judgment, my reason, my wisdom, and I have a different view of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani invoked, as he often does, the westward flights of the
Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, suggesting that Vallone's
brand of leadership was responsible for those earlier defections.
And the mayor recounted how in other places, residents had voted
against stadiums that then proved to be wildly successful when they
were eventually built.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you are probably going to laugh at me when I say
this,'' he said. ``But I believe that 10 years from now I'll be
very popular for doing this. But 10 years from now. Maybe for a few
years I won't be so popular.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what would happen to the mayor's plans for a
stadium should the voters oppose using city money for the project.
Giuliani might go to court to get the results nullified, or he
could turn to another method of financing, such as setting up an
authority that is quasi-independent from the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, a Republican who has been striving mightily to mend
fences with party leaders in recent years, also no doubt realizes
that a referendum might galvanize voters in the November election.
The increased turnout in a city that is overwhelmingly Democratic
could hurt Gov. George Pataki and the rest of the Republican slate.
</P>
<P>
   Such an outcome was one reason that the referendum was proposed
by Vallone, who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
Vallone says that the public has a right to vote on whether the
city should allocate hundreds of millions of dollars for a new ball
park, and his aides acknowledge that if he is the Democratic
nominee, he could benefit from a referendum drawing voters to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor himself benefited from a referendum when he was first
elected in 1993. In that year residents of Staten Island voted to
secede from the city in balloting that drove up the turnout in the
borough, the city's only Republican stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good government groups have been wrestling for years with how
to increase participation in elections,'' said Kevin McCabe,
Vallone's campaign manager. ``It's interesting that now, people are
concerned that more people may actually be participating in an
election. I don't see how that is a bad thing in a democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCabe added that the primary purpose of the referendum would be
to ``let the people have their say.''
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor and his advisers have conceded that winning a
referendum would be tough, if not impossible, they have also sought
to shift the focus to the idea that the city elects a chief
executive to make major decisions, not punt them to the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   But that assertion may fall flat among voters at a time when
referendums have become an increasingly popular method of deciding
issues around the country. Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the
Bronx, who opposes a Manhattan stadium, said the best way to muster
support for holding a referendum would be to tell voters that it
would publicize the project's costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a debate in front of the public that airs out all
these financial issues,'' Ferrer said. ``You can't do this deal in
the back room or the luxury suite.''

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Two in a row looks even more like a long
shot for Eddie Cheever Jr. after yesterday's qualifying run for the
True Value 500K.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever and his No. 51 Team Cheever//Rachel's car managed
215.595 mph in the first practice session Thursday, 24th-fastest in
the 31-team field. A qualifying speed of 214.985 yesterday places
Cheever Jr. in the 10th row for tonight's race. Pole winner Tony
Stewart was 10 mph faster.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the Indianapolis 500 winner said his team hasn't
even come close to figuring out how to get the car to go any faster
at Texas Motor Speedway. With time running out for tonight's race,
Cheever said his team is in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's a pretty enormous problem right now,'' Cheever
said. ``It seems like everybody else is running fast and we can't
get it down. I could tell as soon as I got on the track that it was
going to happen.'' &QL; 
BOAT'S FRIENDLY RIVALRY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Billy Boat, who drives for the A.J. Foyt Racing Team, said it
seems like every time he takes to the asphalt, one challenge he
faces is running faster than a car from Team Menard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a friendly little rivalry going,'' Boat said. ``It's
fun. We didn't beat them to the pole, which is what we really
wanted, but we'll go out tomorrow and do our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat qualified in the front row beside Team Menard driver and
pole-winner Tony Stewart. Team Menard driver Robbie Buhl is in the
second row. Kenny Brack, the second A.J. Foyt entry, will start in
the sixth row.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track is gripping so well and all the cars are running so
fast that I think we're in for a sprint to the finish,'' Boat said.
``From the start, it's going to be all out.'' &QL; 
SAM THE SALESMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After his qualifying session yesterday, IRL driver Sam Schmidt
wheeled out a glass case full of sunglasses near his spot in the
garage, and turned from race-car driver to salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, who sells the glasses as a favor for one of his new
sponsors, said he sells 25 to 30 pairs at each race. The price
ranges from $45 to $125.
</P>
<P>
   A good sales day would take some sting out of a tough week for
Schmidt and his team on the track. After a crash at Indianapolis,
the team did not get another car until Thursday, the first day of
practice. Schmidt will be in the 12th row for today's race after
qualifying 24th. &QL; 
ONE FAST ROOKIE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Beechler came to the series from the dirt tracks of the
Midwest, racing sprint cars and midgets. He started 24th in the
Indianapolis 500, but because of engine trouble, finished 32nd.
</P>
<P>
   He was the fastest qualifying rookie for tonight's race, and
will start 17th after qualifying with a speed of 216.485 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like running in a coffee cup here,'' Beechler said of
TMS. ``I have yet to run on anything this banked; about the only
thing I can compare it to is Eldora (Speedway in Ohio). It is very
smooth, and it really puts you down in your seat. These speeds are
not far off what we qualified at Indy.'' &QL; 
GEAR GAMBLE COSTS RAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greg Ray consistently turned in some of the fastest practice
laps Thursday, then dropped to the seventh row when qualifying for
True Value was over yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said his team ran pretty fast in sixth gear the first day,
then made a ``radical switch'' before qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rolled the dice,'' Ray said. ``It's not like we hit snake
eyes, but we didn't exactly miss the table, either. We'd like to be
closer to the front, but we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final IRL practice session yesterday evening, Ray was
back near the front with the seventh-fastest speed. &QL; 
WHO'S HOT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart's pole speed of 224.448 mph is the fastest pole
speed ever by a new-formula IRL car. The previous best was Billy
Boat's four-lap average of 223.503 last month at the Indianapolis
500. &QL; 
WHO'S NOT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stan Wattles, one of two drivers using the American-made Riley &AMP;
Scott chassis, qualified third-to-last for tonight's race with a
speed of 213.228. The other R&AMP;S user, Eliseo Salazar, qualified
18th.

laps Thursday, then dropped to the seventh row when qualifying for
True Value was over yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said his team ran pretty fast in sixth gear the first day,
then made a ``radical switch'' before qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rolled the dice,'' Ray said. ``It's not like we hit snake
eyes, but we didn't exactly miss the table, either. We'd like to be
closer to the front, but we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final IRL practice session yesterday evening, Ray was
back near the front with the seventh-fastest speed. &QL; 
WHO'S HOT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart's pole speed of 224.448 mph is the fastest pole
speed ever by a new-formula IRL car. The previous best was Billy
Boat's four-lap average of 223.503 last month at the Indianapolis
500. &QL; 
WHO'S NOT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stan Wattles, one of two drivers using the American-made Riley &AMP;
Scott chassis, qualified third-to-last for tonight's race with a
speed of 213.228. The other R&AMP;S user, Eliseo Salazar, qualified
18th.

   UNION CITY, N.J. _ Hidden in the wooded bluffs overlooking the
Hoboken railroad tracks, at least a dozen homeless people have
built makeshift shacks in recent years using scraps of wood and and
corrugated tin, tree branches, plastic tarp and other junk. But on
Thursday morning, a crew from the city's Department of Public
Works, assisted by the police, took axes and a buzz saw and razed
the shacks.
</P>
<P>
   Union City police officials said the move to demolish the
shantytown came after a rising number of complaints by residents of
nearby houses and apartments about noise and petty thefts. The
police said they had warned the shanty occupants a week in advance
that the structures would be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   When officers returned Thursday at 9 a.m., they were accompanied
by officials from North Hudson Community Action Corp., which runs
counseling programs for the homeless, and from Palisades Emergency
Residence Corp., which operates a shelter and soup kitchen. ``We
didn't go there in an arrest mode,'' said Chief Paul Hanak of the
Union City police. ``We went there to urge them to accept social
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight homeless men were near the shanties when the police
arrived, Hanak said. Four agreed to speak with the outreach
workers, but in the end, none followed up by seeking food or
shelter later in the day. ``We gave out literature; we told them of
all the services that we provide,'' said Jane Casares, the
coordinator of emergency food and shelter for North Hudson
Community Action. ``They were supposed to come to our offices. They
didn't show up.''
</P>
<P>
   The action by city officials to remove the cliffside encampment
cast light on a mostly ignored nether world that outreach workers
said has existed for years, a shadowy collection of dozens, perhaps
hundreds, of homeless people living hidden in the craggy Palisades
at the edges of some of New Jersey's most densely populated
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked with several of those individuals before and
attempted to assist them,'' said Vanessa Van Orden, the executive
director of the Palisades Emergency Residence Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to finding the cluster of shacks on the cliffs in
Union City overlooking Hoboken, Ms. Van Orden said, outreach
workers were familiar with several other locations where the
homeless had set up camp, including in nearby West New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Union City, some of the shacks had existed for years, and
although the police occasionally razed one or another of them, the
homeless were largely left to their own hardscrabble existence. But
the cliffs have also become a popular hangout for teen-agers and
others who gather to drink alcohol, leaving empty cans and broken
bottles strewn about.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a search for a missing teen-ager last week that
brought the shantytown back to the attention of the police. The
teen-ager was later found elsewhere, but officers, alarmed by the
growing number of shacks and the often fetid conditions of the area
surrounding them, warned the shanty residents that they would
return. An offer of transportation to a shelter was universally
rejected, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unsanitary condition they were living in,'' Hanak
said. ``There was no running water, no sanitary facilities. It's in
their own best interest. They may not see it that way, but it's in
their best interest that we took this action.'' One of the men
appeared to be drunk and admitted having an alcohol problem, but
the others appeared to be in generally good condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to dismantle their houses and not have contact
with them,'' the chief said. ``First, we had to make sure there was
no one with any serious physical injury or anyone with serious
mental deficiency. All were able to speak and knew what was going
on. As long as they can make an intelligent decision, we honor
their wish as to whether they want help or not.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, local officials across the country have sought
to eliminate encampments of the homeless even as more and more
shantytowns seem to materialize. In New York City, for example, the
authorities have torn down nearly every large encampment, including
those at or near Columbus Circle, the United Nations and one called
``the Hill,'' which consisted of a teepee and about 15 shacks by
the Manhattan Bridge. New York officials have also moved to chase
squatters from abandoned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Hanak said he wanted to clear away the shanties before ``we have
too many people to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the sturdiness of the shanties varied, almost all were
equipped with a mattress and bedding. The structures were without
running water or electricity, but many of the people living in them
had installed cooking equipment that could be operated with an open
fire or propane gas. Because of the danger of a gas explosion, fire
officials were on hand for Thursday morning's sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, piles of rubble and a lingering stench were
the only signs of the former shantytown. In one spot were a cracked
plastic lawn chair and a crinkled tube of toothpaste. A brown
jacket was hanging neatly from a nearby tree branch. In another
area, a mattress had been repositioned, covered neatly by a brown
comforter. There were a pair of old work boots and a small grill, a
frying pan and an empty can of pineapple chunks that was being used
to store utensils. But there was no sign of the owner.

RED WINGS BEAT STARS FOR STANLEY CUP BERTH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Texas)   (ja) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ With Chris Osgood atoning in a big way for his lapses
in goal two nights earlier, the Detroit Red Wings beat the Dallas
Stars, 2-0, Friday night in Joe Louis Arena and won the Western
Conference finals by four games to two.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the Wings returned to the championship round, which
they won in a four-game sweep against Philadelphia last season.
They also set up a Stanley Cup finals against the Washington
Capitals that will feature starkly contrasting franchises and a
human-interest subplot that is both sincere and sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a lead with a goal in each of the first two
periods, the Red Wings held off the visitors in the third period
with a ferocious checking effort that brought the capacity crowd to
its feet repeatedly with long, loud bursts of chanting and
cheering.
</P>
<P>
   The checking helped Osgood earn his second shutout of this
series in a postseason that has been erratic for him. One final
hurdle remains for Osgood and the Wings: Washington, starting next
Tuesday night here.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the Red Wings and the Capitals and their
hockey cultures is clear. The Red Wings, the defending champions,
will be playing for the third time in four years for the title. The
Capitals, in their 24th season, are making their first appearance
in the finals, having eliminated Buffalo in six games on Thursday
to clinch the East.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit, which has been in the National Hockey League since the
1920s, is an industrial city on the Canadian border where fans
routinely buy all the tickets and crowd the standing-room tiers.
The Capitals, who moved to a new arena this season, work in a
government-driven city that has no baseball and favors football, a
city only casually familiar with hockey. The Caps played many times
this season before large gaps of empty seats, even in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   On an individual and personal level, the most interesting man in
the final series might be Ron Wilson, the first-year coach of the
Capitals. He was born in Windsor, Ontario, a Canadian city less
than a mile from the drab gray walls of Joe Louis Arena. Wilson's
father, Larry Wilson, played and coached the Wings before his
death. So did Johnny Wilson, Larry's brother and Ron's uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson carries in his suit coat a hockey card with a picture of
his father in a Detroit uniform. He has said that one of his career
goals is to coach the Wings. After his team beat Buffalo on
Thursday night, Wilson was asked which team he would rather face,
Detroit or Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, Detroit,'' Wilson said. Noting that his team will
be a clear underdog to the Wings, he added, ``Probably everybody
thinks we'll go down four straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit did nothing Friday night to dispel that notion. Scoring
first, while short-handed, was Larry Murphy, the veteran
defenseman. When the Wings' captain, Steve Yzerman, banked the puck
off the boards to Darren McCarty in the neutral zone, Murphy jumped
off his bench to turn a one-on-one rush into a two-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   After Murphy beat goalie Ed Belfour with a backhander at 6
minutes 20 seconds of the first period, the Stars argued that
Detroit had too many men on the ice. Although one of the Detroit
skaters went to the bench after Murphy came on, it was not soon
enough, in the view of the Stars. Referee Bill McCreary ignored
their protests and the goal stood.
</P>
<P>
   The Wings made it 2-0 at 1:48 of the second period on a goal by
Sergei Fedorov. It was his first of the series but his ninth of the
playoffs, most in the league. After taking a pass from Murphy,
Fedorov fired a long shot between the circles that Belfour only
partly stopped before the puck trickled over the line.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end, Detroit goalie Chris Osgood stopped 18 shots
in the first 40 minutes. Several of them were difficult and he was
cheered by the fans, clad mostly in red and white. In the previous
game, a 3-2 Stars victory, the winning goal was scored in the first
minute of overtime on a shot by Jamie Langenbrunner from center
ice.
</P>
<P>
   That was the third goal of the soft sort that Osgood had given
up in this tournament. Although he seems to have the support of the
Wings players, fans and news media, Osgood is widely perceived
outside Detroit as one of the Wings' vulnerabilities.

IRL TURNS TO COUNTER MEASURES TO PREVENT ANOTHER SCORING SNAFU

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In order to prevent post-race protestations,
Victory Circle roundhouses and morning-after headaches, the Indy
Racing League wants you to know that it can count to 208.
</P>
<P>
   That magic number is 208 _ the number of laps it will take to
complete the True Value 500K tonight, and the IRL can count them in
four _ count 'em, ``four'' _ different ways.
</P>
<P>
   They use their computerized Data 1 system with its 11 on-track
antennas that track the position of the transmitter in each of the
28 cars on the track.
</P>
<P>
   They use NASCAR's computerized AMB system with its in-track
cables that track the position of ``another'' transmitter in each
of the 28 cars on the track.
</P>
<P>
   They use the four _ count 'em, ``four'' _ eyeballs of Randy
Kenyon and Sandy Griffith, who write down the numbers of each of
the 28 cars on the track as they pass the start/finish line _ the
way races have been doing it since the beginning of time.
</P>
<P>
   And they use their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   They can count to 208 with their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, people would write down the time on scorecards
and our auditors would collect and collate the data,'' IRL official
Steve Mansfield explained from the scoring center in a suite
overlooking the Texas Motor Speedway. ``Now, we've taken that one
step further. Each team has a scorer who sits with an Apple Newton.
You tap the screen when your car passes and it registers. All the
Newtons are wired together, and this data is passed onto the
computer and we can see it immediately. I take the data from all
our serial scorers and all the electronic systems and make sure
they are in synch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to let what happened last year happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened last year depends on who's counting.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to have taken Arie Luyendyk 208 laps to win the
inaugural race last year. But a scoring glitch counted Luyendyk a
lap behind when Billy Boat finished his 208th lap ahead of the rest
of the field, and U.S. Auto Club
</P>
<P>
   escorted Boat to victory circle.
</P>
<P>
   Mayhem ensued: Luyendyk, stormed the circle claiming he was a
lap ahead of Boat and had actually run 210 laps. Boat's car owner
A.J. Foyt shoved Luyendyk. USAC reviewed the scoring, revised its
decision, awarded Luyendyk the victory the next day and was
promptly relieved of its duties by the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Britton, who ran data systems for Luyendyk that day, said
the headaches started at about lap 50 when he and his teammates
noticed that USAC had Luyendyk eight laps down when he was on the
lead lap. The Treadway Racing team told Luyendyk to stay on the
track until the checkered flag fell, even though their records
showed he'd won it two laps before.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt still disputes who won the race, but one thing he and
Luyendyk can agree on is that USAC couldn't be counted on to count
straight last year.
</P>
<P>
   USAC ``put the pace car on us and we thought Luyendyk was two
laps behind us so we waved him by,'' Foyt said. ``You're not going
to wave somebody by if you want to win a race. My computer on my
car said we won that race, and I think my computer knew more than
some of those idiots that were upstairs scoring!''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, A.J., IRL executive director Leo Mehl has taken
great pains to make sure there are no ``idiots'' upstairs anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Among Mansfield's fleet of Newton scorers is Betsy Starne, whose
husband has known Foyt for some 32 years. Her finger hits the
Newton pad every time Boat crosses the start/finish line. She then
has about 25 seconds to copy the elapsed time onto a lap-by-lap
race sheet and a 10-lap card until Boat crosses the line again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be completely focussed and concentrate on your one
car,'' said Carol Blackwell, the Team Cheever office manager who
started counting for Eddie Cheever Jr. when the IRL implemented the
Newton system last year after the Texas race. ``You just always
have to be watching that one car while the race fan in you wants to
watch the race.''
</P>
<P>
   But when a car goes around and around and around and around 208
times?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always in the back of your mind that you might mess up
and it's pretty stressful,'' Starne said. ``You know that if you
have a problem you can hold up your hand and they'll come check for
you, but that's why they have four systems.''
</P>
<P>
   And since the IRL can count to four, they hope it will be easier
to count to 208.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The scientist at the center of an investigation of
whether two U.S. companies improperly helped China improve its
rockets told the Chinese in 1996 that he would do everything he
could to make their rockets the most reliable in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wah Lim, a Chinese-born American citizen, was a
senior vice president and engineer at a unit of Loral Space and
Communications when he wrote a cordial letter to China Aerospace
Corp. in April 1996, two weeks before a technical review he oversaw
was provided to the Chinese company without U.S. government
permission and contrary to Loral policies.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are investigating whether the review, an
analysis of a Chinese rocket-launch failure that destroyed a Loral
satellite, violated export-control laws and damaged national
security by giving the Chinese information that would enable them
to improve their missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation caused Justice Department prosecutors in
February to oppose President Clinton's approval for China to launch
another Loral satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Loral officials insist that the unauthorized and perhaps illegal
disclosure to the Chinese was just a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But both the warmly worded letter by Lim, in which he promised a
fruitful joint effort to figure out why the Chinese rocket had
exploded two months earlier, and other internal Loral documents
portray a corporate mind-set in which the priority was to fix a
serious problem of concern both to the American company and to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese rocket carrying the Loral satellite crashed into a
hill 22 seconds after liftoff in February 1996. The Chinese thought
they had figured out the cause, but their insurance companies
wanted a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Lim. The Loral physicist, an intensely private man of 53
who grew up in Singapore and came to the United States on a
Fulbright scholarship, was so highly respected by the Chinese that
Liu Jiyuan, the chairman of China Aerospace, asked Loral executives
to put him in charge of the review.
</P>
<P>
   Although his mandate was narrowly defined, his letter to Liu
during the early stages of the review and other internal Loral
documents suggest that he may have had broader objectives: to offer
concrete recommendations to improve the reliability of China's
troubled Long March rocket program.
</P>
<P>
   Since many of Loral's satellites are launched in China, such a
goal was in the company's best financial interest as well. But
China Aerospace launches rockets with both commercial and military
applications, and improvements in the ability to launch rockets
accurately and reliably could aid not only its business of sending
communication satellites into space but also its testing and
delivering of nuclear weapons from ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   So the Loral documents underscore the risks of the Clinton
administration's policy of promoting the transfer of sophisticated
U.S. technology to countries like China at the same time as trying
to prevent that technology from being used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   That policy has now come under broad congressional review, while
there are also federal investigations into testimony about
surreptitious contributions to the Democratic Party by the Chinese
military through a China Aerospace executive, and into campaign
contributions to the party from Loral's chairman, Bernard Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the Chinese, Lim said he felt ``truly honored
for having been asked'' to head the review team and noted that an
important goal of the review was ``using this failure as an
opportunity to ensure that the Long March launch vehicles have the
best reliable record in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lim added, ``We, at Space Systems/Loral would like China Great
Wall to be a strong supplier of launch services and we will do
everything in our power to help you.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, to an important business partner, offered other
expressions of encouragement as well, including Lim's confidence
``that your company will take their share of the world market for
satellite launch services.''
</P>
<P>
   A week and a half earlier, in a strategy report, Lim had
outlined four objectives for the review team, including
recommending to China Aerospace and its launching subsidiary, China
Great Wall, ``any other areas of improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Before writing that outline, Lim had received a security
briefing by Loral officials instructing him on what kinds of
information the Chinese could receive, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ground rules imposed by the U.S. government on Loral,
the company was allowed to help the Chinese mount its satellite on
the Chinese rocket. But the company, according to its written
briefing, was forbidden to disclose ``launch vehicle/satellite
detail design'' or ``information that will enhance the launch site
facilities or launch vehicle/mission capabilities'' of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his role in the technical review, Lim, who now heads
the technology and development arm of Hughes Space and
Communications Co. in Southern California, is the central figure in
the Justice Department's criminal investigation into whether Loral
and Hughes, whose scientists also worked on the review, illegally
transmitted information to the Chinese that may have helped its
missile program.
</P>
<P>
   According to a confidential 21-page letter by Loral's lawyers to
the State Department in June 1996, Loral acknowledged that the
company should have asked the State Department to approve the
activities of its review team, calling it ``a serious mistake'' not
to have done so.
</P>
<P>
   The letter stated that ``it is not clear there was any
violation'' of law because of the transfer of technical data to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   It also acknowledged that the issue of whether illegal
assistance was given to the Chinese in the ``testing, manufacture
or repair'' of the rocket ``is more problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   What was also problematic was the way in which the report by
Lim's review team made its way to the Chinese, according to the
confidential letter.
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, 1996, Lim approved a press release by the Chinese
anticipating the release of his team's report four days later.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Nick Yen, an aide to Lim, faxed a draft
version of the report to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, Lim apparently got cold feet. He decided to
seek the approval of Loral's general counsel, Julie Bannerman,
before sending the Chinese the final version of his report.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Bannerman read the report, she ``became concerned that
export control laws had not been properly considered,'' and asked
Loral's expert outside counsel for advice, the Loral letter said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she tried to block the transmission of Lim's report
from Loral's Beijing office to the Chinese on the morning of May
10, she was too late. It had been faxed to the Chinese one hour
before _ by Yen, but with a cover letter written by Lim.
</P>
<P>
   Lim declined to be interviewed. But his lawyer, George Newhouse,
declared that his client is innocent of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a nice man, a quiet, low-key individual, a scientist,
not a lawyer or an expert in export-control laws,'' Newhouse said.
``And now he finds himself in the eye of the hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Gerald Solomon suggests there may be more to it. The
New York Republican and chairman of the House Rules Committee wrote
Defense Secretary William Cohen asking 22 questions about whether
the scientist was properly given security clearances or was a
security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Lim's lawyer took exception to the insinuation that his client
compromised U.S. national security _ either intentionally or
unintentionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a spy,'' said Newhouse. ``He is a 100 percent
red-blooded American. To suggest he would betray his country or do
anything in any way to damage American national security interests
is not only wrong but offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse declined to discuss any of the specifics of the current
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lim was born in China to a landed, Catholic anti-communist
family. At the age of 4, he fled with his family to Singapore after
the communists took power.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, his father became an investment banker and the
family enjoyed a comfortable life. Lim majored in physics at the
University of Singapore in 1967, and came to the United States on a
Fulbright scholarship, getting a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from
the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Like other scientists, Lim advanced by moving throughout the
aerospace and defense industries. From 1973 to 1982 he managed the
group at Honeywell, Inc., that successfully introduced the
ring-laser gyroscope for commercial airlines.
</P>
<P>
   For the next seven years, he was responsible for the development
of advanced guidance and navigation systems for strategic missiles
at Northrop Grumman Corp. Until early 1997, he was senior vice
president of technology and operations at Loral, when he left to
work for Hughes.

   The fate of Lim rests, at least in part, on interpretations of
technical information understood best by rocket scientists like
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Loral says that it was simply trying to help the insurance
companies assess whether China's own inquiry into the accident had
reached the correct conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But federal officials have said that Lim's review team went
beyond confirming to the Chinese what the problem was and gave them
insights into the cause of the explosion and the way to prevent
future accidents.

CITY COUNCIL APPROVES BUDGET WITHOUT MAYOR'S AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Except for huge personal income tax cuts, the $34.08
billion budget that the City Council passed Friday _ the first in
the city's history that was approved without the agreement of the
mayor _ included relatively modest changes from a plan Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani proposed only weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic-controlled council made the tax cut the highlight
of the budget _ which passed 43-7 _ slashing $201 million next
fiscal year and more than $500 million in the years after that.
</P>
<P>
   Budget experts said that the greatest impact of the council's
plan will be on the city's long-term fiscal condition, because the
tax cuts would permanently eliminate a significant source of
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the council's plan would hurt the city's health
into the new millennium because it would widen the gap between
revenues and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But Speaker Peter Vallone trumpeted many of the changes that the
council at his urging, implemented for the new fiscal year, which
begins on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up a battered wooden seat from a public school, Vallone
said he thought it was more important to replace students' chairs
``than worrying about where and what kind of seats we're going to
have and what kind of luxury boxes we're going to have in Yankee
Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   The council's plan added $4 million to buy furniture for public
schools. The council also increased appropriations for a host of
other agencies, including $22 million for libraries, $28 million
for the Administration for Children's Services, $18 million for
cultural affairs, $7.6 million for parks and about $5.5 million
each for city hospitals and for the Department of Housing
Preservation and Development.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate budget for capital projects, the city would borrow
$100 million to buy gas furnaces for public schools with coal
furnaces. To finance that project, the council killed several of
the mayor's capital projects, including a $65 million contribution
to the privately owned Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   However, the budget could change over the next few weeks. While
the mayor can veto part or all of the spending plan the Council
approved, Vallone demonstrated Friday that he clearly had the
support to override a veto, an action that would require a
two-thirds vote of the council's 51 members.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani has also said he is prepared to impound city funds,
if necessary, to block the council budget, a move that would likely
end up pitting the two sides against one another in court.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday night, just hours after council members gathered to cheer
their new budget in the City Hall rotunda, Giuliani showed how his
mayoral powers can throw the council's plan in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Under the City Charter, the mayor reveals what the city can
expect in non-property tax revenues only after the council adopts a
budget. Essentially, that means that the mayor can determine how
much money the city will have to spend next year. In its budget,
the council was forced to use tax revenue estimates that the mayor
included in a plan he proposed a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the mayor announced that he expected the city to
receive less in taxes than he had anticipated a month ago, a move
that could force the council to agree to spending cuts or to raise
the property tax, the one tax it controls.
</P>
<P>
   Council officials accused the mayor of acting purely out of
political vindictiveness, adding that all government fiscal
monitors reported that they expected higher tax revenues than the
mayor predicted last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the mayor reduces revenues _ contrary to what the city
comptroller and the state comptroller and the other monitors say _
he's putting the city at fiscal risk,'' said Bruce Bender,
Vallone's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has trained his criticism at the plan's long-term
impact. City spending is growing faster than revenues, and Giuliani
said the council's budget means widening deficits by more than $2.2
billion in the years 2000 to 2002. He added that the council had
tried to cover those future gaps through an unrealistically rosy
prediction of the tax revenues the city will collect through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``This assumes that Wall Street continues to function precisely
the way it is and grows over the next three to four years,'' the
mayor said, ``that there is no drop, that for the first time in the
history of Wall Street or America, there will be no downturn in our
economy at all, at any time in the next three to four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This newest thing that they've done, where they just start
pulling revenues out of the air on the assumption that the economy
is going to continue to grow at record levels, is a highly
irresponsible thing to do,'' Giuliani added in a news conference,
clutching at the air with his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hevesi, the city comptroller, said the council's plan would
increase the deficits, but by about $767 million.
</P>
<P>
   Council officials said future deficits would actually shrink
under their plan.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Criscitello, director of the city's Independent Budget
Office, said that, except for the personal income tax cuts, the
council's plan hewed to Giuliani's proposal from a month earlier.
The council's budget calls for about $49 million less in spending
than the mayor's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a huge departure from what the mayor proposed,''
Criscitello said. ``It's close to what a negotiated budget would
look like if negotiations had occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   The council's budget drew praise from many lobbyists and
advocates who have been milling inside City Hall this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The council should be commended for their first budget, which
clearly puts children first and encourages working families to work
and raise their children in New York City,'' said Rose Anello,
associate executive director of the Citizens' Committee for
Children. ``It enhances programs that support family life, like
after-school programs that will enable working parents to work and
not worry about their children.''

   NEW YORK _ With the Florida Marlins in town to play the Yankees,
Orlando Hernandez has had a chance to spend time with his younger
half-brother, Livan Hernandez, who made his own mark as a starting
pitcher last year in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about everything, but not much baseball,'' Livan
Hernandez said Friday. He arrived in New York early enough on
Wednesday night to see Orlando pitch the final two innings of his
winning major league debut.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Hernandez will make his second start in the place of
David Cone on Tuesday in Montreal, if Cone's cut right index finger
has not sufficiently healed by then.

VOTERS CHALLENGED TO PROVE RESIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN BEACH, N.Y. _ This Fire Island summer colony is often
called the ``Land of No'' for its many rules and regulations,
including some banning beach Frisbees, shirtless men and drinking
on walkways.
</P>
<P>
   But when voters went to the polls Friday, they confronted a rule
of an entirely different sort.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, Paul Pugliese, had people placed in the polling place
to ask voters to swear that they met all residency requirements
before they entered the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   Pugliese has asserted that owners of village businesses, intent
on denying him a second four-year term, schemed to register
waitresses, busboys, shop workers, landscapers and other seasonal
employees as voters. He said many of the employees used bogus
addresses to satisfy the 30-day residency requirement called for
under state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fraud,'' said Pugliese, who was standing Friday outside
the boathouse that serves as the polling place. ``These people
don't live here, they don't sleep here, and some of them have
probably never even been here.''
</P>
<P>
   By midday Friday, no voters who were challenged had refused to
take the oath. But leaders of an opposing village party, the Unity
Party, accused Pugliese of trying to intimidate voters, an
assertion he denied.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents said they were especially angered because Pugliese
had been warning voters that the penalty for lying on registration
forms or in oaths was a fine of up to $5,000 or four years in jail,
or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Land of No' has become the `Land of No Voting,''' said
Andrew Miller, a village trustee who is a member of the Unity
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Pugliese, 56, a retired Time magazine cartographer who is a
village homeowner but also has a home in another Long Island
community, Dix Hills, angered opponents last week when the leader
of his New Community Party, Jon Marin, filed suit challenging the
registration of more than 100 voters.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Jack Cannavo of state Supreme Court in Central Islip on
Wednesday removed from the case all but 14 of the voters named
because Pugliese and his supporters had not served them with
summonses. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the New York state Board of Elections, Lee
Daghlian, said election law did not strictly define residency. He
said that Pugliese was right in saying state law provided for
penalties against people who falsely swore they were residents, but
added that he had never heard of anyone being fined or jailed for
lying on a registration form or in an oath.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hirsch, a lawyer and owner of the Island Mermaid
restaurant, said the seasonal employees and business owners
challenged by Pugliese had the same right to vote as Pugliese and
others who had homes in Ocean Beach but didn't live there year
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nobody on their list who isn't qualified to vote,''
Hirsch said. He said many of the voters Pugliese was challenging
were registered in the village four years ago, when many business
owners supported his bid to become mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Beach, a half-square-mile of Atlantic oceanfront, shops,
restaurants and tightly clustered bungalows, has fewer than 150
year-round residents but about 750 registered voters. That is still
a small fraction of the more than 10,000 summer residents.
</P>
<P>
   In challenging the voters, Pugliese said he was trying to
protect Ocean Beach from the ``rowdiness'' brought in by the day
trippers whose patronage is sought by many of the business owners
who oppose him.
</P>
<P>
   But his detractors, who favor a village trustee, Natalie Katz
Rogers, for mayor, called him a weak administrator with a penchant
for enforcing picayune rules, particularly against village
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's part of an old guard that is so inflexible and thinks if
it didn't invent something it doesn't exist,'' said Brenda Ruello,
the owner of an Ocean Beach landscaping business, Pistils and Peat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ruello, who spends her summers in Ocean Beach but also has a
home in New York City, is one of the remaining defendants in the
voting suit. She voted Friday after a formal challenge from members
of Pugliese's party.

STATUS OF THREE COWBOYS VETERANS VARIES, JONES SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said yesterday that
defensive end Tony Tolbert's status is more of a health issue than
a financial one.
</P>
<P>
   However, the free-agent status of popular veteran safety Bill
Bates and running back Herschel Walker are vastly different, Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones expects decisions on the players' futures to be made
during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert, who will count $3,447,000 against this season's salary
cap, underwent surgery on both knees a few weeks ago. Jones said if
Tolbert can regain his health completely, is cleared to play by
doctors and wants to play, then ``his contract is not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he's under the impression the surgery could heal
Tolbert's knees for the first time in a couple of years. The
Cowboys had believed that Tolbert, a Pro Bowl selection in 1996 who
was reduced to a part-time player due to his knees, had chronic
knee problems that were beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert said he will make an evaluation in the best interest of
his career and his family when he gets healthy. He said he's solely
concentrating on getting healthy right now.
</P>
<P>
   Time, however, is also an issue, Jones said. He said he expects
to know something before training camp.
</P>
<P>
   If the health issue is not resolved by then, the Cowboys could
save close to $2 million on the salary cap if they release Tolbert
or he retires. The Cowboys could also try to sign him to a lowered
salary if they believe he can contribute at some point during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the question with Walker is whether the running back
wants to play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily our decision,'' Jones said. ``He will
decide if he wants to play or not. It really is Herschel's call.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bates, who is looking to play a team record 16th season
with the Cowboys, does not control his own fate.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the team will decide during training camp Bates'
future based on the progress made by current players at filling
Bates' role in the nickel defense and on special teams.
