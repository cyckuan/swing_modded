<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 3 (Xinhua) -- President of Kyrgyzstan Askar
Akayev said one of the major tasks facing the Central Asian
Economic Union in 1998 is to set up a free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Interfax news agency Saturday, Akayev,
chairman of the union, also reviewed the union's achievements in
1997. He noted the Central-Asia Cooperation Development Bank, a
subordinate of the union, carried out a series of successful
investment projects.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, he added, the union will strive to establish a free
trade zone in order to increase the trade volume by
one to two percent among its member countries.
</P>
<P>
But Akayev cautioned the success of the project will
depend on the will of the region's leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Central Asian Economic Union, set up in 1994, grouping
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, aims to strengthen
cooperation in culture, science, technology, economy and trade
within the region.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Cabinet Approves New Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of Zimbabwe's
economic reform program is set to begin in earnest this year
following the recent approval by cabinet of the blue print
outlining strategies for achieving macro-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
The much-awaited Zimbabwe Program for Economic and Social
Transformation (ZIMPREST) document was drawn up with the
involvement of the private sector, first for the government to
consult with non-policy makers on such a crucial national
document.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said here today the ZIMPREST
document had been accepted by the cabinet during a recent
meeting.
</P>
<P>
''The ZIMPREST has been approved now and later this month, the
document will be discussed at a meeting of the National Economic
Consultative Forum,'' the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The forum comprises representatives of the private and public
sectors and was established along the lines of Malaysia's smart
partnership concept.
</P>
<P>
A successor of the five-year Economic Structural Adjustment
Program (ESAP) concluded in 1995, the ZIMPREST has three key
elements for achieving macro-economic targets.
</P>
<P>
The five-year program seeks a consistent reduction in the
budget deficit to 2.9 percent by the year 2000 from the current
eight percent.
</P>
<P>
A continuous growth in exports is also envisaged and with
sustained improvement investment performance.
</P>
<P>
While ESAP resulted in heavy job losses and social suffering,
the ZIMPREST aims to reduce poverty, create more jobs and
restrict government's role in the economy to merely facilitative
rather than controlling.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said logistics for the implementation of the program
were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
The ZIMPREST also seeks to achieve some targets missed by its
predecessor, namely a sustainable Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth rate of five percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
Funding for critical balance of payments under the ZIMPREST
has been promised to the tune of one billion Zimbabwe dollars
(about 60 million U.S. Dollars) by the European Union,
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Observe Turkey-Israel-US War Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today announced it will
observe the upcoming military exercises in the Mediterranean which
involve navies from Turkey, Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Acting Minister of State for Information Affairs Nasser Lawzi
said after a cabinet meeting today that Jordan made the decision
in response to an official invitation from Turkey to observe the
one-day war game off the coast of Israel on January 7.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hasn't decided on the exact size of the observers'
body and will later announce a list of observers and their ranks,
said Lawzi, who is also minister of public works and housing.
</P>
<P>
The controversial three-way navy drills, which have been put
off twice, sparked harsh criticism from the Arab world because
they were widely believed to target Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey signed two military cooperation agreements with Israel
in 1996, which annoyed its Arab neighbors. Egypt, Syria and Iraq
are spearheading an Arab campaign against the growing military
alliance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was the only country in the region to be invited by
Turkey to send observers to the exercises, and was under pressure
from its Arab brothers not to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish leadership has time and again explained that the
war game involving five ships, a number of helicopters and search
planes, was "merely rescue and search exercises...for humanitarian
purposes only." But the Arabs seemed not convinced.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed peace with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, Israel and Turkey are all beneficiaries of U.S. aids in
recent years and are believed to be firm allies of the U.S., which
endeavors to secure its vital economic interests in the region.

<HEADLINE> Top UK Companies Outperform Smaller Ones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) - The largest 100 British companies
significantly outperformed medium-sized groups last year, said a
survey by FTSE International and the Frank Russell group of
consultants.
</P>
<P>
The survey released here today was established to chart the
performance of FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies according to two
classifications: value stocks with a low share price to book
value, and growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
The research said the average difference in total returns
achieved by the 100 largest companies in the growth category and
their medium-sized counterparts was 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
In the year as a whole, the 100 biggest growth companies
returned almost 29 percent while the 250 medium-sized companies
returned 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the value category the 100 largest companies returned 28
percent and the medium-sized companies 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Ayers, an adviser to the Frank Russell company, said:
"The purpose of the indices is to provide an appropriate measure
for investors to judge those managers."
</P>
<P>
The figures highlight the difference between large and
medium-sized companies. The study showed that value beat growth in
the lower performing medium-sized sector by 2.7 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Moi's Victory to Be Declared Soon: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The victory of incumbent
President Daniel arap Moi, who has garnered more than enough
votes for returning to power, will be declared "very soon", an
official with the Electoral Commission (EC) told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
A swearing-in ceremony will come as soon as the EC announces
the final results, which will happen "at any time from now but
most likely on Sunday or Monday," said the official.
</P>
<P>
As the counting draws to an end, Moi is heading the poll with
half a million votes more than his closest challenger, Democratic
Party's Mwai Kibaki and has got more than 25 percent of the votes
in five out of the country's eight provinces, meeting all
requirements by law for a qualified head of state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, EC Chairman Samuel Kivuitu said despite chaos
and delays caused by bad weather and technical problems on
Election Day (Monday), "the exercise was executed successfully"
with "no breach of the law."
</P>
<P>
The polling had to be extended and ended on Tuesday due to a
late start, and, as the results of Moi's possible win, two
leading opposition parties had asked for a re-run, saying the
voting was rigged.
</P>
<P>
In response, the EC said the poll should be accepted because
it was carried out peacefully with high turn-out and the fact
that "there are no percentages of voters who have been denied a
chance to cast the votes."
</P>
<P>
"It is noted that (the turn-out of voters) in the majority of
the constituencies recorded between 65 percent and 85 percent,"
much higher than the level in the last elections five years ago,
said Kivuitu.
</P>
<P>
Among 151 out of 210 constituencies in the country where the
counting wound up, Baringo North in Moi's power base Rift Valley
Province saw the highest turnout with 96.40 percent and Kisauni
the lowest, which also hit 42.78 percent, up from 1992's 40.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 9,031,141 registered Kenyan voters were expected to
to elect one president, 210 parliamentary members and 2,955 local
councillors for the next five years starting from 1998.

<HEADLINE> No Provision in Kenyan Laws to Repeat Elections: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) today said there was no provision in the
Kenyan laws for the Opposition to direct the Electoral Commission
to conduct a repeat election.
</P>
<P>
This was said by an official of KANU headquarters at a press
conference today in response to the demand by two opposition
parties to repeat the 1997 General Election.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Democratic Party (DP) and National Development
Party (NDP) yesterday rejected the provisional results of the
General Election and demanded a repeat of the presidential
election within 21 days.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, DP presidential candidate Mwai Kibaki and his
counterpart Raila Odinga of NDP said that incumbent President
Daniel arap Moi had "desperately manipulated" the Electoral
Commission to rig the election in his favor.
</P>
<P>
The KANU official said the allegations made by the two
opposition leaders that KANU has been involved in manipulation of
the elections "have no basis at all".
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the intentions of such charge against KANU
was designed to "cover up their own malpractices in the elections
process including their violence proned behavior".
</P>
<P>
Senior KANU official Bonaya Godana told the press conference
that it was Kibaki who had "made elections rigging his pet topic"
since the process of counting votes began in various parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Kibaki's supporters violently blocked KANU
agents from entering into polling and counting centers to perform
their duties in Nakuru, Naivasha, Molo, Subukia, Mathioya and
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki's agents in Siakago, South Mugirango and Mwala were
arrested with presidential ballot papers "all marked in favor of
Mr. Kibaki", he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper of East African Standard today reported
that opposition party Safina yesterday accepted the outcome of
the just ended General Election, saying that it was nonsensical
to seek nullification of the polls.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Ford-Kenya also reportedly said yesterday that it
was so far satisfied with the provisional results of the General
Election which had been officially announced by the Electoral
Commission.

<HEADLINE> French Government Takes Measures to Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The French government Saturday
announced several emergency measures to support the jobless
people, including sending an additional 500 million franc (84
million U.S. dollars) unemployment aid package.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry said at a
press conference that the government will present a law on helping
unemployed people before Summer this year, in which a series of
measures will be taken in the fields of housing, health care and
school.
</P>
<P>
She also promised to continue holding talks with unions and
anti-unemployment associations on the terms to be adopted by the
government in favor of jobless people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government ordered the local governments in
prefectures to solve case by case the job problems of people
living in distress, and asked them to maintain "emergency cells"
responsible for tackling unemployment.
</P>
<P>
France's unemployment rate now stands at 12.4 percent, which
means that 3,114,600 people among France's working age population
are without jobs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 36.89 percent of these people have been seeking jobs
for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployed people staged a series of protests from Christmas
through New Year festival by occupying the offices of government
agencies in charge of unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
Since these emergency cells were set up by the end of December,
2,000 cases of jobless people in distress have been reviewed and
700 of them have been given "positive responses" on finding a job,
said the government.
</P>
<P>
The government said that the number of jobs offered increased
by 20 percent from November 1996 to November 1997, while the
number of lay-offs decreased by 17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Poll Acceptable: Independent Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The second multi-party poll in
Kenya was conducted basically free and fair and its results
should be accepted by all Kenyans, three main independent
observer organizations said today.
</P>
<P>
Although the final results are yet to come in, it is fully
clear that incumbent President Daniel arap Moi will be the winner
by taking an assailable lead in total votes collected and
reaching standards under law for a qualified president.
</P>
<P>
The "results do on the whole reflect the wishes of the Kenyan
voters and should be accepted in total," said the Institute for
Education in Democracy, the Catholic Justice and Peace Commission
and the National Council of Churches of Kenya in a document
issued jointly today.
</P>
<P>
The eight-page document was based on reports from 840 campaign
and nomination process monitors and 28,126 poll observers the
three bodies jointly sent out across this eastern African country
on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The voting process was generally handled well by polling
station officials, and closely scrutinized by party agents and
poll watchers," it commented.
</P>
<P>
"The vote count, while quite chaotic and slow," said the
document, "was also closely scrutinized by party agents and
observers, and appears to have been largely carried out
satisfactorily."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Democratic Party (DP) and National Development Party
(NDP), two most prominent opposition parties in Kenya, said they
would reject Moi's win, asking a repeat of the poll which they
accused of being rigged with general chaos and delays.
</P>
<P>
But they failed to reveal their further plans, if they had
any, in case of Moi's swearing-in, which is said to come as soon
as the official results is announced.
</P>
<P>
In response to the threat voiced by DP and NDP to reject the
polling results, the government has warned that the police would
"deal swiftly and firmly" with anyone who tried to disturb the
peace.
</P>
<P>
Latest results showed that so far Moi has garnered over 2.2
million votes, half a million more than his closest challenger,
DP Chairman Mwai Kibaki. NDP's leader Raila Odinga takes the
third place far behind.
</P>
<P>
Moi, 73 and taking power sine 1978, has also managed 73
percent of the vote in Rift Valley and North Eastern provinces,
46 percent in Western Province, 42.3 percent in Coast, 41 percent
in Eastern and 26 Percent in Nyanza. Only Nairobi and Central
Province continue to elude Moi.
</P>
<P>
Under Kenya's current constitution, the candidate who wins the
highest total and no less than 25 percent of the votes in at
least five of Kenya's eight provinces can be qualified as a
president.
</P>
<P>
So far Kibaki has received 1.7 million votes countrywide and
has managed 25 percent of the vote only in three provinces --
Nairobi (44 percent), Central (89 percent) and Eastern (26
percent).
</P>
<P>
While, Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) has
won 102 parliamentary seats, followed by DP with 35 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission (EC) said today it could not announce
the official results unless vote counting is finished in all
constituencies.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Food Supply Situation Under Assessment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP) plan to
assess Tanzania's food supply situation in the 1997/98 crop
season.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by FAO here today said that the assessment
is aimed at evaluating the prospect for this year's long rains
season and estimating the imports requirement, including food
aid.
</P>
<P>
The FAO will also assist the Ministry of Agriculture and
co-operatives in developing a credible intervention strategy for
future drought mitigation in the east African country, according
to the statement.
</P>
<P>
In a recent meeting with FAO's new representative in Tanzania,
Sulayman Sait M'boob, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye expressed
appreciation of the international organization's assistance to
the country, especially in food production.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.4 million people are facing food shortage after a
severe drought hit Tanzania last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the FAO provided Tanzania with emergency assistance
fund totaling 2.65 million U.S. Dollars for drought relief and
livestock disease control.
</P>
<P>
Food situation in Tanzania, with a population of 30 million,
may become worse after devastating floods starting from last
December swept most parts of the country. Meterological
departments predicted that the above average seasonal rains
linked to El Nino weather phenomenon will last till April.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 60,000 tons of
fertilizers is being delivered to ethiopia's hinterland as part
of the effort to supply farmers in Oromiya and south Ethiopian
regions with farm inputs in the coming harvest seasons.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the Agricultural Inputs Supply
Enterprise of Ethiopia in a statement today.

remaining amount needed for the big rainy season will be
delivered at 40 distribution stations.
</P>
<P>
There are two rainy or harvest seasons in Ethiopia. The small
rainy season from February to May produces about 10 percent of

<HEADLINE> Mordachai on Israeli Withdrawal from South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordachai has said Israeli troops can withdraw from Lebanon after
an interim security arrangement is in place, Lebanon's Orient
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, Mordachai told the Lebanese magazine
Arab Nation that Israeli government is ready to implement the
United Nations Resolution 425 which demands Israeli unconditional
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to reach an interim security agreement with
Lebanon under the support of Syria although it isn't put in the
framework of comprehensive peace accord," Mordachai said, quoted
by magazine in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The interim agreement he proposed will be able to put an end to
the circles of violence in south Lebanon and mark a positive step
toward building up trust and overcoming obstacles in the course of
reviving negotiations between Israel and Syria and Lebanon, he
added.
</P>
<P>
But the radio did not say when and in what circumstances the
Israeli defense minister made the remarks.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 2,000-strong Israeli troops have been occupying a
1,200-square-kilometer tract in south Lebanon since 1985. The
Israeli self-styled security zone was carved with the claimed aim
of preventing its residents in the north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, the growing casualties of Israeli soldiers in the
area, which last year registered 39 dead and 95 wounded, gave
momentum to the call for an unconditional withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister stressed that the agreement he proposed
should include a halt of military operations against Israel
staged from Lebanese territory and disband of resistance groups.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, he added, the South Lebanese Army,
Israeli militia ally controlling Lebanon's predominantly Christian
town of Jezzine, must be guaranteed to be safe if Israelis exit
and the Lebanese government army should be deployed across the
south.
</P>
<P>
If needed, he said, an international forces can be called in to
take part in the peacekeeping mission in the border area.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Second City Hit by Fuel Scarcity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's second largest
town Dire Dawa has been hit by a fuel scarcity since last week,
the Ethiopian News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted residents of the town as complaining that
they have been unable to get fuel from depots since last week,
while the price of kerosine has doubled.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Trade, Transport, Industry and Tourism in the
town administration said it is exerting efforts to transport fuel
by train as the scarcity occurred because of the damage to the
road from the petroleum depot in Djibuoti to Dire Dawa.
</P>
<P>
The road authority is now speeding up the maintenance of the
220-Kilometer Dire Dawa -- Djibuoti road, the report said.

<HEADLINE> 18 Nabbed by Turkish Police for Illegal Emigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen people were nabbed by
Turkish police today in the Euro-Asian city of Istanbul in a truck
loaded with rubber tires as they attempted to illegally emigrate
to Italy, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish security teams staged a raid and captured these people,
most of them from southeastern Turkey, hidden in the truck that
was about to be loaded onto a ship bound for Italy, according to
the news agency.
</P>
<P>
It said these people claimed they wanted to go to Germany via
Italy in a bid to seek asylum.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Italy traded accusations on Friday over the influx
of Kurdish refugees into southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italian Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano urged Turkey to
prevent further ships leaving Turkey with refugees, according to
the Turkish Daily News today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Napolitano rejected Ankara's call for Italy
to refuse asylum to Kurdish immigrants and to send them back.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Interior Minister Murat Basesgioglu said
that the number of people embarking on the dangerous sea voyages
to European countries has increased as a result of Rome's offer of
asylum to those refugees.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the Turkish vessel Ararat with 800 Kurdish
refugees on board ran aground near Catanzaro, Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish interior minister said Turkey had taken measures
on its borders and was negotiating with the Italian authorities
to resolve the problem, adding that Turkey was ready to welcome
back Turkish citizens.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that around 2,000 Kurdish refugees had arrived
in Italy's Adriatic coast since September. Italy expatriated about
38,500 illegal immigrants in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Leone Peace Process Remains in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- It seems that the arrival of the
new year will not bring anything favorable to the improvement in
the situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Instead, heavy fightings between forces of the military junta
in power and the traditional hunters known as Kamajors continuing
at the turn of the year have further stalled the peace process
scheduled to end this April.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting between the two sides erupted Friday in a
southeastern town, forcing civilians in the area to flee for
refuge in neighboring Liberia about 20 miles away.
</P>
<P>
The two-hour fighting, coupled with heavy artillery exchanges,
also claimed the lives of several junta soldiers, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
It said reinforcements of the Kamajors were seen this
afternoon heading toward another town occupied by the junta
forces, which, according to analysts here, signified that
fighting had escalated in the troubled west African country.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors started to fight against the junta since the coup
in May last year in an effort to restore ousted president Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Temporary cease-fire was reached after the junta signed a
peace accord with west African countries in Conakry, Guinea five
months following the coup.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, all combatants in Sierra Leone should be
disarmed and demobilized in a process scheduled to begin from
December 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
But the Kamajors refused to put down their weapons, saying
that they were legal civil defense group approved by Kabbah,
while the junta did the same with claims that its troops belonged
to the country's legitimate armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary United Front, which has fought successive
governments since early 1990s and allied with the junta forces in
the wake of the coup, said they were part of the national army
and could not be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
As steps that further breached the Conakry accord, the junta
leader, Johnny Paul Koroma who was on Christmas eve promoted from
the rank of major to lieutenant-colonel, has said the delay of
disarmament and arrival of promised international relief aids
would make it unrealistic to return power to Kabbah on schedule.
</P>
<P>
According to the peace plan, the junta will hand over power to
Kabbah in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Koroma's intention to extend his stay in power got
reinforcements when the junta announced its first budget a few
days ago.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Joe Amaru-Bangali of the junta reportedly
projected revenue at 6.5 billion Leone (about 7.1 million U.S.
Dollars based on price in early 1996).
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that only one billion Leone could be realized
due to the economic sanctions imposed by west African countries
and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions had caused shortage of consumer goods, including
food items and fuel, which, the minister decried, has
"aggravated" the cost of living in the country, although the
junta was still importing some goods.
</P>
<P>
As observers are being upset by these happenings with fear
that peace is remote in Sierra Leone, the west African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG has vowed to resolve the
crisis there in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his new year's message to his soldiers in Monrovia, capital
of Liberia, ECOMOG force commander Major-General Victor Malu told
them to see 1998 as a year to extend final peace and stability in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has helped end Liberia's seven-year-old bloody civil
war and created a safe environment for the country's successful
general election to make Charles Taylor the first post-war
president.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, the achievement of ECOMOG in Liberia should
be something that can be done in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
It appears that Malu's promise partly proves the grave concern
of the international community over the deadlocked situation in
that country.

WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- American balloonist Steve
Fossett was over Bulgaria Sunday in his bid to circle the globe
non-stop, and was expected to avoid Libyan airspace despite a
last-minute green light from Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Fossett had crossed Romania and was flying south along the
western edge of the Black Sea at 1020 GMT, according to a
statement from his team in St. Louis, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
He was traveling at about 40 kilometers per hour at an altitude
of 6,500 meters in clear skies.
</P>
<P>
He was projected to travel east along the southern coast of the
Black Sea and the northern edge of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Fossett left St. Louis on New Year's Eve on his third bid to
make aviation history.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving on this current expedition, Fossett got
permission from 44 countries to enter their airspace.
</P>
<P>
Fossett rode the edge of a polar jet stream over the Atlantic
to attain a top speed of about 220 kilometers an hour at an
altitude higher than 7,000 meters.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants to Resume Talks with Syria: Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel wants to resume peace
negotiations with Syria without preconditions and on the basis of
the U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, according to
diplomatic sources here today.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a message from the Israeli government
conveyed to Syrian officials by visiting U.S. Senator Arlen
Specter, who is also chairman of the Security Affairs Committee of
the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the Israeli government also showed its
readiness to take into consideration the ideas that the Syrian
side had come to with the previous Israeli government, provided
that such ideas would not be binding.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations should be

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Urges Further Reforms in Railway Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
today called on the country's railway industry to accelerate the
pace of reforms.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the call in his letter to a national conference
attended by leading officials from local railway administrations
across China.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, he asked local railway authorities to separate
the functions of the government and railway enterprises, to reduce
the staff to improve the efficiency, to turn from incurring losses
to making profits, and to strengthen the management.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Ministry of Railways, the
industry made substantial progress in 1997, when the speed of
trains were raised and a computerized-booking network was put into
operation.
</P>
<P>
The drastical declination of the railway transport volume in the
country was curbed last year.
</P>
<P>
China has planned to have 68,000 kilometers of railways in
operation by the end of 2000, of which, 32 percent are
double-tracked and 24 percent electrified.

<HEADLINE> HK's ECIC Raises Contingent Liability for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Export Credit
Insurance Corporation (ECIC) announced Sunday that it has
increased its contingent liability by more than 30 percent in an
effort to further expand its business capacity and increase its
protection to local exporters.
</P>
<P>
The contingent liability of the ECIC has been increased from
7.5 billion HK dollars (about one billion U.S. dollars) to 10
billion HK dollars (1.28 billion U.S. dollars) with effect from
December 19, 1997, Thomas Yiu, the ECIC Commissioner said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The ECIC Ordinance ruled that the aggregate maximum liability,
the maximum amount which the ECIC is contractually liable to
indemnify its policyholders of all risks if materializing at the
same time, must not exceed its contingent liability.
</P>
<P>
Yiu said that the insured business of the ECIC has maintained a
satisfactory and steady growth over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
"In view of our increased marketing efforts and growing demand
for our services, we see the need to raise the contingent
liability to cope with expected business growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the increase in our business capacity
certainly means more exporters will be able to capture more export
orders with the help of our export insurance services," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yiu pointed out that the new contingent liability ceiling is
also aimed at meeting ECIC's strategic plan in diversifying its
business, particularly in developing its Small and Medium
Enterprises Policy and policies for services industries.
</P>
<P>
Also, a higher contingent liability limit will allow the ECIC
to expand to medium-term covers, for example in the export of
capital goods which requires longer terms of credit, should the
demand for such services be established, Yiu said.
</P>
<P>
The ECIC, founded in 1966, is the only credit insurer in Hong
Kong which provides insurance to exporters against the risks of
non-payment for export of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The ECIC is a government-owned organization with all its
liabilities being guaranteed by the government.

<HEADLINE> Reason Unknown for Power Outage in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Investigators have not found the
exact reason for Saturday's blackout on the entire Luzon, one of
the three main islands of the country, the Philippines News Agency
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The National Power Corporation (NPC) and the Manila Electric
Company (Meralco) are still "in the dark" and at dispute as to
what has caused the wide blackout that hit Metro Manila and the
whole of the Luzon grid, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Even when both parties have agreed that a Meralco post which
tilted a 115 kv transmission line in Binan, Luguna province,
triggered the outage, questions remain to be answered as to why it
has taken almost 12 hours to restore power in all the affected
areas.
</P>
<P>
The outage started at 1:36 p.m. and NPC officials confirmed it
was fully restored at about 1 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
NPC said the trouble started when the Meralco post hit the 115
kv transmission line, adding that the failure of the circuit
breaker to respond immediately allowed the trouble to cascade,
thereby leading to the automatic tripping of eight power plants.
</P>
<P>
However, Meralco's system operations head Fortunato Leynes said
it was a very small portion of the total system network which
could have been isolated immediately by NPC's circuit breaker.
</P>
<P>
"The upper portion of that particular Meralco post burned due
to still unknown reason, thereby tilting the 115 kv transmission
line it was supporting," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China Expands Cooperation with ASEAN (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China and the nine nations in
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) made
substantial progress in developing good-neighborly ties and
friendly cooperation in the political, economic, cultural and
international affairs arenas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement issued by the People's Republic of China
and ASEAN following the recent Sino-ASEAN informal summit in Kuala
Lumpur has shown that the Sino-ASEAN relations has
entered into a new stage.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement has not only outlined the principles
guiding the relations between the two sides, but also clearly
delineated that the common goal of the two sides is to establish a
good-neighborly partnership of mutual trust geared to the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which celebrated its 30th anniversary last August,
consists of nine nations which are neighbors of China. Developing a
good-neighborly partnership with ASEAN based on mutual trust is an
important component of China's foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Shi Yongming, an associate researcher with the China Institute
of International Studies, said China is a vast country neighboring
with most of the ASEAN nations and it is significant for both
sides to expand the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have maintained frequent high-level contacts since
China became a consulting partner with ASEAN in 1991. Qian
Qichen, China's foreign minister, has since attended the annual
ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference (PMC).
</P>
<P>
China became a country in full dialog with ASEAN in July 1996,
opening broad prospects for further cooperation between China and
ASEAN at an even higher level.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have consistently conducted fruitful economic
cooperation, with the bilateral trade volume witnessing an average
annual increase of 20 percent since the late 1980s. The 1996 trade
volume reached 20.4 billion US dollars, and ASEAN has emerged as
China's fifth largest trade partner.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the two sides signed two agreements establishing the
China-ASEAN Joint Committee on Economic and Trade Cooperation and
the China-ASEAN Joint Committee on Science and Technology
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They have also supported and coordinated regional and
international organizations such as the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the China-ASEAN Joint Cooperation
Committee, which was established last February, determined that
the framework of Sino-ASEAN dialog would be formed by five
parallel mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also established the China-ASEAN Cooperation Fund
and approved in principle a number of items such as personnel
contacts, sponsorship of economic and trade cooperation seminars
and informational contacts.
</P>
<P>
Shi noted that the true significance of the joint cooperation
committee is that it has ensured highly organized and systematic
Sino-ASEAN cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The third round of political consultations between senior
officials from China and the ASEAN countries was held in east
China's Anhui province last April. The two sides exhibited their
political will to consider the bilateral ties from a strategic
perspective and to maintain regional peace.

Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen attended the fourth ARF
meeting and the meeting between ASEAN countries and its dialog
partners last July.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the latter meeting, Qian said that China and ASEAN
share extensive common interests and have reached a consensus on
various issues. He said the two sides should proceed from a
strategic perspective and develop comprehensive bilateral ties
and improve cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the 30th anniversary of the founding of ASEAN, Chinese
Premier Li Peng paid official visits to Malaysia and Singapore
last August as guest of their respective prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Li and the prime ministers of Malaysia and Singapore discussed
the development of good-neighborly friendship and cooperation
geared to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The recently concluded informal summit between China, Japan,
the Republic of Korea and ASEAN and the August China-ASEAN
Summit were the first top-level meetings between leaders from
East and Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The said meetings greatly improved the worldwide
multipolarization process.
</P>
<P>
China and Asean are determined to make the best use of existing
mechanisms for all-round dialogue and cooperation in order to
promote friendship and expand common ground in the following areas:
</P>
<P>
-- placing priority on economic, trade, scientific and
technological cooperation so as to ensure mutual improvement and
common progress;
</P>
<P>
-- coordinating and supporting each other on major regional and
international issues in order to jointly safeguard the legitimate
rights and interests of the developing countries;
</P>
<P>
-- properly handling existing differences or disputes
through friendly consultation in the spirit of seeking common
ground while setting aside differences.
</P>
<P>
China has participated in an extensive aid program under the
framework of the International Monetary Fund, a fact which fully
demonstrates its willingness to help relevant countries overcome
difficulties resulting from the recent financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Though China and some ASEAN members have disputes on the issue
of islands in the South China Sea, they have agreed to solve the
disputes through friendly consultation and negotiation in
accordance with the universally recognized international laws,
including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The said
agreements were included in the aforementioned joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that all parties concerned should adopt an approach of
shelving disputes and seeking common development on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the development of bilateral ties in recent years
has had a positive influence on the world peace and formation of a
new international order.
</P>
<P>
The advancement of bilateral ties in 1997 served as a summary
of relations between China and ASEAN in the wake of the Cold War,
and as a new starting point for the future development of
relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN currently includes Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.

<HEADLINE> China Selects Top Ten Research Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 Chinese scientists
have selected China's ten biggest scientific results in 1997. The
world's first high-definition DNA "fingerprint" of rice was on the
top of the list.
</P>
<P>
The technology, highlighted by academicians from both the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of
Engineering, has already been used in growing hybrid rice with
better genes.
</P>
<P>
The second one is the damming of the Three Gorges Water Control
Project on the Yangtze River. The designed water flow for the
damming was 14,000 to 19,400 cubic meters per second, and the
deepest water level was 60 meters, both of which rewrote the
world records.
</P>
<P>
The launching of the meteorological satellite Fengyun 2 ranked
third on the list, which also includes two major breakthroughs in
physics -- one concerning the nanometer electronics super-high
density information storage and the other, the expanding of the
diameter of single-crystal silicon.
</P>
<P>
The other successful projects selected are the
13-billion-bytes-per-second super computer, "Yinhe-3", completion
of a mission in the Pacific Ocean for China's 6,000-meter deep sea
robot, the use of cloned antibody in treating the encephalitis B,
the publication of three sets of encyclopedia, containing 140,000
species of plants and animals in China, and the sampling of
large ice cube from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by Chinese and
American scientists.
</P>
<P>
The selection of the Chinese top ten research results was
jointly-organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese
Academy of Engineering and the Chinese Science News.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Confirms Mordechai's Statement on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed today that Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai was stating the government's policy when he expressed
Israeli willingness to withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the confirmation here at this morning's weekly
Cabinet meeting, during which Mordechai's statement was
discussed.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister told the London-based Arabic newspaper
Al-Watan in an interview over the weekend that Israel would accept
the United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 calling for
Israeli pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Mordechai conditioned the Israeli pullout on Lebanon's
providing necessary security measures to secure safety of Israel's
northern border.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that a top Israeli official has
specifically said that Israel would comply with the
U.N. Resolution 425 passed nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai proposed reaching an interim security agreement with
Lebanese government, in which he envisioned an Israeli troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon and its replacement by the Lebanese
Army and possibly international peace keepers.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out a unilateral Israeli pullout if the Lebanese Army
refuses to restores authority in the region.
</P>
<P>
The minister's statement came amid an intensive public debate
over whether Israel should continue its military presence in south
Lebanon, where it is occupying a 15-kilometer-wide security zone
carved out since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrilla forces have
been fighting a tough war to oust Israeli occupation, which takes
an average death toll of over 30 Israeli soldiers every year.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine Israeli soldiers were killed in Lebanon last year,
in addition to the 73 killed in a helicopters collision disaster
near the border early that year.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Forces Withdraw from Southwestern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Reports from Somalia's
southwestern region of Gedo indicate that the Ethiopian forces
have made a total withdrawal from the region.
</P>
<P>
According to Major Mohamed Hussein Abdullahi, a senior
official from the split faction of the Somali National Front
(SNF), the Ethiopian forces have pulled out from the towns of
Lug, Bulo Hawo and Dolow along the border with Ethiopia on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi said the Ethiopian forces have pulled out on their
own accord and withdrew peacefully without firing a single shot.
</P>
<P>
The SNF official who spoke with the reporters here in
Mogadishu today confirmed a meeting that took place between the
Ethiopian force commanders in Dolow and the Rahanwein Resistance
Army militia commanders prior to their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know the contents of their discussions," he said.
</P>
<P>
A report said more than 500 Ethiopian forces on armed
personnel carriers, tanks and military trailers have made their
rendezvous at the bridge of Dolow-Somalia before crossing to
Dollow-Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces from the town of Luq, former headquarters
of Al-Itihad, have been the largest contingent and the latest
that arrived at the rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic fundamentalist organization of Al-Itihad also
confirmed the peaceful withdrawal of the Ethiopian forces from
Gedo region which has been occupied since early June last year.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Hassan Dahir Awey, commander of Al-Itihad forces, who
also spoke with the journalists here today in south Mogadishu,
has appealed for peace to the SNF faction of General Omar Haji
Masalle which now controls the region.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are the best way for a lasting solution to
Somalia's crises," he said, adding "Al-Itihad is calling for
peace to all parties in Gedo."
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi of SNF also called on his fellow SNF faction and
Al-Itihad men to negotiate to prevent further armed
confrontations in the region. He noted that the withdrawal was
also marked in the towns of Garbaharrey and Bardera in Gedo
region.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces have made two incursions into Somalia in
August 1996 and June 1997 in which they captured the three
important towns of Dolow, Bulo Hawo and Luq in their attempt to
the eradicate the presence of the Al-Itihad organization from the
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the district of Wajid, 90 km northwest
of Baidoa, indicate that the forces of Hussein Mohamed Aidid had
also peacefully withdrawn from the town on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Ali Aden Qalinle, spokesman for the Rahanwein
Resistance Army (RRA), said here that Hussein Aidid's men had
spoken with the RRA commanders in Wajid before pulling out.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Hussein Aidid's men took all their
equipments including the VHF radio communications and battle
wagons.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the Ethiopian forces from Gedo and Hussein
Aidid's retreat from Wajid took place at a time when many of
Somalia's faction leaders are in Ethiopia in an effort to cool
down the temper of Ethiopia after the signing of the historic
peace deal in Cairo late last month.
</P>
<P>
Early reports from Addis Ababa indicate that Ethiopia is
finally working towards the implementation of the Cairo agreement
as desired by the Somali people.

JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy announced Sunday in Tel Aviv his resignation from the
government, creating a crisis for government led by Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Levy said in a press conference that he will send his
resignation letter to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
He said that he resigned because Netanyahu's government has
abandoned the Middle East peace process and been ignoring the
difficulties of the poor of the country.

Under the law, Levy's resignation would come into effect 48
hours after his resignation letter to the prime minister. So the
prime minister still has two days to persuade him to change his
mind.
</P>
<P>
With the resignation of Levy from the government, Netanyahu
only enjoys a marginal majority of 61 seats in the 120-member

<HEADLINE> Moi Declared President Elect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Commission (EC)
of Kenya declared this afternoon that incumbent President Daniel
arap Moi has won his final five year term in the just concluded
general elections.
</P>
<P>
The president elect will be sworn in tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
"Moi has received the highest number of votes and 25 percent
in five provinces and is thereby declared the winner," Samuel
Kivuitu, chairman of the EC, told a news conference in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Official results showed that so far Moi has garnered 2.446
million votes (40.12 percent), followed by Democratic Party (DP)
Chairman Mwai Kibaki with 1.896 million votes (31.09 percent).
National Development Party's leader Raila Odinga took the third
place with only 665,725 votes.
</P>
<P>
The 73-year-old Moi who has been in power since 1978, has also
managed to win 69.38 percent of the votes in Rift Valley, 73.08
in North Eastern province, 44.67 in Western Province, 61.05 in
Coast, 35.87 in Eastern, 23.52 in Nyanza, 20.56 in Nairobi and
5.59 in Central Province.
</P>
<P>
Under Kenya's current constitution, the candidate who wins the
highest total and no less than 25 percent of the votes in at
least five of Kenya's eight provinces can be qualified as the
president.
</P>
<P>
Kibaki has managed 25 percent of the votes only in three
provinces -- Nairobi (43.74 percent), Central (88.73 percent) and
Eastern (28.81 percent).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU)
has won 102 parliamentary seats, followed by DP with 35 seats.
</P>
<P>
So far there are nine constituencies whose polling results are
yet to come but they "would not make any differences" of the
final outcome, said Kivuitu.
</P>
<P>
A total of 9,031,141 Kenyans had been registered for the
second multi-party elections to elect one president, 210
parliamentary members and 2,955 local councillors for the next
five years starting from 1998.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: State-Owned Enterprises on the Merger Trail (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China's reform of the
state-owned sector is on the verge of entering a new phase
featuring more restructuring and enterprise mergers.
</P>
<P>
The new phase will follow in the wake of a merger trend which
swept across the country in 1997, a year featuring the mergers of
some 3,000 enterprises and the reallocation of some 15.5 billion
yuan in state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
Ren Long, vice-director of the Policies Research Office under
the State Planning Commission, said the widespread inefficiency in
China's economic sector was to a great extent caused by irrational
capital allocations amongst enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy, which has experienced rapid growth over
two decades, must improve its efficiency and productivity, rather
than simply expanding the production scale. Therefore, the goal of
restructuring enterprises to ensure the more reasonable delivery
of state-owned capital could be one of the most effective means
for shaping a capital and technology-intensive economy, according
to Ren.
</P>
<P>
She said that steady economic growth in 1997 provided a number
of positive factors, including an ample supply of industrial
products and a buyer's market, rather than a seller's market, a
fact which guaranteed a sound basis for more enterprises mergers
in the country.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the number of enterprises and the volume of
state-owned assets involved, enterprise mergers in 1997 far
exceeded those on previous years.
</P>
<P>
Four large-scale chemical enterprises in Nanjing -- Jinling
Petrochemicals, Yangzi Petrochemicals, Yizheng Chemical Fiber
Co. and Nanjing Chemical Fiber Co. -- merged into a powerful
conglomerate with the encouragement of the central and local
governments. The new venture -- the Donglian Petrochemical Group
-- was formed on November 19, 1997. The restructuring, involving
state-owned assets of 54.2 billion yuan, was the largest in China
since 1949. The Donglian Group is expected to record year-end
figures of 44 billion yuan in sales and 3.3 billion yuan in
profits for 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Qilu Petrochemical Co., another major petrochemical giant,
purchased two chemical plants in Shandong Province, with the
restructuring involving over three billion yuan in state-owned
assets.
</P>
<P>
The country's metallurgical, civil aviation and household
electric appliance industries were also swept by the merger
wave during 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Changhong Group, China's largest color television
manufacturer, acquired two color television ventures, one each in
Jiangsu and Jilin provinces, and purchased the controlling stake
in a battery plant in Mianyang, Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
China General-Purpose Airline Company, a small aviation
company, was mergered with Eastern China Airlines, one of the
major local airlines in China. Three of the nation's largest iron
and steel plants in Hubei Province also announced merger plans in
late November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Local economists acknowledged that the merger wave is far from
reaching its peak. Officials from the Ministry of Machine-Building
Industry noted that the ministry will attempt to form more
productive automotive manufacturing conglomerates by combining the
assets of several of the country's largest automotive plants.
</P>
<P>
They said the merger wave is not only resultant from the rapid
growth of the national economy, but also a timely response to the
global market by domestic enterprises which were overwhelmed by
mergers amongst transnationals in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The only way for Chinese enterprise to compete with foreign
companies is to form a powerful capital scale and create higher
efficiency, according to the economists.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that governments at all levels should adhere to
the reform policies of the 15th National Congress of Communist
Party of China which gave green light to forming more enterprises
groups, regardless of boundaries between different regions,
sectors, forms of ownership and countries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, governments at all levels should use the industrial
policies to guide enterprise mergers, and should extend the
greatest possible efforts to improve both investment conditions
and market order, Wang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
discovered that female patients contracting cystic hyperplasia of
the breast have a much more likely chance of developing breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Gene research conducted by doctors at the Hebei Medical
University's No.4 Hospital found that the incidence of cystic
hyperplasia amongst female patients suffering from breast cancer
was three to five times higher than that for women free of cancer,
according to today's edition of Health Daily.
</P>
<P>
Geng Cuizhi, director of the research program, said that
pathological research reveals that 20-61 percent of breast
cancer patients also suffer from cystic hyperplasia.
</P>
<P>
She said they also discovered that mammary gland cells change
in form, function, metabolism and degree of differentiation during
their development from normal cells to hyperplasia and
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Researchers noted that cystic hyperplasia is a benign disease,
but caution that doctors should not treat the disease as various
other benign diseases.
</P>
<P>
The researchers suggested that the patients should undergo
tests of gene and cell kinetics to determine if indicators are
normal. However, should indicators show positive, patients should
be treated according to procedures for early stages of breast
cancer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Postpones Mideast Tour to Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A top Palestinian official said
today that U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis Ross has
postponed his tour of the Middle East till Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Voice of Arabs Radio over phone from
Jerusalem, Mahmoud Abbas, secretary of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) Executive Committee, voiced hope that Ross'
mission would help break the deadlock in Israeli-PLO peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Ross will direct his efforts to the Israeli side to
implement the redeployment of troops, halt unilateral acts and
promote activities of the sub-committee of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy's upcoming visit to Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas was planned for Monday but was rearranged at
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's request because of a
ongoing budget crisis in his government.
</P>
<P>
As for separate meetings U.S. President Bill Clinton is to hold
with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat and
Netanyahu in Washington this month, Abbas said the convocation and
success of such meetings depend on the possibility of realizing
progress in outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
"If the negotiations fail, an Arab stance should be adopted
upon which the coming steps will be defined," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ross' trip, including talks with Arafat on Tuesday, follows
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's unsuccessful bid last
month to break a nine-month impasse that started when Israel began
work on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem last March.
</P>
<P>
Albright had tried to make Netanyahu produce a blueprint for
Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank and Arafat to come up
with a written document on better security cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israel's cabinet has failed to agree on the scope of the
pullback and the extent of "security zones" it wants to establish
in the West Bank in a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have been voicing concern that U.S.-sponsored
peace moves, which seem to be gaining steam, could be sidetracked
by Israel's domestic troubles.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed today that Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai was stating the government's policy when he expressed
Israeli willingness to withdraw from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the confirmation here at this morning's weekly
Cabinet meeting, during which Mordechai's statement was
discussed.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister told the London-based Arabic newspaper
Al-Watan in an interview over the weekend that Israel would accept
the United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 calling for
Israeli pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
But Mordechai conditioned the Israeli pullout on Lebanon's
providing necessary security measures to secure safety of Israel's
northern border.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that a top Israeli official has
specifically said that Israel would comply with the
U.N. Resolution 425 passed nearly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai proposed reaching an interim security agreement with
Lebanese government, in which he envisioned an Israeli troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon and its replacement by the Lebanese
Army and possibly international peace keepers.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out a unilateral Israeli pullout if the Lebanese Army
refuses to restores authority in the region.
</P>
<P>
The minister's statement came amid an intensive public debate
over whether Israel should continue its military presence in south
Lebanon, where it is occupying a 15-kilometer-wide security zone
carved out since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrilla forces have
been fighting a tough war to oust Israeli occupation, which takes
an average death toll of over 30 Israeli soldiers every year.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine Israeli soldiers were killed in Lebanon last year,
in addition to the 73 killed in a helicopters collision disaster
near the border early that year.

The city's transport bureau has made great efforts to improve
the service of tourist vessels and taxies since early 1997. The
bureau launched service contests among the more than 100 tourist
boats under its jurisdiction in last April. Three ships were set
as pace-setters in the activity last year.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 10,000 survey sheets were distributed among the
tourists concerning service quality, tourist guides' work, prices
in catering service as well as management. Efforts were also made
to help training tourist guides.
</P>
<P>
Great progress was seen since the activity was launched. It is
a common practice that taxi drivers do not pocket the money they
pick up in Guilin, as elsewhere in the country. Incompleted
statistics showed that in 1997, taxi drivers turned over some
250,000 yuan the passengers left behind.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, tests were given to some 3,000 drivers concerning
traffic regulation, professional ethics, and traffic general
knowledge, in a bid to increase their competence as taxi drivers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Austria's Thomas Sykora took
his first World Cup victory of the season in an Alpine skiing
slalom on Sunday, while Italian Alberto Tomba pulled out of the
race because of the poor condition on the course in Kranjska Gora,
Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Reigning overall champion Sykora, who was ninth in the first
leg, timed a combined one minute 37.93 seconds after the two legs
to top the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Pierrick Bourgeat followed on 1:38.09 despite a 19th
place in the opening leg, while Austrian Thomas Stangassinger, the
1994 Olympic champion, third in 1:38.13 from a first-leg eighth
finishing.
</P>
<P>
The broken piste distracted Tomba, who set the best time of the
season, to pull out of the event because officials reversed the
start list of 30 racers instead of the leading 15.
</P>
<P>
Jagge, winner of the first leg, failed to carry on his
impressive performance to finish just 25th overall.

<HEADLINE> Macao Prepared for Any Possible Outbreak of Bird Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Macao is fully prepared for any
possible outbreak of the bird flu although no case of H5N1 virus
has been found so far, a doctor with the Government Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
The doctor was quoted by the Tai Chung Po newspaper on Sunday
that his hospital is fully prepared to cope with the treatment and
testing of the bird flu disease which had killed four people in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said the hospital has been paying special attention to the
bird flu disease because of the geographical proximity between the
two places.
</P>
<P>
If a patient is tested positive of the virus in Macao, the
doctor said, the hospital will alert the Health Department to send
the samples for further testing in Hong Kong. In the same time the
patient will be treated as catching bird flu to prevent any
possible delays.
</P>
<P>
Although doctors have repeatedly called on local residents to
remain calm, sales of chickens in Macao have plummeted by more
than 50 percent over the past month. Many residents have turned to
pigeons, geese or pork for substitutes.
</P>
<P>
Another report in the Macao Daily News said on Sunday that the
imports of pigeons and geese have increased by more than 10
percent. The sales of pork also increased.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Government-Rebel Peace Talks to Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has strongly urged the peace panels of the government and the
National Democratic Front (NDF) rebels to forge a comprehensive
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the resumption of formal talks between the
government and the NDF in the Netherlands, Ramos said Sunday that
a "nation united in purpose and fully at peace with itself" will
be one of the best achievements the Filipino people expect in the
centenary of Philippine independence this year.
</P>
<P>
He said negotiations with the NDF have been a "long, difficult,
and protracted quest for peace" that began in an atmosphere of
great expectation in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The people's "expectations and confidence in the talks have
been diminished with every impasse in the talks over the last five
years," he added.
</P>
<P>
The formal negotiations between the two sides have been
recessed four times over the last five years over conflicting
positions on substantive issues.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the often disappointing twists and turns of these
negotiations, the government remains committed to its goal of
attaining a just and lasting peace that the Filipinos want and
deserve," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
He enjoined the NDF to match the government efforts to break
the current deadlock in the talks and to finally move resolutely
to tackle the substantive issues that could lead to a final peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a separate statement, government panel chairman Howard Dee
said the primary objective of the fifth round of peace talks was
for "both sides to arrive at a mutually acceptable agreement on
human rights and international humanitarian law."
</P>
<P>
Dee said that once the agreement is signed, the two panels can
move on to other equally vital substantive agenda of the talks
and, finally, forge a comprehensive peace agreement that the
Filipino people have long prayed and waited for.

<HEADLINE> Four Army Officers Involved in S. Leone Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The military government in
Sierra Leone today sacked four of the 17 army officers who
toppled the civilian government of Tejan Kabbah on May 25.
</P>
<P>
A statement on the official radio accused the men of "an act
of sabotage in vandalizing the Iranian embassy (in the west end
of the capital) on New Year's eve and New Year's day."
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by Colonel Abu Kamara, the under
secretary of defense, said Hassan Bangura, Brima Kamara, Mohamed
Kallon and Foday Kallay as well as Captain Alfred Browne of the
people's army (former rebel combatants), all Corporals who were
people's revolutionary leaders, were also dismissed from the
powerful Supreme Council of State.
</P>
<P>
Corporal Tamba Gboric, a ringleader of the May 25 coup, was
demoted to the rank of Lance Corporal, dismissed from the Supreme
Council of State and stripped of all government vehicles and
security personnel except two and put under probation.
</P>
<P>
Another people's army official, Lt. Colonel Issa Sesay will
lose three months' salary.
</P>
<P>
The statement ordered "all civilians involved in the matter to
surrender all looted items to the nearest police" while the
department of foreign affairs is to send "an immediate apology to
Tehran and all commandeered vehicles returned to the embassy with
immediate effect."
</P>
<P>
Residents around the embassy said soldiers in three trucks
arrived at the embassy close to midnight on December 31 and used
ladders to scale the huge fence and battered steel doors to gain
entrance.
</P>
<P>
"I watched with shock as they carted off computers, furniture
and TVs," one eyewitness said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The embassy is now being guarded by heavily armed Sierra Leone
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
West African diplomats here said they were surprised over the
government's tough action against the men previously regarded as
"untouchables".
</P>
<P>
"The government is anxious to wipe out its past stains and
deal ruthlessly with any man who wants to derail the revolution,"
one diplomat said.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislators Urged Immediate Rescue of Tibet Archives (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua)-- Two Chinese legislators have
called for immediate action to rescue and protect historic records
preserved in the Tibet Archives.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't take any prompt action, some of these precious
historical records will probably perish in the foreseeable
future," warned Nie Dajiang and Xu Jing, both members of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Nie and Xu made an inspection tour of the Tibet Autonomous
Region September last year during which they were thrilled to see
the vast amount of historic records stored in the Tibet Archives,
some of which were seriously damaged and became indecipherable.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint speech they made at the NPC Standing
Committee's 29th meeting last week, the Tibet Archives keeps more
than three million historic documents and papers that span some
seven centuries from the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) to the
Democratic Reform in 1959.
</P>
<P>
The archives are historically correct and are a good record of
Tibet's life in almost all aspects including politics, economics,
military, culture and religions during the imperial Yuan, Ming
(1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties, and well into the
Repubic of China (1912-1949) and the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"They are of profound political implications and of high
historical value," said Nie, citing that the files include
imperial edicts from the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and rigid
official decrees of that time, which called for the protection of
Tibetan Buddhist temples and Tibetan tribal chieftains' rights and
interests.
</P>
<P>
Also among the archives are the imperial edicts and orders
issued by the court of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) to Tibetan
political and religious leaders, written in the three languages,
namely, the Han (or Chinese), Tibetan and Mongolian languages.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislators Call for Immediate Rescue of Tibet Archives (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These records testify to the fact that the central Chinese
goverment began to exercise its administrative jurisdiction over
Tibet as early as seven centuries ago and that Tibet has been an
inalienable part of China since ancient times," Nie noted.
</P>
<P>
The two legislators further pointed out the archives are
indispensable for the study of the Tibetan history, its regional
defence and relations with other ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
"They offer comprehensive perspectives to the studies of Tibet's
philosophy, culture, religion, art, language and cosmology as
well," said Nie.
</P>
<P>
However, nearly one third of these precious historic records
are in a bad shape. About 400 lots of papers and documents have
not yet been sorted, some are rotten and fragmented, and some
others are simply melted together.
</P>
<P>
"There is no time to lose in trying every means to rescue these
records," Nie noted.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the central government and departments
concerned recruit scholars and experts all over the country to join
in the rescue team.
</P>
<P>
To this end, a special fund should be established to finance
the project which definitely requires special equipment for
restoration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government should hire experts on
ancient Tibetan language who can not only lead the resue work but
help train young professionals.
</P>
<P>
"We should guarantee preservation of the precious archives for
the benefit of coming generations," Nie said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Phone Calls Bounce Back in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian police is worrying
about the return of illegal commercial telephone operators who
have once been driven underground, the Sunday Champion reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The fraudsters resurfaced towards the end of last year by
opening more illegal call offices and expanding their illegal
services from telephone to fax.
</P>
<P>
The illegal call offices offer their services to local, trunk
and overseas callers for amounts much less than the official
prices, costing the Nigeria Telecommunications Ltd. (NITEL)
millions of Naira in revenue, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The fake phone operators, believed to be enjoying assistance
and support of some fraudulent NITEL staff, either tap lines of
big companies with multiple numbers or simply covert a private
line for the "business".
</P>
<P>
The pirated line is often abandoned after millions of Naira
may have been accumulated as bills within weeks.
</P>
<P>
To stem the illegal activities, the government set up a task
force on telecommunications and postal offences in early 1996,
which drove the fraudsters underground following the abolition of
commercial phone services in business centers.
</P>
<P>
Despite regular raids on suspected havens of fraudsters and
arrest of suspects by the task force, the illegal call offices
have continued to boom.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people have been arrested by the task force over
alleged involvement in telecommunication offences nationwide, but
most of the suspects never got convicted or even charged before
properly constituted courts.
</P>
<P>
According to Taiye Shobajo, public relations officer for the
task force, most of those arrested are "miscreants, criminals and
low profile individuals without any home base" or responsible
persons to stand as their guarantors.
</P>
<P>
The officer, however, pleaded the judicial to ensure more
trial and conviction of the suspects in the New Year.

<HEADLINE> Shenyang Hospital Succeeds in Liver Transplanting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The No.1 Hospital of
Shenyang-Based China University of Medical Sciences has succeeded
in a liver-transplanting operation.
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old liver receiver, Zhao Changjiu, has recently
left the hospital after the operation which was conducted a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
The experts of the hospital said that Zhao's new liver is now
functioning well and Zhao is able to live like others.
</P>
<P>
On November 25 last year Zhao received the new liver to replace
his original one, for he had suffered cancer of common bile duct.
</P>
<P>
It took eight hours for the doctors to remove his disabled
liver and transplanted the new one. The biles came out 15 minutes
after all the ducts of the new liver were connected with the
original ducts.
</P>
<P>
On the fourth day after the operation, Zhao's liver resumed
normal operation and in the next few days, Zhao overcame
infections.
</P>
<P>
It is the second liver-transplanting case that the hospital has
done in the past three years. The hospital failed in its first
transplanting and the patient died 12 days after the operation due
to infections.

<HEADLINE> German Coach Banned from Swimming Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Germany's swimming team head
coach Winfried Leopold has been banned from attending the world
swimming championships in Perth, the sport's governing body FINA
announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
FINA said in a statement that Leopold's accreditation for the
championships starting on Thursday had been revoked and his case
forwarded to its doping panel.
</P>
<P>
Leopold's exclusion came after his stunning admission last week
that he had been involved in doping programs during his time as an
East German coach.
</P>
<P>
"Following the declarations of Mr Winfried Leopold, team leader
of the German Swimming Federation, published by the press and
confirmed by the German Swimming Federation, the FINA Bureau
requested that the executive and several other bureau hear Mr.
Leopold," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"At the close of the hearing, the bureau decided to forward the
case to the doping panel, and withdraw his accreditation that was
granted to him for the eighth FINA swimming world championships."
</P>
<P>
News of Leopold's past emerged last Sunday when German media
reported that Berlin prosecutors had launched a probe into
Leopold's conduct.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors alleged Leopold provided banned substances to
swimmers between 1986 and 1990 without telling them about, or
sufficiently explaining, the side effects.
</P>
<P>
Four German coaches and two sports doctors were charged earlier
this year with doping offences.

<HEADLINE> Internal Auditing Helps Supervise Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Internal auditing units set up
by Shanghai's firms and government bodies checked out more than
one billion yuan-worth of losses in 1997, according to the
municipal auditing bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau noted that these internal auditing units have helped
supervise the economic activities in this largest city in China.
</P>
<P>
Thirty three cases involving illegally used funds found during
the auditing process have been transferred to judicial organs,
said the bureau.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, some 1,800 internal auditing units had been
set up in the city, employing more than 7,022 auditors.
</P>
<P>
Supervision by auditing has played a positive role in
maintaining China's financial and economic order, said the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Last year, auditors throughout the country saved the state more
than 30 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
During a national conference on auditing last December in
Beijing, Chinese Premier Li Peng called for increased supervision
by auditors across China to check embezzlement and other economic
crimes.
</P>
<P>
The State Auditing Administration is considering working out
regulations on internal auditing to improve the supervision
mechanism.

<HEADLINE> Two Pages of Manuscript Ramayana Found in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Two pages of the manuscript of
the Nepali version of the Hindu holy book "Ramayana" have been
found, local newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Ramayana" was written by Valmiki in Sanskrit about 2,200 years
before. Nepal's pioneer poet Bhanu Bhakta Acharya, born in 1814,
translated it into Nepali.
</P>
<P>
The two pages were found in the house of Bhanu Bhakta's
great-grandson in between the books used to be read by the pioneer
poet.
</P>
<P>
One of the pages has been ravaged by insects, but the other is
intact, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
The two pages include the 11th to 22nd and 87th to 98th verses
of the "Ramayana Balkanda", the newspapers said, adding that the
handwriting on both sides of the thick Nepali paper is bold and
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
"I do not know how these pages came to be left here, but I am
sure the writing is in Bhanu Bhakta's own hand," the newspapers
quoted Gopinath Acharya, the youngest great-grandson of the
pioneer poet as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled how his father had on many occasions asked him
to search for the two pages which he had kept in remembrance of
his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
The handwriting is yet to be scientifically identified, and so
far there has been no authoritative identification of the
handwriting in Bhanu Bhakta's "Ramayana", the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Two manuscripts of "Ramayana" held separately by the national
archives and by the Bhanu library in Chundi Ramgha, Tanahu
district of western Nepal, the birthplace of the pioneer poet,
have not been identified scientifically either, the newspapers
added.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Command Reshuffled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Major General Mugisha Muntu,
Ugandan army commander, has been replaced by Jeje Odongo, former
state minister for defense in charge of training, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni last night also appointed
Brigadier James Kazini as the acting chief of staff to replace
Brigadier Chefe Ali. Kazini, former commander of the fourth
division, was replaced by Colonel Katumba Wamala, commander of
the second division.
</P>
<P>
The position of state minister for defense is vacant for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
Holding the concurrent post of commander-in-chief of the
Ugandan army, Museveni said in his decree that a further
reorganization in the army command will take place later.
</P>
<P>
Odongo joined the army in 1979 and was trained in Tanzania and
Russia and was regarded as one of the best trained army man in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Kazini and Wamala belong to the new breed in the army command,
said an army source who did not want to be named. Both of them
are the main figures in the fight against the Lord's Resistance
Army (LRA) in recent years in the northern part of the country
which has resulted in drastic restraining in LRA's rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Both Kazini and Wamala have retained their officer ranks.
</P>
<P>
The new posts for Mugisha Muntu and Chefe Ali are not yet
arranged for the time being. But local media said Muntu is a
ministerial material while Chefe was a possible figure for a
special duty responsible to President Museveni.

<HEADLINE> Cholera under Control in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar has allowed
several schools to re-open after the outbreak of cholera was put
under control, Sunday News said today.
</P>
<P>
Schools were closed early last month after the epidemic
claimed more than 140 lives on the isles off the east coast of
Tanzanian mainland. Over 600 people have contracted the disease.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a statement from the Ministry of Health as
saying that the decision to open some educational institutions
has been reached following careful consideration of the current
cholera trend and the needs of students at the learning
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The institutions which have been allowed to open doors to
students include senior secondary schools, teacher training
colleges, in-service training centers, the Zanzibar Hotel and
Tourism Training Institute, the Institute of Kiswahili and
Foreign Languages and Islamic institutions for adults.
</P>
<P>
Nursery schools, primary schools and junior secondary schools
will remain closed waiting for further notice.
</P>
<P>
Health officials attributed the spread of the killer disease
to the lack of latrines and waste disposal pits.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the paper said the Ministry of Health
Saturday sent drugs to contain the spread of cholera which has so
far claimed 236 lives in the east-central region of Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
Regional Medical Officer Dr. Meshack Massi said a total of
3,841 people have contracted the disease, and the drugs will meet
the demand for two months, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
He has directed the affected people to rebuild latrines and
stick to basic hygiene regulations.

<HEADLINE> New Way to Help Learn Chinese Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have found a way
that can double the speed of learning Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
The method will enable students to familiar with thousands of
Chinese characters within two or three years, compared to six
years when the conventional way is used, experts from Beijing
Languages and Culture University say.
</P>
<P>
Linguists have made new conclusions that the complicated
Chinese language system is based on only 500 basic
characters. Other characters are constructed with the 500 "bricks".
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the best way to learn Chinese is to learn the 500
characters, according to them.
</P>
<P>
The method is especially helpful for foreigners to learn
Chinese, which is becoming popular in some countries as more
students there want to link their future to China's economic
development, the experts note.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese-English book will soon be published by the Xinhua
Publishing House to explain the method, sources say.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Lifts Power Rationing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 4 (Xinhua) -- With enough water pouring
into major dams, Tanzania has lifted power rationing, Baruany
Luhanga, Tanzania Electrical Supply Company (TANESCO) Managing
Director, has announced.
</P>
<P>
Incessant rains linked to El Nino have filled the Mtera,
Kidatu, Nyumba ya Mungu and Pangani dams with water, making
hydro-electric generators operating in high gear, Luhanga made
the announcement on Friday when addressing his employees at the
head office.
</P>
<P>
By Friday, he said, water levels at the Mtera reservoir in
Iringa Region in the southwest had risen to 695.22 meters above
the sea level, more than five meters higher than the warning
level of 690 meters one month ago, Sunday News reported today.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the company has been able to step up power
generation and put an end to load shedding, which had been in
force for four months last year.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania, whose electricity mainly comes from hydro-electric
power stations, started to introduce power rationing system
following depletion of water at major dams in early September
because of a drought.
</P>
<P>
During the worst period, a number of areas suffered from no
supply of electricity in five days of a week, adversely affecting
industrial production and people's daily life. In late November,
the Zanzibar airport was lost in darkness at night, except for
cruicial sections which were lit by candles and kerosene lamps.
</P>
<P>
With the on-going rains and improved water levels, the TANESCO
managing director expressed optimism that power generation will
be good throughout the year and there will be no need for load
shedding. The company has also sufficient fuel for the running of
generators.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's food Deficit Likely to Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's food deficit is
likely to shoot up to four million tons in the current fiscal year
ending June 30, a rise of 81.8 percent as compared with the
previous corresponding year, the Bangladesh Observer said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The annual food requirement of this South Asian country with a
population of 124.3 million is estimated at 22 million tons.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's total food production this year is
unlikely to exceed 18 million tons, leaving a shortfall of four
million tons, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The daily attributed this to bad weather such as inadequate and
untimely rain and widespread pest attacks.
</P>
<P>
The food deficit should give no cause for unnecessary alarm
among the people, officials said, adding that the government is
preparing a massive import of foodgrain to plug the shortfall, the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
As a related effort, the government has also allowed private
enterprises to import grains, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China's railways carried 917
million passengers in 1997, down from 942 million in the
previous year, but halted a sharp decrease in the number of
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Fu Zhihuan, vice minister of railways, made the announcement at
a national railway meeting that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that operation express passenger trains and
arrive-in-a-night trains, computerized ticket booking, and an
improved railway operational map last year increased the railway
sector's market competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that highways and air transport had seized some of
the railway's market shares. In 1996, the railway passenger
transport volume dropped 12.3 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Railways transported approximately 1.62 billion tons of freight
last year, matching the 1996 level, and earned 84 billion yuan,
8.9 billion more than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, railways contributed greatly to the transport of such
vital goods as cotton, grain, petroleum, and disaster relief
materials, the official said.

LOS ANGELES, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Vandals hit downtown of
Portland, the biggest city in the U.S. northwest state of Oregon,
leaving hundreds of graffiti pieces behind last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Part of the tagging spree was the vandalism of a 85-year
historic library. On walls decorated with historic figures and
benches bearing writers' names was a mess of spray-painted scrawls
left by vandals, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the city spends at least 300,000 U.S. dollars to
strip graffiti, which initially appeared in the subways of New
York City in the early 1970s, from public property -- everything
from restrooms to park benches and buses.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, the cost of cleaning up graffiti is
estimated between four and seven billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Different measures have been introduced to eliminate the
graffiti. Chicago and Phoenix have banned aerosol spay paint
cans. Other cities require property owners to remove graffiti
within 10 days or face a fine or jail.

workers, about 30 percent of the province's textile workforce,
were laid off and entered the service industry sponsored by the
province's various textile companies.
</P>
<P>
The province's textile industry is also undergoing structural
overhauls, with many small companies merging into big group
companies, reducing some small brands. The province has 42 brands
of textile products recognized as famous national brands.
</P>
<P>
China plans to reduce about 10 million outdated and backward

<HEADLINE> Ellwood Hands Australia a Successful Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian teenager Annabel
Ellwood gave Australia a dream start in the 585,000 U.S. dollars
Hopman Cup, eclipsing Asa Carlsson of Sweden in straight sets in
Australian coastal city of Perth Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by a capacity crowd of 8500, Ellwood overcame a nervous
beginning to triumph 6-4, 6-4 in 84 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Ranked 93 in the world, the 19-year-old girl was jittery early
in the first set, and despite having break point opportunities,
trailed 0-3.
</P>
<P>
She then settled and, aided by erratic Carlsson groundstrokes,
particularly from her forehand, rallied admirably to snatch the
first set in 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Carlsson's mistakes continued in the second as Ellwood, growing
in confidence, not only kept the ball in play but attacked the
lines regularly.
</P>
<P>
The victory was secured on the second match point when a
Carlsson backhand flew the baseline.
</P>
<P>
"My heart-rate was definitely up at the start," a delighted
Ellwood told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It is definitely up there up ... because you are playing for
your country."
</P>
<P>
Ellwood surprised no-one when she conceded the boisterous
crowd support had been a contributing factor in her success.
</P>
<P>
"It's great to have that atmosphere in here and have them on
my side," she said.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Another 465 tons of hay were
dropped to herds stranded by fierce snowstorms throughout
southeastern New Mexico Saturday, according to news reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The airlift is a continuation of emergency rescue effort by
six C-130 military cargo planes which dropped 103 tons of food to
ranchers who couldn't reach their livestock.
</P>
<P>
State officials say bad weather killed up to 9,600 cattle and
sheep since Christmas Eve when a series of snowstorms stranded
more than 180,000 herds.
</P>
<P>
Farms around the city of Roswell have been the hardest hit with
ranchers unable to get feed to their livestock.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture offered 2 million dollars of
disaster aid on Wednesday, agreeing to reimburse ranchers for up
to 30 percent of cost of buying feed to be airlifted in.
</P>
<P>
However, as temperatures warmed late Saturday, some ranchers
canceled their orders for more feed and the five-day rescue effort
finally came to an end.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Mining Industry in Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean mining industry
is facing serious trading problems with earnings in the financial
year ending 1997 going down 11 percent from 484.6 million U.S.
dollars in 1996 to 428.5 million dollars, the Sunday Mail
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Liz Chitiga, chief executive of the Minerals
Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe (MMCZ), as saying that various
factors including lower prices on the world market and shutdowns
by some local mines had attributed to the shrinking of the
industry.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the local industry has had
negative growth since management problems in MMCZ were ironed out
in 1992. The industry had since 1992 experienced an upward growth
and there were predictions that some of the minerals,
particularly gold and nickel, could soon match tobacco which is
the country's single largest foreign currency earning commodity.
</P>
<P>
Results for gold which is marketed through the reserve bank
were not available from the Chamber of Mines last week. But like
most minerals, gold also had a bad year with low prices on the
world markets.
</P>
<P>
MMCZ result indicated that the mining industry failed to reach
the target of 5.2 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (about 289 million
U.S. dollars) which it had set for itself. The industry earned
4.8 billion Zimbabwe dollars (267 million dollars) but that much
was realised only because of the heavy devaluation of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The results also indicated that nickel continued to play a
major role in the mining sector earning 1.4 billion Zimbabwe
Dollars (77.8 million dollars) or more than 25 percent of the
earnings by all minerals. The prices for the mineral were firmer
in the first half of the year but weakened during the last six
months. Sales volumes went up by only two percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices were weak for almost all major minerals including high
carbon ferrochrome, low carbon ferrochrome, ferrosilicon chrome,
asbestos, granite stone, diamonds, emeralds, coal and graphite.

<HEADLINE> mee010401hke - Iran Condemns Algerian Massacres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran condemned recent massacres
in Algeria and criticized international human rights bodies for
their indifference towards the ongoing slaughter of innocent
civilians.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper Iran News today, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the murders were committed under
very suspicious circumstances which have made the task of
identifying the perpetrators very difficult.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that over 400 people were killed on December 30 by
Muslim militants in the Relizane region, 250 kilometers southwest
of capital Algiers.
</P>
<P>
The massacre at the beginning of the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan was the worst in the past six years since Muslim
insurgency flared up in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said Iran condemns anyone or any group that is
responsible for torturing and killing innocent women and children.
</P>
<P>
He called the human rights organizations' silence over the
massacres "unacceptable," and hoped the initiatives and efforts of
the U.N. chief, the humanitarian organizations and the
Organizations of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the campaign
against genocide could be brought to an end soon.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi noted that the Islamic world should not remain
indifferent to those atrocities, specially in Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
He hoped those responsible for the crimes will be brought to
justice soon and their identities revealed.

<HEADLINE> 1.7-Billion-Year-Old Cosmic Dust Discovered in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have
discovered cosmic dust dating back some 1.7 billion years in
Jixian County of north China's Tianjin City, indicating that a
strong "meteorite shower" hit the area.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said those metal globular grains are of great
importance to research into cosmogony, the formation of the Sun
and space flight.
</P>
<P>
Li Zenghui, a female researcher with the Tianjin Institute of
Geology and Mineral Resources attached to the Ministry of Geology
and Mineral Resources, collected 500 kilograms of dust from quartz
sandstone 859 meters underground in Changgou Village of Jixian
County in the northern part of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
After scientific sorting, more than 600 milligrams of cosmic
dust were obtained.
</P>
<P>
With advanced facilities, researchers found that the dust
contains black iron globular grains with a diameter of 0.1 to 0.3
millimeters.
</P>
<P>
They believed the comic dust to be around 1.73 billion years
old, which coincides with the geological year of the quartz
sandstone from where the dust was taken.
</P>
<P>
Geologists said Changgou Village is located at the southern
side of Yanshan Mountains, where the geological structures and
large amounts of ancient organisms are well preserved.
</P>
<P>
Chinese geologists also found this kind of cosmic dust in
nearby Luanxian County in Hebei Province, Xingcheng County in
Liaoning Province and Changping County in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They said the discovery indicates that a strong "meteorite
shower" hit vast areas with Jixian as the center.

</P>
<P>
At present, the city has 13,000 overseas-financed enterprises.
Export-oriented businesses of the city now contribute more than 40
percent of the city's gross domestic product (GDP). The city's
annual imports and exports come to 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Changping Railway Station of Dongguan became a
first-category railway passenger transport outlet capable of

<P>
HELSINKI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Finland experienced multiple
abnormal weather conditions in 1997, with extremes of dog days
rarely seen in a century and a winter season starting as early as
September.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that
the highest temperature last July hit 31.5 degrees Celsius, a
record over the past 100 years. The average temperature over the
whole summer was much higher than the normal 17 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 40 sunny days in the three summer months,
about three times that of normal years, making it the longest
summer season yet since the beginning of meteorological recordings.
</P>
<P>
The other side of the picture is that snow began to fall in
big, feathery flakes in September in the eastern region of Kainuu
and northern Lappi. In other areas, snowfalls came two to three
weeks earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
The beginning of last year saw a record high of 1.9 meters of
accumulated snow in the outermost north of Kilpisjarvi, which did
not melt away until May.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the abnormal weather, Finland suffered
unbalanced rainfall throughout the year and tornado attacks in the
northwest of the country, which affected crop growth to varying
degrees.

HANOI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam's communist party aims
to speed up the country's renovation process in its latest
resolution published here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted by the fourth plenum of the party's
central committee late last month, also stressed the tasks of
mobilizing internal strength, raising the effectiveness of
international cooperation and practising thrift to fulfil
socio-economic targets for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
It reviewed the achievement in implementing socio-economic
development tasks set forth by the 8th party congress and pointed

</P>
<P>
"These problems affected the economic environment, reducing the
growth rate and hiding potential threats to socio-economic
stability," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the party's major policies, it was necessary to speed
up the economic restructuring and adjustment of the investment
structure, to go on renewing the country's financial-monetary

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The "Thai-Help-Thai" campaign is
gaining momentum in Thailand as the general public is ready to do
something to help the country out of the current economic crisis,
according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, initiated by a Buddhist monk last month, has been
widely supported by the general public, and prime minister's
office minister Supatra Masdit has been assigned to oversee the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said Saturday that people in his
hometown of Trang province, southern Thailand, had given him gold
necklaces weighing half a kilogram and some 40,000 baht (850 U.S.
dollars) in cash to help the nation.
</P>
<P>
Last week, an old woman donated 150 grams of gold and 5,000
baht (106 dollars) in cash through the "Thai-Help-Thai" office at
the government house.
</P>
<P>
Yong Wuttikiat, 73, who moved from Hong Kong to Bangkok 30
years ago, donated 600,000 baht (12,800 dollars) to the government
house last week.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed monk has reportedly collected over a million baht
(21,300 dollars) from the public and is expected to turn over the
donations to the government soon.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 temples in the southern province of Chumphon and
various organizations in other provinces are collecting valuables
from the public for the nation.
</P>
<P>
The military also plans a nationwide campaign to collect gold,
jewelry, cash and other valuables from people who are willing to
help the government tackle the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Supatra said that what matters is not how much the government
receives from the people, but the public's goodwill and awareness
of how bad the economic crisis is.

<P>
HELSINKI, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Finland experienced multiple
abnormal weather conditions in 1997, with extremes of dog days
rarely seen in a century and winter a season starting as early as
September.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Finnish Meteorological Institute show that
the highest temperature last July hit 31.5 degrees Celsius, a
record over the past 100 years. The average temperature over the
whole summer was much higher than the normal 17 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 40 sunny days in the three summer months,
about three times that of normal years, making it the longest
summer season yet since the beginning of meteorological recordings.
</P>
<P>
The other side of the picture is that snow began to fall in
big, feathery flakes in September in the eastern region of Kainuu
and northern Lappi. In other areas, snowfalls came two to three
weeks earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
The beginning of last year saw a record high of 1.9 meters of
accumulated snow in the outermost north of Kilpisjarvi, which did
not melt away until May.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the abnormal weather, Finland suffered
unbalanced rainfall throughout the year and tornado attacks in the
northwest of the country, which affected crop growth to varying
degrees.

<HEADLINE> Sino-DPRK Border Market Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Stocks of goods are piled up
in the small wood plate-walled market, covering no more than 200
sq m, and people are busy bargaining, with the help of calculators
and in the only working language of the market -- Korean.
</P>
<P>
This has been a normal scene at the first and only border
shopping-mall between China and the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK), since June 17 last year when the Quanhe-Wonzengri
Border Trading Zone opened on the DPRK side in the DPRK land-port
of Wonzengri.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the border market is beneficial to the two
sides," said Wang Wenli, Director of the Foreign Trade Bureau of
Hunchun, in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of northeast
China's Jilin province.
</P>
<P>
For the Chinese side, it is helpful for increasing the income
of the border people, he said, noting that it has been a new
source of income for those have been laid off from state-owned
factories in the city.
</P>
<P>
The market opens four days every week, from Tuesday to
Friday. To maintain business order, as too many border residents
want to join in, the number of traders was recently
set. Currently, merely 150 participants from each side are allowed
to operate every trading day, much less than the previous months.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the market has been welcomed by the DPRK side as
it has contributed to easing the shortage of food and daily
necessities in the border area, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
To this day, some 20,000 Chinese visitors, mainly from Hunchun,
have visited the market. Most of them are ethnic Koreans.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the DPRK authorities do not collect any fee
and levy from the market.
</P>
<P>
While bringing back Chinese-made goods, DPRK businessmen have
supplied sea food to their Chinese counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan International Reserves $17.3 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan international
reserves were 17.3 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1997, a 120
million dollar, or 0.69 percent, reduction compared to the
previous week when they were 17.42 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the Weekly Indicators Bulletin published by
the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) Saturday shows that the
international reserves indicator has been registering a
contraction since December 8, 1997, due to the Christmas season's
increase of imports and foreign travel.
</P>
<P>
A strong demand for hard currency has made necessary the
constant presence of the BCV, which has had to supply the dollars
to maintain the rate of exchange within the established bands.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the reserves during the last four weeks, according
to the BCV, was 1.53 billion dollars, after the 18.83 billion
dollars were registered up to December 1.
</P>
<P>
However, the reserves at the close of 1997 have surpassed the
level reached in December of 1996 when they were 15.22 billion
dollars.

In tandem with the implementation of China's policies of reform
and opening to the outside world, Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, has witnessed rapid economic
development and marked improvements in the lives of local
residents.
</P>
<P>
However, the city is also encounted with increasing cases of
crimes committed by younsters due to various reasons.
</P>
<P>
To educate these teen-agers, Guangzhou City's Intermediate
People's Court and the Guangzhou City Committee of the Chinese
Communist Youth League first put a project in operation which
involves specially-invited jurors in trying juvenile delinquents
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Specially-invited jurors include outstanding Youth League
organizers and teachers, who are asked to conduct persuasion in
court and supevise education in school.
</P>
<P>
During the trial operation of the project between 1992 and
1993, 25 cases involving younsters were dealt with, 47 teen-agers
were sentenced, 30 of them with suspended sentences.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts of judges and specially-invited jurors,
none of these younsters committed crimes again.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 300 specially-invited jurors serving the
city's childrens' court since the project was put into official
operation across the city in 1994.

In 1995, the city set up a juvenile delinquents education
center to help those serving sentences.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 persons, including judges, specially-invited jurors,
and people who are concerned with the education of juvenile
delinquents, regularly visit the center to provide legal
assistance and psychological consultation, correct bad behaviors
of juvenile delinquents, provide guidance for their action and
help them make up their mind to contribute to society again.
</P>
<P>
These people are also responsible for introducing new social
developments to juvenile delinquents and help them find jobs or go
back to school after completing their terms in the center.
</P>
<P>
"Guangzhou City Youth Hotline" was opened in 1995 to provide
consultation on protecting the legitimate rights and interest of
juveniles, explain punishment on youngsters who have violated the
law, and spread legal knowledge and guide youngsters in studying
and making friends.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, the Guangzhou Juveniles Legal Assistance
Station and Legal Assistance Fund were established to provide free
legal consultancy and assistance for local and non-Guangzhou
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the ratio of juvenile delinquents in the city
drops by an average three percentage points annually.
</P>
<P>
Activities mobilizing more work units and departments to join
the efforts to educate juvenile criminals have been started.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, Youth League committees from nine enterprises have
established links with local juvenile delinquents education
stations to undertake regular education services for youngsters.

beyond our borders, we have to work harder to overcome the
divisions that undermine the integrity and quality of life around

<HEADLINE> No Monarchy, Romanian President Stresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu said Saturday that no attempt to change the
republican system of the country will be allowed during his term
of office.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in response to a monarchy restoration
attempt by former King Mihai I.
</P>
<P>
Mihai, who returned to Romania on holidays, declared on
December 30, 1997 that he had chosen his eldest daughter as
successor to "all his rights."
</P>
<P>
Political parties and organizations in Romania have reacted
very strongly to the declaration, which they view as a restoration
attempt by Mihai, and urged the president to take a clear stand on
the issue in line with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu had to suspend his new year holidays on Saturday
and held a special press conference on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the government's earlier announcement on the legal
status of the former king, the president stressed that Mihai must
abide by the current constitution and respect the authority of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Mihai was free to return to Romania and live there. As for what
rights he was entitled to, parliament would work out a legal
definition on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party, the
Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party have expressed
their support for the republican political system, saying it best
suits the situation in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Mihai, 76, has been in exile overseas since he gave up his
throne in 1947, but has indicated recently plans to return to live
in Romania.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Sales Up 6.45 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- About 1.57 million motor
vehicles are estimated to have been sold in China in 1997, up 6.45
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, car sales are expected to hit 470,000 units, up
20.17 percent from 1996, the "China Daily" Business Weekly
reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, 40 percent of the automobiles were sold to private
buyers, according to a senior official from the Ministry of
the Machine-building Industry (MMBI).
</P>
<P>
Despite the dramatic increase in auto sales, "a
government-encouraged atmosphere favoring car purchase has yet to
arise," Zhang Xiaoyu, director of MMBI's Automotive Department,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the development of the auto sector lies in
fostering the market," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Business Weekly said analysts expect housing sales to enjoy a
brisk business this year-- a move that may have an impact on auto
purchases.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Opens Strongly in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The dollar entered the New Year
with a strong showing against the major world currencies,
reflecting doubts about the Japanese and German economies and
optimism about the United States economy.
</P>
<P>
In New York on Friday, the U.S. currency closed the holiday
week at 132.10 yen and surged to 1,771.91 Italian lire, compared
to the final quotation of 1,759.19 lire on New Year's eve.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that behind the rise of the dollar is the
widespread conviction that ongoing turbulence on the Asian markets
will continue and that the Japanese economy will remain weak in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
The lira has been following the general trend of decline against
the U.S. dollar and showed no reaction to a recent report that
Italy's 1997 budget deficit had been slashed to as low as 2.7
percent of the GDP.

<HEADLINE> Coal Firms to Be Listed on Stock Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China will choose 10 to 15 of
its best coal enterprises to issue shares on domestic stock markets
in the next three years, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
As part of an ambitious endeavor to invigorate the lumbering
coal sector, China will first reform four coal producers -- Datong,
Yanzhou, Pingdingshan and Kailuan coal mines -- as enterprise
groups.
</P>
<P>
After a series of trial reforms, the Ministry of the Coal
Industry is ready to restructure all large and medium-sized State
coal mines by the year 2000, Minister Wang Senhao was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
China has about 120 large-and medium-sized State coal firms.
The restructuring is aimed at establishing a clear and stringent
management system to encourage firms to seek more profits and to
protect State assets efficiently.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated China mined 1.33 billion tons of coal in
1997, down 3.2 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
China intentionally reduced coal output last year to give
state-owned firms more room to stem losses.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Adventurer Steve Fossett
today changed course to avoid Libya on his around-the-world
balloon odyssey and was heading toward the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
Fossett's Solo Spirit flight team said in St. Louis that
meteorologists guided the balloon to a path off Libya.
</P>
<P>
He could have been forced to abort the flight because he had
still not received permission to fly over the north African
nation.
</P>
<P>
Louis Billones, the team's chief meteorologist, said the balloon
was moving into a wind pattern to avoid Libya by dropping to about
15,000 feet (4,560 meters) over Germany.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Libya granted Fossett permission to fly over, but he
had already used up fuel trying to avoid Libyan airspace and fuel
shortage forced him to land in India.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, on his third attempt to balloon around the globe
without stop, passed through the Netherlands and Germany overnight
and was near Budapest by Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In the current mission, Fossett is carrying 50 percent more
fuel that is enough to last 20 days.
</P>
<P>
Fossett, a 53-year-old Chicago commodities broker, took off
from St. Louis Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Household-based Chinese Farmers Again Turn To Co-ops (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Cooperatives, which remind old
Chinese farmers of their unhappy times in the 1950 and '60s, are
emerging once again in rural areas. But the difference is that
farmers no longer see them as negative.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yumin of Laiyang City of east China's Shandong Province
was an eyewitness to the nationwide cooperative campaign at that
time. Now Wang, in his 60s, has set up a cooperative, the first in
his hometown.
</P>
<P>
"We were so naive then, taking it for granted that we could
purify our minds and live a better life just by working together,"
Wang said. "So we offered our means of production to the
collective in a hurry."
</P>
<P>
Wang admitted that he had been a staunch advocate of the
cooperative system, but that he now holds a different view.
</P>
<P>
China's rural reforms were actually initiated in 1978 by
farmers in Xiaogang Village of Fengyang County, Anhui Province,
when they risked prison to contract the collective's farmland in
secret on a household basis.
</P>
<P>
The late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping shared their idea and
spoke highly of the practice, which was later known as the
contract household responsibility system. Means of production,
including land, were returned to the farmers. The practice spread
around the country almost overnight, and helped the majority of
farmers rise from poverty within a few years.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Wang's village of Zhujiatong have solved their food
problem by growing wheat and maize. Since the mid-1980s, the 150
families in the village have been growing vegetables as a way to
achieve prosperity.
</P>
<P>
But problems cropped up as individual households were
vulnerable to market risks and losses because of shoddy pesticides
and chemical fertilizer.

<HEADLINE> 24,647 Assassinations in Colombia in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- 24,647 assassinations
were committed in Colombia last year, a figure of some 2,000 less
than that of 26,642 in 1996, says Saturday a report from the
Judicial Police Direction.
</P>
<P>
It can be gleaned from the figure of common homicides in 1997s,
that 68 persons died every day for these causes in Colombia,
almost three every hour.
</P>
<P>
The most violent department was Antioquia, where -- including
Medellin and Uraba -- 6,997 persons were assassinated.
</P>
<P>
The statistics of common homicides in the three main capitals
of the country is as follows: Medellin with 4,472 cases, Santafe
de Bogota with 2,702, and Cali with 1,753. The month in which more
assassinations were registered was May, with 2,192.
</P>
<P>
During 1997 6,175 persons in died of traffic accidents in
Colombia and 1,537 terrorist actions were perpetrated, says the
Colombian police report.
</P>
<P>
Last year 1,817 persons were kidnapped and 676 bank holdups
registered. Also 71,000 robberies were commited and 2,842 cases of
piracy on land registered.

<HEADLINE> Household-based Chinese Farmers Again Turn To Co-ops (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rest of China's rural areas faced the same
problem. Economists attributed this to the contradiction of
small-scale production and big markets, explaining that
household-based agriculture made it difficult for farmers to have
timely and sufficient services in areas such as information,
technology, distribution and processing.
</P>
<P>
So farmers had to improve their methods of production and
management to adapt to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Wang presented his plan for a co-op which stipulated
that there would be no change in farmland ownership. Forty-three
households agreed to the plan, each contributing 500 yuan. The
vegetable co-op was responsible for providing high-quality means
of production at low prices, and for helping farmers sell their
products.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of farmers have seen the benefits of
cooperatives. The city has established 413 co-ops covering nearly
70 percent of rural families.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the trend toward cooperation has been
expanding in rural China. In Anhui Province, for example, farmers
have also begun to cooperate in conserving water, planting trees
in mountainous areas and other projects. Some farmers have formed
special technical associations to collect market information and
to seek larger market shares for their products.
</P>
<P>
The fact that Chinese farmers have begun to cooperate all over
again doesn't necessarily mean that they have had enough of the
responsibility system. Farmers say they still like the system but
just want to improve it.

<HEADLINE> China Setting Up First Trading Market of Regenerated Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- China has established its first
state-level trading market of regenerated resources in Tianjin,
the largest industrial port city of north China.
</P>
<P>
It symbolizes that China has entered a new stage in the aspect
of retrieving and utilizing regenerated resources, said well-known
economist Wu Xiang, who was former deputy head of the Rural
Development Research Center of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the market is financed by the China
General Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Tianjin Municipal
Government. The China Regenerated Resources Corporation and the
Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative are responsible
for its operation.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the market has been listed as a major project
in the field.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is a center for collecting and distributing discarded
and used materials in north China. So far, it has 14 state-level
markets in operation.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the regenerated resources market will take
eight years to finish and will be carried out in three stages,
with the first stage completed last year.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005 will chalk up 5.66 billion yuan worth of

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Propose Medicare Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
next budget is expected to include proposals to expand Medicare to
offer benefits to people under age 65 and restore food stamp
benefits that legal immigrants lost in the 1996 welfare reform,
according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
The Medicare proposal would allow people between 62 and 64 to
pay up to 400 dollars a month for health coverage, according to
The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. That would mark
the first time that people under 65 could obtain coverage in the
three-decade history of Medicare -- the federal health insurance
program covering about 40 millions of elderly and disabled
Americans.
</P>
<P>
The plan would enable people who often cannot afford private
insurance a chance to obtain coverage and repay the fees through a
surcharge after they reach age 65.
</P>
<P>
The food stamp proposal would restore benefits lost through the
1996 welfare overhaul by legal immigrants who are not yet
citizens.
</P>
<P>
The administration is not yet sure whether the restored
benefits should apply to all legal immigrants or only those in the
country when the bill became law last August.
</P>
<P>
Both plans will be part of Clinton's fiscal 1999 budget to be
formally unveiled next month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Auto Sales Expected to Remain Steady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. auto sales are expected to
top 15 million units for the fourth straight year in 1997, local
newspaper Investor's Business Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Given high consumer confidence, strong employment and growing
income, analysts see 1998 as another good year for auto makers.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales in 1998 may reach 15.3 million units, the paper
quoted Chrysler economist Van Bussman as saying. The prediction
was agreed by many others who believe that U.S. demand for autos
will stay strong.
</P>
<P>
Car sales in millions of units are projected 7.91 for 1998,
7.93 for 1999 and 8.07 for 2000 and trucks sales in million of
units are forecast 6.58 for 1998, 6.6 for 1999 and 6.77 for 2000,
according to a research unit of Federal Reserve bank of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
Light trucks' share of U.S. auto market grew to 44 percent in
1997 from some 25 percent in the early 80s.
</P>
<P>
Analysts see new truck products to continue improving U.S. auto
competitiveness as the Big Three, namely GM, Chrysler and Ford
have an advantage in quality and other consumer concerns.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts predict that U.S. auto makers may see
challenges from Japan and difficulties to further penetrate into
other Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
A depreciating Yen is to put Japanese makers in a good position
to increase their U.S. market share especially of compact cars.
</P>
<P>
Financial turmoil in Asia has already stalled U.S. auto exports
to countries such as Thailand and Malaysia considered the fastest
growing markets until recently.

NEW YORK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Personal computer is in
growing demand in the United States and the trend towards cheaper
PCs is expected to continue in 1998, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. PC unit sales are expected to rise to 36.7 million in 1998
from 31.9 million last year, U.S. International Data Corp. said in
its latest report.
</P>
<P>
By 2001, sales may hit close to 50 million, it added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from other sources show that household PC
penetration in the U.S. may grow from 38.2 percent in 1997 to 40.3
percent this year and 47.8 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
One of the big stories in the U.S. technology market last year
was that over 30 percent of PCs were selling for under 1,000 U.S.
dollars per unit, as a result of the market expansion strategy.
</P>
<P>
The hot-selling sub-$1,000 PCs are to give up to sub-$800
models in 1998, market watchers predicted.
</P>
<P>
PC giant Hewlett-Packard Co. is leading the way to change the
strategy by introducing a $799 PC which uses a 200-megahertz Intel
chip, local newspaper Investor's Business Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
With profit margins narrowing under the price competition, more
consolidation is expected to occur among market players and it is
easier for the big ones to survive, analysts said.

JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu will visit Washington on January 20 and hold

</P>
<P>
This decision was reached earlier this evening between

</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also briefed Albright over telephone on the budget

</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Albright that the 1998 state budget is
scheduled to go through the second and the third readings in the
Knesset (parliament) on Monday and after that he will travel to
Washington for talks with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset was originally scheduled to vote on the 1998 state
budget Thursday night, but the voting was postponed again after
Foreign Minister David Levy said in the same day that his Gesher
party will vote against it.
</P>
<P>
Levy lashed out at the government's socio-economic policy,
saying that the promises Netanyahu made to him last summer to aid
the poor and low-waged are ignored in the proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the government's foreign policy and doubted
it will agree on further troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who also threatened to resign on Thursday, will not
attend the weekly cabinet meeting on Sunday, his party sources
said. The Gesher party now holds five seats in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said on Thursday that he will not let Levy resign,
because the government will collapse without Levy and his
party.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Falling Prices Could Affect Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- There are valid reasons for
wishing to avoid ongoing declines in the general price level,
because falling prices may not be such a good thing after all, the
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said today.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan made these remarks at the annual meeting of the
American Economic Association and American Finance Association
held in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
He noted deflation isn't destructive if it takes place at a
time of a rapid growth in productivity.
</P>
<P>
"For example, in the high-tech sector of our economy today, we
observe falling prices together with rapid investment and high
profitability," he said.
</P>
<P>
Seeking for some reassurance on deflation, Greenspan made it
clear that the Central Bank would seek to avoid it just as it
seeks to avoid inflation. The Fed's goal has been price stability,
and overall price changes are so small that they don't affect the
decisions of businesses and consumers.

"Even a moderate rate of inflation can hamper economic
performance," Greenspan said, stressing that "moderate rates of
deflation would most probably lead to similar problems. Deflation,
like inflation, would distort resource allocation and interfere
with the economy's ability to reach its full potential."
</P>
<P>
Besides, he added, deflation would produce an upward bias in
real wages. That's not bad for those holding onto their jobs, but
it probably means fewer jobs and higher unemployment than would
otherwise be the case.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a rapid drop in the price of assets such as real
estate and stocks historically has "held the potential to be a
virulently negative force in the economy," Greenspan said.

According to the U.S. official statistics, prices paid to
producers such as factories and food processing plants declined at
a 1.2 percent annual rate during the first 11 months of 1997.
Consumer price inflation, including services, rose at a scant 1.8
percent rate during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Most U.S. analysts expect inflation to maintain at that level
or even increase slightly this year. But a few warn of deflation,
especially if a flood of cheap imports from economically ailing
Asian nations forces domestic manufacturers to cut their prices to
stay competitive.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military to End Hay Airlift to New Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Six U.S. C-130 cargo planes
are ending an emergency airlift of hay to cattle and sheep that
were stranded in a severe snowstorm in southeast New Mexico as
ranchers can reach their herds now, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
The New Mexico Department of Public Safety said that the
whether was improving and many ranchers could get out to their
herds.
</P>
<P>
The department said about 460 tons of hay would have been
dropped to the animals by C- 130 planes from Air National Guard
bases in Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, Minnesota and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
The Farm Services Agency offices from the U. S. Department of
Agriculture estimated that at least 5,000 animals have been killed
by severe cold and heavy snowstorms since Christmas Eve, and New
Mexican officials feared that about 180,000 more are at risk.
