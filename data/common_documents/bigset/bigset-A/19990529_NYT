YANKEES BEAT JAYS, 10-6  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TORONTO _ Logic says Jason Grimsley is not really this good. His
first 14 years in pro ball were undistinguished. He won fewer than
half his 149 minor league decisions, and before this year, his
earned run average in the majors was 5.39.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it that at age 31 Grimsley has become unhittable?
</P>
<P>
   He relieved Andy Pettitte with runners on base and the tying run
at the plate Friday night, and while throwing one type of pitch
almost exclusively _ a fastball that sinks a foot or so _ Grimsley
pinched off a Toronto rally before the Yankees hitters blew open
the game with four runs in the seventh inning en route to a 10-6
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter had three doubles and a sacrifice fly and has
reached base in every game this season, Scott Brosius drove in
three runs and Joe Girardi had two of the team's 16 hits. The 1999
Yankees are emerging from the shadows of '98: they have won six of
their last eight games, their offense is stirring, they are playing
terrific defense, running the bases aggressively and getting great
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley represents the significant accomplishment of Don
Zimmer's tenure as the Yankees' interim manager. When Jeff Nelson
got hurt and Mike Stanton pitched erratically, Zimmer ignored
Grimsley's pedigree and gave him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two months into the season, Grimsley's stuff is as dominant
as any pitcher's in the American League. Mariano Rivera blew away
opposing hitters with his high fastball in 1996; like Rivera,
Grimsley is throwing an overpowering pitch, but his dives in the
strike zone. Opposing batters are hitting .150 against Grimsley,
and he is 4-0 with a 1.98 e.r.a.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it's like trying to hit a sinker like that _ it's
like trying to hit a shot-put,'' said Chuck Knoblauch, who laughed
when asked about the movement of Grimsley's fastball.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Homer Bush said, ``It was the best sinker I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored three runs in the top of the sixth inning to
assume a 6-3 advantage, but Pettitte (3-2) was nearing 100 pitches
and allowed back-to-back hits in the bottom of the sixth. With one
out, Yankees Manager Joe Torre waved to the bullpen for Grimsley.
</P>
<P>
   What Grimsley is doing could not be more simple. He grips the
ball with his right index and middle fingers close together,
between the seams, his fingertips resting in the spot where a
player might sign an autograph, and he throws as hard as he can.
There is no mystery. There is no deception. The hitters read
scouting reports and see videotape, and they know that he throws
his sinker 95 percent of the time. They cannot hit it.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Lennon struck out on six pitches, Bush whiffed on four,
all sinking fastballs. Grimsley looked like a 15-year-old giant
pitching against tee-ball players.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush walked away from the plate, stunned, he turned and asked
the home plate umpire, Marty Foster, if any of the pitches Grimsley
threw him were strikes. Later, Bush recalled his at-bat against
Grimsley, holding his hand waist high and said, ``The ball started
out here.'' Bush lowered his hand to just below his knees. ``And
went to here.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley's sinker is unusual in that it moves vertically,
straight down, rather than at a downward 45-degree angle, like that
of Ramiro Mendoza. The movement on Grimsley's pitch is so violent
that scouts sitting behind home plate have asked one another if
Grimsley is throwing a split-fingered fastball. Seattle Manager Lou
Piniella accused Grimsley of scuffing the ball, which is illegal.
Boston's Jose Offerman grabbed the ball after striking out against
Grimsley on Wednesday and checked it for cuts. There were no marks,
no spit; there was nothing to be found. ``It's like a dry
spitter,'' Stanton said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Mel Queen, Toronto's pitching coach: ``If the ball is being
scuffed, he ain't doing it; somebody's doing it for him, because I
was watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley got two ground-ball outs in the seventh, and with a
no-ball, two-strike count, Shannon Stewart looked for a sinker, and
Grimsley spun a curveball for the third strike. Unfair, players
like to say.
</P>
<P>
   He had always had good stuff, Torre remembered, but it was
always a question of consistency. Rather than throw three or four
different pitches, Grimsley began throwing his sinker on almost
every pitch last year, after moving to the bullpen. Recently, he
began to work with a sports psychologist, who has given Grimsley
several specific keys to think about, to focus on, as he pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley did not pitch in the majors in 1997 or '98, and the
Yankees signed him to a minor league contract before the '99
season, giving him a $10,000 signing bonus. It's safe to say he's
been worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sinker is unbelievable,'' Girardi said. ``The movement is
so hard, and it's so late.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter said, ``His pitches are moving so much right now, he
probably has no idea where it's going.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Toronto right fielder Shawn Green was hit by a pitch from Andy
Pettitte in the fourth inning Friday night and sustained a small
fracture in the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are expected to trade catcher Mike Figga shortly.
The Los Angeles Dodgers may or may not be his destination, but the
Dodgers want to trade first baseman Eric Karros and shift the
struggling catcher Todd Hundley to first base. In preparing for
that, the Dodgers could be in the market for a catcher.

ALL THE LITTLE THINGS ADD UP
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Adrian Beltre
back-pedaled on a grounder and Atlanta scored two runs. Second
baseman Eric Young dropped a ball on a play in which manager Davey
Johnson thought a baserunner would be thrown out stealing.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers won't be able to put together a significant winning
stretch until the little things are executed properly, and
Johnson's patience is waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't give runs away,'' Johnson said after the Dodgers' 4-2
loss to the Braves on Friday. ``I thought (catcher Todd) Hundley
had the guy at second and (Young) drops the ball. Beltre retreats
on a ball we could have a double play on. We have to make those
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Both plays came in the fifth inning when the Braves scored twice
to take a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get mad at a guy for making a physical error,''
Johnson said. ``But (Beltre's) play, that's a borderline mental
error because he retreats. We have some learning to do, some
growing to do. But we have to get it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Dodgers' losses on the current nine-game road can be
attributed to not making the little plays at a crucial time.
</P>
<P>
   The first loss came in Cincinnati when Hundley dropped a third
strike and threw wildly to first. The problem was compounded when
first base Eric Karros couldn't get to a grounder to his right that
led to two in a 3-2 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's been so far on this road trip,'' Karros said.
``Before then it was a little pitching, some other little things.
We haven't put it all together. It seems like it's one thing or
another.''
</P>
<P>
   Dejection in Vero Beach: The news that Florida governor Jeb Bush
vetoed a bill Thursday that would appropriate $7.5 million in funds
to the city of Vero Beach and Indian River County and aid greatly
in keeping the Dodgers in Dodgertown brought disappointment to the
area.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the local government with $13 million worth of funding
for a project estimated to cost more than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stunning,'' said Dodgertown managing director Craig
Callan, a Vero Beach resident. ``Completely out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general counsel Sam Fernandez and director of business
development Fred Coons will travel to Vero Beach next week to meet
with city and county officials. But Callan, an employee of the
Dodgers, said the outlook wasn't very good for keeping the Dodgers
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to meet with city and county officials to make
sure we haven't left any stones unturned,'' Callan said. ``When the
$7.5 million was identified (as being a possibility) I thought we
were heading in the right direction with the city and state. Now,
it makes it a lot tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   It could make it virtually impossible. Callan said when the
meeting takes place it could be a situation in which the city and
county say they've done all they can do for the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Fort McDowell Indian Community
president Bernadine Boyd said it was possible the Yavapai Tribe,
located near Phoenix, could cut the cost from $50 million to near
$35 million for a proposed spring training complex for the Dodgers.
Most of the expenses would be cut if the project didn't include a
second set of practice fields and amenities for a second
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Precautionary X-rays on Dodgers
outfielder Todd Hollandsworth's ailing rib cage were negative. He's
expected to miss the remaining to games against Atlanta after
straining his rib cage while swinging Thursday in Cincinnati....
Dodgers utility infielder Jose Vizcaino, on the disabled list with
a left hamstring strain, remains in Los Angeles rehabbing. He can
be activated Tuesday in Pittsburgh but Johnson said he's not sure
whether that will happen. ``He's still just jogging,'' Johnson
said.

   LUBBOCK _ Although Jerry Augustine spent nine seasons pitching
for the Milwaukee Brewers, it is doubtful that anything ever moved
him to the descriptive heights he reached yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we're a little nervous ... you know, being around all
these media people,'' he said. ``Normally, we got one guy that
writes something every four or five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, this is probably the biggest moment in the history of
this school _ ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach spoke after watching his Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panthers
roll to a stunning 8-4 victory over top-seeded Rice in the opening
round of the NCAA regionals.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls (52-12) came into the tournament as the top-ranked team
in the nation in two of the four major polls. The Panthers (31-27),
who lost their first eight games and got off to a 1-11 start, are
the first team in the history of the Midwestern Collegiate
Conference to make the NCAA playoffs. They are the first team from
the state of Wisconsin to enter postseason play in a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher-designated hitter Chad Sadowski, who had three of his
team's 15 hits and threw eight shutout innings after the Owls
scored four times in the first, acknowledged that ``this was
definitely the biggest game of my college career. I threw the last
three innings on adrenalin.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss marked the first time in five regionals that Rice has
lost the opening game, and broke an eight-game winning streak for
the Owls at Dan Law Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were ready to play, but that guy pitched a heck
of a game and they did a great job hitting the ball,'' said Rice
coach Wayne Graham, who withheld staff ace Mario Ramos for the
presumably more crucial second game of the tournament. The Panthers
drove starter Jeff Nichols (13-3) from the mound in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kinda fired us up, knowing that they underestimated us,''
said right-fielder Brett Huebner, who led the Panthers' attack with
four hits. ``During the first inning, I was thinking, `Oh, no _ I
don't want to end up saying we're just happy to be here.' But after
we got out of that and started getting a few hits, I felt real
good.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Sadowski, who kept mowing down the Owls. Meanwhile, the
Panthers kept scoring runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what his pitch count was, but I told him after
the sixth he'd thrown 40 and not to worry about it,'' Augustine
said. ``Seriously, what this tells us is that we can play with
anyone.''
Texas Tech 5, Rutgers 2
</P>
<P>
   Defense was the key in the second game _ Texas Tech (41-15) had
it, Rutgers (37-20) didn't, and the Red Raiders walked off with a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we may have found ourselves,'' said Tech coach Larry
Hays, who practiced his team hard for a week after going 0-2 in the
Big 12 tournament. ``I thought we played tremendous defense, and I
liked our approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers starter James Wilson pitched well but made throwing
errors on three bunts that led to three unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Tech got stellar play in the outfield, as center fielder Marco
Cunningham made three outstanding catches, left fielder Ryan Ruiz
killed a rally with a diving catch, and right fielder Chris Sampson
picked up a potential single and threw the batter out at first.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Wright (10-4) gave up two unearned runs while becoming the
first pitcher in Tech history to hit double figures in victories
for three consecutive years.

EX-POLICE OFFICER TO PLEAD GUILTY TO CRASH THAT KILLED ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A former Bellevue police officer will plead guilty to
charges of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault for a deadly
car wreck that stunned the community in the first hours of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Thomas, 29, told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Friday he
accepts responsibility for the Jan. 1 wreck that killed one
passenger in his car and left the other, a Washington State Patrol
trooper, facing a grueling rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas knows he will spend time in prison. King County
prosecutors want him to serve four years.
</P>
<P>
   He will live with the guilt of lives devastated and the nagging
wish he had called a cab.
</P>
<P>
   He never again can be a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who will enter his guilty plea in King County Superior
Court Tuesday morning, wants people to realize an alcohol-related
tragedy could happen to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a police officer, I was trained to know what the effect of
alcohol was, and I made a bad judgment, anyway,'' he said. ``It
doesn't matter who you are _ if you get behind the wheel when
you've been drinking, you take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was out to celebrate the New Year and the birthday of his
best friend, State Patrol Trooper Jeremy Reid. He was driving that
night, and he thought he was being careful.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his last drink three hours before he left a Seattle
party early Jan. 1, he said. He felt sober, and he even tested
himself with the portable breath test he used in his job as a
Bellevue police officer.
</P>
<P>
   It was not enough to avert tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he ``had a couple drinks'' at his house on New
Year's Eve before he and his friends, Reid and Reid's childhood
friend, Brian Grooms of Ohio, went to a dance party promoted by a
Seattle radio station at the Seattle Center.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he had ``a couple'' more drinks _ he would not say
what kind _ and they stayed for several hours. When they decided to
leave, Thomas said they passed around the portable breath test.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he blew a 0.07 percent, which is just below the
state's legal limit for intoxication. He said both of his friends
failed and unanimously affirmed Thomas would drive.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he was speeding _ prosecutors say he may have doubled
the posted 40-mph speed limit _ when his 1998 Dodge Stratus veered
out of control on south Bellevue's Coal Creek Parkway and crossed
the center line just after 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It smashed into a Ford Expedition driven by John Bell, a
Bellevue man police say also was intoxicated. Bell was not hurt,
but his wife suffered neck and leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Grooms, 26, who was riding in the back seat, died at the scene.
Reid was so badly hurt he remained in a coma for 19 days.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas suffered broken ribs and a concussion, and a Bellevue
police officer who responded said his off-duty colleague smelled of
liquor and appeared intoxicated, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   A blood test indicated Thomas' blood-alcohol level was 0.08
roughly two hours after the crash. By new legal standards that had
just gone into effect at midnight, prosecutors say Thomas was
drunk.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his guilty plea, King County prosecutors agreed
to recommend that Thomas spend four years in prison, the middle of
the approximate 3{- to 4{-year standard sentencing range.
</P>
<P>
   A sentencing hearing probably will be scheduled during the next
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' attorney, John Wolfe, said he will ask the judge for a
sentence lower than the standard range. Victims' consent can be
mitigating in the eyes of the law, said Wolfe, who could argue Reid
and Grooms knew Thomas had been drinking when they climbed into his
car.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Thomas' apparent alcohol level being near the legal
borderline, he said did not want to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was responsible for the accident, and knowing that, it would
not be right to fight it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has little recollection of the predawn wreck, which stunned
the Bellevue Police Department and the community. He has only
blurred memories of an ambulance ride and awakening, painfully, at
Seattle's Harborview Medical Center to the bitter reality he'll
live with the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The guilt still racks his thoughts and occasionally steals his
sleep at night. He has told both Reid and Grooms' mother he is
sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of being an officer and being involved in the first
alcohol-related fatality under new state drunken-driving laws
thrust Thomas into the spotlight _ and onto the side of the law he
thought he'd never be.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I wanted to help people, and now to be considered
a criminal by society _ it's tough,'' he said, slowly shaking his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the crash, Thomas resigned from the Bellevue
Police Department, where he had worked 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a solemn interview yesterday in his attorney's Seattle
office, Thomas' eyes lighted up to talk about Reid _ and the latest
hurdle in his recovery. Friday, Reid was released in a wheelchair
from Ohio State University Medical Center and allowed to go home
with his mother, who lives in the small town of Washington Court
House.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was thrilled Reid, his best friend whom he calls every
few days, was improving. Reid is learning to walk with a cane and
will undergo extensive physical and speech therapy, according to
State Patrol spokesman Capt. Eric Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy's stubborn. He'll walk again, and he says he's going to
come back and be a trooper,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Reid met several years ago at Fort Lewis in Pierce
County, where they were stationed in the Army. A strong friendship
and playful rivalry grew out of their shared love of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Reid's mother would discuss her son's condition only
through Robertson. But she has previously expressed support, not
blame, for her son's friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other punishment or prison time will change the life
sentence Eric will live with,'' Carol Reid said in a statement in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Thomas has picked up a few odd jobs. Once envisioning
becoming Bellevue's police chief someday, he now does not know what
his life will hold. ``I made a terrible mistake,'' he said. ``I
wish I could change it, but I can't.''

WHEN PETS HURT, TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSION, KAN. _ It is 7 p.m. Wednesday when the clinic
loudspeaker blares: ``Tech to the front!'' a call that often
signifies an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Hamill, an assistant, runs from the clinic's treatment
room, returning in moments with a small animal carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   Inside it is a beautiful white cat named Cody. The owner,
Roseann Granda, had raced to the clinic when Cody suddenly
collapsed after a dramatic hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   At Mission MedVet such dire moments are almost routine.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic treats animals hit by bullets and hit by cars. In
recent days it treated a dog with a locust thorn lodged deeply in
its back; a dog that swallowed a fish hook; a cat with a jagged
piece of chain-link fence through its face; a puppy that ate fly
poison.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the treatment room, two vets, Katherine Spry and Robin
Wall, hover over the semi-conscious white cat. Wall quickly shaves
the cat's left front leg with clippers and takes his vital signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lousy arterial pulse,'' she says to Spry. ``What do we know
about this case?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 8 years old. He had his vaccinations today. No other
history of recent illness. It may be anaphylaxis (an allergic
reaction) caused by the shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Spry looks up suddenly. ``Whoa, the pulse just plummeted,'' she
says. ``It's down to 80 from 180.''
</P>
<P>
   Blister packs containing disposable medical equipment start
flying around the table as the vets and technicians reach for
tubes, syringes, needles, medication bottles and bandages.
</P>
<P>
   Wall injects atrapine to stimulate the cat's heart. She inserts
an IV shunt in the cat's left rear leg. Hamill holds an oxygen mask
over Cody's face. Wall attaches EKG monitor leads.
</P>
<P>
   Spry takes blood samples and rapidly runs a series of tests.
</P>
<P>
   The cat's blood glucose is so low the lab machine cannot measure
it accurately. The blood protein level is at one-sixth the normal
level. The red cell count is low and dropping.
</P>
<P>
   Wall injects glucose, drips lactated ringer's solution through
the IV. She begins a blood transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's bleeding into its gut,'' she says. ``I want to
call in another specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   She calls Janet Peterson, a veterinary internist and a senior
member of the clinic staff. Peterson arrives at 8:32. She stares at
the cat for a long time. She feels his pulses, orders an X-ray,
injects steroids, shakes her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very strange,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later the cat vomits blood. His temperature drops to
95, five degrees below normal. He is hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we may be seeing a syndrome called D.I.C.
(disseminating intravascular coagulation),'' Peterson says. ``That
means the cat has developed so many small clots that it's used up
its clotting factor. Now it's bleeding everywhere. This is a
dramatic case.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9:45, a technician places the cat in an incubator to fight
the lowering body temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson attends other cases, but always returns to the
incubator. There she paces back and forth for almost an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else to do for this poor cat,'' she murmurs
to herself. ``I don't know what else to do.'' New trend
</P>
<P>
   Mission MedVet was created six years ago by a veterinary surgeon
named David Allen. It is one of four emergency animal treatment
clinics in greater Kansas City and represents a new trend in animal
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the last 10 years or so, you didn't find many veterinary
specialists outside universities,'' said Robin Wall, a specialist
in critical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're set up to handle nighttime emergencies and to treat
referrals from other veterinarians.''
</P>
<P>
   The clinic, which has two operating rooms, a radiology
department and a special procedures room, is staffed by 10
veterinarians, seven of whom are board-certified specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the problems it sees are considered life threatening.
Many involve toxins. Puppy in trouble
</P>
<P>
   At 9:15 Monday evening, Randa Rawlins of Kansas City knew her
puppy, Callie Jo, was in real danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was cowering in a corner, foaming at the mouth,'' Rawlins
said. ``She seemed terrified. She was having trouble walking. She
was trembling all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawlins carried the dog, an 11-month-old border collie mix, down
to her Ford Explorer and drove rapidly to Mission MedVet.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarian on duty that night was Thomas Mick. He examined
the dog immediately. She seemed to be in the throes of a seizure:
intense spasms, disorientation, rolling eyeballs, constant
salivation.
</P>
<P>
   Her temperature was 107.9. The normal temperature for a dog is
between 100 and 102 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Mick suspected a toxic substance and questioned Rawlins
carefully. Could the puppy have eaten anything unusual?
</P>
<P>
   ``We put out some slug bait...'' Rawlins said, and even as she
spoke those words she saw what she later described as ``bright
lights going on in Dr. Mick's eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mick knew instantly that Callie Jo had ingested a poison called
metaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the main ingredient in slug and snail bait,'' he said.
``And it induces symptoms that look exactly like a seizure. But
what's really happening is that the poison is blocking certain
muscle inhibitor cells, and so the animal's muscle fibers begin
firing constantly and uncontrollably.''
</P>
<P>
   The animal's intense, ceaseless muscle spasms generate
tremendous body heat, a kind of self-induced hyperthermia that can
exceed 110 degrees. Untreated, the condition causes severe brain
and liver damage and then death.
</P>
<P>
   To stall the tremors, Mick injected Valium. He ordered a cooling
bath to decrease the dog's temperature, and started an intravenous
drip of pentobarbital to anesthetize the animal and calm the
spasms.
</P>
<P>
   He kept the dog anesthetized all night.
</P>
<P>
   Mick and several technicians took turns sitting with Callie Jo
through the night and into the following morning. The puppy was
never alone. Success and failure
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m. Thursday, Cody the cat died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been a reaction to its vaccinations,'' said
Peterson, ``but I suspect septic shock caused by some underlying
condition that simply overwhelmed its system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sorry about that little guy. He fought very hard,
didn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Callie Jo, the puppy who ate slug poison, went home late
Wednesday afternoon. She was wobbly but alert and happy. There were
no signs of permanent damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't have made it without this place,'' said her
owner. ``They knew exactly what to do.''  &LR; tag1:To reach Joe Popper,

JOURNALISTS QUESTION NEWSPAPERS' COURT FILINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The bitter dispute between Jeffrey Katzenberg and
The Walt Disney Co. took a bizarre turn this week as the Los
Angeles Times and four other news organizations sought a court
order to keep documents about Katzenberg's DreamWorks SKG secret.
</P>
<P>
   Some journalists within the news organizations questioned the
unusual tactic, since media normally try to get information made
available to them, and prominent media attorney Pierce O'Donnell
withdrew the motion a day after it was filed.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Ben Bagdikian, former dean of the graduate school of
journalism at the University of California at Berkeley, sharply
criticized the friend-of-the-court filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in almost 50 years in journalism and
media research that I have heard that the managements of news
organizations _ including important national ones _ filed a brief
asking a court in a civil case to keep secret (including from their
own organizations) documents in which the news organizations are
not directly involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all the more bizarre that this happens to be a highly
publicized case that these news organizations have been covering in
considerable detail.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode _ involving the Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles Daily
Journal, Time magazine, Variety and the Wall Street Journal _ left
the publications ``with egg on their faces,'' according to the
Hollywood Reporter, which carried a story in Friday's edition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a mistake,'' Karlene Goller, deputy general counsel
for the Los Angeles Times, said through a spokesman Friday. ``These
papers should not have been filed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagdikian said he was particularly disturbed by the trend of
reporters and editors deferring to business considerations in news
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is ominous to me is the possibility that the growing
intrusion of the business offices of news organizations into the
selection and presentation of news has gone so far that the
corporate side of major news organizations now act more as fellow
corporations in a corporate case and not as detached journalistic
observers covering the case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The original filing, made Wednesday by O'Donnell, appeared to
place the organizations on the side of Katzenberg _ one of the
founders of DreamWorks _ because it backed his motion that the
DreamWorks documents should not be allowed in the record. The
filing said the documents were ``not relevant'' and had been
submitted by Disney ``in bad faith'' and were intended to
``punish'' Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``DreamWorks has been reluctantly dragged into this dispute,''
the filing said. ``While we do not want to be drawn into this
bitter feud, we cannot support such bad faith litigation tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Reporter said unidentified reporters at one of the
organizations had ``gone ballistic'' after learning of the filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised and disappointed,'' said Daily Journal Editor
Katrina Dewey in describing her reaction to the original filing.
``I would say that because of miscommunication, I was not apprised
of the brief before it was filed. We decided, in consultation with
the other entities, that this was a position we did not support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times also filed a notice Thursday substituting a new
attorney for O'Donnell on media issues, Goller said.
</P>
<P>
   The filings occurred following last week's major victory for
Katzenberg, who is suing Disney for more than $250million that he
claims he is owed after spending a decade heading Disney's film
studio. Retired judge Paul Breckenridge ruled on May 19 that Disney
had breached its fiduciary duty and owed Katzenberg interest worth
millions of dollars on the yet-to-be-determined bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Time, Variety and the Wall Street Journal did not respond Friday
to requests for comment. For his part, O'Donnell stressed that the
filing included language that stressed the public's right to
DreamWorks documents if they remain part of the public record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also want to emphasize that the position we took in court
was previously approved by our clients,'' O'Donnell said in an
interview. ``I can see how the filing might be misinterpreted that
we were taking sides. That was never our intent.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewey pointed out that O'Donnell had successfully argued last
month on behalf of the organizations that Katzenberg's suit be open
to the public. ``I hope no one loses sight that this filing would
not have been an issue if we had not been successful in opening
this part of trial,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Oudenkirk made the ruling
on April 15, spurning Disney's arguments that the case should be
closed because it will include information about its film-release
strategies that would help rivals. But he also gave lawyers the
opportunity to make a case before Breckenridge as to why some of
the documents should be kept under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Disney claimed in a filing earlier this week that its planning
documents qualify as trade secrets and that the DreamWorks
documents show that Katzenberg ``considered a virtually identical
type of planning and forecasting document to qualify for the
highest level of confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   It pointed out that DreamWorks executives have provided legal
advice to Katzenberg, have attended court hearings and are expected
to provide testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``To claim, as DreamWorks does now, that Disney has somehow
dragged DreamWorks into this case is disingenuous at best,''
Disney's filing said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg left Disney in 1994 after a falling-out with Chairman
Michael Eisner and sued the Burbank-based entertainment giant in
1996, citing failure of the company to pay him the bonus he was
owed. Disney paid Katzenberg a partial settlement of $117million in
1997, and the current phase will determine how much more Disney
will have to pay.

PETROLEUM SPILLS REMAIN A HAZARD, AS RECENT SPILL IN KANSAS SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When it comes to petroleum disasters, the
textbook example occurred in the wilds of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The Exxon Valdez ran aground and leaked crude oil, causing an
environmental catastrophe that grabbed the national limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, however, the potential for another kind of
calamity lurks underground, along 157,000 miles of pipelines that
transport hazardous liquids around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What happened recently near Atchison, Kan. _ a pipeline breaking
and dumping diesel fuel into a creek _ isn't rare.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the spills don't involve much petroleum. But in 1998,
U.S. Transportation Department statistics show, an average of three
pipeline incidents occurred each week in the United States. The
combined weekly damage toll exceeded $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what can happen, when things go awry as petroleum
products flow beneath the ground:
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, a spill in southeast Kansas sent 34,000 gallons of
light crude oil down the Verdigris River, polluting water into
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, oil from a spill in Missouri flowed along the
Chariton River south of Kirksville, fouling the banks for 35 miles,
coating beavers and killing fish.
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline breaks can claim human casualties. In 1996, a pipeline
transporting liquid butane ruptured in Texas. A truck drove into
the resulting vapor cloud, an explosion occurred, and two persons
died.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the threat from pipelines could be downplayed before
environmental concerns took center stage and before petroleum
mishaps were telecast live into people's homes. But no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The era of buried pipelines operating out of sight and out of
mind is over,'' said Kelley Coyner, a Transportation Department
administrator in Washington who oversees the Office of Pipeline
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The office, she told a congressional hearing earlier this year,
has taken an assertive approach to safety, while at the same time
addressing the industry's need for flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline operators say they spend large sums to head off the
threats. Environmental groups, faulting both federal law and
federal regulators, say a lot more should be done.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has worsened recently, according to the
Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Office of Pipeline Safety has an extremely poor record of
enforcing existing and developing new safety requirements,'' said
Lois Epstein, senior engineer with the environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she said, pipeline incidents spilled 7.7 million
gallons of hazardous liquids, more than any year since 1991.
Cleanup efforts recovered some of that.
</P>
<P>
   Office of Pipeline Safety experts say the agency has increased
spending and employees, and has been striving to improve its
performance. Pipelines, they point out, remain the safest way of
transporting petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   When spills do happen, the causes vary. Corrosion is one
culprit. So is damage caused by construction companies working near
pipelines. Natural disasters such as floods can damage pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Williams Pipeline Co., which operated the
pipeline that ruptured north of Atchison on May 10 and spilled
200,000 gallons of diesel fuel, use a variety of techniques to head
off trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're doing more of the right things in the right
places,'' said Mike Pearson of Tulsa, manager of the refined
products control center for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Using satellite communications, the company monitors the flow of
petroleum in each pipeline 24 hours a day, he said. When a drop in
pressure occurs _ an indication of a spill _ the pipeline can be
automatically shut down from the Tulsa center.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent corrosion, the company runs a small electric charge
through its pipelines, he said. Also, he said, the company employs
``smart pigs,'' devices that are run through a pipeline to check
for such things as cracks and deteriorating steel.
</P>
<P>
   Of 12.2 billion barrels of petroleum transported by pipelines in
one recent year, the Office of Pipeline Safety says, only about
0.00127 percent spilled.
</P>
<P>
   The office wields clout over pipeline companies but draws
criticism for not being aggressive enough.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Jim
Hall, said that the office deserves a failing grade.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Klinger, spokeswoman for the Office of Pipeline Safety,
said: ``We are working very hard to improve our program, and we
continue to work hard. We've doubled our staff, we're doubling our
efforts in a lot of ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Defense Fund recommends several steps, such as
toughening standards on pipeline leak detection systems, granting
states more authority over pipeline safety, and giving citizens new
power to take enforcement actions by filing lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency regional office in Kansas
City, Kan., which has been overseeing cleanup of the Atchison
spill, keeps specialists on call 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Experts from Kansas agencies are also keeping watch in Atchison.
The Missouri Natural Resources Department increased its hazardous
spill staff two years ago. Some of those experts are in Atchison,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup work, performed by the pipeline company and its private
contractors, is nearly complete.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly the worst pipeline incident in Kansas history occurred
10 years ago, north of Wichita, when construction equipment
accidentally caused a rupture in a line operated by Kaneb Pipe Line
Co., state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   More than 450,000 gallons of gasoline flowed out. The petroleum
was kept in a confined space, away from water.
</P>
<P>
   Damage was far greater in central Missouri in 1988, when a
pipeline carrying crude oil across the Gasconade River ruptured and
sent 840,000 gallons of crude into the Gasconade and Missouri
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McKinney, a spokesman for Shell in Houston, still remembers
witnessing the damage.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later the Anheuser-Busch brewery in St. Louis shut
down because of worries its beer might be tainted.
</P>
<P>
   These days, McKinney said, inspectors for Shell and Texaco,
which jointly operate the pipeline, fly along its route about twice
a month looking for construction or other activity that might cause
trouble.

MAN ACCUSED OF BUILDING ON SOMEONE ELSE'S LAND WITH STOLEN
MATERIALS

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Someone apparently wanted his own hunting
cabin in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, police say, is that he was using someone else's
materials to build that cabin on someone else's property.
</P>
<P>
   Adam A. Park, 21, of Kearney this week pleaded not guilty in
Clay County Associate Circuit Court to a felony stealing charge. He
also has been charged in Platte County with two misdemeanor counts
of stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Police say that in the last month someone stole thousands of
dollars worth of building materials _ lumber, windows, doors,
roofing and even a skylight _ from seven Northland construction
sites to build a 576-square-foot, one-story cabin on 200 acres of
woods in Kansas City, North.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that when the man who is leasing the land for
farming noticed tire tracks on the land, he investigated.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered the construction site. By that time, the cabin was
partly framed with corner posts.
</P>
<P>
   The man telephoned the property owner in California to ask when
he had decided to build a house on the land.
</P>
<P>
   The owner said he had not.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was leasing the property called police and told them
that he knew Park had hunted on the land and that he had seen
Park's truck on the property several times recently.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Pentagon on Friday torpedoed Litton
Industries Inc.'s proposed $1.9 billion acquisition of Newport News
Shipbuilding Inc., saying the potential cost savings to the
government are not big enough to justify less competition among
shipbuilders.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with reporters in Washington on Friday, Defense
Secretary William Cohen said a Litton-Newport News combination
would be ``contrary to our interests in maintaining separate
facilities'' for naval shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
   And although the government's stance is based on the U.S. Navy's
preliminary assessment of the deal, Cohen said it is probably the
final word on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the government indicated it would not object
to Litton's proposed $500 million cash acquisition of Avondale
Industries Inc., a New Orleans-based builder of amphibious assault
vessels, support ships for the Navy and commercial ships.
</P>
<P>
   That news, coupled with the fact that Litton's offer for
Avondale tops an earlier bid from Newport News, indicated to Wall
Street that Litton probably will win the bidding for Avondale.
Shares of Litton and Avondale increased, while Newport News shares
lost 16 percent of their value Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Woodland Hills-based Litton took the news in stride, noting that
no formal proposal regarding its offer to Newport News has been
submitted to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe the combination of Litton and Newport
News and Litton and Avondale are good for the companies, for the
stockholders, the employees, the country and the Navy,'' said
Litton spokesman Randy Belote.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the department's assessment is still a preliminary
one and that there have been ongoing discussions between the
company and the government.
</P>
<P>
   Litton now plans to revisit the cost savings issue to see
whether a satisfactory resolution can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Litton made separate bids for Newport News and Avondale on May
6. The offers came after anti-trust regulators rejected a bid by
General Dynamics Corp. for Newport News on grounds that potential
cost savings to the government did not warrant a reduction in
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Litton's Ingalls Shipbuilding subsidiary builds destroyers and
other surface ships and Newport News is the Navy's only builder of
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators appear troubled that if the companies combine, there
would be two, rather than three, contractors for battle-worthy
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hansen, a Defense Department spokeswoman, said Friday that
the agency has not been asked to send any documentation regarding
the merger to the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assessment was based on Litton representing its intentions
as opposed to a formal acquisition proposal. But you've got one
`go' and one `no go' here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the deal was announced some analysts thought
Litton's offer stood a better chance of passing regulatory muster
than did General Dynamics' bid.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Newport News, based in Newport News, Va., took a
neutral position on the issue Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really up to Litton to try to determine if they want to
investigate the concerns that have been expressed,'' said Newport
News spokesman Mike Hattfield.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators already had approved Newport News' $470 million
stock-for-stock merger with Avondale, which continues to evaluate
both offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avondale has made no decision on which of the two offers it
would accept but the company is still closely studying both merger
proposals,'' said company spokesman Ed Winter. ``There is no
timetable or deadline to make such a decision and we can't say when
that might occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Litton increased $2.1875 to $64.9375 Friday on trading
volume three times heavier than normal. Newport News lost $5.25, or
16 percent, to close at $27.50 on eight times normal volume.
Avondale increased 25 cents to $36.50.

THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIMISM ABOUT BEING READY FOR Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Grassroots community organizers battling the
Y2K bug say the federal government and corporate America are
undermining their efforts with a flurry of ``don't worry, we'll
have everything fixed'' messages.
</P>
<P>
   A May survey of 100 local organizers in 28 states shows Y2K
activists fear confusing national readiness messages will only make
matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Press statements from the president's Y2K council, for example,
say the nation's telephone system will work, but then adds that
1,400 small telephone companies could run into problems.
</P>
<P>
   And comparing Y2K to a bad winter storm is ``false, misleading
and creating a dangerous sense of complacency,'' activist David
Sunfellow said Tuesday in testimony before the Senate's special Y2K
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not facts but public Valium,'' Kerry Brock, director
of broadcasting for the Media Studies Center, told the Senate
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence coming from big business also does not fit neatly
into the everything-will-be-fixed mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the point (with Y2K) where almost everybody says
everything is under control,'' said Capers Jones, a leading Y2K
expert. ``But that does not mean that everything is under
control.''
Health-care watch
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest Y2K question marks still looming in the
United States is the health-care industry, where those testing
biomedical devices are reporting conflicting results.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals testing devices listed on the Food and Drug
Administration's Web site as being Y2K-ready are finding they
malfunction when dates are advanced to Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted the General Accounting Office, the federal
government's watchdog agency, to press regulators to verify claims
of Y2K readiness by device manufacturers. Up until Tuesday, the
Food and Drug Administration said it lacked the resources to do
such testing.
</P>
<P>
   Now officials plan to audit the data of 60 ``high risk'' device
manufacturers that could threaten patient health and safety, said
the Food and Drug Administration's William Hubbard in testimony
before a joint House committee.
</P>
<P>
   That comes as good news to Joel Willemssen, the General
Accounting Office's Y2K expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that organizations such as the FDA can
provide medical device users with a greater level of confidence
that their equipment is Y2K compliant,'' Willemssen said.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA's Hubbard remains unconvinced that potential device
problems will be significant or widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be specific problems that need corrections,'' he
said in written testimony. ``However, the current assessment is
that they are much more likely to disrupt patient care rather than
be of direct danger to patients.''
Falwell fallout
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell now says Y2K will not be nearly as bad as
his $30 doom-and-gloom video predicts.
</P>
<P>
   In a fax to the Rev. Steve Hewitt of Raytown, Mo., editor of
Christian Computing magazine, Falwell says:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been pleased with the substantial progress that has been
made in both the government and private sector...While I expect Y2K
to be annoying and somewhat disruptive, I do not expect it to be as
serious as some are projecting, or as I first feared possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell's videotape, ``Y2K: A Christian's Guide to the
Millennium Bug,'' was produced last August. It has since been
pulled from circulation.
Community planning
</P>
<P>
   Y2K tidbits from the land of community preparedness:
</P>
<P>
   - The Mid America Assistance Coalition will hold a ``Yearning 2
Know'' session Wednesday at UMKC for social service providers
wanting to learn how Y2K might affect their low-income clients.
Call (816) 561-2727 to register.
</P>
<P>
   - The Y2K Elected Officials Task Force will convene a Y2K summit
on June 22. Readiness reports will be given from critical service
areas. Call (816) 474-4240 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   - The Overland Park Chamber of Commerce has produced a ``Year
2000 Survival Guide.'' Non-members can purchase it for $50 by
calling (913) 491-3600.
</P>
<P>
   - A free Y2K workbook _ ``Are you OK with Y2K'' _ developed by
the Missouri Office of Information Technology is available. Also,
the office is holding one-day workshops throughout the state in
June and September. For more information or to schedule a Y2K
speaker for civic groups, contact the Missouri Y2K Call Center at
1-877-661-4925 or click on www.y2k.state.mo.us
</P>
<P>
   - The President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion has launched a
``Community Conversations'' campaign to promote local Y2K efforts.
To receive a discussion ``tool kit'' that includes a videotape and
handouts, call 1-888-872-4925.

POLICE SNIPER KILLS GUNMAN AFTER DEADLY RAMPAGE THROUGH
NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER AND PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHORELINE, Wash. _ Police killed a 22-year-old man Friday night
who fled an accident on Interstate 5 and terrorized two blocks of a
North End neighborhood near Seattle, fatally bludgeoning an elderly
woman, breaking another woman's neck and spraying bullets at
police.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the rampage began earlier in Brier, a
Snohomish County suburb where the man's mother and his 2-year-old
nephew were found slain inside a house on a quiet cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   Before it ended, the melee sent at least four people _ including
a King County sheriff's deputy _ to hospitals and shut down I-5 in
both directions, gridlocking holiday travelers leaving early for
the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, children at a nearby elementary school were
confined by police to the building until 8:30 Friday night, after
it was confirmed that a police sharpshooter had killed the suspect.
Anxious parents waited outside the school for hours.
</P>
<P>
   King County Sheriff Dave Reichert refused to identify the man,
but said the suspect may have had a $10,000 warrant out for his
arrest. Reichert would not say what the warrant was for.
</P>
<P>
   As the man darted from house to house, he came upon Erma Spence,
63, whom he attacked with a gardening tool. She was pronounced dead
at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center at 2:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, 82-year-old Irene Z. Hilton, suffered a broken
neck after she was attacked in her backyard garden.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the suspect fled south on I-5 in his slain mother's
car, speeding wildly through holiday traffic. Washington State
Trooper Tom Foster said at about 1:30 p.m., the suspect swerved
suddenly and collided with Anthony Venegas, 64, of Everett, Wash.,
who was riding a motorcycle. The impact almost severed one of
Venegas' legs, which doctors later amputated below the left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The mangled, stolen car caught fire and skidded to a halt just
north of 195th Street Northeast in Shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect ran, and may have used a pedestrian bridge to cross
over a thick sound wall that separates the busy freeway from a
quiet neighborhood of suburban ramblers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a warm, sunny afternoon, and police believe Spence was
outside in her garden, which bordered her one-story home, when she
was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old neighbor heard Spence crying for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was screaming, `Help me!','' the neighbor said. ``It
sounded like she was being beaten because it was the sound of
something hitting'' her.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old woman frantically called 911 and then headed for
Spence's house. She said she saw a young black man leaving and
asked him what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked sketchy, and he didn't say anything back,'' she
said. Then, the man jumped a chain-link fence bordering Spence's
property, and the neighbor said she became afraid and ran back to
her house.
</P>
<P>
   John Wayne, a 28-year-old neighbor, was one of the first to come
upon Spence. He said Spence was lying in a pool of blood, with what
looked like a broken posthole digger near her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not looking good,'' Wayne said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before, Wayne had been standing on a footbridge,
surveying the scene from the car accident. When he looked back
toward his neighborhood, he said he saw a disturbed-looking man in
his early 20s sporting braids or dreadlocks looking at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was acting very, very agitated,'' Wayne said. ``He was
looking around paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   The man then disappeared, and that's when Wayne heard neighbors
shouting for help from Spence's home.
</P>
<P>
   After the assailant left Spence, he moved across Seventh Avenue
Northeast. He marched through the unlocked doors of the home of
John Berger, and his roomate Michael Barker, who live at 525 N.E.
195th St.
</P>
<P>
   Face to face with the threatening man, who wore a baggy shirt
and was bleeding at the mouth, Berger and his roommate went for
their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking very irrationally like he lost his way,''
Berger said. ``I told him to get out. There was craziness in his
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to scare the man away. He then moved south down
Seventh Avenue Northeast, navigating through the backyards of
several homes. His next victim, police say, was 82-year-old Hilton,
a widow in poor health who was puttering in her yard.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's next-door neighbor of more than four decades, Gerald
Gehret, heard Hilton screaming his name.
</P>
<P>
   He peered over his fence and saw the man grabbing Hilton by her
hair. As soon as the man saw him, Gehret said, he hit her with what
looked like a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Gehret ran inside to grab a gun. He went out his front door and
spotted police outside. He pointed them to Hilton's house and put
away his gun. King County Sheriff's officers had by then responded
to a 911 call from the neighborhood, spokesman John Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing police, the assailant fled, leaving Hilton behind, her
neck broken. Hilton was listed in critical condition Friday night
at Harborview Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the assailant then moved two houses south, to the
four-bedroom home of Fred and Chrystine Westphal, who have lived on
Seventh Avenue Northeast for 11 years. Neither the Westphals nor
their three children were home.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect found the Westphal's gun collection and barricaded
himself inside their home, police said. The Westphals kept three
semi-automatic handguns, two rifles and two shotguns in rifle bags
or boxes, according to 16-year-old Austin Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   Police quickly surrounded the home. Over the next three hours,
police estimate the suspect shot at them 50 or more times.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the suspect changed weapons and went to a
higher-caliber weapon _ a rifle of some type, said Washington State
Trooper Phillip Davidson, who was one of the first officers on the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Five or six officers took cover behind a Jeep Cherokee near the
house and ordered the suspect to come out and drop his weapon. They
gave the suspect two warnings on the bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
   There was no response, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking cover behind the Jeep, King County Sheriff's Deputy Diana
Russell received cuts to her face and her skull was fractured after
the suspect opened fire. Two Montlake Terrace Police officers
received minor injuries from flying glass.
</P>
<P>
   After that, an armed personnel carrier provided by the Seattle
Police Department's SWAT team was sent in.
</P>
<P>
   While SWAT teams extricated deputies pinned down by gunfire,
other officers helped evacuate nearby homes and secure six blocks
around the scene. Children at nearby North City Elementary School
were ordered to stay in their school throughout the evening until
they could be safely released.
</P>
<P>
   The stand-off between police and the suspect culminated at about
5:30 p.m. when snipers moved in closer to the home, said Reichert.
He said one sniper fired a shot through a window, hitting the
suspect. The man, who was holding a firearm, fell back and his gun
dropped from the window into the yard.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 p.m., officers approached the house and threw in tear gas
cannisters from two sides. They repeated that at 6:15 and again at
6:30 p.m. and were hoping to flush the suspect out, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Then robots from the Seattle Police Department's bomb squad,
with cameras attached to them were sent into the house to search
for the suspect, who was found dead.

CHICKENPOX CAN BE SEVERE, AND VACCINE IS AVAILABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Four-year-old Cody Spruyt never got
chickenpox vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor didn't insist on it. His parents didn't think it was
a big deal. After all, every kid gets chickenpox.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Lenexa, Kan., boy got chickenpox last month, it
wasn't the simple childhood illness his parents expected.
Chickenpox can turn into something dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The disease made Cody vulnerable to strep bacteria that invaded
his heart and ate away at a vital heart valve. Now Cody faces major
surgery to repair the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, if I could do it all over again, I wouldn't take
the chance of not vaccinating him,'' Cody's mother, Wendy Spruyt,
said. ``I relied on the medical profession for guidance. I feel I
was let down.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took
action to make chickenpox vaccine a routine part of every child's
health care.
</P>
<P>
   It issued new recommendations calling on states to require that
children be vaccinated for chickenpox before being allowed to
attend day care or enter school. It is up to each state to
implement the requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Such rules are long overdue, said Mary Anne Jackson, an
infectious disease expert at Children's Mercy Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the most under-utilized vaccines,''
Jackson said. ``If you ask people to describe chickenpox, they'll
say it's benign and inevitable. It's time the medical community and
the lay community learn the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Before chickenpox vaccine became available in 1995, about 4
million people got the illness each year, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. For most it's an uncomfortable
four or five days of fever, malaise and hundreds of small itchy
rashes covering the body from scalp to feet. Getting chickenpox
confers lifetime immunity.
</P>
<P>
   But about 100 people, almost half of them children, die of
chickenpox complications each year. And about 10,000 are
hospitalized with chickenpox complications.
</P>
<P>
   Although no chickenpox deaths have been reported in Kansas in
recent years, in Missouri there have been 18 deaths reported since
1993, including one Kansas City area child this year.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like these make chickenpox the most deadly childhood
disease that's preventable by vaccine, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts recommend that all children be immunized for chickenpox
around their first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But because chickenpox is seen as a mild disease and experience
with the vaccine is limited, doctors have been slow to recommend
it, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, for example, although more than 80 percent of
2-year-olds are up to date on required shots for such illnesses as
measles, polio and tetanus, only about 28 percent have been
vaccinated for chickenpox, the most recent data show.
</P>
<P>
   National data are more encouraging; about 48 percent of children
under age 3 have been vaccinated for chickenpox, according to
unpublished federal figures for the third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ten states and the District of Columbia now require chickenpox
immunization to attend school. Kansas and Missouri are among the
majority of states that don't require it.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices called for mandatory
immunization for school and day care entry after reviewing new
evidence on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, said Jane
Seward, a physician with the federal agency's national immunization
program.
</P>
<P>
   The most common side effect, which occurs in less than 1 percent
of cases, is a mild rash, according to the advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also recommended that people exposed to chickenpox
who aren't immune get the vaccine in order to prevent outbreaks of
the disease. And it also said teen-agers and adults who've never
had chickenpox should be immunized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have a product that we know works, we can't accept
children dying or developing serious complications. It's not worth
taking the risk anymore,'' Seward said.
</P>
<P>
   But taking risks with chickenpox is still common, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still hear from parents, `The kid down the block has it.
I'll expose my kids to get it over with,' '' Jackson said. ``I
cringe when I hear that. We've seen too many complications in
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Chickenpox can become dangerous in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   The chickenpox virus itself can enter the central nervous system
and cause the brain inflammation encephalitis. Fever from a
chickenpox infection can lead to dehydration serious enough to
require hospital treatment. In pregnant women, chickenpox can cause
serious birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   The most common complications occur when chickenpox sores become
a portal to virulent staph or strep bacteria. The bacteria can
cause toxic shock or infect the bloodstream or organs.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Cody Spruyt.
</P>
<P>
   Cody broke out on April 27 with chickenpox that covered his head
and body. About four days into his illness, his temperature spiked
at 105.2 degrees. His parents were able to his fever down, but Cody
didn't get better. He felt listless. He had persistent nose bleeds.
His left foot ached.
</P>
<P>
   For days, Cody was in and out of hospitals and doctors' offices.
Finally, his parents took him to Children's Mercy, where his
condition was diagnosed. The foot pain turned out to be an
infection that required surgery. An echocardiogram found the heart
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of something I thought so benign, the chickenpox, it's
something my son will have to deal with the rest of his life,''
Wendy Spruyt said.

COLLINS GIVES GLAUS CHANCE TO RECOVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins elected
to rest slumping third baseman Troy Glaus after Thursday's 0-for-4
performance against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Jeff Huson, who started at first on Thursday, played
third on Friday, but Collins said he just wanted to give Glaus a
breather. Glaus has just three hits in his last 43 at-bats and only
one RBI since May 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten to the point where he just needed to get away,''
Collins said. ``He's getting so much advice from everyone, it can
be a bit much. But he's going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, the Angels' top pick in the 1997 draft, made the big
leagues in just 109 games. This season he won the third-base job
from Dave Hollins, who was traded to Toronto during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Glaus batted .341 (28 for 82) with five homers and 14
RBI. He still leads the club with 15 doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you don't have to worry about is the effort,''
Collins said. ``He was out there early, hitting like he always
does. He probably was trying too hard. No big deal. I looked up
this morning and I realized there is still four months of baseball
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher makes the call: When he was struggling a month ago,
Angels right-hander Tim Belcher received a pick-me-up phone call
from his former Dodgers catcher Rick Dempsey. Now, Belcher is
pitching well, in part because of some mechanical adjustments
Dempsey suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, it was Belcher on the phone to Dempsey in Atlanta, where
the Dodgers are playing the Braves. Dempsey was moved from
third-base coach to bullpen coach on Wednesday when pitching coach
Charlie Hough was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I think it is a good move,'' said Belcher, who will
make his next start Monday against Minnesota. ``Who knows pitchers
better than an old catcher. But he wants to be a big-league manager
and I think he's wondering what a move like that will do to his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   As for straightening out his pitching, Belcher said his location
has improved since getting pounded in three consecutive starts
during the last week of April and the first week of May.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey had suggested Belcher turn his body more during his
delivery, showing the catcher the number on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't very many guys who know my mechanics like him,''
Belcher said. ``Now when I have a bad inning, it's one or two runs,
not six like it was before.''

ANXIETY CLOUDS REUNION OF ALBANIAN FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STACY DOWNS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ It has been 18 years since Edmond Rugova's
family was together.
</P>
<P>
   A photo from that time shows him, his brother and his sister _
all Albanians from Kosovo _ smiling in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova points out the irony: He was part of the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same army that's killing us now,'' said Rugova, a former
Comets soccer player living in suburban Overland Park, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade Rugova helped bring his brother and parents
from Kosovo to live in the area. Discrimination against Albanians
had forced his parents out of jobs, but the ethnic cleansing had
not begun.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday his sister and her three children _ Kosovo refugees
_ arrived in Kansas City to complete the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no words. We just stood there embracing,'' Rugova
said. ``It was overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon his sister Diana Dalipi's daughters Agnesa, 15,
and Dafina, 10, and son Ligrid, 5, played with Rugova's daughters
in the living room. The adults exchanged smiles and spoke in
Albanian about childhood memories.
</P>
<P>
   But sorrow and anxiety clouded the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova's family stayed up until 3 a.m. Friday talking. All
shared the shock that hundreds of thousands of people had lost
their homes and that a nationality was being erased.
</P>
<P>
   Dalipi, her husband, her two daughters and son recently were
forced out of their home in Gilan, Kosovo. They had 10 minutes to
pack their belongings and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Dalipi and her children became separated from her husband. She
and the children walked 30 miles and crossed the Kosovo border into
safety. They slept on concrete floors and lived on the few supplies
they could carry.
</P>
<P>
   Thick, dark circles line Dalipi's eyes, and she is much thinner
than she was in the family photo from 18 years ago. Her mother's
eyes fill with tears when she looks at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get over how much she has aged and what she has gone
through,'' Rugova said. ``My mother keeps telling me this isn't the
daughter she remembers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rugova and his brother, Veton, have been trying for years to
bring their sister and her family to live in the Kansas City area.
But hopes for peace and other complications kept her and her family
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   When the masses of Kosovo Albanians were forced from their
homes, the family prayed for Dalipi and her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there would be suffering for her and her children _
they would be tired, thirsty, hungry and sleeping in open places,
but we were most afraid about them being raped,'' Veton Rugova
said. ``Luckily that did not take place.''
</P>
<P>
   The worrying is not over. The family still waits to hear from
Dalipi's husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope and pray the worst has not happened,'' Rugova said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rugovas are trying to help other relatives and friends who
are refugees. Rugova's wife, Qefsere, wants her mother to leave and
live with them. Because of the frequent contacts, the Rugovas'
phone bills range between $600 and $1,100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Cosmos youth soccer club, which Rugova formed,
has held several fund-raisers to help the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't emphasize how important everyone's help has been,''
Rugova said. ``The people here have given us so much support.''

MILOSEVIC INDICTMENT COLORS TALKS WITH RUSSIAN ENVOY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for refinements throughout)   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The day after President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia was indicted on war crimes charges, a
search for a negotiated solution to the conflict in Kosovo
proceeded on Friday, clouded by uncertainty and recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian envoy voiced some hope, but the United States
withheld judgment.
</P>
<P>
   After nine hours of talks with Milosevic about a Kosovo
settlement, the Russian special envoy to the Balkans, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, pronounced himself ``very pleased,'' but added, ``We
face the most difficult negotiations in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   The sticking points remain the shape of any international force
to police a settlement, the command of such a force and the size of
the Yugoslav army and police contingents allowed to remain in
Kosovo. The Russians are said to be willing to supply soldiers of
their own, and to be exploring the idea of German troops acting as
the center of a NATO contingent.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of the talks was colored by the indictment of
Milosevic and four top aides by the international tribunal at The
Hague on Thursday on charges of responsibility for war crimes in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said he hoped to return to Belgrade next week with
President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland after further talks with
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said that Ahtisaari did not travel to Belgrade
today because of the indictments announced on Thursday. But
Yugoslav officials said he may have stayed away waiting to see if
the prospects of success improve.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Talbott took pains to say that Chernomyrdin was not
representing the United States or NATO; Ahtisaari is their
designated negotiator. Finland is not a member of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NATO defense ministers were holding an unpublicized
meeting in Germany to discuss what kind of force would be needed to
carry out a ground invasion of Kosovo. A force as large as 150,000
troops was reportedly discussed.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Friday evening, the Yugoslav government
said it accepted the principles for a settlement issued two weeks
ago by the Group of 7 industrial countries and Russia. Yugoslavia
``agrees that the U.N. Security Council should pass a resolution
based on those principles,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It also said that ``the return of all the refugees to their
homes should be insured as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade has accepted the principles before, but putting them
into a substantive, detailed peace settlement is the current
difficulty. Even the United States and Russia still disagree over
those details.
</P>
<P>
   The principles call for a halt in the violence and oppression in
Kosovo, the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from the province and the
deployment of an international security ``presence,'' now
understood to be an armed force under a United Nations flag with
members from at least some NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   The principles also call for the return of ethnic Albanian
refugees to Kosovo, the establishment of an interim administration
before new elections and the opening of Serbian-Kosovar talks on
the province's future.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin flew on Friday to a Belgrade that was without
electricity after renewed NATO attacks on the nation's power grid
in what NATO officials said proudly was their heaviest day of
bombing yet, with 792 sorties, a record in the air war, which began
on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in a sour mood, in part a function of what Russian
officials described as a very difficult two days of negotiations
with Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said he was ``unsatisfied that all of our
negotiations have failed to achieve results'' and added, ``If they
continue in this vein, then their continuation would be
senseless.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the talks were the only hope of a peaceful
resolution and called again for a halt to NATO's bombing as an
important prerequisite for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Moscow, he told reporters about the war crimes
indictments: ``We knew, we warned, we asked, `Don't do this,
because it will simply complicate the process.' But we are flying
to Belgrade. We deal with the lawfully elected president of
Yugoslavia and will go on dealing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Talbott, briefing NATO ambassadors in Brussels Friday, chose
to emphasize that Chernomyrdin was representing only the Russian
government in talks with Milosevic and not NATO or the United
States. Talbott spoke one day after the indictment and a day after
leaving Moscow, where anti-NATO sentiment has escalated in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized Chernomyrdin for an Op-Ed page article in The
Washington Post in which the Russian complained about NATO policy,
called the Kosovo issue a ``domestic conflict'' and said Russia
would cease its efforts unless the bombing stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Chernomyrdin is not negotiating for NATO or the United
States,'' Talbott said. ``He will also refer to what he understands
to be the position of the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is bringing further ideas on the makeup of an
international force under U.N. auspices to police a Kosovo
settlement. The Russians may be willing to supply up to 10,000
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade would prefer NATO troops from countries _ like Germany,
Italy, Greece and Spain _ that are not associated in the public's
mind with the air attacks on Yugoslavia, as the United States and
Britain are.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a dispute over who should command such a force,
with Russia wanting a neutral country, and over how many Yugoslav
troops and Serbian policemen should be allowed to remain in Kosovo,
even as a symbol of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians predict, as Belgrade does, that if all Serbian
forces pull out, the vacuum will immediately be filled by the
Kosovo Liberation Army, the secessionist guerrilla force, which is
supposed to be disarmed in any settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO says it wants a strong force with NATO at its core to
protect ethnic Albanians from Serbs and to prevent a reinfiltration
of Serbian forces, Yugoslav officials _ and even some with NATO _
predict that the biggest threat to the international force will be
the Kosovar rebels and are skeptical that NATO will disarm them.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have complained bitterly, as have the Chinese, the
Yugoslav democratic opposition and even Western officials, about
the timing of the Hague indictments.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Clinton administration viewed the Belgrade
reports cautiously. ``Milosevic has made numerous statements in the
past,'' Mike Hammer, a National Security Council spokesman, said
Friday. ``There's a level of detail that Milosevic has to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Yugoslav leader must accept is ``clear, verifiable
withdrawal'' of Serbian forces from Kosovo, and a peacekeeping
force with NATO at its core, Hammer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like we're really there yet,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said that while the White House welcomed any hopeful
signs, administration officials must confer in depth with
Chernomyrdin before determining whether there are concrete reasons
for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats hope to speak with Chernomyrdin as early as
Saturday morning.

MAN ADMITS CHARGE INVOLVING HANDGUN THAT CHILD FIRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Kansas City man faces up to 10 years in
jail after admitting Friday to leaving a loaded handgun that a
6-year-old boy fired, killing his 1-year-old playmate.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Clark said it would
take several weeks to decide how much time Terrance Hoard should
serve on the two counts of child endangerment. No sentencing date
was set.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Miller, assistant prosecutor, said he believed he had been
lenient by not charging Hoard, 20, with felony murder. He refused
to offer a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so incensed by it,'' Miller said afterward. ``When a child
dies, the case is more difficult than others. There is no one more
innocent than a child.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, 1998, a 6-year-old boy shot Darian D. Hinds in an
apartment in midtown Kansas City. The boy told police that he
pulled the handgun from a bag that contained video games.
</P>
<P>
   He said he pointed the .38-caliber semiautomatic toward the wall
and pulled the trigger. A bullet struck Darian.
</P>
<P>
   The boy told police that a man called ``T'' had placed the gun
in the bag before leaving the residence. Police later identified
Hoard as ``T.''
</P>
<P>
   At the court appearance Friday, Hoard, in a halting voice,
explained that he had the gun because he had been robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Miller pointed out that if a 6-year-old could fire the gun so
easily, it was likely the safety was not on. Hoard said he thought
it was.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Hoard should have known ``that a child will get a
hold of something and play with it.''

TWA SUBMITS ``BEST AND FINAL OFFER'' ON NEW CONTRACTS TO UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Trans World Airlines submitted what it called
its ``best and final offer'' on new contracts to the Machinists
union Friday, less than two weeks from a possible strike deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Union negotiators indicated they would provide details of the
latest package to 16,000 members at TWA and submit it for a vote,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest offers to TWA's three employee groups represents a
move by the company to bring their wages within 90 percent of
industry standards earlier than previously proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Machinists union officials could not be reached for comment late
Friday. However, they previously have been adamant that a contract
bringing wages to within 90 percent of the industry average was
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new proposal, which would remain in effect till
January 2002, the employees would see their wages reach the 90
percent standard by July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, all Machinists employees would receive a lump-sum
payment ranging from $2,100 to $5,000, distributed in intervals
over the first two years of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Compton, TWA's president and chief operating officer,
said management originally proposed bringing the employees' wages
up to the 90 percent standard by September 2002. Then the company
moved to January 2002 before its latest offer.
</P>
<P>
   Though TWA's pilots reached a contract in 1998 that is expected
to bring their pay to within 90 percent of the industry over four
years, TWA's Machinists members would reach that level by July
2001, slightly more than two years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really pushed the envelope as to what we can afford in
making this offer,'' Compton said. ``The employees certainly
deserve more, but it's as much as we can afford at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton said the value of the wage and benefit package was
$356.2 million through January 2002, about $100 million more than
the company initially proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Compton said union negotiators did not indicate whether they
would make a recommendation to the membership on how to vote on the
new contract.

COLORADO EVENS SERIES ON DRURY'S OVERTIME GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ St. Patrick spoke, and the skies opened.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe they didn't open, but at least the Colorado Avalanche
can see a nice beam of sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Patrick Roy, the Avalanche's inimitable goalie,
criticized his teammates for not scoring more, for not getting
traffic in front of Stars goalie Ed Belfour, for not putting more
shots high, the Avalanche listened just enough and won a 3-2
overtime thriller in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals before
an invigorated crowd of 16,061 at McNichols Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche rookie Chris Drury hit the game-winner with 31 seconds
remaining in the overtime period to tie the best-of-seven series at
two games apiece _ something Stars players said doesn't surprise
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think they were going to just give up,'' Stars
defenseman Shawn Chambers said. ``They played a great game. And
after the first five minutes, I thought we played a great game.
It's just a great series and I don't think there's one player on
this team that has lost a bit of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but the Avalanche has gained a ton. Backed to the wall and
needing a victory to avoid a 3-1 deficit in the series, Roy showed
no shyness in calling out teammates Joe Sakic and Theo Fleury for
their lack of scoring and generally berating his team for making
life too easy for Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche responded.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic, who had been without a point in the first three games,
scored the opening goal at the 4:06 mark of the first period _ the
earliest the Stars have been touched in 14 playoff games. In fact,
the Stars had allowed only three first-period goals before last
night, but gave up two in 48 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Shjon Podein garnered the second goal as his shot deflected off
the stick of Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig and over the shoulder of
Belfour at the 4:54 mark of the first.
</P>
<P>
   On both plays, the Avalanche was able to get traffic in front of
Belfour. On both plays, Stars' defensemen had their sticks in front
of Belfour and deflected pucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fluky, but that's what happens,'' Ludwig said. ``In
any playoff series, those things are going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But what was key, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said, was that the
Stars didn't panic. They bounced back from the shocking goals _
goals that enlivened a testy crowd _ and basically matched the
Avalanche shot for shot, scoring chance for scoring chance and
punch for punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough way to lose,'' Hitchcock said. ``But both teams
played hard, both goaltenders were excellent, there were a lot of
quality chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a whale of a hockey game and I'm proud of my team and
the way we battled back,'' Hitchcock added.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting back, the two teams finished with 45 shots apiece
and Belfour and Roy were embroiled in a vicious goaltender
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars finally cracked Roy in the second period when Jamie
Langenbrunner sent a soft wrister through the crowd on a power play
goal. Like the Avalanche, the Stars finally were able to get some
traffic in front of Roy. In fact, the Avalanche goaltender never
even saw the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Roy did see the second goal, it went right between his legs as
Langenbrunner made a great play to steal the puck from Sylvain
Lefebvre and that set up Brett Hull for a slap shot with 3:53
remaining in regulation and sent the game to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   There, the Stars did everything but win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got what we came for, it's now best of three and we have
home ice,'' Hitchcock said. ``We've played great every game in this
series. You have two teams giving everything right now. Nothing is
left in the tank for anybody.

MCCAIN DROPS AMENDMENT ON ARIZONA WILDLIFE REFUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain has dropped a proposal that
environmentalists feared would open the Cabeza Prieta National
Wildlife Refuge to the rumble of tank treads.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's withdrawal of an amendment that could have let tanks
and armored personnel carriers cross the largest intact expanse of
the Sonoran Desert was greeted warmly by wildlife and wilderness
groups, who said it strengthens their chances of eventually turning
the wildlife refuge, and the surrounding Barry M. Goldwater gunnery
range, into Arizona's newest national park.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said it was never his intention to expose the wildlife
area in southwestern Arizona to military ground maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain rattled environmentalists and tribal officials
earlier in the week with an amendment to the proposed 2000 National
Defense Authorization Act. That amendment would have allowed the
Goldwater range to be permanently reserved for military use.
</P>
<P>
   The range covers much of southwestern Arizona _ nearly 3 million
acres _ including the wildlife refuge and parts of the Tohono
O'odham Indian Reservation. It borders Organ Pipe National
Monument.
</P>
<P>
   The military's use of the bombing range was last authorized by
Congress in 1986. That 15-year authority is nearing an end, and
Congress is debating whether to extend its military use. And, if
so, for how long.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and tribal groups read McCain's proposal as not
only allowing the desert land to be permanently removed from public
use, but they also saw language that could allow the military to
conduct ground maneuvers in the currently protected Cabeza Prieta.
</P>
<P>
   McCain argued that his intent was misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language originally included in the bill was intended to
be neutral on the few controversial aspects of the proposed
withdrawal,'' he said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   But such groups as the Land and Water Fund of the Rockies, the
Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society saw nothing neutral about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read the language as authorizing military ground
training,'' said Jim Waltman, director of refuge and wildlife
programs for the Wilderness Society. ``Sen. McCain and his staff
tell us they did not intend that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tohono O'odham tribe, which has three parcels of sacred
lands within the current boundaries of the bombing range, also
protested to McCain, saying the bombing range covers more turf than
is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal Chairman Edward D. Manuel, in a letter to McCain this
week, said the land included 141 archaeological sites, with
artifacts dating back at 7,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe wants the lands returned, especially since the Air
Force said that they are not needed for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McCain met with members of the Wilderness Society,
the National Audubon Society and Defenders of the Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Based on their objections, and those of Sen. Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M., McCain dropped his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he submitted an amendment that says the Senate needs to
decide the issue before it adjourns its session this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Waltman praised the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cabeza Prieta is really the crown jewel of the Sonoran
Desert,'' he said. ``It has spectacular wildlife and incredible
scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups still want to see the Cabeza Prieta left
out of any military use. Environmentalists have sparred with the
Air Force for nearly a decade over low-flying jets and their impact
on reproduction for the endangered Sonoran pronghorn antelope, of
which fewer than 200 remain. Intensified military use in the area
would spoil the chances of making it a park, Waltman said.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain told the groups he wants to ensure that the current
situation with the Cabeza Prieta _ which allows for military
overflights and the aerial maintenance of several telemetry sites _
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ives, press secretary to McCain, said the senator is
waiting for a proposal from the Clinton administration. That is
expected within two weeks, and will set the stage for the next
round of discussions on how much of the range should be reserved
for military use, and for how long. &QL;

UNIVERSAL BOUNCING BACK AFTER STRING OF FLOPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY -- The losing streak at Universal Studios has
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Most of 1998 was horrific for Universal as virtually its entire
motion picture schedule tanked, including promising projects like
``Primary Colors,'' ``BASEketball,'' ``Blues Brothers 2000,''
``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: Pig in the City.'' Half a dozen top
executives left, including Universal Pictures Chairman Casey Silver
and Universal Studios head Frank Biondi.
</P>
<P>
   But Universal has turned around this spring, and long-term
prospects look better than they have in several years. In the short
term, it has clearly benefited from a bold marketing decision to
take on ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' far more
directly than any other Hollywood studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal has really rebounded,'' noted Drew Devlin, an
executive with Clark Film Buying in Bozeman, Mont. ``Their upcoming
schedule looks pretty strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's outlook seemed dim just a few weeks ago. On May 6,
parent Seagram Co. announced the studio had taken a stunning $97
million loss for the quarter ended March 31 and warned it would
lose about the same amount during the current quarter due to poor
theatrical and ancillary performance by ``Virus,'' ``EDtv,'' ``Meet
Joe Black'' and the ``Babe'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   It opened ``The Mummy'' the next day, just as anticipation over
``Phantom Menace'' crested, and stunned Hollywood by grossing a
phenomenal $43.6 million on opening weekend. In retrospect, ``The
Mummy'' cleaned up because everyone else had decided to avoid the
Force or release niche product in the weeks leading up to the
``Phantom Menace'' release.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 days, ``Mummy'' crossed the $100 million mark and
analysts say it could take in another $50 million by the end of its
domestic run.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's move to bracket ``Phantom Menace'' with a Julia
Roberts comedy, ``Notting Hill,'' may pay off even more
impressively. The film, which opened Friday in 2,745 theaters with
a solid buzz and strong reviews, was originally scheduled for June
18, but the studio decided in late March to move it forward three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being crushed by the ``Star Wars'' juggernaut,
``Notting Hill'' looks like it will offer an attractive alternative
for moviegoers seeking something without lightsaber duels. ``We
think the audience is hungry for an excellent romantic comedy,''
said distribution head Nikki Rocco. ``This is all about
counterprogramming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' should take in a more-than-respectable $22
million during this weekend, according to Robert Bucksbaum,
president of the Reel Source forecasting service. `` `Notting Hill'
is easily the best date-crowd entry we've seen all year,''
Bucksbaum said. ``The fact that Julia Roberts is the biggest draw
for women is going to give it a boost, particularly in major
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Devlin is even more bullish. He believes ``Notting Hill,'' in
which Roberts' character falls in love with a British bookstore
owner played by Hugh Grant, will succeed even outside major
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Universal's concerned it's too sophisticated for small
towns, but I think people underestimate the sophistication of those
markets,'' he said. ``It's a very likable film. The fact that it's
set in London won't put people off.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cesinger, an executive with investment bank Greif &AMP; Co.,
said the studio's ability to pinpoint key dates in the schedule
this spring is probably related to how much it suffered after its
costly ``Babe: Pig in the City'' was buried by ``A Bug's Life'' and
``The Rugrats Movie'' last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio clearly paid the price with the `Babe' scheduling
fiasco,'' Cesinger said. ``It probably made them a little more
careful. Studio executives have big egos; sometimes it takes a lot
of cold water to make them reconsider strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from the ``Babe'' sequel led to Silver resigning on
the Monday after it opened. Two weeks earlier, when ``Meet Joe
Black'' opened disastrously, Biondi departed. Silver's post has
remained vacant as Universal Studios President Ron Meyer, a former
agent, and Seagram chief executive Edgar Bronfman Jr. have asserted
more direct control.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Universal's prospects for the rest of the year look
decent, particularly with its next entry: a coming-of-age comedy
called ``American Pie'' that is due July 9 has been termed a
``Porky's'' for the '90s and this year's ``There's Something About
Mary.''

DODGERS BAFFLED BY CRAFTY PEREZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta lefty Odalis Perez dominated a power-oriented
Los Angeles Dodgers lineup for 81/3 innings with finesse piled atop
finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Dodgers' difficulties were in their inability to
make adjustments during the game.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Dodgers right fielder Raul Mondesi homered in
the ninth that the Dodgers got to him, and by then the Braves were
on their way to a 4-2 win in the opener of a three-game series
Friday at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   It snapped the Dodgers' modest win string at two. The last time
the Dodgers (24-23) won three straight was during a five-game
winning streak April 27-May 1.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be interesting, and tell-tale of where the Dodgers' season
is heading, to see if adjustments are made today against Tom
Glavine. And if Mondesi's success will be picked up by the rest of
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hardly advance to second,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``We couldn't make adjustments. Mondesi was the only
one who seemed to have the idea; take him up the middle and then
knock it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who retook the NL home run lead from Sammy Sosa with
his 18th homer, had three hits. So did the rest of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked to the plate not worrying where he threw the ball,
just trying to make good contact,'' Mondesi said. ``Most of the
time he pitched middle away. He threw me one in the middle and I
hit it to the middle. He threw me in and I went to left-center and
he threw me a slider in and I hit it to left. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple for Mondesi. Difficult for most everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   It was the longest outing of Perez's brief career. The
20-year-old made the Dodgers look so lackluster offensively that he
didn't allow a runner past first base until Dave Hansen's pinch-hit
double with two outs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never gave in,'' said Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley, who
failed to get the ball out of the infield in three hitless at-bats
against Perez. ``Me, personally, he threw me one fastball on the
inside part of the plate. Other than that, it was sliders and
breaking balls on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never gave into us. Away, away, away. Almost a Glavine-type
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley also said it was the same type of pitching plan that
Cincinnati right-hander Steve Parris used in beating the Dodgers on
Tuesday. It's what Glavine will do, and the same approach Greg
Maddux, Atlanta's starter Sunday, will try.
</P>
<P>
   That is both scary and beneficial for the Dodgers. They failed
to adjust to Perez (3-2), and all Glavine's proven to be is someone
who can pitch a markedly superior game than the one Perez threw.
</P>
<P>
   Though Glavine hasn't pitched in his typical way so far _ he's
3-5 with a 5.54 ERA _ he does symbolize the type who can dominate
the Dodgers' lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who struck out one and walked one, didn't allow more than
one Dodger on base in any inning until the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That type of pitcher can be tough on guys trying to go deep,''
Johnson said. ``We hit a lot of home runs in Baltimore and guys
like (Jamie) Moyer gave us fits. Guys like this, we have to make
adjustments and go the other way and up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Dodgers also can't make errors in the field against
teams the caliber of the Braves and win.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 2-0 on RBI groundouts by Gerald Williams and Perez in
the fourth, the Braves added two runs in the fifth when the little
things collapsed for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones and Brian Jordan singled. Jordan stole second and
was safe when Eric Young dropped the ball and Javy Lopez walked to
load the bases with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort, who allowed four funs in five innings but also
walked five, got Ryan Klesko to hit the needed groundball, but
third baseman Adrian Beltre took a step back on the sharp grounder
and misplayed it. It allowed two runs to score and gave the Braves
a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreifort threw pretty good but we gave them (one) unearned
run,'' Johnson said. ``I don't think it's (Beltre's) confidence.
He's played well there. He just retreated.''

EVEN IN DEFEAT, STARS RETURN AS THE FAVORITE TO ADVANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Eddie Belfour deserved better, much better. But after a
long evening of body-pounding playoff warfare, it can also be said
the Colorado Avalanche truly earned some new postseason life. And
finally achieved just that.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 of the NHL's Western Conference finals seemed headed the
Stars' way, which meant this series was all but over.
</P>
<P>
   And on 60 minutes of style points, combined with overall
dominance, Dallas was the best team in regulation, crawling slowly
back from a very quick two-goal deficit. When Brett Hull whistled
the puck through Patrick Roy's 5-hole with 3:53 left in the third
period, the Avs had every reason to panic. The game was tied, and
the Stars were in control, wearing down Colorado with muscle and
four lines.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Avs' playoff existence was at stake. This was
a can't-lose-contest for them. Being down three games to one and
going back to Dallas for Game 5 was almost the same as being
vacation bound.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Stars had answered every question Colorado threw
at them for three consecutive games. And now, overtime did not
appear to bode well for the desperate Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise, sudden death seemed to suit Colorado. For the
most part, they were the aggressive outfit, although both teams had
to survive power plays.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final minute of OT, the Avs came up with a turnover
off defenseman Darryl Sydor, allowing the puck to stay in Dallas'
zone. With Colorado's Sandis Ozolinsh it's usually either feast or
famine. He can make the great play or the stupid one.
</P>
<P>
   This time he looked brilliant in sliding the puck to an
uncovered Chris Drury. The rookie unloaded on Belfour, going high
side-right side, and the puck found net.
</P>
<P>
   With a mere 31 seconds remaining in overtime, Colorado won, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   That new life did belong to the Avs, with the series now tied
after four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was another great game for us,'' said Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock, and that's true. ``But it was a great game for both
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars came to Colorado to regain home-ice advantage in the
series and did just that in Game 3. But the burial of the Avs could
have come last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in very good shape _ it's now who can win two out of
three and two of those will be on our ice,'' noted Hitchcock, as
Game 5 tomorrow afternoon at Reunion Arena now becomes yet another
pivotal moment in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was gonna be this kind of series all along,'' added
Hitchcock. ``It was going to come down to six or seven games all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   And, obviously, the winner will be determined by which goalie
played better. And for the record, Belfour bested Patrick Roy for
the third consecutive game, except this time there would no be no
W. Roy was outstanding, just not as good as Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   `The Eagle,' however, happened to be very unlucky in the opening
minutes of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had a 2-0 lead before five minutes was gone. The Avs
would go another 75 minutes before scoring again, but that goal was
the game winner.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the overtime ending, the Stars actually lost the game
way back in that opening period.
</P>
<P>
   The first shot put up by the Avs came four minutes into the
contest, but Joe Sakic's blast from the point appeared harmless.
Belfour was in position until the puck deflected off the stick of
Sydor, who was wrestling Theo Fleury in the slot. The re-direction
slid past Eddie for a 1-0 Avs lead. Suddenly, Sakic became a
playoff factor after a long slump, but he needed help from Sydor's
stick.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, there was a replay less than a minute later,
although this time it was winger Shjon Podein who found a Stars
stick. His shot also appeared to be no trouble until Craig Ludwig
lifted his stick, trying to knock down the puck before it reached
Belfour. But that resulted in yet another re-direction into the
goal, and the lead was 2-0 for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour could have cracked at that point. So could have the
Stars. Instead, both took over the game. And when Hull tied it,
Colorado was in shock.
</P>
<P>
   But that's also why the Avs' strong overtime play, while
surprising, was also inspired.
</P>
<P>
   The ``hate'' factor also surfaced last night, which pushed the
physical play in Game 4 to the same level as the Edmonton series.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, the Stars come back home as the best team in
the series. To stay that way, they now have to win Game 5.

FATHER ARRIVES TO CLAIM TRAIN VICTIMS' BODIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., also filed in `i' category)  
 (HLW)  
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man whose family was struck and killed by an Amtrak
train earlier this week arrived in New York from Ecuador Friday
night and said that he intended to take the bodies of his wife and
their four sons back home.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a frayed suit and looking bewildered, the man, Carlos
Urgiles, a farmhand from a rural Andean town, said he planned to
give his family a Catholic burial in their native country, perhaps
as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But relatives of his estranged wife, Julia Toledo, have been
planning to bury the family in Connecticut, and according to the
Mormon faith. Maria Toledo, Julia's sister, encouraged the family
to convert to Mormonism about 18 months ago. Urgiles has said the
conversion provoked the breakup of their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to bring the bodies back home,'' he told reporters
at Kennedy International Airport. ``I don't want to have problems
with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Urgiles' antipathy toward Mormonism, church leaders in
Trumbull, Conn., said they would go ahead with the funeral service
on Monday morning as planned _whether the bodies are buried in
nearby Easton or taken back to Ecuador. Kenneth Openshaw, a church
leader, said that the Mormon faith usually honors the father's
wishes, but that in this case, the needs of other surviving
relatives could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, that won't stop us from memorializing this
family, which was greatly loved and cherished not only by the
church and the boys' school, but by the entire community,''
Openshaw said. ``There is a need for closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who knew Ms. Toledo recalled her as a devoted
mother and were mystified why she was walking along the tracks with
her children at 2:20 Tuesday morning. Although she used to live
with her sister, Ms. Toledo, 47, a custodian at Fairfield
University, recently moved to a homeless shelter at a Y.M.C.A. in
Bridgeport. Several friends have said that she might have been
afraid that her sister would take her children away, claiming that
she was mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Although they still do not know why she was on the tracks at
that early morning hour, investigators say Ms. Toledo was killed
when she suddenly realized a train was approaching and tried to
grab one of her sons from the path of the train. The other boys,
they said, followed her and all of them were struck. One of the
boys survived, but died two days later of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Urgiles, whose trip was paid for by an Ecuadoran television
station and the state airline, said he had yet to absorb what had
happened to his family. ``I feared something terrible would happen
to them here,'' he said. ``I am destroyed.''

STARS FOUGHT BACK THEIR WAY: BATTERING, BRUISING THEIR FOE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With a sudden 2-0 deficit staring them in the chops,
the Stars were forced to revert to their inner selves last night.
</P>
<P>
   You know the drill. ``Concussions _ Half-Off.''
</P>
<P>
   For the ensuing 55 minutes and then some, the corners and ends
of the McNichols Arena ice might as well have been lined off with
that yellow police tape. Just as their coach sermonizes, the Stars
were going to earn their way back into the hockey game one
purposeful shoulder at a time.
</P>
<P>
   They won't be coming home with the road sweep that they worked
so hard for in Game 4 of this NHL Western Conference final series.
But given the couldas, wouldas and shouldas of the first five
minutes, the Stars' 3-2 loss in overtime to the Colorado Avalanche
seemed almost a swallowable consolation prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got what we came for,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said,
seeing the bigger picture of a series knotted at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a best-of-three now, and two of the games are on our
ice.''
</P>
<P>
   The words weren't just post-game fluff. Hitchcock wasn't trying
to spin-doctor what turned out to be a disappointing ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played great in every game of the series,'' the coach
went on. ``The two goals they had in regulation were both
`seeing-eye dogs.' We're playing with a tremendous amount of energy
and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a great series _ exactly what we thought it would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   What Hitchcock knows is that after the Avs' two early
``seeing-eye dogs'' found the other side of Ed Belfour, it was the
Stars who patiently dictated the flow of play for the remaining 55
regulation minutes.
</P>
<P>
   They did it the way that Hitchcock preaches _ winning individual
battles and not abandoning the game plan. They did it with
persistent checking in the neutral zone, which continues to fluster
the Avalanche. They did it with Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk
again outplaying Colorado's Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
   They did it with defenseman Derian Hatcher, tattooing Avs onto
the corner boards all night long.
</P>
<P>
   After Sakic's and Shjon Podein's deflected ``seeing-eye dogs''
gave the home team the lead, Hatcher became a dog with a different
bite.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what will win this series, if the Stars
continue to follow their own script. And why wouldn't they? If
there ever was an itch to scratch, an urge to flex their wings and
answer the Avalanche's early salvo, last night was the night.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they didn't. They shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The series is even. Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   After the Avs' second goal, the Stars killed off a power play
for the 10th time in 11 tries in this series. Colorado scored six
times (out of 30) with the manpower advantage in its semi-final
series with Detroit. But against the Stars, the Avs are now
1-for-16.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado still looks uncomfortable with the attention that it's
getting while trying to traverse between the blue lines. For two
nights at McNichols, the fans have roared whenever Theo Fleury or
another Avs winger have grabbed the puck in the neutral zone and
set sail up the ice.
</P>
<P>
   But each time, a Stars defenseman _ usually Richard Matvichuk,
Darryl Sydor or Hatcher _ has rushed up to greet the onrushing Av
and poke him harmlessly off the puck. The crowd's oohs have turned
into a night-long chorus of awws.
</P>
<P>
   It's called Stars hockey. Hitchcock preaches it. The team
believes it, as it reminded us last night.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, once handed a two-goal deficit, the Stars
turned up the heat on the game's physical play. Matvichuk was lost
in an aggressive collision with Forsberg behind the end line. Guy
Carbonneau wobbled off at one point, but returned.
</P>
<P>
   Deserving credit should go to Colorado's Adam Foote for trying
to match the Stars, stick for stick, check for check. But now,
really. Aside from Claude Lemieux, the Avs' resident weasel,
Colorado still doesn't have the bodies or the commitment to play a
rugged, patient hockey game with the Presidents' Trophy winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much become a war,'' said Chris Drury, who poked
in the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   But there's Colorado's mountain-sized problem. The war began in
Game 1, as far as the Stars are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   They head home bloodied, but not all that unhappy. Actually,
they like the blood, if you've been paying attention.

FATHER ARRIVES TO CLAIM TRAIN VICTIMS' BODIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., also filed in `a' category)  
 (HLW)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man whose family was struck and killed by an Amtrak
train earlier this week arrived in New York from Ecuador Friday
night and said that he intended to take the bodies of his wife and
their four sons back home.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a frayed suit and looking bewildered, the man, Carlos
Urgiles, a farmhand from a rural Andean town, said he planned to
give his family a Catholic burial in their native country, perhaps
as early as Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But relatives of his estranged wife, Julia Toledo, have been
planning to bury the family in Connecticut, and according to the
Mormon faith. Maria Toledo, Julia's sister, encouraged the family
to convert to Mormonism about 18 months ago. Urgiles has said the
conversion provoked the breakup of their family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to bring the bodies back home,'' he told reporters
at Kennedy International Airport. ``I don't want to have problems
with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Urgiles' antipathy toward Mormonism, church leaders in
Trumbull, Conn., said they would go ahead with the funeral service
on Monday morning as planned _whether the bodies are buried in
nearby Easton or taken back to Ecuador. Kenneth Openshaw, a church
leader, said that the Mormon faith usually honors the father's
wishes, but that in this case, the needs of other surviving
relatives could not be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, that won't stop us from memorializing this
family, which was greatly loved and cherished not only by the
church and the boys' school, but by the entire community,''
Openshaw said. ``There is a need for closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who knew Ms. Toledo recalled her as a devoted
mother and were mystified why she was walking along the tracks with
her children at 2:20 Tuesday morning. Although she used to live
with her sister, Ms. Toledo, 47, a custodian at Fairfield
University, recently moved to a homeless shelter at a Y.M.C.A. in
Bridgeport. Several friends have said that she might have been
afraid that her sister would take her children away, claiming that
she was mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Although they still do not know why she was on the tracks at
that early morning hour, investigators say Ms. Toledo was killed
when she suddenly realized a train was approaching and tried to
grab one of her sons from the path of the train. The other boys,
they said, followed her and all of them were struck. One of the
boys survived, but died two days later of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Urgiles, whose trip was paid for by an Ecuadoran television
station and the state airline, said he had yet to absorb what had
happened to his family. ``I feared something terrible would happen
to them here,'' he said. ``I am destroyed.''

ADOPTION RING ARREST SURPRISES DOUGLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 and GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS, Ariz. _ In Spanish, they call Mario Reyes ``Capi'' _
The Captain, the man who runs things.
</P>
<P>
   He was the American lawyer who made a mint with his practice
across the border in Agua Prieta, Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   He was the lector at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church who
had breakfast daily with the priest.
</P>
<P>
   He was the candidate for Douglas City Council two years ago who
ran on a platform of better education and family values.
</P>
<P>
   He was the business leader who owned a gas station and liquor
store.
</P>
<P>
   So, this border city was shocked when federal agents swooped in
late Wednesday and hauled Reyes, 40, away.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleges that he and two women from the New York
City area ran an illegal adoption ring in which they paid Mexican
women for 17 babies, spirited the children out of the country and
then sold them to couples on Long Island for as much as $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   The news had tongues wagging at the restaurant of the historic
Gadsden Hotel, said Aida Moulinet, a shift supervisor and friend of
the Reyes family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is just shocking, like getting hit in the head with
a board,'' Moulinet said. ``No one is more respected in this town
than he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moulinet, like many other Douglas residents, said they never
really gave much thought to what kind of law practice Reyes had in
Agua Prieta. His office was a cubbyhole storefront next to his
family's liquor store, a block away from the border crossing
station.
</P>
<P>
   They had seen him a lot more in Douglas the last few months.
That's curious, some thought.
</P>
<P>
   He took a job as a substitute English teacher in nearby Bisbee
for $50 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an interesting guy who left a very good impression on the
students,'' said Anna Marie Salmon, office manager for Bisbee High
School. ``But we never had a clue that he was this interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   As law officers on both sides of the border closed in on Reyes,
his world began falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   First, his Douglas businesses went belly up.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the church distanced itself from him last year after the
Mexicans issued a warrant for his arrest on charges of illegally
trafficking in children.
</P>
<P>
   His fear of arrest in Mexico left him unable to take up the
cases of Mexicans who claimed to be abused by U.S. immigration
officials, an effort that had made him very unpopular over the
years in U.S. Border Patrol and Immigration and Naturalization
Service circles.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes was spending a lot more time on the U.S. side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   A large lock is now on his law office door. Two panes of glass
are broken, and debris is scattered throughout the building.
</P>
<P>
   Those around Reyes faced trouble, too.
</P>
<P>
   Margarita Soto de Smith cared for the babies in Reyes' home.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, her name appeared on the birth certificate as the
birth mother of a child given for adoption. But she told
authorities, the child was not hers.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Mexican authorities arrested Soto in Agua Prieta
when she attempted to cross the border with the child. That baby is
still being cared for by the Mexican government's child protective
agency, known as the DIF, in Agua Prieta.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report from ``El Imparcial,'' a leading Mexican
newspaper, the birth mother was a 16-year-old girl from the state
of Veracruz on the Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Attorney General's office, which began investigating
the baby ring last March, issued a warrant charging Reyes and two
other individuals with trafficking of minors, unlawful detention of
a minor and conspiracy. Authorities refused to name the other
suspects because they are not yet in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Charges eventually may be brought against another eight to 10
individuals, said Ernesto Garcia Guerrero, the head of the federal
attorney general's office in Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence so far Reyes paid for any of the 17
children he put up for adoption, nor evidence that any of the
babies were stolen, according to Mexican officials. Investigators
have located only three of the 17 birth mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes did not pay the women who gave up their babies
voluntarily, but he covered the costs of their delivery, said
Rafael Flores Cardenas, the federal attorney for Agua Prieta.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said Reyes told him that he arranged the adoptions out of
compassion because the women could not afford to raise their
babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a Catholic lay minister and would give communion in
church, so many people trusted him,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   No one has yet requested that the children involved in the
illegal adoptions be returned to Mexico, and no parent has stepped
forward with a claim to the babies placed with American couples,
U.S. and Mexican officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Murphy, U.S. consul in Nogales, said, ``Mexican authorities
have been conducting their own extremely thorough investigation of
the Mexican side of this case. They have been very helpful in
sharing information with American investigators. The information
from the Mexican side was extremely important in developing the
case against Mr. Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exploitation of small children is something that simply
will not be accepted,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   According to an interview Reyes gave to ``El Imparcial'' after
Soto's arrest last year, he estimated he had arranged about 40
adoptions of children born mostly in Agua Prieta or the state of
Sinaloa. He insisted all the adoptions were legal.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador Cassian-Santos, the Mexican consul general in Phoenix,
said Mexico takes adoption very seriously and every adoption
application is reviewed to ensure the birth parents are voluntarily
giving up their child to a suitable home.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of ``express adoptions'' conducted by Reyes exploited
the desires of the prospective parents to have a child but skipped
Mexico's arduous adoption process, Cassian-Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lengthy and complicated process followed to protect
the interests of the children and the parents, both natural and
adoptive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The DIF oversees all adoptions in Mexico. ``They conduct a
socioeconomic study of the couple interested in adopting to prove
they are of good moral character, can provide an adequate home
environment and have sufficient resources to feed and educate the
child properly,'' Cassian-Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also check to be sure that the child is being
given up voluntarily by the birth mother or parents. If everything
squares, a family court judge will issue an adoption certificate at
a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a transaction that can be handled long-distance or
by mail. They can hire a lawyer to represent them in court, but
they must be present,'' Cassian-Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his office has not processed any recent requests from
Americans interested in adopting.
</P>
<P>
   The last time most Douglas residents saw Reyes was earlier this
week when he delivered a prayer to open the city's Little League
baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes from a very reputable family in Agua Prieta and has
been a very dedicated family man,'' said Douglas Mayor Ray Borane.
``It's very sad to see something happen like this to a man who had
so much to offer.'' &QL;

FINLEY'S COASTER RIDE GOES OFF TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ From the record book to a fifth-inning hook,
Chuck Finley was just being himself Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing one of the most up-and-down stretches of his 14-year
Angels career, Finley tied the American League mark with seven
consecutive strikeouts before allowing seven runs to the next 10
batters in an 11-4 loss to the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Edison Field crowd of 30,946 cheered wildly as Finley struck
out the side in the second and third innings and got Carlos Beltran
to open the fourth, matching the league record set by Nolan Ryan,
Roger Clemens and Ron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans turned sullen when Johnny Damon started a rally
that included four hits and four runs in the fourth, then watched
as Finley could not retire a batter in the fifth and allowed four
more runs to score.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd didn't come alive again until the seventh when Mo
Vaughn hit a meaningless home run, his 11th of the season and his
third in as many games.
</P>
<P>
   But by then the Angels had their third consecutive loss,
dropping them deeper into last place in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   For Finley (3-5), it was more of an alternating pattern of peaks
and valleys that has marked his last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, he limited the World Series champion New York Yankees
to three hits and no runs in eight innings of a 1-0 victory. In his
next start, against Baltimore, he was chased in the sixth inning
after giving up seven hits and five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Finley returned last Sunday against Tampa Bay to pitch his first
complete game since July 1997 and the 14th shutout of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Now this, but never so hot and cold in the same game. And for
bottom liners, the 11 runs allowed was the most allowed by the
Angels in a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Finley seemed to have the better of his
opponent, Royals right-hander Kevin Appier, who has drawn the
interest of the pitching-thin Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Appier, (6-2) back after missing most of the 1998 season due to
shoulder surgery, escaped serious injury in the second inning after
taking a Darin Erstad line drive off the inside of the left foot.
</P>
<P>
   The ball ricocheted into foul territory along the first base
line and play was halted for several minutes as Appier dropped to
the ground in pain.
</P>
<P>
   He returned, but was greeted by a Randy Velarde base hit that
scored Andy Sheets and gave the Angels a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The pain quickly disappeared and Appier sailed through the six
innings and left after throwing exactly 100 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a strong sense early that Appier wasn't going to
get much offensive support, especially when Finley struck out
Jermaine Dye, former Angel Chad Kreuter and Joe Randa in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Finely fanned Scott Leius, Rey Sanchez and Carlos Febles in the
third then got Beltran to open the fourth. Beltran had given the
Royals a 1-0 lead in the first with a home run into the Angels
bullpen, his seventh of the season. But in the fourth he gave no
indication of what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   Damon's single to nearly skipped by Erstad in left for extra
bases. The crowd applauded Erstad's defensive effort, but Mike
Sweeney followed with a single and Damon scored on an infield out
by Dye.
</P>
<P>
   Finley might have gotten out of trouble right there when he
appeared to get an inning ending strike out on Kreuter on a 2-2
pitch. Instead, home plate umpire Fieldin Culbreth called it a ball
and Kreuter walked on the next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Randa and Scott Leius added RBI singles and Randa scored all the
way from first on a throwing error by Angels shortstop Andy Sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Finley lasted just three batters into the fifth, done in by a
double from Febles a walk to Beltran and an RBI single by Damon.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Al Levine took over, but the two runners on base
were Finley's responsibility. Levine retired the first batter, but
Dye drove a 0-1 fastball for his 10th home run to give the Royals a
9-2 lead.

POLICE SNIPER KILLS GUNMAN AFTER DEADLY RAMPAGE THROUGH
NEIGHBORHOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER AND PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHORELINE, Wash. _ Police killed a 22-year-old man Friday night
who fled an accident on Interstate 5 and terrorized two blocks of a
North End neighborhood near Seattle, fatally bludgeoning an elderly
woman, breaking another woman's neck and spraying bullets at
police.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the rampage began earlier in Brier, a
Snohomish County suburb where the man's mother and his 2-year-old
nephew were found slain inside a house on a quiet cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   Before it ended, the melee sent at least four people _ including
a King County sheriff's deputy _ to hospitals and shut down I-5 in
both directions, gridlocking holiday travelers leaving early for
the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, children at a nearby elementary school were
confined by police to the building until 8:30 Friday night, after
it was confirmed that a police sharpshooter had killed the suspect.
Anxious parents waited outside the school for hours.
</P>
<P>
   King County Sheriff Dave Reichert refused to identify the man,
but said the suspect may have had a $10,000 warrant out for his
arrest. Reichert would not say what the warrant was for.
</P>
<P>
   As the man darted from house to house, he came upon Erma Spence,
63, whom he attacked with a gardening tool. She was pronounced dead
at Seattle's Harborview Medical Center at 2:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, 82-year-old Irene Z. Hilton, suffered a broken
neck after she was attacked in her backyard garden.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the suspect fled south on I-5 in his slain mother's
car, speeding wildly through holiday traffic. Washington State
Trooper Tom Foster said at about 1:30 p.m., the suspect swerved
suddenly and collided with Anthony Venegas, 64, of Everett, Wash.,
who was riding a motorcycle. The impact almost severed one of
Venegas' legs, which doctors later amputated below the left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The mangled, stolen car caught fire and skidded to a halt just
north of 195th Street Northeast in Shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect ran, and may have used a pedestrian bridge to cross
over a thick sound wall that separates the busy freeway from a
quiet neighborhood of suburban ramblers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a warm, sunny afternoon, and police believe Spence was
outside in her garden, which bordered her one-story home, when she
was attacked.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-year-old neighbor heard Spence crying for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was screaming, `Help me!','' the neighbor said. ``It
sounded like she was being beaten because it was the sound of
something hitting'' her.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old woman frantically called 911 and then headed for
Spence's house. She said she saw a young black man leaving and
asked him what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked sketchy, and he didn't say anything back,'' she
said. Then, the man jumped a chain-link fence bordering Spence's
property, and the neighbor said she became afraid and ran back to
her house.
</P>
<P>
   John Wayne, a 28-year-old neighbor, was one of the first to come
upon Spence. He said Spence was lying in a pool of blood, with what
looked like a broken posthole digger near her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not looking good,'' Wayne said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before, Wayne had been standing on a footbridge,
surveying the scene from the car accident. When he looked back
toward his neighborhood, he said he saw a disturbed-looking man in
his early 20s sporting braids or dreadlocks looking at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was acting very, very agitated,'' Wayne said. ``He was
looking around paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   The man then disappeared, and that's when Wayne heard neighbors
shouting for help from Spence's home.
</P>
<P>
   After the assailant left Spence, he moved across Seventh Avenue
Northeast. He marched through the unlocked doors of the home of
John Berger, and his roomate Michael Barker, who live at 525 N.E.
195th St.
</P>
<P>
   Face to face with the threatening man, who wore a baggy shirt
and was bleeding at the mouth, Berger and his roommate went for
their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking very irrationally like he lost his way,''
Berger said. ``I told him to get out. There was craziness in his
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to scare the man away. He then moved south down
Seventh Avenue Northeast, navigating through the backyards of
several homes. His next victim, police say, was 82-year-old Hilton,
a widow in poor health who was puttering in her yard.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton's next-door neighbor of more than four decades, Gerald
Gehret, heard Hilton screaming his name.
</P>
<P>
   He peered over his fence and saw the man grabbing Hilton by her
hair. As soon as the man saw him, Gehret said, he hit her with what
looked like a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Gehret ran inside to grab a gun. He went out his front door and
spotted police outside. He pointed them to Hilton's house and put
away his gun. King County Sheriff's officers had by then responded
to a 911 call from the neighborhood, spokesman John Urquhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing police, the assailant fled, leaving Hilton behind, her
neck broken. Hilton was listed in critical condition Friday night
at Harborview Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the assailant then moved two houses south, to the
four-bedroom home of Fred and Chrystine Westphal, who have lived on
Seventh Avenue Northeast for 11 years. Neither the Westphals nor
their three children were home.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect found the Westphal's gun collection and barricaded
himself inside their home, police said. The Westphals kept three
semi-automatic handguns, two rifles and two shotguns in rifle bags
or boxes, according to 16-year-old Austin Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   Police quickly surrounded the home. Over the next three hours,
police estimate the suspect shot at them 50 or more times.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, the suspect changed weapons and went to a
higher-caliber weapon _ a rifle of some type, said Washington State
Trooper Phillip Davidson, who was one of the first officers on the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Five or six officers took cover behind a Jeep Cherokee near the
house and ordered the suspect to come out and drop his weapon. They
gave the suspect two warnings on the bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
   There was no response, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking cover behind the Jeep, King County Sheriff's Deputy Diana
Russell received cuts to her face and her skull was fractured after
the suspect opened fire. Two Montlake Terrace Police officers
received minor injuries from flying glass.
</P>
<P>
   After that, an armed personnel carrier provided by the Seattle
Police Department's SWAT team was sent in.
</P>
<P>
   While SWAT teams extricated deputies pinned down by gunfire,
other officers helped evacuate nearby homes and secure six blocks
around the scene. Children at nearby North City Elementary School
were ordered to stay in their school throughout the evening until
they could be safely released.
</P>
<P>
   The stand-off between police and the suspect culminated at about
5:30 p.m. when snipers moved in closer to the home, said Reichert.
He said one sniper fired a shot through a window, hitting the
suspect. The man, who was holding a firearm, fell back and his gun
dropped from the window into the yard.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 p.m., officers approached the house and threw in tear gas
cannisters from two sides. They repeated that at 6:15 and again at
6:30 p.m. and were hoping to flush the suspect out, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Then robots from the Seattle Police Department's bomb squad,
with cameras attached to them were sent into the house to search
for the suspect, who was found dead.

EX-POLICE OFFICER TO PLEAD GUILTY TO CRASH THAT KILLED ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A former Bellevue police officer will plead guilty to
charges of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault for a deadly
car wreck that stunned the community in the first hours of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Thomas, 29, told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Friday he
accepts responsibility for the Jan. 1 wreck that killed one
passenger in his car and left the other, a Washington State Patrol
trooper, facing a grueling rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas knows he will spend time in prison. King County
prosecutors want him to serve four years.
</P>
<P>
   He will live with the guilt of lives devastated and the nagging
wish he had called a cab.
</P>
<P>
   He never again can be a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who will enter his guilty plea in King County Superior
Court Tuesday morning, wants people to realize an alcohol-related
tragedy could happen to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a police officer, I was trained to know what the effect of
alcohol was, and I made a bad judgment, anyway,'' he said. ``It
doesn't matter who you are _ if you get behind the wheel when
you've been drinking, you take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was out to celebrate the New Year and the birthday of his
best friend, State Patrol Trooper Jeremy Reid. He was driving that
night, and he thought he was being careful.
</P>
<P>
   He finished his last drink three hours before he left a Seattle
party early Jan. 1, he said. He felt sober, and he even tested
himself with the portable breath test he used in his job as a
Bellevue police officer.
</P>
<P>
   It was not enough to avert tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he ``had a couple drinks'' at his house on New
Year's Eve before he and his friends, Reid and Reid's childhood
friend, Brian Grooms of Ohio, went to a dance party promoted by a
Seattle radio station at the Seattle Center.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he had ``a couple'' more drinks _ he would not say
what kind _ and they stayed for several hours. When they decided to
leave, Thomas said they passed around the portable breath test.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said he blew a 0.07 percent, which is just below the
state's legal limit for intoxication. He said both of his friends
failed and unanimously affirmed Thomas would drive.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he was speeding _ prosecutors say he may have doubled
the posted 40-mph speed limit _ when his 1998 Dodge Stratus veered
out of control on south Bellevue's Coal Creek Parkway and crossed
the center line just after 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It smashed into a Ford Expedition driven by John Bell, a
Bellevue man police say also was intoxicated. Bell was not hurt,
but his wife suffered neck and leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Grooms, 26, who was riding in the back seat, died at the scene.
Reid was so badly hurt he remained in a coma for 19 days.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas suffered broken ribs and a concussion, and a Bellevue
police officer who responded said his off-duty colleague smelled of
liquor and appeared intoxicated, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   A blood test indicated Thomas' blood-alcohol level was 0.08
roughly two hours after the crash. By new legal standards that had
just gone into effect at midnight, prosecutors say Thomas was
drunk.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for his guilty plea, King County prosecutors agreed
to recommend that Thomas spend four years in prison, the middle of
the approximate 3{- to 4{-year standard sentencing range.
</P>
<P>
   A sentencing hearing probably will be scheduled during the next
two months.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' attorney, John Wolfe, said he will ask the judge for a
sentence lower than the standard range. Victims' consent can be
mitigating in the eyes of the law, said Wolfe, who could argue Reid
and Grooms knew Thomas had been drinking when they climbed into his
car.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Thomas' apparent alcohol level being near the legal
borderline, he said did not want to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was responsible for the accident, and knowing that, it would
not be right to fight it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has little recollection of the predawn wreck, which stunned
the Bellevue Police Department and the community. He has only
blurred memories of an ambulance ride and awakening, painfully, at
Seattle's Harborview Medical Center to the bitter reality he'll
live with the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The guilt still racks his thoughts and occasionally steals his
sleep at night. He has told both Reid and Grooms' mother he is
sorry.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of being an officer and being involved in the first
alcohol-related fatality under new state drunken-driving laws
thrust Thomas into the spotlight _ and onto the side of the law he
thought he'd never be.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I wanted to help people, and now to be considered
a criminal by society _ it's tough,'' he said, slowly shaking his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the crash, Thomas resigned from the Bellevue
Police Department, where he had worked 2{ years.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a solemn interview yesterday in his attorney's Seattle
office, Thomas' eyes lighted up to talk about Reid _ and the latest
hurdle in his recovery. Friday, Reid was released in a wheelchair
from Ohio State University Medical Center and allowed to go home
with his mother, who lives in the small town of Washington Court
House.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was thrilled Reid, his best friend whom he calls every
few days, was improving. Reid is learning to walk with a cane and
will undergo extensive physical and speech therapy, according to
State Patrol spokesman Capt. Eric Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy's stubborn. He'll walk again, and he says he's going to
come back and be a trooper,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Reid met several years ago at Fort Lewis in Pierce
County, where they were stationed in the Army. A strong friendship
and playful rivalry grew out of their shared love of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Reid's mother would discuss her son's condition only
through Robertson. But she has previously expressed support, not
blame, for her son's friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other punishment or prison time will change the life
sentence Eric will live with,'' Carol Reid said in a statement in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Thomas has picked up a few odd jobs. Once envisioning
becoming Bellevue's police chief someday, he now does not know what
his life will hold. ``I made a terrible mistake,'' he said. ``I
wish I could change it, but I can't.''

GOOD START FOR USC, LEHR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He had been to a regional before, but it was
nothing like this. Justin Lehr was on a different team and playing
a different position.
</P>
<P>
   He made an impact this time.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr, a right-hander who transferred to USC for his senior year,
went the distance in the Trojans' 10-0 victory over Virginia
Commonwealth in the opening game of the NCAA first-round regional
Friday afternoon at Dedeaux Field.
</P>
<P>
   USC (34-23) plays today at 3 p.m. against Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr, who came to USC from UC Santa Barbara, where he was a
three-year starter as a catcher, pitched the first complete-game
shutout of his career. He gave up six hits and struck out 10,
including Cory Bauswell to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr jumped off the mound after the final out, yelling and
pumping his fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (the emotion) had to do with the way this year has
gone for me, sometimes good and sometimes frustrating,'' said Lehr,
who improved to 7-2. ``Today was a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   The strikeouts stood out in Lehr's performance. He struck out
the side in the first, then caught Bauswell looking with a fastball
on the outside corner in the fourth to end a bases-loaded threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not too much of a better day you can have from a
pitcher's standpoint,'' USC catcher Eric Munson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr's ability to get out of the fourth, while the Trojans were
holding a 4-0 lead, was the game-breaker for the Rams (40-19).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good regional performance by a great pitcher,'' VCU
head coach Paul Keyes said. ``It's still a 4-0 game. It put (USC)
in a comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans gave Lehr a lot of room to work; they jumped on VCU
starter John Korn (8-5) in the first with four runs on three hits.
Jason Lane had an RBI double and Dominic Correa a run-scoring
triple in the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was dictated in the first inning,'' Keyes said.
``(USC) came out and took it to us early.''
</P>
<P>
   Korn never recovered. In seven innings, he gave up 11 hits and
was charged with 10 runs, nine earned. USC designated hitter Carlos
Casillas had three hits off Korn _ a single, double and home run.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a triple for the cycle in his last at-bat in the
seventh, the burly Casillas, who is 6-foot-4 and 245 pounds, struck
out. Casillas doesn't have a triple in his USC career.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My chance) was pretty slim there,'' Casillas said. ``It would
have been better if I needed something else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans avenged a 14-4 loss to the Rams in last year's East
Regional at Clemson behind Lehr, Casillas and freshman third
baseman Beau Craig, who hit a three-run homer in the seventh that
made it 10-0. None of those three played against VCU last year, but
Lehr has been in the playoffs before.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman at UCSB, Lehr played in a regional at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, getting to Omaha isn't that far away,'' he said. ``We
didn't think we were going to win that regional. This is our
regional to win. It picks up your game, takes it to the next
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine earned its way into the winner's bracket on the right
arm of sophomore pitcher Jay Adams, who pitched his third shutout
of the season with a 4-0 victory over Harvard. Adams (11-2) gave up
four hits and struck out eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just worked down (in the strike zone) and got a lot of
ground balls,'' said Adams, who induced 12 groundouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves (44-14) were methodical against the Crimson (28-19),
getting one hit in each of the first four innings and two in the
fifth. Dane Sardinha's 15th homer in the fourth gave Pepperdine a
2-0 lead.

POINTS SYSTEM DOESN'T BOTHER CROMSIGT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Gerrit Cromsigt has been the dominant
competitor in the NASCAR Late Model division at Irwindale Speedway
thus far.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't tell that by looking at the track point standings,
which before Friday night's event showed the Pine Mountain Club
resident tied for first place with Palmdale's Richard Hooper.
</P>
<P>
   Cromsigt, who has won three of the first four Late Model
features at Irwindale, doesn't seem to mind the system that scores
50 points for first place, 48 for second and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The points system is fair,'' Cromsigt said. ``It rewards
everyone who gets in the race. But if you miss a race ... that's
where it really hurts you. As long as you get in the race and
finish the race, you're doing OK. It's quite fair because something
could happen to you, and that could be the deciding factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it shouldn't be that way. I don't know. Maybe wins
should be worth more, but (the point system) seems fair to me. It's
been that way forever.''
</P>
<P>
   It also gives someone like Simi Valley's Dusty McDonald, who is
basically starting from scratch, a chance to stay in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who is in his first season running on a half-mile
track, began Friday night's event third in points, a mere 18 points
off the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot closer,'' said McDonald, who had the top
qualifying lap Friday. ``My car had never raced a half-mile track
until it came here. Cromsigt has been on a half-mile for the past
three years. It's going to take us a little time for us to get
caught up. Our car is sharp in qualifying and we're not doing
anything different than what we're doing in the main events. We
just got to get the car where it will handle right the whole main
event and not go away on us towards the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding on: Rod Johnson will try hold on to his points lead in
one division and make ground in another when the NASCAR Super Late
Models and Grand American Modified classes return to Irwindale
Speedway tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a resident of Canyon Country, has been a steady
competitor in Super Late Model, considered the elite division in
the NASCAR sportsmen Winston Racing series.
</P>
<P>
   He has won one feature and comes into tonight's event with a
30-point advantage over second-place A.J. Dimarzo of Saugus. Others
who could contend in the Super Late Model feature include Duarte's
Dennis Arena, who is fifth in points, and Chino Hills' Tim Woods,
who has won one race and ranks 10th in points.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is on the other side of the points chase in Grand
American Modifieds.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the No. 15 Chevrolet finished second in last
weekend's event and is in second place, 30 points behind leader
Larry Krieger of Thousand Oaks. Krieger won for the second time
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers who are doing well in the points standings include
Whittier's Greg Benner, who is fourth in Super Stocks; Scott
Porter, who is fifth in Mini Stocks and Covina's Luis Del Real, who
is second in Street Stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's trophy dash winners were Hooper in Late Model, Mike
Price in Super Stocks and Kevin Bernhardt in Mini Stocks.

ON THE PLUS SIDE: MARINERS WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariner 500, seemingly a two-year race to nowhere,
took a pit stop Friday night. Put the brakes on. Screeched to a
halt.
</P>
<P>
   For just the third time in 207 games, the home club climbed
above the break-even mark, pushing forward with a 6-1 victory over
Tampa Bay before 25,421 fans at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey's three-run home run and Russ Davis' solo shot
backed another precocious effort by one-third of Randy Johnson's
trade bounty, rookie pitcher Freddy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome left the Mariners at 24-23, their first peek at the
top side of the ledger since they were 4-3 on April 12. They
experienced a winning record only once during the 1998 season, at
19-18 on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope it continues,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``It
coincides with pitching. Our pitching has gotten better.''
</P>
<P>
   Said first baseman David Segui: ``We're a lot better than a .500
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskey pointed the Mariners in a positive direction when he
crunched a two-out homer in the first inning, scoring Alex
Rodriguez and Ken Griffey Jr. The others had reached base on a pair
of Texas Leaguers, balls softly landing in right and center fields,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing light and breezy about Huskey's connection.
</P>
<P>
   On a 2-0 pitch, the Mariner right fielder took a cut so
forceful, he looked like a high handicapper letting one rip off the
first tee at Jackson Park. He nearly fell over. One hand flew off
the bat. The ball was pulled dead left. But in this instance, he
didn't have to tee it up again. The blast landed about 20 rows up
in left field, 401 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey said he felt sick all day, but not enough to come out of
the lineup. Sometimes you play better that way, he reasoned. A
misplaced Wilson Alvarez changeup was the right tonic in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you go up to the plate for, you want to hit a
mistake,'' said Huskey, who has eight homers and 30 RBIs. ``I just
saw it and hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Huskey circled the bases, unsubstantiated trade rumors were
circulating in Los Angeles that he would soon become a Dodger in a
three-way trade that included the New York Yankees. In the
exchange, the Mariners and Yankees supposedly would receive
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Piniella nor Huskey was aware of any such deal being
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' the Mariner manager said. ``I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Me to the Dodgers?'' Huskey said. ``I haven't heard
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis used a more restrained swing than Huskey, but launched a
longer homer in the fifth inning. His two-out poke to left-center
traveled 422 feet, hitting halfway up the dark blue background
tarp. It was his 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and Segui didn't find the fence on this night, but each
singled, extending their respective hitting streaks. Griffey is now
at 16, Segui 13.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia (6-1) went just the minimum five innings, his outing cut
short by an inexplicable case of wildness. But when he was out
there, the Devil Rays couldn't hit him, collecting just four
singles. Two hits and Miguel Cairo's sacrifice fly produced the
only run off him.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander struggled mightily in the fifth, walking the
bases full with two outs. He threw balls in the dirt. He took off
his hat and paced behind the mound. But rather than suffer a
complete meltdown, he retired Jose Canseco on a 2-1 pitch, getting
him to ground to third for an easy forceout.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco had other unpleasant moments as well. Early on, he had
words with a heckler who was escorted out of the stands by three
police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia's hasty exit was prompted by poor mechanics. Piniella's
law finished him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk three hitters like that, you give up runs; we
were fortunate,'' the manager said. ``He started opening up his
front shoulder and lost his control. ... We expect all of our
starting pitchers to give us six or seven innings. But Freddy's
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garcia, who had no problem with the early hook: ``I lose my
mechanics. I open my shoulder. I don't follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Another rookie, Jordan Zimmerman, replaced Garcia and threw two
shutout innings, permitting only a harmless walk to his first
batter, Fred McGriff.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Jose Paniagua finished it off with two more shutout
innings, with McGriff's single the only interruption.
</P>
<P>
   It was a win-win situation. For Seattle, a victory and a record
on the plus side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to keep it up,'' Piniella said.

FINLEY, ANGELS PUMMELED BY ROYALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ From the record book to a fifth-inning hook,
Chuck Finley's Friday night was more than even he could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing one of the most up-and-down stretches of his 14-year
Anaheim Angels career, Finley tied the American League mark with
seven consecutive strikeouts before allowing seven runs to the next
10 batters in an 11-4 loss to the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Edison Field crowd of 30,946 cheered wildly as Finley struck
out the side in the second and third innings and got Carlos Beltran
to open the fourth, matching the league record set by Nolan Ryan,
Roger Clemens and Ron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans turned sullen when Johnny Damon started a rally
that included four hits and four runs in the fourth, then watched
as Finley could not retire a batter in the fifth and allowed four
more runs to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been through anything like that,'' Finley said.
``It was such a sudden reversal. I was a real Jekyll and Hyde out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd didn't come alive again until the seventh when Mo
Vaughn hit a meaningless home run, his 11th of the season and his
third in as many games. But by then, the Angels had their third
consecutive loss, dropping them deeper into last place in the
American League West.
</P>
<P>
   For Finley (3-5), it was more of an alternating pattern of peaks
and valleys that has marked his past four starts.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, he limited the World Series champion New York Yankees
to three hits and no runs in eight innings of a 1-0 victory. In his
next start, against Baltimore, he was chased in the sixth inning
after giving up seven hits and five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Finley returned last Sunday against Tampa Bay to pitch his first
complete game since July 1997 and the 14th shutout of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Now this, but never so hot and cold in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen others go through this, but not Chuck,'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``When he was striking out all those
guys, I said to myself, `This definitely is his night.'''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Finley seemed to have the better of his
opponent, Royals right-hander Kevin Appier, who has drawn the
interest of the pitching-thin Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Appier, (6-2) back after missing most of the 1998 season due to
shoulder surgery, escaped serious injury in the second inning after
taking a Darin Erstad line drive off the inside of the left foot.
</P>
<P>
   The ball ricocheted into foul territory along the first-base
line and play was halted for several minutes as Appier dropped to
the ground in pain. The former Antelope Valley High star returned,
but was greeted by a Randy Velarde base hit that scored Andy Sheets
and gave the Angels a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The pain quickly disappeared and Appier sailed through the six
innings and left after throwing exactly 100 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a strong sense early that Appier wasn't going to
get much offensive support, especially when Finley struck out
Jermaine Dye, former Angel Chad Kreuter and Joe Randa in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   Finely fanned Scott Leius, Rey Sanchez and Carlos Febles in the
third then got Beltran to open the fourth. Beltran had given the
Royals a 1-0 lead in the first with a home run into the Angels
bullpen, his seventh of the season. But in the fourth he gave no
indication of what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   Damon's single nearly skipped by Erstad in left for extra bases.
The crowd applauded Erstad's defensive effort, but Mike Sweeney
followed with a single and Damon scored on an infield out by Dye.
</P>
<P>
   Finley might have gotten out of trouble right there when he
appeared to get an inning-ending strikeout on Kreuter on a 2-2
pitch. Instead, home-plate umpire Fieldin Culbreth called it a ball
and Kreuter walked on the next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't complain about calls, but that pitch might have
changed everything,'' Collins said. ``It would have still been
close. Then, it just got away.''
</P>
<P>
   Randa and Scott Leius added RBI singles and Randa scored all the
way from first on a throwing error by Angels shortstop Andy Sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Finley lasted just three batters into the fifth, done in by a
double from Febles a walk to Beltran and an RBI single by Damon.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Al Levine took over, but the two runners on base
were Finley's responsibility. Levine retired the first batter, but
Dye drove a 0-1 fastball for his 10th home run to give the Royals a
9-2 lead.

McDONALD RALLIES FOR VICTORY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Be careful what you wish for, it just might
come true.
</P>
<P>
   It did for Dusty McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   The Simi Valley resident pulled off the near-impossible when he
edged Gerrit Cromsigt to win the NASCAR Late Model feature Friday
night before a sparse crowd at Irwindale Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners were La Verne's Scott Porter in Mini Stocks and
Mike Price in Super Stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just speechless,'' said McDonald, who overcame a 10-car
length deficit to eke past Cromsigt by about a foot at the finish.
``I really don't know what to say. I guess I know how Jeff Gordon
feels now.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it appeared Cromsigt, who increased his points lead
with the second-place finish, would win his fourth event in five
tries.
</P>
<P>
   The Pine Mountain Club resident grabbed the lead on the
backstretch of the opening lap and increased his advantage to
nearly 600 feet near the middle of the 40-lap event.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonald kept plugging away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident with my car,'' said McDonald, who sliced
Cromsigt's advantage to a mere car length with three laps to go.
``My crew chief is a set-up genius. I just pushed it as hard as I
could so I could catch up with (Cromsigt). When I did, I was kind
of amazed. I just kept running different lines, hoping he would
mess up and I could take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That came as both drivers took the white flag.
</P>
<P>
   Then as both approached turn 3, McDonald took an inside line,
and slipped just in front of Cromsigt as both exited turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed in front for the victory, although at first the
scoreboard showed Cromsigt as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really couldn't tell you what happened that last lap,''
McDonald said. ``I was trying to get underneath him because I knew
I had more coming out of the turn. He had more going into the turn,
but I seemed to have more coming out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was praying to God that I'd won because I couldn't see his
front end past mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mini Stock feature was dominated by Porter, who won for the
second time in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Suchy finished second, with Fontana's Kevin Bernhardt
third.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach's Garry Kenyon, who finished 0.589 seconds behind
Porter, was disqualified following a postrace inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, the son-in-law of Winston West racer Kenny Smith, did
receive some challenges in the 20-lap race.
</P>
<P>
   Both came from Kenyon, who started third before moving up to
second when he bumped Richard Yanker Jr. on the front stretch of
the third lap.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Kenyon was able to rub the back bumper of Porter's Ford
Pinto, the last coming on lap 16.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, who moved up to fourth in points with the victory, then
slowly increased his lead over Kenyon before winning by about three
car lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Price won a thrilling 25-lap fight in the Super Stock feature.
</P>
<P>
   The San Pedro resident, who started sixth, took advantage of a
late caution to beat North Hills' T.K. Karvasek by 0.248 seconds.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, May 30, will move Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Now that a congressional committee has
released its three-volume, 872-page techno thriller on what it
believes was the theft of atomic secrets by Chinese spies, much of
Washington is agog. But the uproar overlooks an arresting fact. For
more than half a decade, the Clinton administration was shoveling
atomic secrets out the door as fast as it could, literally by the
ton. Free to all takers, including China's bomb makers, were
millions of previously classified ideas and documents related to
nuclear arms. The tale of that giveaway and what it helped
accomplish, its architects say, is more subtle and perhaps
ultimately more important than the congressional nail-biter. By
William F. Broad. (a category)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   STUDENT-BEHAVIOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the nation's school year
limps to an anxious close, with teachers and principals exhausted
from worry about safety and undetected rage, educators and
psychologists say they are re-examing adolescent behavior _ the
moods, the cliques, the barely repressed violence _ and finding
that American society has failed to come to terms with how such
behavior has changed in recent decades. By Ethan Bronner. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   GUN-RIGHTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Second Amendment, the orphan
of the Bill of Rights, has been written off as a legal backwater
for decades. Judges and legal scholars have glossed over its
guarantee of the right ``to keep and bear arms'' as if it were so
much propaganda for the National Rifle Association. But now, just
as gun control is gaining momentum, the provision one legal scholar
calls ``the embarrassing Second Amendment'' is being taken
seriously for the first time in modern memory, with some scholars
and at least one federal judge saying it may guarantee individual
citizens some rights to guns, after all. By William Glaberson. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SHOOTING-REVIEW (Washington) _ It did not happen after the
bullets flew and the bodies fell at a high school in West Paducah,
Ky., in December 1997, nor did it happen on the heels of the
gunfire and bloodshed at schools in Jonesboro, Ark., or
Springfield, Ore., last year. But after Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., became a deadly shooting gallery on April 20, the
earth finally moved, at least politically speaking, in subtle but
undeniable ways. By Frank Bruni. (a category)
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE-LAWYERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Should defense counsel do
everything in their power to defend a client? Defense lawyers say
that obligation includes suggesting almost any scenario that can
possibly create doubt in a juror's mind. By Laura Masnerus. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   NATO-REVIEW (Undated) _ NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia
has exposed more than policy differences between the European and
American alliance partners. As never before, it has revealed the
vast technological gulf that separates American military
capabilities from those of Britain, France and the others. And
that, in turn, shows just how much the Europeans remain militarily
dependent on the United States for their own defense _ dependent,
and resentful. By Craig R. Whitney. (i category)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is Kosovo a liberal cause? A
conservative one? Actually, it's hard to tell. By Patricia Cohen.
(i category)
</P>
<P>
   WEST-CODE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Spokane (Wash.) County
Commission this month published a pamphlet called the ``Code of the
West'' to forewarn new and prospective residents about the pitfalls
of supposedly idyllic country life. You might also call it ``How
the West Is Not Fun.'' Here are excerpts. By Tom Kuntz. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   SYMPHONIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Imagine being Franz Xaver
Suessmayr. Your teacher, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, is dying, just as
he's writing one of his greatest works. On his deathbed he explains
how he envisions completing it. The rest is up to you. Poor
Suessmayr. No one can say which parts of the ``Requiem'' he had to
make up, and he never wrote anything particularly good after that.
The ``Requiem'' case suggests that finishing the unfinished
artworks of the dead has never been an easy business, and recent
news from the art and literary worlds confirms it anew. By Jenny
Lyn Bader. (a category)
</P>
<P>
   POETRY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Now that the fanfare around National
Poetry Month in April has died down _ the readings, the poetry
slams, the tractor pulls _ there is time for a little serious
contemplation about the future of the form. Questions abound: Is
there a hot genre? What will the new millennium bring? Are the
poetry wars over? Have the Nuyoricans, those anti-establishment
esthetes, sold out? And, finally, will it ever be OK to rhyme
again? By Jesse McKinley. (a category)

<P>
   Now that a congressional committee has released its
three-volume, 872-page techno-thriller on the theft of atomic
secrets by Chinese spies, much of Washington is agog. But the
uproar overlooks an arresting fact. For more than a half decade,
the Clinton administration was shoveling atomic secrets out the
door as fast as it could, literally by the ton. Millions of
previously classified ideas and documents relating to nuclear arms
were released to all comers, including China's bomb makers.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of that giveaway and what it helped accomplish, its
architects say, is perhaps ultimately more important than the
congressional nail-biter, even though the tale is subtle and the
accomplishments are not what you might expect from disclosures on
how to make bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1993, when the terrors of the Cold War were still fresh,
the administration decided that the best way to keep the nuclear
arms race from heating up again was to get the world's nations to
sign a test-ban treaty. The idea was that even if a country knew
how to make a bomb, it couldn't perfect new ones and build up
advanced forces without physically testing new designs. So
development of new weapons would be frozen, ending the vicious
spiral of nuclear move and countermove.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing many of America's nuclear secrets was seen as an
essential part of this strategy, since it would signal a new global
order in which nuclear know-how was suddenly and irreparably
devalued and real security would lie in the collective knowledge
that nobody was able to push weaponry beyond the known boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   What had been gold would become dross, and the atom would lose
power and prestige. Driven by such logic, the administration made
public masses of generalities about nuclear arms, even as specific
weapon designs were kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, critics charge that the gamble failed _ that the
explosion last year of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan and
the reports that China has stolen America's top designs for nuclear
arms have demonstrated that the test ban is fatally flawed. The
depth and breadth of China's spying, they add, make the world's
largest state seem quite hungry for a thoroughly modernized nuclear
force, test-ban treaty or no.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the China scandal, the Clinton administration has
stopped all declassifications, beefed up security at the national
weapons laboratories and adopted a conciliatory tone. Last week. as
the House select committee released its report, President Clinton
called protecting atom secrets ``a solemn obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in private, administration officials say the openness was
smart after all, its advantages even now outweighing its risks.
They insist that its crowning jewel, the test ban, while admittedly
shaky, still has lessened the risk of new atomic advances, making
it a potent force for international good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled off an impossible feat,'' said Hazel O'Leary, keeper
of the nation's atom secrets as secretary of energy from 1993 to
1997. ``To say all our efforts were negative is not to understand
the benefits, not to see what we did in terms of building
international trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics disagree vehemently. But they say the giveaway
nonetheless illuminates the spy scandal and helps explain the
administration's slow response when confronted with evidence of
spying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nothing short of miraculous if the openness has
not seriously damaged U.S. interests,'' said Frank Gaffney Jr., a
Pentagon official during the Reagan administration who now directs
the Center for Security Policy, a research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, officials say, the Energy Department's ``openness
initiative'' has released at least 178 categories of atom secrets.
By contrast, the 1980s saw two such actions. The unveilings have
included no details of specific weapons, like the W-88, a compact
design Chinese spies are suspected of having stolen from the
weapons lab at Los Alamos, N.M. But they include a slew of general
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Its overview of the disclosures, ``Restricted Data
Declassification Decisions,'' dated January 1999 and more than 140
pages long, lists such things as how atom bombs can be boosted in
power, key steps in making hydrogen bombs, the minimum amount (8.8
pounds) of plutonium or uranium fuel needed for an atom bomb and
the maximum time it takes an exploding atomic bomb to ignite an
H-bomb's hydrogen fuel (100 millionths of a second).
</P>
<P>
   No grade-B physicist from any university could figure this
stuff. It took decades of experience gained at a cost of more than
$400 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the secrets started as a high-stakes bet that
openness would lessen, not increase, the world's vulnerability to
nuclear arms and war. John Holum, who heads arms control at the
State Department, told Congress last year that the test ban
``essentially eliminates'' the possibility of a renewed
international race to develop new kinds of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   And the devaluing of nuclear secrets, highlighted by the rush of
atomic declassifications, was seen as a prerequisite to the ban's
achievement. The symbolism alone was potent, officials say.
Openness let them advertise a dramatic new state of affairs where
hidden actions were to be kept to a minimum, replacing decades of
secrecy and paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States must stand as leader,'' O'Leary told a
packed news conference in December 1993 upon starting the process.
``We are declassifying the largest amount of information in the
history of the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the former secrets are extremely valuable
to foreign powers intent on making nuclear headway. Gaffney, the
former Reagan official, disparaged the giveaway as ``dangling
goodies in front of people to get them to sign up into our
arms-control agenda.''

<P>
   Back in 1993, when the terrors of the Cold War were still fresh,
the administration decided that the best way to keep the nuclear
arms race from heating up again was to get the world's nations to
sign a test-ban treaty. The idea was that even if a country knew
how to make a bomb, it couldn't perfect new ones and build up
advanced forces without physically testing new designs. So
development of new weapons would be frozen, ending the vicious
spiral of nuclear move and countermove.
</P>
<P>
   Releasing many of America's nuclear secrets was seen as an
essential part of this strategy, since it would signal a new global
order in which nuclear know-how was suddenly and irreparably
devalued and real security would lie in the collective knowledge
that nobody was able to push weaponry beyond the known boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   What had been gold would become dross, and the atom would lose
power and prestige. Driven by such logic, the administration made
public masses of generalities about nuclear arms, even as specific
weapon designs were kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, critics charge that the gamble failed _ that the
explosion last year of nuclear devices by India and Pakistan and
the reports that China has stolen America's top designs for nuclear
arms have demonstrated that the test ban is fatally flawed. The
depth and breadth of China's spying, they add, make the world's
largest state seem quite hungry for a thoroughly modernized nuclear
force, test-ban treaty or no.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the China scandal, the Clinton administration has
stopped all declassifications, beefed up security at the national
weapons laboratories and adopted a conciliatory tone. Last week. as
the House select committee released its report, President Clinton
called protecting atom secrets ``a solemn obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   But in private, administration officials say the openness was
smart after all, its advantages even now outweighing its risks.
They insist that its crowning jewel, the test ban, while admittedly
shaky, still has lessened the risk of new atomic advances, making
it a potent force for international good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled off an impossible feat,'' said Hazel O'Leary, keeper
of the nation's atom secrets as secretary of energy from 1993 to
1997. ``To say all our efforts were negative is not to understand
the benefits, not to see what we did in terms of building
international trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics disagree vehemently. But they say the giveaway
nonetheless illuminates the spy scandal and helps explain the
administration's slow response when confronted with evidence of
spying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nothing short of miraculous if the openness has
not seriously damaged U.S. interests,'' said Frank Gaffney Jr., a
Pentagon official during the Reagan administration who now directs
the Center for Security Policy, a research group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, officials say, the Energy Department's ``openness
initiative'' has released at least 178 categories of atom secrets.
By contrast, the 1980s saw two such actions. The unveilings have
included no details of specific weapons, like the W-88, a compact
design Chinese spies are suspected of having stolen from the
weapons lab at Los Alamos, N.M. But they include a slew of general
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Its overview of the disclosures, ``Restricted Data
Declassification Decisions,'' dated January 1999 and more than 140
pages long, lists such things as how atom bombs can be boosted in
power, key steps in making hydrogen bombs, the minimum amount (8.8
pounds) of plutonium or uranium fuel needed for an atom bomb and
the maximum time it takes an exploding atomic bomb to ignite an
H-bomb's hydrogen fuel (100 millionths of a second).
</P>
<P>
   No grade-B physicist from any university could figure this
stuff. It took decades of experience gained at a cost of more than
$400 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The release of the secrets started as a high-stakes bet that
openness would lessen, not increase, the world's vulnerability to
nuclear arms and war. John Holum, who heads arms control at the
State Department, told Congress last year that the test ban
``essentially eliminates'' the possibility of a renewed
international race to develop new kinds of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   And the devaluing of nuclear secrets, highlighted by the rush of
atomic declassifications, was seen as a prerequisite to the ban's
achievement. The symbolism alone was potent, officials say.
Openness let them advertise a dramatic new state of affairs where
hidden actions were to be kept to a minimum, replacing decades of
secrecy and paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States must stand as leader,'' O'Leary told a
packed news conference in December 1993 upon starting the process.
``We are declassifying the largest amount of information in the
history of the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the former secrets are extremely valuable
to foreign powers intent on making nuclear headway. Gaffney, the
former Reagan official, disparaged the giveaway as ``dangling
goodies in front of people to get them to sign up into our
arms-control agenda.''

<P>
   Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources
Defense Council in Washington, a private group that has criticized
the openness, said the declassifications had swept away so many
secrets that the combination had laid bare the central mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the phenomenology of nuclear weapons,'' Cochran
said, ``the cat is out of the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the China scandal broke, experts outside the
administration faulted the openness as promoting the bomb's spread.
Last year, a bipartisan commission of nine military specialists led
by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the ``extensive
declassification'' of secrets had inadvertently aided the global
spread of deadly weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate brake on nuclear advances was to be the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which Clinton began to push for as
soon as he took office in 1993, hailing it as the hardest-fought,
longest-sought prize in the history of arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Like software, nuclear weapons are extraordinarily complex. New
designs must be tested repeatedly to get out the bugs and avoid
failures in war. Without explosive tests, experts say, reliable
designs of advanced arms are basically unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1996, Clinton traveled to the United Nations to
sign the newly negotiated accord on behalf of the United States,
followed by 151 other countries, including China. ``It was my
proudest moment,'' O'Leary, the former energy secretary, said of
watching the president.
</P>
<P>
   Today, key nations, including the United States, have yet to
ratify the accord. So it is in legal limbo.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the China espionage scandal, experts say, the ban is
both good and bad, making the blows softer in the short run and
perhaps harder in the long. Since the test ban helps smother
nuclear developments, any recent Chinese spying probably has had
little impact on arms production.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, secrets of the neutron bomb believed to have been
stolen around 1995 would have been little or no aid to China's test
program, which apparently ended in July 1996. The reason, experts
say, is that tests are enormous affairs of science and industry
that typically take two or three years to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that the administration's expectation that China
could do little with stolen information made it blase about
disclosures of espionage and slowed its response to lax security.
Selling China and other states on the test ban, said Gaffney of the
Center for Security Policy, had a higher administration priority
than plugging leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials deny any foot-dragging. But they note
that much of the thievery cited in the congressional report
occurred long before the test-ban treaty was signed and even before
Clinton took office; this, they say, absolves the administration of
some blame. But it gave the Chinese more time to have used
underground blasts to help turn stolen ideas into deadly arms.
</P>
<P>
   This opportunity for China applies especially to the most
worrisome part of the alleged espionage, the theft in the 1980s of
design secrets for America's most advanced warhead, the W-88. The
damage, officials concede, is probably already done, as China
apparently tested the warhead right before it signed the test-ban
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Today, experts worry about the extent to which American secrets,
lost by accident or design, can be joined with increasingly fast
computers to replace testing, so nuclear strides leave no telltale
rumbles.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, American weapon designers used very fast
computers to calculate how bombs explode, producing simulations
realistic enough to check the feasibility of new designs before
taking the costly step of testing them in blasts. Today computers
are only getting cheaper, faster and better.
</P>
<P>
   The House select committee on Chinese espionage, chaired by
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., sidestepped the issue of China's need
for testing, arguing that computers would suffice for advances. The
test ban, it said in its report, increased China's eagerness for
computers to simulate nuclear blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Ray E. Kidder, a senior physicist at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in California, one of the nation's
nuclear-weapons labs, said China could indeed use supercomputers in
lieu of testing to perfect and field a new weapon. ``But it would
have to be a conservative design,'' Kidder said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Total reliance on computers, he added, would virtually rule out
the development of advanced designs, where tiny changes can spell
the difference between success and failure.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term worry, experts say, is whether the test ban is now
masking major Chinese strides, making them less conspicuous and,
over time, perhaps more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bracken, a military expert at Yale, said the ultimate blow
would be a sudden move by China to break out of the test ban with a
barrage of violent blasts, intent on perfecting a new round of
nuclear arms and tipping the world's geopolitical balance.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of American secrets, he said, ``increases the chance
for technological surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials say such fears are unjustified. If the test ban
holds, they say, and if the openness gamble turns out to have paid
off because fewer nations are seeking to join a nuclear club whose
arsenals are frozen, then the Clinton administration will be
remembered as having had clear vision and courage after all.  &QL;

<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was perplexed. Having grown up in a
California suburb in the 1950s, the Supreme Court justice objected
to the way his colleagues were calling what schoolboys do to
schoolgirls ``sexual harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   As he put it in his dissent in a key ruling last week, ``The
real world of school discipline is a rough-and-tumble place where
students practice newly learned vulgarities, erupt with anger,
tease and embarrass each other, share offensive notes, flirt, push
and shove in the halls, grab and offend.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Georgia boy whose behavior the court considered a
violation of federal law was not a tease. For months he had
taunted, propositioned and put his hands all over the girl seated
next to him. This was not 1950s flirting.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the case reflects how much has changed in the lives of
the young in recent decades. As the nation's school year draws to
an anxious close, with teachers and principals exhausted from worry
about safety and undetected rage, educators and psychologists say
they are re-examining adolescent behavior _ the moods, the cliques,
the barely repressed violence _ and finding that American society
has failed to come to terms with those changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that this is their world, `Lord of the Flies,'
sadistic and hierarchical, that it has always been that way and
they just have to work it out, doesn't fly anymore,'' said Dr. Gil
Noam, a professor of psychiatry and education at Harvard
University. ``Especially in the wake of what happened in Colorado,
we have to reassess that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few specialists accept the implication of Kennedy's dissent
from the Supreme Court's ruling last week that schools may be held
liable for a student's persistent sexual harassment of another.
Those experts say little has changed in the last half century,
except perhaps the way society views how men act toward women, and
it makes no sense to apply the law to teen-age hormones and
immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   Most, however, say a lot has changed, and the problem is that
adults do not grasp the significance of those changes. Youthful
behavior has deteriorated markedly, many say, guns are easily
available and there are far fewer adults around to influence
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, violent television and video images, instead of
older friends or relatives, have become role models. Moreover,
research on aggression suggests that even what some might consider
old-fashioned name-calling can do serious harm.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a 14-year-old New York girl hanged herself in a
high school restroom. Friends said she had suffered continual
verbal abuse by classmates. Psychologists note that such suicides
have been on the rise among the young in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in this field, people really believed the old
saying about sticks and stones breaking bones but words never
harming,'' said Marla R. Brassard, a professor of psychology at
Teachers College at Columbia University whose research focuses on
aggression in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today there is a growing body of research that shows that
the core element of abuse is psychological,'' she said. ``Physical
aggression has no anti-social impact unless it is part of
psychological abuse. Getting picked on at school can be the most
damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Koplewicz, director of the Child Study Center at New
York University, said researchers point to five challenges
adolescents must navigate by the time they reach about age 22: they
must adjust to bodily changes; separate psychologically from their
parents or guardians; develop a social network of friends to whom
they can talk; develop educational and vocational goals, and
establish their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Those are a lot of developmental tasks to face in the space of a
decade or less, he noted, and it is no surprise that adolescents
are moodier than younger children, or that high school can be a
very daunting place.
</P>
<P>
   He and others believe that those challenges have essentially
remained unchanged over the generations. Michael Gurian, a family
therapist from Spokane, Wash., and author of ``A Fine Young Man''
(Putnam, 1998), even believes male adolescent behavior is fairly
constant through all the primates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adolescence is a time for children to become adults, and part
of what they have to do is test each other,'' he said. ``Adults are
their teachers, but other youths are their testers. What we do in
junior high school and high school is normal primate behavior. We
have to do this stuff to each other. The question is, where do we
draw the line? For this generation, the lack of adult supervision
is a very big issue. Over the last 30 years we have gradually been
cutting out adult supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a widely held view of researchers. They point out that
the reduced supervision stems not only from both parents or single
parents working out of the home; it is also because relatives and
neighbors are away as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never in the history of the civilized world been a
cohort of kids that is so little affected by adult guidance and so
attuned to a peer world,'' said William Damon, a professor of
education and director of the Stanford University Center on
Adolescence. ``We have removed grown-up wisdom and allowed them to
drift into a self-constructed, highly relativistic world of
friendship and peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon said that he was stunned when he went to Littleton, Colo.,
after the high school shootings there last month, to find parents
saying they felt they had no business learning what their children
were doing on the Internet. The two students who carried out the
Littleton carnage had vented their hatred on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Damon said the fact that modern adults have a less
black-and-white view of morality and human behavior, that they have
perhaps a more nuanced perspective, seems to be blocking their
ability to give clear-cut guidance and make strict rules for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding can paralyze you,'' he said. ``Understanding the
roots of a boy's misbehavior should not stop you from dealing with
it strictly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurian, the Spokane therapist, says ``Lord of the Flies,'' the
chilling 1954 William Golding novel about boys marooned on an
island without adults, is a useful model of unsupervised male
adolescent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pick on those they consider weak partly to establish a
pecking order and partly to protect the group against weakness,''
he said. ``It is natural for boys to do this and it is natural for
adults to supervise and stop this behavior. We are allowing too
much of the first piece and not enough of the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else is going on as well. The view of what is
appropriate male behavior is shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Jay P. Heubert, a professor of education at Columbia's Teachers
College, said he and his wife were watching an old James Bond movie
recently and noted that Bond, played by Sean Connery, grabbed a
nurse and tried to kiss her. When she resisted, he warned her that
he would tell her boss that she was not performing her job well.
</P>
<P>
   While by today's lights, there could hardly be a clearer example
of sexual harassment, there was no mention of it in the film.
Instead, Bond and the nurse are seen shortly thereafter in steamy
embrace and she becomes his companion for the rest of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our norms of what constitutes offensive behavior are
changing,'' Heubert said. ``This only adds to the difficulty of the
young understanding what is appropriate behavior and of their need
for adults to talk to.''

older friends or relatives, have become role models. Moreover,
research on aggression suggests that even what some might consider
old-fashioned name-calling can do serious harm.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a 14-year-old New York girl hanged herself in a
high school restroom. Friends said she had suffered continual
verbal abuse by classmates. Psychologists note that such suicides
have been on the rise among the young in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started in this field, people really believed the old
saying about sticks and stones breaking bones but words never
harming,'' said Marla R. Brassard, a professor of psychology at
Teachers College at Columbia University whose research focuses on
aggression in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today there is a growing body of research that shows that
the core element of abuse is psychological,'' she said. ``Physical
aggression has no anti-social impact unless it is part of
psychological abuse. Getting picked on at school can be the most
damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Koplewicz, director of the Child Study Center at New
York University, said researchers point to five challenges
adolescents must navigate by the time they reach about age 22: they
must adjust to bodily changes; separate psychologically from their
parents or guardians; develop a social network of friends to whom
they can talk; develop educational and vocational goals, and
establish their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Those are a lot of developmental tasks to face in the space of a
decade or less, he noted, and it is no surprise that adolescents
are moodier than younger children, or that high school can be a
very daunting place.
</P>
<P>
   He and others believe that those challenges have essentially
remained unchanged over the generations. Michael Gurian, a family
therapist from Spokane, Wash., and author of ``A Fine Young Man''
(Putnam, 1998), even believes male adolescent behavior is fairly
constant through all the primates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adolescence is a time for children to become adults, and part
of what they have to do is test each other,'' he said. ``Adults are
their teachers, but other youths are their testers. What we do in
junior high school and high school is normal primate behavior. We
have to do this stuff to each other. The question is, where do we
draw the line? For this generation, the lack of adult supervision
is a very big issue. Over the last 30 years we have gradually been
cutting out adult supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a widely held view of researchers. They point out that
the reduced supervision stems not only from both parents or single
parents working out of the home; it is also because relatives and
neighbors are away as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never in the history of the civilized world been a
cohort of kids that is so little affected by adult guidance and so
attuned to a peer world,'' said William Damon, a professor of
education and director of the Stanford University Center on
Adolescence. ``We have removed grown-up wisdom and allowed them to
drift into a self-constructed, highly relativistic world of
friendship and peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon said that he was stunned when he went to Littleton, Colo.,
after the high school shootings there last month, to find parents
saying they felt they had no business learning what their children
were doing on the Internet. The two students who carried out the
Littleton carnage had vented their hatred on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Damon said the fact that modern adults have a less
black-and-white view of morality and human behavior, that they have
perhaps a more nuanced perspective, seems to be blocking their
ability to give clear-cut guidance and make strict rules for their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding can paralyze you,'' he said. ``Understanding the
roots of a boy's misbehavior should not stop you from dealing with
it strictly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gurian, the Spokane therapist, says ``Lord of the Flies,'' the
chilling 1954 William Golding novel about boys marooned on an
island without adults, is a useful model of unsupervised male
adolescent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pick on those they consider weak partly to establish a
pecking order and partly to protect the group against weakness,''
he said. ``It is natural for boys to do this and it is natural for
adults to supervise and stop this behavior. We are allowing too
much of the first piece and not enough of the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else is going on as well. The view of what is
appropriate male behavior is shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Jay P. Heubert, a professor of education at Columbia's Teachers
College, said he and his wife were watching an old James Bond movie
recently and noted that Bond, played by Sean Connery, grabbed a
nurse and tried to kiss her. When she resisted, he warned her that
he would tell her boss that she was not performing her job well.
</P>
<P>
   While by today's lights, there could hardly be a clearer example
of sexual harassment, there was no mention of it in the film.
Instead, Bond and the nurse are seen shortly thereafter in steamy
embrace and she becomes his companion for the rest of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our norms of what constitutes offensive behavior are
changing,'' Heubert said. ``This only adds to the difficulty of the
young understanding what is appropriate behavior and of their need
for adults to talk to.''

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, May 30:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-INAUG (Abuja, Nigeria) _ In an exuberant ceremony of
martial music and marches, Nigeria's military ruler handed over
power to an elected leader Saturday, opening an era of civilian
government in the nation where one in six Africans live. By
Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TIBET (United Nations) _ The United States appears to be
heading for another clash with China, this time over a divisive
World Bank development loan that would help Chinese authorities
resettle tens of thousands of Chinese in regions traditionally
inhabited by Tibetans and Mongolians. By Paul Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   SLOVAKIA-ELECTION (Bratislava, Slovakia) _ Slovaks faced a
simple choice in the second round of their presidential election:
vote for further democratic progress and joining Europe, or slide
back into international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-ELECTION (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ One year after former
Suharto's forced resignation, an extraordinary spectacle is
unfolding on the streets of Indonesia's cities: a true festival of
democracy _ a free and contested campaign with 48 parties, an
unpredictable outcome and giddy daylong rallies with all the
exuberance of a carnival. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-LEAD-POISONING (Torreon, Mexico) _ The mothers who live
just downwind from a towering lead-smelting plant have begun
describing their children by numbers. After living for decades with
grit from the great smelter, the families living near the plant
have discovered that their children are contaminated with dangerous
levels of lead. Recent tests of children from one corner of the
neighborhood were so high that authorities ordered 393 families to
be evacuated and their houses demolished. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN (Washington) _ The United States is warning that
fighting between India and Pakistan in the icy mountains of Kashmir
risks ``spinning out of control'' and could result in the fourth
war between two nations that last year declared themselves to be
nuclear powers. By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-POLITICS (Johannesburg, South Africa) _ The party whose
slogan used to be ``one settler, one bullet'' is trying to stay in
office by appealing to the nostalgia vote. The Pan Africanist
Congress now preaches ``non-racialism'' and says it welcomes anyone
who considers himself an African first, including white Afrikaners.
But it insists it is the true torchbearer of the ideals upon which
the African National Congress was founded in 1912. The ANC, it
argues, went off track in 1959 when it embraced the Communist
Party, Indians and mixed-race voters, thus diluting what was then
supposed to be a black nationalist struggle. By Donald G. McNeil
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-POLITICS (Buenos Aires, Argentina) _ As the race to
replace President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina heated up in
recent weeks, the two major candidates thought they had found an
ideal campaign theme: blame the incumbent's free market economic
policies for rising unemployment and promise major changes if
elected. But investors got so nervous that rumors swirled of an
impending devaluation of the peso, and the already jittery local
stock market took a nose dive. By Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-PENTAGON (Washington) _ The civilian at the top of the
U.S. military, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, rarely speaks
directly to Gen. Wesley Clark, the commander waging America's
longest war since Vietnam. The soldier at the top, Gen. Henry
Shelton, is the general who is said to be unwilling _ or unable _
to air the Pentagon's misgivings about the war. By Steven Lee Myers
and Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Radiovce, Macedonia) _ The Macedonians and
Albanians living in this village of 1,500 people till their soil
side by side. But they inhabit separate worlds, speaking different
languages, sending their children to different schools and never
intermarrying. NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the arrival of more
than 230,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in Macedonia have widened the
distance between the dual worlds of Radiovce. About 260 refugees
from Kosovo have been taken in by Albanian families here. Not one
has been taken in by Macedonians. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MISSING-MEN (Kukes, Albania) _ What happened to the
thousands of Kosovar Albanian men _ from boys barely of fighting
age to grandfathers _ who were separated from their families in
recent weeks in Kosovo, shoved into trucks and who then
disappeared? A partial answer to one of the scarier questions in
the devastation of Kosovo has been staggering across the border
here. The fear was that the men were killed by Serb militias, and
perhaps some were. But in the last week, about 2,000 men crossed
the border into Albania, most unshaven, some weeping, with no money
or belts around pants. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MICH-WELFARE (Detroit) _ In a controversial and unusual effort
to move more welfare recipients into the work force, Michigan plans
a pilot program that would require thousands of those applying for
aid to take drug tests to qualify for benefits. By Robyn Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   FARM-PSYCHOLOGIST (Harlan, Iowa) _ After hauling oats to his
cattle before sunrise on the Iowa prairie, Michael Rosmann drives
to an office and sits down with farmer after farmer to listen to
their troubles. A fourth-generation farmer as well as a clinical
psychologist, he speaks the language of men and women on the verge
of losing their place on the land. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-BLACK-BOX (Undated) _ A newly developed data box being
installed in hundreds of thousands of GM cars this year records not
only the force of collisions and the air bag's performance, but
also captures five seconds of data before impact. It can determine,
for example, whether the driver applied the brakes in the fifth
second, third second or last second. It also records the last five
seconds of vehicle speed, engine speed, gas pedal position and
whether the driver was wearing a seat belt. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   NY-ANTISMOKING (Albany, N.Y.) _ New York, until recently
considered a leader in combating smoking, is rapidly becoming a
laggard, as other states leapfrog past it in the size and
aggressiveness of their efforts. By Richard Perez-Pena.
</P>
<P>
   BRONX-ZOO-GORILLAS (New York) _ The new Congo Gorilla Forest at
the Bronx Zoo opens June 25, and its gorilla occupants are still
getting used to the lush surroundings and the newfound freedom. By
Douglas Martin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   FORBES-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ Beginning next week, the Forbes
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination is opening an
usually early and heavy multimillion-dollar advertising offensive
nationwide, with an emphasis in primary battleground states, that
is intended to repackage Forbes. The message: Forbes, far from the
monotonous advocate of a flat tax who ran in 1996, has the breadth
and the personality to sit in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-VOUCHERS (Washington) _ Exposing the sharp debate over
school vouchers among black people, two long-time allies from the
civil rights struggle in Florida find themselves on opposite sides
on whether the state should help pay for some children to attend
private schools. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   FLAG-BURNING-AMENDMENT (Washington) _ One of these days _ not on
Flag Day, June 14, and not even by the Fourth of July, but probably
sometime this year _ Republicans in the Senate will bring up a
proposed constitutional amendment that would permit laws banning
flag-burning. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENT-SALARY (Washington) _ Despite repeated requests, fewer
than half the candidates commented last week on a proposal in
Congress to raise the pay of the President to $400,000. The salary
has been $200,000 since Richard M. Nixon took office in 1969. By

 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Second Amendment, the orphan of the Bill of Rights, has been
written off as a legal backwater for decades. Judges and legal
scholars have glossed over its guarantee of the right ``to keep and
bear arms'' as if it were so much propaganda for the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But now, just as gun control is gaining momentum, the provision
one legal scholar calls ``the embarrassing Second Amendment'' is
being taken seriously for the first time in modern memory, with
some scholars and at least one federal judge saying it may
guarantee individual citizens some rights to guns, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Here, for example, is a comment made by one prominent
constitutional expert in an interview last week: ``It becomes
impossible to deny that some right to bear arms is among the rights
of American citizens.'' Charlton Heston? No. It was Laurence Tribe,
the influential liberal constitutional law expert at Harvard Law
School who personally favors gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because there are so many guns already in circulation,
most people, polls show, have always believed the Amendment gives
individuals a right to firearms. But for some 60 years courts have
ruled that the Amendment merely guarantees a collective right to
arms _ by state militias, for example _ and extends no such right
to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Now some mainstream legal scholars, including some liberals, say
a new expansive interpretation has persuaded them that the Second
Amendment may have to be pulled out of the courthouse dustbin. In
something of a nightmare for gun-control advocates, a conservative
federal judge in Lubbock, Texas, tried to do just that last month.
Contrary to all modern legal precedents, the judge, Sam R.
Cummings, said the Amendment gives individuals some rights to
weapons. He cited new assertions in recent years that the
Amendment's history shows it was intended to guarantee individuals
such rights.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutional experts say it is too early to tell if the Second
Amendment will gain real force. But if an individual's right were
established under the Second Amendment, courts would have to weigh
any gun-control legislation that limits ownership by individuals to
determine whether it meets some reasonable governmental purpose.
</P>
<P>
   These experts say the Texas case could well go to the Supreme
Court. Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, have
indicated that they are sympathetic to the expanded definition of
the Second Amendment. But it is unclear whether other justices
would agree.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Texas case doesn't get past the federal appeals
court where it is now headed in New Orleans, Cummings' ruling shows
that the new interpretation of the Second Amendment has given gun
advocates rhetorical strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain surface plausibility to interpreting the
Second Amendment as protecting a right to private gun ownership,''
said Michael C. Dorf, a professor of constitutional law at Columbia
Law School who favors gun control. ``When you dig beneath the
surface, you can refute that interpretation but it would be better
if we didn't have to engage in that argument at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said for several years that the reinterpretation of
the Second Amendment is partisan work by scholars supported by the
NRA. In a 1995 article in The New York Review of Books, Garry Wills
attacked the new scholarship as a simple-minded mixture of ``humbug
with history.''
</P>
<P>
   But some constitutional law experts say the recent scholarship
proves that the Second Amendment gives citizens a right to weapons.
``There was never even a suggestion that it would be appropriate
for the national government to deny gun ownership to a private
person,'' said William Van Alstyne, a constitutional law professor
at Duke University and a gun owner who said he has been examining
the Amendment more closely in recent years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new scholarship began in the 1980s, when scholars started to
challenge the prevailing view of the Amendment. They poked through
history and found what they said was clear evidence that the
drafters meant to give individuals the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   One source they cited was the British Bill of Rights of 1689,
which they said was a model for the Second Amendment. The British
Bill said, ``The subjects which are Protestants may have arms for
their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.''
This and other texts, they said, showed that the Second Amendment
was meant to protect private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The new thinking spread beyond the margins of academia. A
respected constitutional expert at the University of Texas, Sanford
Levinson, argued in an influential 1989 Yale Law Journal article,
``The Embarrassing Second Amendment,'' that the liberal legal
establishment had ignored the provision because it could be a
barrier to gun control. Such a cold shoulder would never be
offered, he said, to Bill of Rights provisions that intellectuals
found less embarrassing, like the fashionable First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates have worked hard to undermine the new
analysis. The Amendment deserved to atrophy, they say, because it
is more like the outdated Third Amendment, which prohibits the
quartering of troops in peacetime, than the First Amendment, with
its modern-sounding free-speech guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars supporting gun control have also mined history for
nuggets they say prove the Amendment was limited to collective arms
possession. In a law review article last year, Carl T. Bogus, a law
professor at Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I., argued
that James Madison included the Second Amendment merely to win
support for the Bill of Rights from Southerners who wanted armed
units to control slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these scholars agree that the language of the British
Bill of Rights was reflected in the Second Amendment a century
later. But the British Bill's language permitting gun ownership
``as allowed by law,'' they say, was really a form of gun control
because there had long been curbs on owning weapons. The purpose of
the measure, they say, was to make it clear after the reign of the
Catholic King James II that Parliament, not the monarch, would
decide who would have what weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth is probably just beginning. But it is clear
the argument over the Second Amendment has become much more serious
than it was only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe said he had re-examined the issue because of the recent
burst of scholarship. His study of the Amendment's language and
historical context, he said, caused him to believe that the
provision had been cast aside too easily.
</P>
<P>
   But even if there is some individual right to arms, Tribe said,
he is persuaded that most existing and proposed gun-control
measures would probably be constitutional anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he expects legal experts to be startled when they learn
that a new edition of his influential treatise, ``American
Constitutional Law,'' to be published this summer, will for the
first time include an extensive section suggesting that the
prevailing view of the Second Amendment as guaranteeing only
collective rights to weapons may have been simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who are coming to the conclusion that the
Second Amendment is not just limited to the states are themselves
quite liberal,'' Tribe said. `It's not just the `hired guns for the
NRA.'''

that the new interpretation of the Second Amendment has given gun
advocates rhetorical strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain surface plausibility to interpreting the
Second Amendment as protecting a right to private gun ownership,''
said Michael C. Dorf, a professor of constitutional law at Columbia
Law School who favors gun control. ``When you dig beneath the
surface, you can refute that interpretation but it would be better
if we didn't have to engage in that argument at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said for several years that the reinterpretation of
the Second Amendment is partisan work by scholars supported by the
NRA. In a 1995 article in The New York Review of Books, Garry Wills
attacked the new scholarship as a simple-minded mixture of ``humbug
with history.''
</P>
<P>
   But some constitutional law experts say the recent scholarship
proves that the Second Amendment gives citizens a right to weapons.
``There was never even a suggestion that it would be appropriate
for the national government to deny gun ownership to a private
person,'' said William Van Alstyne, a constitutional law professor
at Duke University and a gun owner who said he has been examining
the Amendment more closely in recent years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new scholarship began in the 1980s, when scholars started to
challenge the prevailing view of the Amendment. They poked through
history and found what they said was clear evidence that the
drafters meant to give individuals the right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   One source they cited was the British Bill of Rights of 1689,
which they said was a model for the Second Amendment. The British
Bill said, ``The subjects which are Protestants may have arms for
their defense suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law.''
This and other texts, they said, showed that the Second Amendment
was meant to protect private citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The new thinking spread beyond the margins of academia. A
respected constitutional expert at the University of Texas, Sanford
Levinson, argued in an influential 1989 Yale Law Journal article,
``The Embarrassing Second Amendment,'' that the liberal legal
establishment had ignored the provision because it could be a
barrier to gun control. Such a cold shoulder would never be
offered, he said, to Bill of Rights provisions that intellectuals
found less embarrassing, like the fashionable First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates have worked hard to undermine the new
analysis. The Amendment deserved to atrophy, they say, because it
is more like the outdated Third Amendment, which prohibits the
quartering of troops in peacetime, than the First Amendment, with
its modern-sounding free-speech guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars supporting gun control have also mined history for
nuggets they say prove the Amendment was limited to collective arms
possession. In a law review article last year, Carl T. Bogus, a law
professor at Roger Williams University in Bristol, R.I., argued
that James Madison included the Second Amendment merely to win
support for the Bill of Rights from Southerners who wanted armed
units to control slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these scholars agree that the language of the British
Bill of Rights was reflected in the Second Amendment a century
later. But the British Bill's language permitting gun ownership
``as allowed by law,'' they say, was really a form of gun control
because there had long been curbs on owning weapons. The purpose of
the measure, they say, was to make it clear after the reign of the
Catholic King James II that Parliament, not the monarch, would
decide who would have what weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth is probably just beginning. But it is clear
the argument over the Second Amendment has become much more serious
than it was only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tribe said he had re-examined the issue because of the recent
burst of scholarship. His study of the Amendment's language and
historical context, he said, caused him to believe that the
provision had been cast aside too easily.
</P>
<P>
   But even if there is some individual right to arms, Tribe said,
he is persuaded that most existing and proposed gun-control
measures would probably be constitutional anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he expects legal experts to be startled when they learn
that a new edition of his influential treatise, ``American
Constitutional Law,'' to be published this summer, will for the
first time include an extensive section suggesting that the
prevailing view of the Second Amendment as guaranteeing only
collective rights to weapons may have been simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people who are coming to the conclusion that the
Second Amendment is not just limited to the states are themselves
quite liberal,'' Tribe said. `It's not just the `hired guns for the
NRA.'''

   WASHINGTON _ It did not happen after the bullets flew and the
bodies fell at a high school in West Paducah, Ky., in December
1997, nor did it happen on the heels of the gunfire and bloodshed
at schools in Jonesboro, Ark., or Springfield, Ore., last year.
</P>
<P>
   But after Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., became a
deadly shooting gallery on April 20, the earth finally moved, at
least politically speaking, in subtle but undeniable ways.
</P>
<P>
   States dusted off languishing gun-control laws. The Senate
approved its own measures, incremental but significant. And last
week Republican leaders in the House, where gun control has
traditionally been a harder sell than in the Senate, signaled that
they would probably follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to chalk up this change to the statistical fact
that the body count at Columbine, where 15 people died, was triple
the toll at any of the other schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the legislative action was the result of a confluence of
factors, from the enormously high stakes of next year's
presidential and congressional elections to the location of the
violence, and from the vulnerability of the National Rifle
Association to the growing discomfort of some Republicans with the
most conservative faction of their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, undoubtedly, a fortuitous moment for pro-gun control
forces,'' said Robert J. Spitzer, a political science professor at
the State University of New York, who wrote ``The Politics of Gun
Control'' (Chatham House, 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, other political analysts and several politicians
stressed that the gun-control legislation being passed now had been
years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue came to a head after Littleton for a number of
particular, special reasons, politicians and gun-control experts
said. One was the looming elections of 2000, when the White House
will be up for grabs and control of the House of Representatives,
where the Republican majority is slim, could go to either party.
</P>
<P>
   Those stakes have left both Republicans and Democrats nervous
about falling on the wrong side of any volatile issue or conceding
any potentially popular cause to their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who helped plot her
party's gun-control strategy on the Senate floor, said Republicans
in the Senate might have beat back Democrats' efforts and tried to
stifle the whole debate at a less fraught moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they knew the outrage over this would have been
deafening had they not allowed this _ and that there would have
been political consequences,'' Boxer said, referring to the debate
on the Senate floor, where Democrats outmaneuvered Republicans and
lured a number of moderates over to their viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma
who now teaches at Harvard University's Kennedy School of
government, said another political factor came into play as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment drive _ and the failure of it _ somewhat
weakened the really hard-line conservatives in the Republican Party
and strengthened the moderates,'' said Edwards, noting that a fair
number of Republicans broke ranks in the Senate and that House
Speaker Dennis Hastert has called for some gun-control measures.
``The hard-core conservatives overreached one time too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Littleton, more than the locations of other school shootings,
was precisely the kind of archetypal suburban setting that both
parties have cast as pivotal political battlegrounds. So
Republicans and Democrats alike were particularly eager to show
such constituents that they cared.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who heads the
Senate Republican Campaign Committee, noted that the gun-control
measures that passed the Senate benefited from an additional, less
politically loaded factor.
</P>
<P>
   As the aftershocks of Littleton rumbled across America, it just
so happened that there was a Senate bill that addressed the
prevention and punishment of juvenile crime. It had been
percolating in a committee for years and was overdue in coming to
the floor of the chamber. The bill became an appropriate vehicle
for gun control, so when Senate Democrats pressed for a gun-control
debate, it was hard for Republicans to resist them.
</P>
<P>
   There was, of course, yet another player in these events: the
National Rifle Association. Although it had been a potent foe of
new restrictions on firearms, the call for such regulations after
Littleton hit the group at a moment of relative frailty. Membership
was down from the early 1990s; ties between the rifle association
and the militia movement had battered its image.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA was also wounded by an astonishing quirk of scheduling.
As Osha Gray Davidson, author of ``Under Fire: the NRA and the
Battle for Gun Control'' (Henry Holt, 1993), said, ``The fact that
the NRA's annual meeting was planned for the week after the
shooting in virtually the same place guaranteed that they would get
extra media scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the final ingredient in the recipe for legislative
action was the banality of the motives of the teen-age boys who
opened fire in Littleton, at least as those reasons were initially
reported in the news media. These children were outsiders hurt by
their exclusion from cliques, and guns gave them their revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When students who come from what appear to be affluent, normal
families suddenly go berserk,'' said Bob Walker, president of the
advocacy group Handgun Control Inc., ``people begin to recognize
that it could happen anywhere.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A good trial lawyer spins a story from threads of
fact and possibility, and Marvyn Kornberg made his best effort. In
defense of the police officer charged with brutalizing the Haitian
immigrant Abner Louima, Kornberg promised the jury evidence that
the injuries to Louima's rectum and bladder could have happened
during consensual sex.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in his opening statement Kornberg said three experts
would testify that the injuries were not consistent with an
assault. He added that a sample of Louima's feces collected from
the station house ``contains the DNA of another male.''
</P>
<P>
   The finer lines of this story will never be known; last week the
officer, Justin Volpe, aborted his defense, pleaded guilty to
violating Louima's civil rights, and gave his own account of
ramming a stick into Louima's rectum in a fit of rage. After his
opening argument, Kornberg never mentioned the possibility of a
homosexual encounter, even during four hours of cross-examination
of Louima.
</P>
<P>
   After his client pleaded guilty, Kornberg said he owed Louima no
apology, because he had never directly said that Louima was injured
by consensual sex.
</P>
<P>
   But Kornberg's initial strategy kept provoking. The Rev. Al
Sharpton protested that it had amounted to ``a second rape.'' And
plenty of others asked: How can lawyers suggest these things? The
answer, Kornberg said in an interview, is that ``it's an
obligation: The defense counsel must do everything in his power to
defend the client.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers say that obligation includes suggesting almost
any scenario that can sow enough doubt to spring the client, as
long as the lawyer does not produce testimony he knows is false.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short of that, there's a whole lot that can be done to
challenge the prosecution's case, and that often includes
distorting the prosecution's case,'' said Abbe Smith, the associate
director of the criminal justice clinic at the Georgetown Law
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence in support of the theory might be quite scant,''
said Ms. Smith, a former public defender. ``But I would embrace it
and argue it passionately, whether I believed it or not. Would I
feel good about it in the morning? It's not fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy, of course, to know what is false. As to where to
draw the line, ``People in the profession are split on this,'' said
David Rudovsky, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. ``It
crosses the line if you don't have the scientific or medical
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Kornberg did plan to present a forensic pathologist and two
colorectal surgeons as expert witnesses, according to a letter
filed with the court. And legal experts pointed out that his
contention _ that Louima's injuries were, as he said in his
opening, ``not, I repeat, not consistent with a nonconsensual
insertion of an object into his rectum'' _ avoided any direct
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   But Rudovsky said Kornberg raised a damning tactical problem for
himself. ``I think it's a crazy theory anyway,'' he said of
Kornberg's gay-sex scenario. ``It was going to be rejected. But
aside from that, one of the first rules of trial advocacy is,
`Don't promise too much.' What I can't imagine is a lawyer making
that claim and not having some proof, because in the end you get
the most devastating statement from the prosecutor: `Where's this
pathologist?'''
</P>
<P>
   Smearing the victim with sexual innuendo, a favored approach in
rape cases, is always a high-risk tactic. ``This isn't a claim that
the umbrella couldn't have opened a certain way,'' Rudovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a risk taken by Alton Maddox in defending Steven Bowman,
one of the men accused of slashing Marla Hanson, the model, on a
Manhattan street 13 years ago. The lawyer said Ms. Hanson, who did
not know her attackers, had ``racial hangups,'' and he badgered her
on cross-examination with questions and innuendo about her sex
life. ``My job,'' Maddox said later, ``is to walk Bowman out of
this courthouse.'' (In the end, he did not.)
</P>
<P>
   The same outrage was directed at Jack T. Litman, the attorney
for Robert Chambers, who killed 18-year-old Jennifer Levin during a
sexual encounter in Central Park. Pursuing Chambers' claim that he
struck Miss Levin when she hurt him during ``rough sex,'' Litman
sought to introduce the girl's diary, which he called ``a
chronicle'' of her ``kinky and aggressive'' sex life.
</P>
<P>
   If rapists are hard to defend, Ms. Smith said, police officers
can be even harder. ``Defense lawyers are easy targets, and
Kornberg is an especially easy target because folks who consider
themselves civil libertarians are less comfortable when it's a
police officer engaged in the level of horrible conduct,'' she
said. ``These are the cases that cause my parents' friends to ask
how I could defend those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond public outrage, the doubly humiliated victim or witness
has no recourse for statements made in a courtroom. However
fantastic and damaging, they are privileged. But lawyers can be
made to pay for what they say on the courthouse steps.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Pagones, a former prosecutor, sued the advisers of Tawana
Brawley after they accused him of abducting and raping the
teenager. He charged that the advisers _ including Sharpton and
Maddox _ had made repeated and baseless accusations outside court.
Last year, after a trial in state Supreme Court in Poughkeepsie,
they were found liable and ordered to pay Pagones $345,000.

filed with the court. And legal experts pointed out that his
contention _ that Louima's injuries were, as he said in his
opening, ``not, I repeat, not consistent with a nonconsensual
insertion of an object into his rectum'' _ avoided any direct
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   But Rudovsky said Kornberg raised a damning tactical problem for
himself. ``I think it's a crazy theory anyway,'' he said of
Kornberg's gay-sex scenario. ``It was going to be rejected. But
aside from that, one of the first rules of trial advocacy is,
`Don't promise too much.' What I can't imagine is a lawyer making
that claim and not having some proof, because in the end you get
the most devastating statement from the prosecutor: `Where's this
pathologist?'''
</P>
<P>
   Smearing the victim with sexual innuendo, a favored approach in
rape cases, is always a high-risk tactic. ``This isn't a claim that
the umbrella couldn't have opened a certain way,'' Rudovsky said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a risk taken by Alton Maddox in defending Steven Bowman,
one of the men accused of slashing Marla Hanson, the model, on a
Manhattan street 13 years ago. The lawyer said Ms. Hanson, who did
not know her attackers, had ``racial hangups,'' and he badgered her
on cross-examination with questions and innuendo about her sex
life. ``My job,'' Maddox said later, ``is to walk Bowman out of
this courthouse.'' (In the end, he did not.)
</P>
<P>
   The same outrage was directed at Jack T. Litman, the attorney
for Robert Chambers, who killed 18-year-old Jennifer Levin during a
sexual encounter in Central Park. Pursuing Chambers' claim that he
struck Miss Levin when she hurt him during ``rough sex,'' Litman
sought to introduce the girl's diary, which he called ``a
chronicle'' of her ``kinky and aggressive'' sex life.
</P>
<P>
   If rapists are hard to defend, Ms. Smith said, police officers
can be even harder. ``Defense lawyers are easy targets, and
Kornberg is an especially easy target because folks who consider
themselves civil libertarians are less comfortable when it's a
police officer engaged in the level of horrible conduct,'' she
said. ``These are the cases that cause my parents' friends to ask
how I could defend those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond public outrage, the doubly humiliated victim or witness
has no recourse for statements made in a courtroom. However
fantastic and damaging, they are privileged. But lawyers can be
made to pay for what they say on the courthouse steps.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Pagones, a former prosecutor, sued the advisers of Tawana
Brawley after they accused him of abducting and raping the
teenager. He charged that the advisers _ including Sharpton and
Maddox _ had made repeated and baseless accusations outside court.
Last year, after a trial in state Supreme Court in Poughkeepsie,
they were found liable and ordered to pay Pagones $345,000.

<P>
   NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia has exposed more than
policy differences between the European and American alliance
partners. As never before, it has revealed the vast technological
gulf that separates American military capabilities from those of
Britain, France and the others. And that, in turn, shows how much
the Europeans remain militarily dependent on the United States for
their own defense _ dependent, and resentful.
</P>
<P>
   For Europe these days, the word ``defense'' means the ability to
deal with problems like Kosovo on their own continent. But that,
more and more, means the ability to bring technology to bear. And
since the Americans have most of the technology, the Americans call
most of the shots on strategy and tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Take the way the air war has developed.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, all the allies hoped a ground war would be
unnecessary. But nobody except the United States had enough
sophisticated F-14, F-15, F-16 and F-18 fighters and
fighter-bombers to launch the kind of campaign that might avoid a
ground war.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody but the United States had the ``stealth'' F-117
fighters and B-2 bombers whose strange shapes and composite
materials make it hard for Yugoslavia's sophisticated air defenses
to shoot them down.
</P>
<P>
   So the allies agreed on an air war but had to accept American
ideas about how it should be fought.
</P>
<P>
   The primary American concern was to minimize allied losses, and
the allied losses have been negligible. But the bombing campaign
has not prevented continued ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, and now
this is widening fissures that were probably there from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one reason the B-2s fly their missions all the way from
Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri: The United States does not
want even most of its European friends to get a close look at the
planes.
</P>
<P>
   And among all its allies, the United States has judged only
Britain trustworthy enough to acquire any of the satellite-guided
American-developed Tomahawk cruise missiles, which can carry out
precision attacks from ships hundreds of miles away. Even the
British got only 65, while the United States has hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Having to deal with Kosovo the American way, with bombing
instead of ground troops, had advantages for the Europeans, but
also drawbacks. The longer the bombing drags on inconclusively, the
greater the frustration and resentment in both Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as some military thinkers are beginning to say a ground
campaign may become necessary before autumn, all that the allies
have been able to agree on is a plan to put 50,000 troops in Kosovo
as peacekeepers if Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic,
finally backs down and lets international troops escort Kosovo's
refugees back home.
</P>
<P>
   But even that plan, calling for perhaps 7,000 American ground
troops, would not dull the edge that technology gives the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   If tens of thousands of fresh troops must be flown in quickly as
peacekeepers, only the United States has enough giant C-5, C-141
and C-17 air transports to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   And if the allies decide this summer that air power alone is not
enough to make Milosevic back down _ which might or might not be
more likely now that he has been indicted as a war criminal by the
international tribunal in The Hague _ only the United States could
quickly fly in or provide the 100,000 or more troops required to
drive Yugoslav forces out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's ability to move around huge numbers of troops is
``deplorably slow,'' in the words of NATO's recently retired senior
military officer, Gen. Klaus Naumann of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the United States continues to dominate the skies over
Kosovo, with up to 815 aircraft (including Apache anti-tank
helicopters still waiting for combat and KC-135 refueling planes).
All 18 other allies together provide 277, with more than half of
those coming from France (102 Mirage, Jaguar, Super-Etendards and
other planes), and Britain (38 Harrier GR-7 and Tornado GR-1
fighter-bombers and support aircraft).
</P>
<P>
   One result is that Europeans are talking again, as they have
been doing for years, about a need to fix the imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   And as flaws in the American air-war strategy emerge, some
Europeans are blaming its failures on the Clinton administration's
reluctance to expose air crews to danger. Most allied pilots fly
only above 15,000 feet, beyond the reach of conventional Yugoslav
anti-aircraft artillery. But they are far less effective against
Serbian armor than they would be if they flew lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military pilots are paid to risk their lives, and most of ours
feel frustrated a lot of the time,'' a French official said. ``But
the United States has a zero-deaths policy, and the United States
is running the show.''
</P>
<P>
   A reluctance to take casualties is only one factor. The
availability of an alternative is another. As Naumann pointed out,
most European countries lack the Americans' ability to launch
laser- and satellite-guided bombs at a safe distance from ground
fire. ``Most European planes,'' he said, ``have to fly more or less
over the targets, which is the most stupid thing you can do, since
you expose yourself to the enemy air defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France agreed late last year that one lesson of
previous wars in the Balkans was that Europe needed to build up
autonomous defense capabilities within the alliance. The day would
come, the French argued, when the United States might tire of
entanglements and the Europeans would have to act alone.
Paradoxically, it is American involvement in Kosovo, rather than
withdrawal, that has revived the issue now.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to achieve real change, Europeans would have to
spend billions of dollars to catch up with the technological
revolution that the American military achieved in the 1970s and
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Naumann said, spends $36 billion a year on
defense research and development, while all the European allies and
Canada together have been spending only $10 billion. Last year,
according to NATO figures, the United States spent the equivalent
of 3.2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense, 27 percent
of it on equipment and infrastructure; the European allies averaged
2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't want a European military organization that can get
along without the Americans and reduce military budgets,'' a
retired French general, Pierre Gallois, said. And the United States
is increasing military spending, while the Europeans are
continually cutting back.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spending, they vow at NATO summit meetings like the
one in Washington in April to build a stronger European security
and defense identity within the alliance. They will probably make
another one at a summit meeting of the European Union in Cologne at
the end of this week, now that NATO has agreed to let European
countries use NATO facilities for future operations that the United
States doesn't join.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Naumann commented, these arrangements exist only on
paper. ``What we now need to see are deeds, and it is urgent that
something is done,'' he said. Kosovo might finally make the allies
actually do something.  &QL;

   Is Kosovo a liberal cause? A conservative one?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's hard to tell. As the question of sending in
ground troops becomes more and more pressing, many seasoned
anti-war liberal intellectuals like Susan Sontag and Democratic
lawmakers like Sen. Tom Harkin have pushed to send in the soldiers.
And right by their side are conservative stalwarts like William
Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard; Republican Sen. John
McCain, and Jeane Kirkpatrick, the former U.N. delegate during the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other conservatives like Pat Buchanan and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott say the United States should stay
out. ``Give peace a chance,'' said Lott _ sounding remarkably like
former President Jimmy Carter and Tom Hayden, the former leader of
the Students for a Democratic Society who is now a California state
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, of course, has produced more strange bedfellows than
``The Dating Game.'' Yet something else seems to be going on here.
These odd alliances may signal a stumbling, but significant,
intellectual and political shift that could have far-reaching
effects for American foreign policy. The unlikely agreements
between bitter ideological enemies are evidence of how much the
definition of America's role in the world is changing.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, opposing the military was a reflex for leftists.
Whether a skirmish in Grenada or a full-scale war in Vietnam, such
battles only helped to strengthen the military and fuel the nuclear
conflict with the Soviet Union. To them, the idea that the United
States had a special responsibility was simply a euphemism for
American imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, those are precisely the kinds of arguments that liberals
who oppose the war in Kosovo continue to make. ``Bombs couldn't
bring peace in Vietnam,'' Hayden wrote in a letter to President
Clinton last month. Hayden also warned against a ``new
imperialism,'' and getting stuck in a ``quagmire.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in The Nation anguished over the dilemma
faced by the ``principled anti-militarist.'' Still, the editorial
demanded that the administration ``Stop the war now,'' citing
violations of law, the disquieting notion of America as the world's
policeman and the bombing's contribution to the Kosovars'
suffering. Even the human rights president, Carter, opposes using
military force to prevent ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But many liberals reject such arguments. The first cracks in the
antiwar tradition appeared at the end of the Cold War. Suddenly the
definition of the national interest was up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian war in the early 1990s, with its haunting images of
skeletal figures behind barbed wire, forced deportations and mass
killings, helped push more liberals out of the anti-war camp. Never
again, declared a growing number of intellectuals, particularly
Jewish ones.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this period, prominent liberals like David Rieff, Ms.
Sontag's son, published wrenching accounts from Bosnia. Other
liberals, like Leon Wieseltier, who wrote a string of editorials in
The New Republic, urged a reluctant Bush administration, and then
the Clinton administration, to act.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the chilling effect caused by the death of 18 Army
Rangers in Somalia in 1993, humanitarian military missions gained
respect among liberals. By 1995, when the Serbs massacred thousands
of civilians in the Bosnian town of Srebenica while a U.N.
peacekeeping force stood by, many liberal peaceniks had hatched
into hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The automatic `no''' has evaporated, said Todd Gitlin, who led
anti-war sit-ins in the 1960s and now teaches at New York
University. ``I think it is a sea change. Just wars are not only
possible, but legion.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, what enabled some doves to embrace war _ splitting
off narrow national interests from universal principles of human
rights _ is precisely what made it unappealing to many
conservatives. Buchanan has said: ``Americans sense that, despite
our disgust at the latest massacre and Milosevic's thuggery, no
vital U.S. interest exists there. The Serbs do not threaten NATO;
they have not attacked Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those very reasons are the ones approvingly cited by Vaclav
Havel, the former dissident and current president of the Czech
Republic, in a recent speech supporting NATO's involvement in the
``first humanitarian war.''

   If the end of the Cold War freed the left from the automatic no,
it also freed the right from the automatic yes. No longer were
conservatives compelled to see every battle as a test of America's
anti-communist resolve. And while many on the right had previously
invoked human rights to criticize regimes in China and the Soviet
Union, the issue was less powerful when containing Communism was no
longer the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger has argued in Newsweek's international edition that
now that the United States and NATO are in Kosovo, they must win _
even if it means ground troops _ because maintaining credibility
trumps every other consideration. But he noted that in the past he
had ``passionately rejected'' sending soldiers to Kosovo, and added
that it was ``absurd'' to think global equilibrium or prosperity
depends on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   For conservatives who want to send ground troops to Kosovo,
intervening to protect human rights has grown into a legitimate
foreign policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said in an interview that American troops should have
been sent to Rwanda in 1994 to stop the Hutu massacre of an
estimated 500,000 Tutsis in a 100-day period _ even though the
United States had no vital interests there. As for Kosovo, Kristol
sees his support of ground troops as an extension of what he
characterizes as former President Ronald Reagan's vision of
America's unique moral mission in world affairs: The United States
should stand up to Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, just as
it stood up to the ``Evil Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other conservatives as well as liberals, Kristol is joining
human rights and Realpolitik interests in a search for common
ground. In Kosovo, Kristol said, ``the moral and strategic
interests of the United States really coincided.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Hoffmann, a liberal professor of European studies at
Harvard University, made a similar case in a recent issue of The
New York Review of Books. ``To tolerate this ferocious combination
of ethnic cleansing and quasi-genocide'' is to `` invite world
disorder on a grand scale,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   True, skeptics could ask whether establishing order is just an
excuse for waging a humanitarian war or whether the appeal to human
rights is simply a way to sell the abstract goal of stability to a
doubtful public. Yet either way, the Kosovo campaign is sharpening
the debate over when force is justified.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would like to see ``a 21st-century policy interpretation
of the Reagan Doctrine,'' which he calls a ``rogue state
rollback.'' In his view, the military should only be called in when
``our strategic interests and our political values'' are both
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Wieseltier, who also says both strategic interests and moral
imperatives require action in Kosovo, put it a different way: ``If
the United States is unwilling to put any one of its soldiers in
harm's way, then the United States is not a superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously this debate won't be settled soon. Still, Kristol
noted how few could have predicted that ``this obscure little part
of the world turns out to crystallize what America's role in the
world should be.''

   Imagine being Franz Xaver Suessmayr. Your teacher, Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, is dying, just as he's writing one of his greatest
works. On his deathbed he explains how he envisions completing it.
The rest is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Suessmayr. No one can say which parts of the ``Requiem'' he
had to make up, but he never wrote anything particularly good after
that. Others would later clean up his orchestrations and create new
versions based on newly unearthed sketches. Listening to the
``Requiem'' with all this in mind gives a whole new meaning to the
concert series title ``Mostly Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the unfinished artworks of the dead has always been a
tricky business, but it can be a marketable enterprise, as recent
events confirm.
</P>
<P>
   When Ralph Ellison died five years ago, he left no instructions
concerning his 2,000-page draft for a sprawling epic. But it was
trimmed by the scholar John F. Callahan into a 384-page novel,
``Juneteenth,'' and published amid great publicity last week. And
Ernest Hemingway's unfinished ``True at First Light'' was cut from
850 pages to 320 by his son Patrick for publication this July in
time for the writer's 100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Dead artists tend to have more clout than living ones these
days. After all, thanks to the peculiarities of restoration and
rediscovery, the big art premiere last week was for Leonardo da
Vinci (his newly restored ``Last Supper,'' in Milan, Italy), and at
the Tony awards next Sunday, the late Tennessee Williams could win
in the ``Best New Play'' category (for his newly produced ``Not
About Nightingales'').
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? In an age of cultural recycling, the fine art of
finishing could become a cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone shares the same definition of
``finished.'' Whe Stanley Kubrick died in March, having just made
the final cut of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' rumors flew that Warner Bros.
might do a little more editing to ensure the movie an ``R'' rating.
Tom Cruise came forward and vowed to fight any alterations.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what would have happened if Cruise had been friends
with Edith Wharton. Could he have have used his influence to see to
it that her unfinished novel ``The Buccaneers'' would stay
untouched by contemporary completers?
</P>
<P>
   In defense of those who can't leave well enough alone, finishing
a work can bring it to a wider audience. If Marion Mainwaring had
not finished ``The Buccaneers,'' fewer readers would have
encountered this work of Wharton's _ and even fewer would have
tuned in to watch it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   And utterly no one would have seen the unproduced final drama of
Frances Sheridan, an 18th-century novelist, if a contemporary
writer hadn't added an ending 233 years after her death. The
resulting play, ``The Whisperers,'' with three acts by Sheridan and
two more in Restoration language by Elizabeth Kuti, premiered in
Ireland this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with the dead creates special challenges. It means
seeing every note on a napkin as a little ``how-to'' manual,
ignoring unhelpful instructions like, ``Burn this if you find it,''
and wildly guessing what the artist would have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in Barcelona have been guessing since 1926 how to
finish the Sagrada Familia church in the spirit that the architect
Gaudi intended _ though no one can agree whether that spirit means
building it as originally specified, updating it or leaving it
magnificently half-built.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens left a half-written murder mystery without a
killer. In the ingenious musical adaptation of ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood'' in the 1980s, the audience chose the murderer by
voting. Different endings were performed each night.
</P>
<P>
   While Dickens might be as startled to discover the Broadway
version of his detective novel as Victor Hugo would be to see a
touring company of ``Les Miz,'' the show's creators did demonstrate
a certain respect for Dickens by leaving the story unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   And audiences don't mind a little open-endedness. They will
happily vote on an ending. They will turn out to see performances
of Bach's unfinished ``The Art of the Fugue'' that stop where Bach
did. They will read ``The Last Tycoon'' though F. Scott Fitzgerald
didn't finish it.
</P>
<P>
   But in cases where the artist is the art, audiences may need a
little closure. When Jean Harlow died in 1937 during the filming of
``Saratoga,'' her fans wanted the movie released, so her remaining
scenes were shot with Mary Dees, who stood as far from the camera
as possible in a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   When Bela Lugosi died during shooting for the 1959 cult classic
``Plan 9 from Outer Space,'' his dentist filled in for him, cloaked
in a cape. When the actor Brandon Lee died in 1993 during the
filming of ``The Crow,'' the filmmakers digitized his image and
inserted him into new scenes, proving that the latest technology is
just as good as a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   Artists planning to die anytime soon should leave instructions.
They should leave heirs, who can shop around for the right person
to finish the opus. They should focus on one masterwork at a time.
Schubert worked on too many at once, leaving so many fragments that
scholars don't know which piece goes with which.
</P>
<P>
   And they should leave a decent beginning. That way, the
prospective finisher, when in doubt, can always reprise. Franco
Alfano, the poor guy who had to write the end of Puccini's
``Turandot,'' figured he might not be able to think up a better
melody than the one in the aria ``Nessun Dorma,'' so he repeated
the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a beginning can provide inspiration. The act of
finishing another's work may illuminate one's own creative
struggles. Or it may promise, in the grand tradition of the
cathedral and the sitcom, a revival of the artist who selflessly
collaborates with others, throwing in jokes or gargoyles for the
sake of the enduring whole and not for the sole credit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, credit may be taken. After finishing Titian's ``Pieta,''
Palma Giovine painted a Latin inscription that read, ``What Titian
began and left behind, Palma reverently completed and dedicated to
God'' _ thus putting all the creators in their proper places.

</P>
<P>
   Dead artists tend to have more clout than living ones these
days. After all, thanks to the peculiarities of restoration and
rediscovery, the big art premiere last week was for Leonardo da
Vinci (his newly restored ``Last Supper,'' in Milan, Italy), and at
the Tony awards next Sunday, the late Tennessee Williams could win
in the ``Best New Play'' category (for his newly produced ``Not
About Nightingales'').
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? In an age of cultural recycling, the fine art of
finishing could become a cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone shares the same definition of
``finished.'' When Stanley Kubrick died in March, having just made
the final cut of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' rumors flew that Warner Bros.
might do a little more editing to ensure the movie an ``R'' rating.
Tom Cruise came forward and vowed to fight any alterations.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what would have happened if Cruise had been friends
with Edith Wharton. Could he have have used his influence to see to
it that her unfinished novel ``The Buccaneers'' would stay
untouched by contemporary completers?
</P>
<P>
   In defense of those who can't leave well enough alone, finishing
a work can bring it to a wider audience. If Marion Mainwaring had
not finished ``The Buccaneers,'' fewer readers would have
encountered this work of Wharton's _ and even fewer would have
tuned in to watch it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   And utterly no one would have seen the unproduced final drama of
Frances Sheridan, an 18th-century novelist, if a contemporary
writer hadn't added an ending 233 years after her death. The
resulting play, ``The Whisperers,'' with three acts by Sheridan and
two more in Restoration language by Elizabeth Kuti, premiered in
Ireland this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with the dead creates special challenges. It means
seeing every note on a napkin as a little ``how-to'' manual,
ignoring unhelpful instructions like, ``Burn this if you find it,''
and wildly guessing what the artist would have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in Barcelona have been guessing since 1926 how to
finish the Sagrada Familia church in the spirit that the architect
Gaudi intended _ though no one can agree whether that spirit means
building it as originally specified, updating it or leaving it
magnificently half-built.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens left a half-written murder mystery without a
killer. In the ingenious musical adaptation of ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood'' in the 1980s, the audience chose the murderer by
voting. Different endings were performed each night.
</P>
<P>
   While Dickens might be as startled to discover the Broadway
version of his detective novel as Victor Hugo would be to see a
touring company of ``Les Miz,'' the show's creators did demonstrate
a certain respect for Dickens by leaving the story unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   And audiences don't mind a little open-endedness. They will
happily vote on an ending. They will turn out to see performances
of Bach's unfinished ``The Art of the Fugue'' that stop where Bach
did. They will read ``The Last Tycoon'' though F. Scott Fitzgerald
didn't finish it.
</P>
<P>
   But in cases where the artist is the art, audiences may need a
little closure. When Jean Harlow died in 1937 during the filming of
``Saratoga,'' her fans wanted the movie released, so her remaining
scenes were shot with Mary Dees, who stood as far from the camera
as possible in a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   When Bela Lugosi died during shooting for the 1959 cult classic
``Plan 9 from Outer Space,'' his dentist filled in for him, cloaked
in a cape. When the actor Brandon Lee died in 1993 during the
filming of ``The Crow,'' the filmmakers digitized his image and
inserted him into new scenes, proving that the latest technology is
just as good as a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   Artists planning to die anytime soon should leave instructions.
They should leave heirs, who can shop around for the right person
to finish the opus. They should focus on one masterwork at a time.
Schubert worked on too many at once, leaving so many fragments that
scholars don't know which piece goes with which.
</P>
<P>
   And they should leave a decent beginning. That way, the
prospective finisher, when in doubt, can always reprise. Franco
Alfano, the poor guy who had to write the end of Puccini's
``Turandot,'' figured he might not be able to think up a better
melody than the one in the aria ``Nessun Dorma,'' so he repeated
the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a beginning can provide inspiration. The act of
finishing another's work may illuminate one's own creative
struggles. Or it may promise, in the grand tradition of the
cathedral and the sitcom, a revival of the artist who selflessly
collaborates with others, throwing in jokes or gargoyles for the
sake of the enduring whole and not for the sole credit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, credit may be taken. After finishing Titian's ``Pieta,''
Palma Giovine painted a Latin inscription that read, ``What Titian
began and left behind, Palma reverently completed and dedicated to
God'' _ thus putting all the creators in their proper places.

   NEW YORK _ Now that the fanfare around National Poetry Month in
April has died down _ the readings, the slams, the tractor pulls _
there is time for a little serious contemplation about the future
of the form.
</P>
<P>
   Questions abound: Is there a hot genre? What will the new
millennium bring? Are the poetry wars over? Have the Nuyoricans,
those anti-establishment aesthetes , sold out? And, finally, will
it ever be OK to rhyme again?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The answer is
</P>
<P>
   you surely knew
</P>
<P>
   Dependent on
</P>
<P>
   your point of view.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with poets, academics, editors and others
lyrically minded, the only point of agreement seems to be that
poetry is enjoying a remarkable renaissance, from cowboy poetry
festivals in the West to daily bits of verse published on the
Internet. Robert Pinsky, the United States' poet laureate, does
regular poetry readings on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores carry the work of this year's Pulitzer Prize winner,
Mark Strand,
 &UR; I think of the innocent lives
</P>
<P>
   Of people in novels who know they'll die
</P>
<P>
   But not that the novel will end. &LR; alongside the work of the
socialist street poet named Sparrow:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; There is a sickness eating away at the
</P>
<P>
   American people _ an illness, a pox
</P>
<P>
   upon this nation-state. And that illness is...Classic Rock.  &LR;  It
is that abundant variety of contemporary poetry, the professionals
say, that makes it so difficult to predict the direction of poetry
in the coming years. Not that there aren't a few ideas. For Pinsky,
the most important current trend has less to do with a particular
style of poetry than its presentation: oral, not printed.
</P>
<P>
   The poet Dana Gioia, the author of ``Can Poetry Matter?''
(Greywolf Press, 1992), said the hottest thing happening in poetry
is rap music. The idea that rap music is poetry is not new; its
increasing popularity and sophistication has Gioia thinking it is
the style to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rap is spoken poetry,'' Gioia said. ``Rap music is essentially
written in the same base meter as `Beowulf,' the difference being
that rap is rhymed and Beowulf isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say that the resurgence of interest in spoken
poetry means that poetry has come full circle, from its ancient
roots in chants and songs through its emergence as a powerful
written form and, finally, in recent years, back to a more oral
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Between the primitive and the postmodern, of course, were dozens
of styles. In the first 600 years of this millennium, poetry moved
from the epic medieval lyrics and tales of Chaucer to the airy,
metaphysical, lovelorn sonnets (holy and otherwise) of Shakespeare
and Donne. Movements and their adjectives each had their time: the
lush Romantics, like Byron, owned the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; She walks in beauty, like the night
</P>
<P>
   Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
</P>
<P>
   And all that's best of dark and bright
</P>
<P>
   Meet in her aspect and her eyes.  &LR;  More restrained, the
Victorians dominated the late 1800s and the knotty _ and naughty _
Moderns ruled after that. But the Moderns (Stevens, Eliot, Auden)
became the Establishment, and eventually some people (those
rascally Beats) started complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the current writing style, some say it's the classics
that are in vogue. Alice Quinn, the poetry editor of The New
Yorker, said that for years while teaching her graduate course at
Columbia University she spent ample time on 19th- and 20th-century
masters like Robert Frost and Emily Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fame is a bee.  &LR;   &UR; It has a song _
</P>
<P>
   It has a sting _
</P>
<P>
   Ah, too, it has a wing.  &LR;  ``I suddenly realized,'' Ms. Quinn
said, ``that what they really wanted, the people becoming writers,
was a survey class from Chaucer to Yeats.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Quinn believes the real money may lie even farther in
the past. ``What are the books that have done well in recent
years?'' she asked. ``Dante, Ovid, Horace.'' Each of which, Ms.
Quinn noted, have been translated and re-imagined by modern poets.
Recent popular translations include Pinsky's version of Dante,
``Gilgamesh'' by David Ferry and Ovid by the late Ted Hughes.
Coming soon are Ferry's translation on Virgil and Seamus Heaney's
take on Beowulf.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the poetry establishment has had some problems lately. In
March, the Academy of American Poets, the home of poetry's elite,
announced it would make significant changes in the structure of its
board of directors in response to critics who had called it far too
homogeneous. More women and minority members will be invited to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the board, Jonathan Galassi, the editor in
chief at Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux and a poet himself, said the
changes reflected variety of thought in contemporary poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the academy as a bellwether, we expanded the Board
of Chancellors to represent a lot of different parts of the
spectrum,'' Galassi said. ``In a way, I think that's a sign that
there's more stuff out there. That's the picture now.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, most poetry professionals agreed the passions
of the poetry wars of the mid-1990s (roughly the establishment vs.
everybody else) have subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The poet Bob Holman presided over the growth of poetry slams a
decade ago while serving as the ``slam master'' at the Nuyorican
Poets Cafe in the East Village. Loud and declamatory, slams are
competitions where poets shout out their work, often with a
microphone in hand and their bodies in motion. The winners are
chosen by the audience. Alliteration and assonance are key
elements, as in the work of Saul Williams, a Nuyorican alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blowing tunes through lunar wombs
</P>
<P>
   impregnating stars giving birth to suns
</P>
<P>
   that darken the skins that skin our drums.  &LR;  In the mid-1990s a
group of Nuyorican types known as the Unbearables protested outside
The New Yorker, demanding that their work be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Holman, who called himself a ``bemused bystander'' to the
Unbearable events, said each side has since come to see the value
of the other. ``Various traditions now exist side by side,'' he
said, ``and all are finding their audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are finding large audiences. This summer's National Poetry
Slam in Chicago will have a record 48 teams of four poets each.
That comes on the heels of last year's well-received independent
film, ``Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the next generation, there are only hints.
</P>
<P>
   Don Lee, an editor at the literary magazine Ploughshares, said
the Internet is the ideal means of dissemination and
experimentation. ``A short story or a novel is impossible to read
on the screen,'' Lee said. ``Poetry is very easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy, perhaps, but by no means simple _ or harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be people saying what the other side
is doing is stodgy or stupid,'' Lee said. ``That's been going on
since poetry began.''  &QL;

   If you're anything like the pampered, reluctant farmer's wife
played by Eva Gabor in ``Green Acres'' _ ``Dahling, I love you, but
give me Park Avenue'' _ then you definitely want to think twice
about moving to rural Washington state. Officials in Spokane
County, in the eastern part of the state, have had it with
city-bred newcomers complaining about the less amenable aspects of
the boondocks. And so the Spokane County Commission this month
published a pamphlet called the ``Code of the West'' to forewarn
new and prospective residents about the pitfalls of supposedly
idyllic country life.
</P>
<P>
   You might also call it ``How the West Is Not Fun.'' Here are
excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The pamphlet starts with some historical context:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Code of the West was first chronicled by famous western
writer Zane Grey. The men and women who came to this part of the
country during the United States' westward expansion were bound by
an unwritten code of conduct. The values of integrity and
self-reliance guided their decisions, actions and interactions. In
keeping with that same spirit, we offer this information to help
citizens of Spokane County who wish to follow in the footsteps of
those rugged individualists and live outside the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For starters, the pamphlet says, forget about essential public
services on a par with cities and towns. The county can't afford
them:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Emergency response times for sheriff, fire suppression, medical
care, etc., cannot be guaranteed. Under some extreme conditions,
you may find that emergency response is extremely slow and
expensive. ...
</P>
<P>
   _School buses travel only on maintained county roads designated
as school bus routes by the school district. If you live on a
private road, you may need to drive your children to the nearest
county road or bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The county's many private access roads are often in bad shape, the
pamphlet says. And guess what? They're your problem:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Natural disasters, especially floods, can destroy roads. ...
Residents served by private roads and/or bridges have had large
bills for repairs and/or reconstruction after floods.
</P>
<P>
   _Unpaved roads generate dust. Spokane County does not treat
roads to suppress dust. If you reside near an unpaved road, you may
want to have the road treated for dust suppression by one of the
contractors authorized to do road oiling by the County.
</P>
<P>
   _If your road is unpaved, it is highly unlikely that Spokane
County will pave it without financing by the adjoining property
owners through a Road Improvement District.
 &UR; You want reliable, regular contact with the outside world? Dream
on:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Mail delivery may not be available to all areas of the county.
...
</P>
<P>
   _Newspaper delivery is not always available to rural areas. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Standard parcel and overnight package delivery can be a problem
for those who live in the country. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Telephone communications can be a problem, especially in the
mountainous areas of Spokane County. If you have a private line, it
may be difficult to obtain another line for fax or computer modem
uses. Even cellular phones may not work in all areas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Our public utilities are second to some:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _If you do not have access to a supply of treated domestic

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're anything like the pampered, reluctant farmer's wife
played by Eva Gabor in ``Green Acres'' _ ``Dahling, I love you, but
give me Park Avenue'' _ then you definitely want to think twice
about moving to rural Washington state. Officials in Spokane
County, in the eastern part of the state, have had it with
city-bred newcomers complaining about the less amenable aspects of
the boondocks. And so the Spokane County Commission this month
published a pamphlet called the ``Code of the West'' to forewarn
new and prospective residents about the pitfalls of supposedly
idyllic country life.
</P>
<P>
   You might also call it ``How the West Is Not Fun.'' Here are
excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The pamphlet starts with some historical context:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Code of the West was first chronicled by famous western
writer Zane Grey. The men and women who came to this part of the
country during the United States' westward expansion were bound by
an unwritten code of conduct. The values of integrity and
self-reliance guided their decisions, actions and interactions. In
keeping with that same spirit, we offer this information to help
citizens of Spokane County who wish to follow in the footsteps of
those rugged individualists and live outside the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For starters, the pamphlet says, forget about essential public
services on a par with cities and towns. The county can't afford
them:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Emergency response times for sheriff, fire suppression, medical
care, etc., cannot be guaranteed. Under some extreme conditions,
you may find that emergency response is extremely slow and
expensive. ...
</P>
<P>
   _School buses travel only on maintained county roads designated
as school bus routes by the school district. If you live on a
private road, you may need to drive your children to the nearest
county road or bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The county's many private access roads are often in bad shape, the
pamphlet says. And guess what? They're your problem:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Natural disasters, especially floods, can destroy roads. ...
Residents served by private roads and/or bridges have had large
bills for repairs and/or reconstruction after floods.
</P>
<P>
   _Unpaved roads generate dust. Spokane County does not treat
roads to suppress dust. If you reside near an unpaved road, you may
want to have the road treated for dust suppression by one of the
contractors authorized to do road oiling by the County.
</P>
<P>
   _If your road is unpaved, it is highly unlikely that Spokane
County will pave it without financing by the adjoining property
owners through a Road Improvement District.
 &UR; You want reliable, regular contact with the outside world? Dream
on:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Mail delivery may not be available to all areas of the county.
...
</P>
<P>
   _Newspaper delivery is not always available to rural areas. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Standard parcel and overnight package delivery can be a problem
for those who live in the country. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Telephone communications can be a problem, especially in the
mountainous areas of Spokane County. If you have a private line, it
may be difficult to obtain another line for fax or computer modem
uses. Even cellular phones may not work in all areas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Our public utilities are second to some:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _If you do not have access to a supply of treated domestic
water, you will have to locate an alternative supply. ...The cost
for drilling and pumping can be considerable. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Electric service may not be readily available in every area of
Spokane County. It is important to determine the proximity of
electrical power, as it can be very expensive to extend power lines
to remote areas. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Power outages can occur in outlying areas with more frequency
than in more developed areas, particularly if power lines are
difficult to access. A loss of electric power can interrupt your
supply of water from a well. Interruptions in power may cause you
to lose the food in your freezer or refrigerator. ... If you live

longer in severe cold with no utilities.
</P>
<P>
   _Trash removal is available everywhere in Spokane County, but
some removal can be more expensive in rural areas than in
metropolitan areas. In some cases, your trash dumpster may be
several miles from your home. Your only option may be to haul your

   In Clash Over Kashmir, India Sends In Its First Jets
</P>
<P>
   Two Indian jets were lost in airstrikes against a large force of
guerrillas dug into the mountains of Kashmir. It was the first time
New Delhi has used jet fighters and helicopters gunships in its
decade-long dispute with Pakistan, sharply increasing tensions in
the nuclear-armed subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   India's ground troops have so far failed to dislodge 500 to 600
Islamic militants who have seized strategic places in the Himalaya
Mountains. India says the force is operating with Pakistan's
assistance.

   Cloned Sheep's Cells Aging

   The genetic material in Dolly, the sheep that was the first
animal to be successfully cloned from an adult, may be showing a
sign of aging, in effect appearing older than the sheep itself,
said the scientists in Scotland who created the animal. If
confirmed, the finding would be the first sign of possible genetic
abnormalities in cloned animals.
</P>
<P>
   Leading investigators said they were not yet convinced by the
preliminary data, which were published in a letter to the journal

scant amount of data,'' said Dr. Robert Weinberg, a cancer
researcher at the Whitehead Institute of the Massachusetts

   Nearly three years after John Huang emerged as a central figure

re-election, the Justice Department announced that Huang would
plead guilty to a single felony charge of conspiring to make
illegal contributions. Republicans dismissed the plea agreement as
a sweetheart deal: Huang will receive no jail time in exchange for
his continuing cooperation with authorities. Federal prosecutors
will also clear him of charges contained in congressional reports
on the fund-raising issue that he may have had an espionage
relationship with China.

   As the Supreme Court interpreted federal laws over the years to
provide protection against sexual harassment, uncertainty remained
over whether any law even applied to harassment of one student by
another. Now, as a result of a bitterly fought 5-4 ruling, school
districts are on notice that they can be sued for failing to stop
severe and pervasive harassment in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The court's dissenters said the ruling opened the door to
massive federal intrusion. But school board lawyers said that it
was clear the ruling applied only to egregious behavior and that
they could live with it.

   New Hampshire's New Holiday
</P>
<P>
   As one civil rights advocate put it, New Hampshire won the race
to be last. It effectively agreed to become the 50th state to adopt
a holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The state
House of Representatives, which had resisted in the past, voted
solidly to attach King's name to the existing Civil Rights Day, and
no further hindrances remained to the new holiday. Most other
states approved a Martin Luther King Day in the 1980s. So what took
New Hampshire so long? Some holiday advocates said it was not
racism that resisted the change but the tradition-bound,
independent-minded nature of residents.

   Diplomacy and Betrayal
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power between the United States and the United
Nations is always tricky. And now former Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, in his book ``Unvanquished: A U.S.-U.N. Saga,''
writes of his 1996 ouster, blaming it on caving in to Bob Dole's
``claim that American troops served under my `command.''' He feels
especially betrayed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, he
says, accusing her of lecturing instead of doing ``the difficult
diplomatic work of persuading.'' Albright's spokesman, James Rubin,
said Boutros-Ghali had neglected his core duty: ``Smooth
cooperation with the United States.''

   A Respite (Sort of) for Springer
</P>
<P>
   Many fans of ``The Jerry Springer Show'' were angered when the
episodes ``Guess What? I'm Bisexual'' and ``My Daughter Wants to Be
an Adult Film Star'' were yanked, replaced by tamer, 6-year-old
reruns. Some station owners were peeved, too, because the show
mesmerizes viewers at a Nielsen-rating level second only to
``Oprah'' and ``Judge Judy,'' earning scads of money.
</P>
<P>
   But Studios USA, the show's owner, was getting political heat
again about the daily format of sexual confrontations leading to
fights. And a Chicago alderman, Edward M. Burke, wanted to know why
off-duty Chicago policemen working as security guards don't arrest
guests for assault and battery.
</P>
<P>
   So executives at Studios USA got righteous _ again. First, they
announced they would ``control'' the violence (April 1998). Then
they said they'd ``eliminate'' it (June). They were also going to
``edit it responsibly'' (July). But the ratings fell. So breast
baring and hair pulling resumed. Now they say ``violence, physical
confrontation or profanity'' will again be edited out.

   Nikita Khrushchev, his son Sergei said, once told Richard Nixon,
``Your grandsons will live in a communist America.'' To which Nixon
replied, ``No, your grandsons will live in a capitalist Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, long after that quintessential nugget of Cold War
bluster, who has come closest to winning the bet? It would be a
stretch to say capitalism has truly taken root in Russia. America
hasn't gone communist, but it did lure a Khrushchev to its shores _
and in one generation, not two.

<P>
   In 1993, Sergei N. Khrushchev and his wife, Valentina Golenko,
became legal residents of Rhode Island. Khrushchev, unable to
venture abroad for 25 years after his father's ouster in 1964, said
one overriding attraction was the freedom to travel. Khrushchev had
been a member of the Soviet Communist Party, but Nixon, who spent a
good part of his career demonizing communists, supported his
resident-alien status.

   Now Khrushchev, 63, a rocket engineer turned Brown University

   Diplomacy and Betrayal
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power between the United States and the United
Nations is always tricky. And now former Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, in his book ``Unvanquished: A U.S.-U.N. Saga,''
writes of his 1996 ouster, blaming it on caving in to Bob Dole's
``claim that American troops served under my `command.''' He feels
especially betrayed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, he
says, accusing her of lecturing instead of doing ``the difficult
diplomatic work of persuading.'' Albright's spokesman, James Rubin,
said Boutros-Ghali had neglected his core duty: ``Smooth
cooperation with the United States.''

   A Respite (Sort of) for Springer
</P>
<P>
   Many fans of ``The Jerry Springer Show'' were angered when the
episodes ``Guess What? I'm Bisexual'' and ``My Daughter Wants to Be
an Adult Film Star'' were yanked, replaced by tamer, 6-year-old
reruns. Some station owners were peeved, too, because the show
mesmerizes viewers at a Nielsen-rating level second only to
``Oprah'' and ``Judge Judy,'' earning scads of money.
</P>
<P>
   But Studios USA, the show's owner, was getting political heat
again about the daily format of sexual confrontations leading to
fights. And a Chicago alderman, Edward M. Burke, wanted to know why
off-duty Chicago policemen working as security guards don't arrest
guests for assault and battery.
</P>
<P>
   So executives at Studios USA got righteous _ again. First, they
announced they would ``control'' the violence (April 1998). Then
they said they'd ``eliminate'' it (June). They were also going to
``edit it responsibly'' (July). But the ratings fell. So breast
baring and hair pulling resumed. Now they say ``violence, physical
confrontation or profanity'' will again be edited out.

   Nikita Khrushchev, his son Sergei said, once told Richard Nixon,
``Your grandsons will live in a communist America.'' To which Nixon
replied, ``No, your grandsons will live in a capitalist Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, long after that quintessential nugget of Cold War
bluster, who has come closest to winning the bet? It would be a
stretch to say capitalism has truly taken root in Russia. America
hasn't gone communist, but it did lure a Khrushchev to its shores _
and in one generation, not two.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Sergei N. Khrushchev and his wife, Valentina Golenko,
became legal residents of Rhode Island. Khrushchev, unable to
venture abroad for 25 years after his father's ouster in 1964, said
one overriding attraction was the freedom to travel. Khrushchev had
been a member of the Soviet Communist Party, but Nixon, who spent a
good part of his career demonizing communists, supported his
resident-alien status.
</P>
<P>
   Now Khrushchev, 63, a rocket engineer turned Brown University
research scholar, and his wife are applying for American
citizenship.

NIGERIA'S MILITARY TURNS OVER POWER TO CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ In an exuberant ceremony of martial music and
marches, Nigeria's military ruler turned over power to an elected
leader Saturday, opening an era of civilian government in the
nation where one in six Africans live.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after he was handed a copy of Nigeria's 24-day-old
Constitution and 20 years after he stepped down as its military
ruler, Olusegun Obasanjo, a retired general, was sworn in as
president.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, in a symbolic retirement of the military
from politics, the outgoing head of state, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, was escorted in a motorcade by the military's
highest-ranking officers to his hometown of Minna, about 75 miles
west of the capital here.
</P>
<P>
   In the square where the handover of power took place, Obasanjo _
speaking in English, the one common language in a country with as
many as 400 ethnic groups and languages _ declared the day as the
``beginning of a genuine renaissance'' in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are taking a decisive step on the path of
democracy,'' said Obasanjo, 62. ``We will leave no stone unturned
to ensure sustenance of democracy, because it is good for us, it is
good for Africa, and it is good for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar became only the second general to give up power
voluntarily in Nigeria's postcolonial history. Obasanjo was the
first, in 1979, but the civilian rule that followed lasted only
until 1983. The military had ruled since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``This day, May 29, 1999, must rank second only to October 1,
1960,'' Abubakar said, mentioning the day on which Nigeria gained
its independence from Britain, whose colonial officers cobbled
together patches of land in West Africa to create present Nigeria
in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day awaited with excitement as well as anxiety since
last July, when Abubakar announced that the generals who have ruled
Nigeria for all but 10 years since 1960 would finally relinquish
power. And it ushered in a period of cautious optimism that an
elected government would address the myriad political, social and
economic problems that, at several dramatic points in the last
year, pushed this restive nation of 110 million people to the edge
of chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The handover _ long promised, and for a generation, often
postponed _ registered immediately on many levels. It means that
Africa's most populous nation, the nation with the largest black
population in the world, now lives under a government of its
choice. It means that one of Africa's big powers, just one year ago
an international pariah led by the ruthless dictator Gen. Sani
Abacha, is now headed by a man respected and welcomed elsewhere on
this continent and in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The handover also offers a positive counterpoint to the despair
that much of Africa has sunk into in the last year. Since President
Clinton's historic visit to Africa in March 1998, an unprecedented
number of wars has erupted over the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Nations considered allies of Washington _ including Rwanda and
Uganda, countries trumpeted by Clinton as leading the so-called
African Renaissance _ have become embroiled in conflicts with
seemingly no resolution. Ravaged by brutal wars, cut up into
pieces, big countries like the Congo and small ones like Sierra
Leone have essentially ceased to exist as states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigeria is wonderfully endowed by the Almighty with human and
other resources,'' Obasanjo said. ``It does no credit to us or the
entire black race if we fail in managing our resources for quick
improvement in the quality of the lives of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's inauguration was attended by more than a dozen
African heads of state, including President Nelson Mandela of South
Africa, who interrupted his campaigning for his party in next
week's elections. Washington sent a delegation headed by the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, Clinton's special envoy for Africa, and Rodney
Slater, the secretary of transportation. Prince Charles represented
Britain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After an elaborate parade by the armed forces, three Zulu Alpha
jets flew low over the square, releasing two green streaks and one
white one against a sunny sky, the colors of Nigeria's flags. Two
propeller planes followed, with their landing wheels lowered, to
``signify the arrival of civilian rule,'' according to the
announcer.
</P>
<P>
   The cannon boom of a 21-gun salute, followed by a lone bugler,
signaled Abubakar's departure. And after Christian and Muslim
prayers, Obasanjo stepped onto a red carpeted dais and, holding a
Bible, was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ose ose o, ose o ose, baba,'' a group of people in the stands
started singing, a Yoruba victory song thanking God. In a country
ruled by a military dominated by northern Muslims, Obasanjo is the
first Yoruba _ from southern Nigeria _ to lead the country since he
himself was head of state.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar, dressed in full military uniform, then embraced
Obasanjo, wearing a white agbada, a traditional gown. Abubakar
handed over the flags of Nigeria and its military to Obasanjo, as
well as a copy of the new Constitution, which he signed into law on
May 5. Then Abubakar saluted the new president.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday, most of the top-ranking military officers
holding political positions are expected to retire, as a younger
generation of officers assumes control of the military. Political
control of Nigeria will shift to civilians elected in four
elections over the last six months: officials in 774 local
governments; governors representing the 36 states; state lawmakers,
as well as national ones, whose approval Obasanjo will need for
decisions including forming his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The handover was the culmination of a tumultuous year in Nigeria
that began with the unexpected death of Abacha last June. A month
later, the equally sudden death of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the
presumed winner of the 1993 presidential elections annulled by the
military and the country's most popular politician, plunged Nigeria
into a crisis quelled only by the promise of elections.
</P>
<P>
   As the wall of secrecy surrounding Nigeria's military government
was lowered in the last year, the deep-rooted problems facing
Nigeria have become clearer. Years of misrule, corruption and theft
have shattered the country's economy. The new government is faced
with with a restive population lacking basic needs like reliable
electricity and drinking water. In recent months, economic
conditions have worsened as the government engaged in an as yet
unexplained spending spree that is estimated to have reduced
foreign reserves of $7 billion by more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Niger delta, the region in southern Nigeria that produces
almost all the country's oil, has been a focal point of unrest and
violence in recent months. Neglected for decades by the government,
residents of the delta's impoverished villages have been disrupting
oil production, at one point cutting Nigeria's daily oil production
by a third.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Obasanjo fully acknowledged these problems and
the failures of government, as well as the destructive role it has
played in Nigerian society. Pledging to tackle the problems, he
pleaded for patience and sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   For Obasanjo, Saturday was another chapter in a remarkable
political journey. Exactly a year ago, he was in prison serving a
15-year sentence for having allegedly plotted a coup against
Abacha. After Abacha's death and his release from prison, Obasanjo
eventually declared his candidacy for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by retired generals and the country's wealthiest
businessmen, Obasanjo easily won the elections in February despite
suspicions surrounding his military past and a widespread
anti-militarist mood in the nation. The election's results were
contested by Obasanjo's rival, Olu Falae, but the challenge never
gained any support from a population eager to see the military
relinquish power.

COMMENTARY: HERE AT THE ARDSTHORPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
Henry van der Luyden 
President of the Co-op Board 
The Ardsthorpe 
Fifth Avenue 
New York, New York, 10028 
 
Dear Ms. Rodham Clinton Rodham:
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are delighted to be in receipt of your application for
ownership and residency in our distinguished building. As you know,
a personal interview with the members of the Board will be
required. We cannot schedule it, however, without some further
documentation. Here at The Ardsthorpe, we must know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Please understand that we wish to be fair. It is not true that
we are a star chamber whose mission is to keep out people and
shatter their self-esteem. (There are even entertainment lawyers
living in the building.) But your unusual background and
circumstances leave us no choice but to explore some delicate
matters more deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, The Ardsthorpe cannot satisfy itself simply with
the Starr report, which only skimmed the surface. Surely you
appreciate that the sterling reputation of this address is owed to
its success at keeping out the less fetching and the less fortunate
elements _ minorities, show people, journalists, swarthy Arab
royalty, half-dressed songbirds, disgraced presidents, people with
pre-existing medical conditions and political consultants, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, we will need written assurances on the following points.
</P>
<P>
   1. Will your husband be living with you? We understand your
reticence in your public response to questions concerning the state
of your marriage, and we guarantee discretion. But here at The
Ardsthorpe, we will not be spun. We prize our tranquility. We need
to know in advance how many nights a month Clinton will be on the
premises, so that your neighbors will not have to turn a skeptical
eye on every pizza delivery.
</P>
<P>
   2. Can you explain your admiration for the work of one Kaki
Hockersmith, the Little Rock interior decorator who redid your
White House? Here at The Ardsthorpe, a building to which Sotheby's
makes regular deliveries, we would hope to avoid bordello fabrics.
Unlike the White House, The Ardsthorpe is not the People's House.
We have an aesthetic tradition to maintain. It does not include
``unadulterated Victorian.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Although many of our residents are in no position to cast
stones at real estate speculators, we must put to rest our
anxieties about Castle Grande. May we assume the press exaggerated
in calling it ``a trailer park''? We do not mind prosperity. We
mind vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   4. Will you ever have Eleanor Roosevelt or any other channeled
person to dinner? If so, you will have to clear them with the
Board.
</P>
<P>
   5. To what extent will your apartment serve as your professional
headquarters? Will our halcyon corridors be disturbed by the din of
Harold Ickes' loud and profane manner of speech? Will Sidney
Blumenthal lurk conspiratorially around our marble lobby? We assume
you understand that funds are not to be raised or solicited on our
premises. Some of your past political friends, like Johnny Chung,
are NOCD (Not Our Class, Dear). Here at The Ardsthorpe, overnight
guests are not paying guests.
</P>
<P>
   6. Is it your intention to live with non-political animals, such
as Socks or Buddy? We are concerned about the cleanliness of our
premises and about the demands on its mailbox space. Please provide
the Board with a veterinarian's letter attesting to the death of
both your pets, with forensic evidence attached.
</P>
<P>
   7. Can you reassure us as to your competence as a record keeper?
Here at The Ardsthorpe, maintenance must be paid promptly. We will
not abide misplaced or vanished billing records.
</P>
<P>
   8. Please be apprised that no Bloodworth-Thomason will be
allowed to film any campaign propaganda, or any footage at all, in
or near The Ardsthorpe, or any that mentions the name of The
Ardsthorpe or any building whose name sounds like The Ardsthorpe.
Here at The Ardsthorpe, we do not like to see ourselves on
television.
</P>
<P>
   It is not our aim to disconcert you with these inquiries.
Indeed, we would be most pleased to welcome another successful
commodities trader. Here at The Ardsthorpe, however, we must know
everything. Please complete the enclosed disclosure forms and
return them at your convenience. The Board would also be happy to
recommend some suitable addresses in Westchester or, better yet,
the West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Yours discriminatingly, &QR;
</P>
<P>

COMMENTARY: A COP WHO CARED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Detective Investigator Juan Rodriguez, who died a
little over a week ago, was the kind of cop you don't hear much
about. He was 46 years old, skinny, wiry, tough, relentless and
incorruptible. He was soft-spoken and a sucker for kids. He didn't
strut, and he never engaged in macho games. But if you were a
criminal or a corrupt cop and Juan Rodriguez knew about it, you had
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez worked for the Queens district attorney's office. For
a while he was assigned to the Special Victims Bureau, which
handles sex crimes and the physical and sexual abuse of children.
</P>
<P>
   One of his toughest cases involved a woman who was a drug
addict. She was grabbed by a group of guys as she emerged, high,
from her apartment in Queens. She was badly beaten and then dragged
into an abandoned house, where she was held prisoner and gang raped
over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
   When police were finally notified, there was very little in the
way of clues to work with. And, frankly, for a lot of officers, a
woman who is a drug addict is not a particularly sympathetic
victim. But Rodriguez pursued the case as doggedly as if she had
been a society matron.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Karen Migdal recalled the case last
week: ``He worked with her and met with her so many times, trying
to help her remember or figure out what had happened. He was able
to put together a phenomenal case and got almost everybody involved
arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years Rodriguez was a senior investigator in
the district attorney's Integrity Bureau. In 1997, he and his
partner, Detective Sgt. Richard Scantlebury, played key roles in
the arrest of Paul Voss, a police officer who robbed banks,
sometimes while on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was one of the many cops in the district attorney
offices around the city and in the Police Department who do their
jobs quietly and competently, and often bravely, without abusing
people or bringing shame to their badges.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly good with crime victims. He was
compassionate and empathized with their suffering and their fear.
And he had a knack for explaining to them, clearly and
convincingly, why it was so important for them, despite their fear,
to do all they could to nail the criminals who had victimized them.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of screaming headlines and pulse-pounding police
dramas on television and in the movies, it is the very ordinariness
of Rodriguez's life and his death at too early an age that is
striking. He died at home of a heart attack on Saturday morning,
May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ```Flamboyant' was a word that had nothing to do with Juan,''
said Scantlebury. ``He listened to people, and he treated everyone
respectfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's colleagues remembered him as much for his love of
his family as they did for his dedication to his job. Just 8{
months ago his wife, Patty, gave birth to their fourth child,
Nicholas. Normally reserved and always dignified, Rodriguez
couldn't help going about the office flashing pictures, smiling,
and in the words of one assistant district attorney, ``even
giggling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He always wanted to be a police officer, ever since he was a
little kid,'' said Mrs. Rodriguez. ``He would get upset when he
heard stories, you know, about what some of the bad cops would do.
He took the public's trust very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night before he died Rodriguez arrested a lawyer who had
been disbarred in California and was not licensed to practice in
New York. She was emotionally troubled and, in the words of
Scantlebury, ``started acting up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting hot under the collar,'' the sergeant recalled,
``and Juan admonished me a little. He said, `Richie, you've been
doing this a lot of years now. This shouldn't bother you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Queens district attorney, Richard Brown, described
Rodriguez's death as a tremendous loss. ``I was the one who
transferred him to the Integrity Bureau, which covers all
violations of public trust,'' said Brown. ``He had a great
reputation and his colleagues felt he was a very special guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Patty and Nicholas, Rodriguez is survived by a
daughter, Christina, 17, and two sons, Joseph, 15, and John, 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' said Patty Rodriguez. ``I sit back and I still
sort of feel like he's at work and I'm waiting for him to come
home.''

SHUTTLE DOCKS AT SPACE STATION AND CREW PREPARES TO WALK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BETH DICKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Hours after arriving at the international
space station aboard the first craft ever to dock there, the space
shuttle Discovery astronauts prepared Saturday for a spacewalk
outside the orbiting outpost to mount cranes and other tools for
use by future construction crews.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery docked with the space station at 12:24 ET Saturday
morning, concluding a 41-hour chase that began with the shuttle's
launching from Florida on Thursday. The shuttle and the unfinished
station _ consisting of a Russian control module and an
American-made connecting hub _ were flying at 17,500 mph 235 miles
above Russia when they made contact.
</P>
<P>
   Five men and two women from the United States, Canada and Russia
are preparing the station to accommodate its first permanent
occupants, a crew of two Russians and one American who are
scheduled to arrive early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been six months since anyone came to visit. Welcome
aboard,'' an unidentified engineer radioed from Mission Control in
Houston when the seven shuttle astronauts reached the space
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole station looks beautiful and we're happy to be
visiting and give you some work to do again,'' answered Daniel
Barry, one of two astronauts who planned to spend six hours outside
attaching to the station's exterior an American crane and parts of
another one manufactured in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The spacewalk called for Barry to float free and Tamara Jernigan
to attach herself to the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm and maneuver
up the outside of the station, which towers about 70 feet above the
cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the spacewalkers nor their five crew mates have entered
the outpost yet. They opened the entrance briefly to remove some
obstructions Saturday morning. But they planned to wait until
Sunday to start unloading 3,600 pounds of clothing, computers,
tools and housekeeping supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're joined firmly tonight. The crew is working on starting
the ingress steps to the international space station,'' Wayne Hale,
the shuttle flight director, said in a news conference three hours
after Discovery had parked. ``We're preparing to start transferring
logistics in two days.''
</P>
<P>
   The station flight director, Paul Hill, said the six-hour
spacewalk will kick off six hectic days of cargo transfers and
maintenance and repair work on power and communication systems.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts will replace 18 batteries in an electrical system
inside the Russian control module. They will repair or replace a
radio system in the American node, which provides several ports for
space station systems to be added in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   When construction is finished, the $60 billion space station
will include 100 components and cover an area twice the size of a
football field.

   TORREON, Mexico _ The mothers who live in the cinder-block
houses just downwind from a towering lead-smelting plant have begun
describing their children by numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo has 71, his mother said anxiously of the 3-year-old.
Norma Angelica, a 6-year-old who is always battling a fever or
stomach ache, has 42. And Claudia Elena Arellano found out that her
spindly daughter Jazmin, also 6, has the highest numbers of anyone.
The girl's tests came in at 100.4.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are not school grades and a high score is no boon.
They measure the amount of lead in their blood, and Mrs. Arellano's
little girl, with 10 times the level considered safe by
international standards, has a clear case of lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   After living for decades with grit from the great smelter
blackening their walls and crackling under their shoes, the working
class families living near the plant have discovered that their
children are contaminated with dangerous levels of lead.
</P>
<P>
   Recent tests of children from one corner of the neighborhood
were so high that authorities ordered 393 families to be evacuated
and their houses demolished, in what has become one of the most
severe environmental emergencies Mexico has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis around the plant of Met-Mex Penoles SA de CV has
marked a shift in Mexico's response to big industries that impose
hazards on surrounding communities.
</P>
<P>
   Where once environmentalists' warnings were dismissed, the lead
epidemic among children here has moved state and federal health and
environment officials, not to mention the local press and the bar
association, to admit they were complacent. And start demanding
that the company either run ``clean'' in accordance with newly
tightened rules, or close down.
</P>
<P>
   The 98-year-old installation, which now employs as many as 5,000
workers, was always regarded as the central pillar of progress in
this rambling industrial city.
</P>
<P>
   The huge plant of Met-Mex Penoles is the largest producer of
refined silver in the world. Once isolated in the desert, the
smelter expanded while the city encircled it. In the 1970s the
federal government sold parcels of a sandlot it owned on one edge
of the plant, allowing a new community, Colonia Luis Echeverria, to
spring up.
</P>
<P>
   The smelter has long had a program to monitor the health of its
workers. Executives acknowledged, though, that they never paid
attention to the people dwelling just beyond the plant's high
walls. And government regulations never required it.
</P>
<P>
   But last year the contamination was uncovered when a
pediatrician, Manuel Velasco, noticed that many of his young
patients who lived near the plant were anemic and began testing
them for lead. At the same time a local toxicologist, Gonzalo
Garcia Vargas, completed a study that showed that the children had
alarmingly high lead levels.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the smelter's walls, not 100 yards from the kitchens
where mothers fry tacos for family dinner and the dirt patios where
toddlers scuttle, huge mounds of lead-laden dirt wait to be
refined. Swirling winds from the desert skim dust off the piles and
blow it on the houses. Experts concluded that the children have
swallowed lead that settled over the years into the soil, onto the
furniture, even into their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Of 1,518 children from the community tested in recent weeks by
public health officials, 92 percent had lead levels that were
considered unsafe. They included at least 210 children with levels
that call, under internationally accepted codes, for emergency
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   As the results came in, horror seized the community. Little by
little the parents learned that lead could be especially damaging
to their children. Prolonged exposure could have permanently
weakened their muscles and even dimmed their intelligence. But the
families cannot be sure because no tests for long-term effects have
yet been done.
</P>
<P>
   Dalila Zamarron, who is 25, recalled her odyssey from one
specialist to another trying to find an explanation for her
daughter Norma Angelica's chronic ailments. The doctors' diagnoses
ranged from typhoid fever to sinusitis, but their cures never
worked. Now Mrs. Zamarron wonders how much of the problem was lead.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the little girl is repeating kindergarten again
this year, after failing for the second time to pass into first
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's slow,'' Mrs. Zamarron said, her voice hoarse with
sadness. ``She's definitely slow.''
</P>
<P>
   The community is determined to make Met-Mex Penoles pay for the
damage. Aided by local lawyers, about 125 families have joined in
civil suits against the company seeking compensation for any
disabilities the children are found to have.
</P>
<P>
   Met-Mex Penoles has made no attempt to deny its pollution. The
company quickly dispatched street-sweeping trucks to dust the
community's avenues and teams of workers to vacuum contaminated
houses. It paved the yards of several nearby schools, set up a
mobile clinic to deliver medicines and agreed to put $6.6 million
in a trust fund to pay for cleanup and medical costs. The company
is also building a vast roof to cover the mounds of dirt now
believed to have been the prime source of lead dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their attitude has been, `Tell me what to do, and I'll do
it,''' said Antonio Azuela de la Cueva, Mexico's attorney general
for environmental protection. Azuela shut down half of the plant's
production while more rigorous systems for monitoring emissions are
put in place.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits to what the company executives will do. On
one hand, they argue that the contamination came from dust that
fell from the plant decades ago. In a full-page ad it took out in
major national newspapers, the company asserted that modern
machinery installed since 1970 had reduced toxic emissions ``to
levels which represent no risk to the population.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, company physicians maintained that the
children's lead levels present only a short-term crisis and can be
readily fixed with mineral supplements and special diets. ``We know
that the children who grew up there might end up with some kind of
lasting problem,'' Edmundo Mesta, a company physician, said. ``But
right now we are not contemplating that scenario.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Met-Mex Penoles is part of the Mexican conglomerate Grupo Bal SA
de CV, which also includes Palacio de Hierro, a chain of chic
department stores. The group's chairman, Alberto Bailleres, has
remained aloof from the events in Torreon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a speech on May 20 at a top Mexican university, which
gave him an honorary doctorate, Bailleres reminded students that
``showing solidarity and appreciation for our fellow human beings
is an unavoidable moral obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   The government response, though forceful, was slow and confused
in coming, aggravating the community's distrust. On May 5 state
officials ordered the evacuation of part of the neighborhood but
left it to the company to carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   Met-Mex Penoles initiated a program to buy the houses in the
evacuation area. But most of the residents are tenants, not
homeowners. They soon began to receive notices from absentee
landlords demanding that they vacate so the owners could sell. Yet
neither the company nor the state government have offered the
families a new place to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an evacuation, this is an eviction,'' said Maria
Dolores Guillen, a community leader.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the case that has caused most alarm was Mrs. Arellano's.
On March 9, weeks before she learned of Jazmin's lead poisoning,
Mrs. Arellano gave birth to twin girls. One was healthy but the
other, Marlen, was born without eyes and with her tiny head swollen
with liquid, a condition known as hydrocephalus. The baby's lead
levels were low. But her blood tests revealed an even more toxic
poison in her veins: arsenic.
</P>
<P>
   A study published in April by a team of researchers from the
Dartmouth Medical School and the University of Cincinnati found
exceptionally high levels of arsenic dust around the plant.
Experiments on animals have demonstrated that fetuses exposed to
arsenic were sometimes born without eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this episode ends with the company in operation without
hurting the people,'' Azuela said. ``But I haven't made up my mind.
There is no technical certainty that it will work out that way.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Northwest 54th Street in Miami was crowded at 4:30 p.m. on Feb.
7, 1997, and many people saw the three-car collision that killed
Detective Robert Vargas. But none of them could help police
determine why he died.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old detective, responding in his unmarked car to a
robbery call, had what looked to investigators like a relatively
minor collision with a Chevy Blazer entering the intersection from
his right. His year-old Chevy Lumina skidded across the double
yellow line into oncoming traffic and was struck head-on by a
Mercury Marquis.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating the force of the crash from the skid marks and
wreckage, investigators determined that Vargas' air bag could have
saved his life.
</P>
<P>
   Why it did not was explained by a witness who never ``saw'' the
crash, but reported many of its details electronically.
</P>
<P>
   A black box about the size of a videocassette under the Lumina's
front seat recorded that the air bag had, in fact, deployed when
the Blazer struck the first blow more violently than the human
analysts suspected. The bag had deflated before the head-on
collision, leaving Vargas, who was not wearing a seat belt,
unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale recorder _ known as a Sensing and Diagnostic
Module, or SDM _ was one of 6 million quietly put into various
models of General Motors cars since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A newly developed model being installed in hundreds of thousands
of GM cars this year records not only the force of collisions and
the air bag's performance, but also captures five seconds of data
before impact. It can determine, for example, whether the driver
applied the brakes in the fifth second, third second or last
second. It also records the last five seconds of vehicle speed,
engine speed, gas pedal position and whether the driver was wearing
a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has equipped hundreds of thousands of cars with a similar
system, and is developing a device to read the data. An industry
committee is trying to develop standards for the recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in car crashes say the devices could revolutionize
some aspects of accident research.
</P>
<P>
   The devices could also bring important changes in insurance
settlements, crash litigation, automobile design, and even the
medical treatment of crash survivors. At the same time, important
issues are being raised about who should have access to the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data from the SDM, in future crash litigation, can be the
equivalent of DNA in paternity suits and murder cases,'' said
Edward Ricci, a lawyer who is currently suing GM in a case brought
by the family of Jerome Brown, a former professional football
player who was killed in his Corvette in a 1992 accident. Ricci
said the recorder in that car proved that the cause of the crash
was the air bag deploying when the car hit a pothole; GM disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   But few lawyers or other crash specialists know much about the
recorders, whose existence is virtually unknown to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The advanced model, which records the final five seconds of
data, was first installed in 1998 Cadillacs sold to rental car
companies, but it was done so quietly that even executives at Avis,
which buys hundreds of such cars, were unaware of the recorders.
</P>
<P>
   At National Car Rental, a spokeswoman said executives were
broadly aware of the system but had never seen any data from a
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure, potentially, it would be useful,'' said Veronica
Valentino, a spokeswoman at National's headquarters in Minneapolis.
``I would think it's additional evidence, and if it could be
brought into court, would certainly provide an opportunity to look
at more information that previously wasn't available.''
</P>
<P>
   In many states, rental car companies are responsible for damage
done by the cars they own. They have paid millions of dollars in
judgments that might have been avoided if crash box data showed the
accident was not the renter's fault, some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance executives are interested, too. ``They could lead to
better settlements as time goes on,'' said Donald Griffin, an
executive at the National Association of Independent Insurers, a
trade association that represents 620 insurance companies. The data
could quickly clarify who was at fault, he said, though the
industry would have to have more experience with the boxes before
deciding whether to rely on them.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical researchers think the boxes could save lives. If
ambulance crews could read them on the spot, they could determine
whether a crash was severe enough to create a likelihood of head
injuries, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Some head injuries only become evident hours after the accident,
said Dr. Jeffrey Augenstein, a professor of surgery at the
University of Miami who has been working with GM to develop the
recorders. But the recorders could alert doctors to watch for brain
swelling or other symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Augenstein, who also has appeared in court as an expert witness
in crash cases, said the data would give a better picture of what
had happened, but ``it will still require interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't just plug it into a computer and say, `You're at
fault; you pay $10 million,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The automotive black boxes could be almost as useful as those on
airplanes. The National Transportation Safety Board, best known for
its plane crash investigations, recommended last year that they be
used in cars. But compared with flight data recorders on planes,
whose role is defined by federal law, the automotive versions are
hitting the roads in a legal vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an untested area of law,'' said Lawrence Friedman, a
personal injury lawyer in Boca Raton, Fla., and the chairman of the
American Trial Lawyers Association's Motor Vehicle, Highway and
Premises Liability section.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts hopes to establish a pilot program later this year
that would analyze data from the devices in GM cars involved in
fatal crashes and compare the results with conclusions reached by
human analysis, to help confirm the electronic recordings. But the
state trooper planning the program, David Noonan, said that he did
not know if he could ask a judge for a search warrant to obtain the
boxes in a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That has not been Massachusetts' purpose, or GM's in obtaining
or analyzing the data. GM has been circumspect about the boxes
because it does not want them used in litigation; in fact,
executives are concerned that car buyers could shy away from such
cars if they thought the data could be used against them.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been using the information mostly to refine its
on-board safety systems, and wants the information from the newer
boxes to show what a typical driver's behavior is in the seconds
before a crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest is in safety research, and we're not going to
encourage its use'' in other forums, said Robert Lange, engineering
director of auto safety at GM. As for other uses, he said, ``We are
not going to be able to prevent that and control that.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, only GM can download and decode data from its own
boxes, but that will change within the next few months as software
becomes commercially available. GM has an agreement with Vetronix
of Santa Barbara, Calif., to develop software and a cable that will
allow anyone with a laptop to interrogate the box. Vetronix also
hopes to begin selling the software, including a proprietary
circuit board that decodes the information, in August for a few
hundred dollars, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the owners of the vehicles will be the ones who will
be ultimate arbiters as to whether such information is retrieved,
and if retrieved, how it's utilized,'' Lange of GM said. But
lawyers and others said this was an open question.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, GM has already found that if it does not
let others, like the police, retrieve the data, it may not get much
of the data. Once a car is sold, there is no way for GM to know
whether that car becomes involved in a serious crash, so no way to
know when to try and retrieve the box.
</P>
<P>
   Some engineers wince at the coming legal battles. ``Everyone
probably is hesitant to open this Pandora's box,'' said Adrian
Lund, a crash expert at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
</P>
<P>
   For the handful of researchers now using them in collaboration
with GM, the data boxes promise a gold mine of information never
before obtainable. Highway safety experts say the information
retrieved could change the way air bags and other safety systems
are designed. Air bags are currently made to meet the government's
30-mph frontal-crash test standard, but data from real accidents
could show that the accidents causing the most injuries are at a
higher speed or a lower one, or are not head-on collisions. That
might lead to new passenger protections.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder is ``an invaluable tool,'' said James Stratton, a
senior crash investigator at the William Lehman Injury Research
Center at the University of Miami School of Medicine, who helped
reconstruct the crash that killed Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder is an almost accidental outgrowth of the
computerization of cars. Air bags already come with computers that
measure the ``crash pulse,'' or change in velocity, and calculate
whether and when to deploy the bag. Many cars also have computers
that keep track of engine speed, car speed and the like. GM's
innovation involved adding an inexpensive system that records all
this data on a microchip if the car is bumped hard enough, or
almost hard enough, to deploy the air bag.
</P>
<P>
   The enhanced recorders are installed on all 1999 Buick Century
Park Avenue and Regal models; the Cadillac Eldorado, DeVille and
Seville models; the Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette, and the Pontiac
Firebird. The company plans to have them on all its vehicles in the
2004 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Noonan, of the Massachusetts State Police, said, ``This has
great implications for public safety and public health.'' Sometime
soon, said Noonan, in one of the 400 or so fatal crashes that occur
in his state each year, two new cars will collide and researchers
will have data from both of them, which could show tailgating,
speeding or other signs of bad driving.
</P>
<P>
   Private use is more problematic. A driver charged with speeding
or some other violation after a crash might seek to bring his own
data to court, to exonerate himself, but Noonan said it has not
been determined if such evidence would be admissible.

<P>
   HARLAN, Iowa _ After hauling oats to his cattle before sunrise
on the Iowa prairie, Michael Rosmann drives to an office and sits
down with farmer after farmer to listen to their troubles. A
fourth-generation farmer as well as a clinical psychologist, he
speaks the language of men and women on the verge of losing their
place on the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good people who feel like terrible failures,'' said
Rosmann, who knows what it is to endure sleepless nights spent
worrying about crop prices and peril to family tradition.
``Somebody needs to tell them it's not their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosmann, a big man in a leather vest and cowboy boots who lost
part of a foot in a farm accident, sees most of his patients at his
office, off the town square in this small western Iowa town. But he
will counsel wherever the need takes him, practicing psychotherapy
while standing in a cornfield or leaning against a tractor tire and
talking to a farmer in bib overalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week I took a guy fishing,'' Rosmann said. ``He's so down
he had stopped talking. So we sat. And we fished.''
</P>
<P>
   A quiet desperation shrouds the countryside in places like
Harlan, where plunging corn, bean and livestock prices are bringing
ruin to farms nurtured by families for generations. But if troubles
are in plentiful supply in much of rural America, psychological
help like Rosmann's most often is not.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the farm economy lurching toward the dreadful
conditions of the early 1980s, when suicidal gunshots rang out from
red barns, rural social and church groups are trying to extend
solace to men and women on the verge of breakdown, both financial
and emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Rosmann himself recently helped organize the Sharing Help
Awareness United Network, or SHAUN, named for Shaun Petersen, a
13-year-old Iowa boy killed in a farm accident in 1989. The
nonprofit group promises to find counseling for farm families that
need it, regardless of their ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Adair County, east of here, a group of scholars, social
workers and clerics gathered the other day for an Ecumenical
Retreat on Family Farm Stress, where they mapped mental health
strategies to help people faced with financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska, a series of workshops called Working With
Distressed Farm and Ranch Families, for clerics, families and
social workers, is set for July 6-9 in Lincoln, Kearney, Omaha and
South Sioux City.
</P>
<P>
   And in the rural communities of eastern Washington, social
workers have been counseling farmers' children and checking for
signs of strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a farmer, your work is your home, and there is no
escape from the suffering,'' said Fred Moskol, a researcher in
rural mental health at the University of Wisconsin Medical School.
``And the poor kids, they're watching it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The root of the suffering is a market that has sent the prices
of crops like corn and soybeans to 12-year lows. Livestock, too,
has been hit hard. At the end of last year, hogs were selling for
as little as $9 per hundredweight, barely a fourth of what a pork
farmer with little debt would need to break even; hog prices have
since rebounded to $35 or $40 per hundredweight, but that is only
half their mid-1990s highs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
reports that average farm income dropped 33 percent from 1996 to
1998 and that an additional dip of 10 percent is expected for this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Without psychological help, says Larry Barber, a rawboned
57-year-old patient of Rosmann who recently lost a farm that had
been in the family for more than a century, he would have lost his
mind as well. For patients who can afford it, Rosmann charges $100
an hour. But he has charged some distressed farmers as little as
$20 for a two-hour session. And others he has not sent a bill at
all.
</P>
<P>
   A week before Barber was forced to sell his cattle, he sat and
cried, tears streaming down his face, making no sound, his body
shuddering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost all desire to do anything,'' Barber said, tears now
again in his eyes as he drew hard on a cigarette. ``This is like a
death, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding the agricultural economy's roller coaster, farmers like
Barber saw record prices for their crops just three years ago,
before the Asian economic crisis stifled demand for American
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Drabenstott, a vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Kansas City, said: ``It's a classic tale of supply and demand.
When prices hit records in 1996, farmers responded by bringing more
product to market. Just then their best customer, Asia, starts
going into terrible financial problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Drabenstott said that while the American farm economy was now
``clearly in the throes of a serious downturn,'' the severity was
not yet that of the 1980s, when interest rates, always a crucial
index to a way of life that runs on borrowed money, soared to
nearly 20 percent and land prices plunged, leaving many farmers
without sufficient collateral to back their loans. The value of
farm acreage has lately been holding steady, Drabenstott said, and
interest rates have been relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   A steep drop in income has nonetheless meant disaster to farmers
already working on slim margins.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the low commodities prices, Drabenstott said, American
agriculture is seeing ``substantial structural change,'' with more
farmers working under contract with big processing companies,
especially in the hog business. Since the processors find it most
efficient to deal with large farms, the smaller, family farms,
particularly those with big debt loads, have been the ones most
often squeezed out.
</P>
<P>
   While farmers like Barber and his wife, Linda, may understand
that it is forces beyond their control that are driving them out of
business, that knowledge does little to relieve a certain guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me, `It's not your fault,''' Barber said, ``but it
is a little like driving a car, then skidding on a bad patch of ice
and hitting a child. It wouldn't be your fault, but you'd live
every day with the doubts and thoughts of how could I have avoided
this terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Farmers tend to be an independent breed, of course, and many are
reluctant to ask for psychological help.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a small town,'' said Moskol, the University of Wisconsin
researcher, ``you walk into the mental health center and everybody
sees you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the most part, Rosmann said, farmers understand the
benefits of psychotherapy and drugs in treating depression and
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are smart people,'' he said. ``They're stubborn, but
they're also innovative. They've got to be. A good manager will try
anything that helps the operation. If that means going to a
psychologist, then fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The big problem, he said, is making the time out of a busy
schedule, especially if you are forced to drive 50 miles or more to
find a counselor.
</P>
<P>
   His caseload growing with the worsening of the farm economy,
Rosmann rented out his corn and bean acreage this year so that he
could devote more time to his patients. He says farmers appreciate
that he can talk about the ins and outs of agricultural work as
well as the emotional pressures. Other psychologists, he notes with
a smile, might be at a loss should the discussion turn to crop
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Rosmann, a native of Harlan who taught psychology at the
University of Virginia before returning here to farm, says the
suicide to which financial pressures sometimes drive farmers tends
to differ from suicide among city dwellers, or even among rural
people in other occupations.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, farmers who try suicide are far more
likely to achieve it. While suicide attempts among nonfarmers often
occur after a Friday or Saturday night drinking bout, farmers are
more likely to be sober and deliberative, taking their lives on a
Sunday morning when their wives are away at church.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we have a lot of `accidents' on the farm,'' Rosmann
said, referring to those cases that could be suicide and presumably
are. ``They want to make sure the insurance will be paid to their
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber, who is now on antidepressants, said he would never have
taken his own life. But his wife believes he would have been driven
to the grave by stroke or heart attack had it not been for Rosmann.
</P>
<P>
   Barber still struggles terribly with the changes in his life,
swallowing hard when he is asked about his new job in a lumberyard.
His wife was once active in volunteer work, winning awards for her
efforts on behalf of shelters for battered women and in helping the
poor with their taxes. Now she is looking for a job, as a
receptionist or a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also go to Rosmann,'' Mrs. Barber said. ``There are a lot of
things I need to work through.''
</P>
<P>
   When they farmed, Mrs. Barber liked to do the disking in the
fields. She would ride her tractor and talk to her husband on a
walkie-talkie as he rode a combine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waving to each other across the field,'' Mrs. Barber said, her
voice breaking, ``I miss that so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The old Barber farm is a pretty place, with bur oaks, ponds and
rolling prairies. The Barbers were able to hold on to their modest
house there, and these days they often sit at the kitchen table,
looking out at the countryside when they are not just staring into
their coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Simply getting from one day to the next has been such a
struggle, they said apologetically on one recent evening, that the
housekeeping has suffered a bit lately. A stack of newspapers,
magazines and files leaned against a computer in the kitchen, and
in the living room stood an artificial Christmas tree, still
wrapped in tinsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Christmas tree in May _ it doesn't belong,'' Barber said.
``That's how I am, I guess. Just out of place.''

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York, until recently considered a leader in
combating smoking, is rapidly becoming a laggard, as other states
leapfrog past it in the size and aggressiveness of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, New York was one of just four states that
financed advertising and education programs aimed at persuading the
public, particularly teen-agers, not to smoke. Now, eight states
have such programs, and 11 others, including New Jersey and
Connecticut, expect to begin theirs within the next year. With one
possible exception, all those states anticipate spending far more
than New York on the programs, when adjusted for the states'
populations.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, a Republican whose party has reaped major
campaign contributions from the tobacco industry, has proposed
spending $8.4 million on New York's anti-tobacco program over the
next year, up from $8.2 million in the last year. California, in
contrast, is spending $120.1 million in the current fiscal year,
Florida, $70.4 million, and Massachusetts, $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of other existing state programs ranges from Oregon,
which spends $2.59 per person in its current budget, to
Mississippi, which spends $11.26 per person. New York spends 45
cents per capita.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about like throwing a mosquito at an elephant,'' said
Michael Moore, Mississippi's attorney general, who led the
multistate six-year legal fight against tobacco companies. ``It has
no effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, Pataki's press secretary, defended New York's
program. ``We could probably spend a zillion dollars, and there's
always going to be advocates who say we could do more,'' he said.
``But we think we have a good plan and a good program, and we're
always open to new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Pataki, New York began anti-tobacco advertising on radio
and television three years ago. Those ads have been dismissed by
anti-smoking groups as all but useless, mostly because they do not
appeal to young people, and they are broadcast so infrequently that
many people have never seen or heard them.
</P>
<P>
   One shown last year featured then-Attorney General Dennis Vacco
speaking earnestly of the dangers of smoking. The most prominent
part of New York's current campaign is billboards with a collage of
celebrity faces and the line, ``We choose not to smoke,''
reminiscent of the ``Just Say No'' anti-drug campaign of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ads in other states often have a slap-in-the-face
tone, aiming to be shocking or darkly funny. One television ad
shown in Florida depicts a ceremony held in Hades, with Adolf
Hitler in the audience, to award tobacco the prize for most deaths
caused, ranking ahead of other contenders like murder and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   John Signor, a spokesman for the New York state Health
Department, which administers the anti-smoking program, noted that
some of the advertisements used by New York were produced by other
states or by the federal government. ``We have a very comprehensive
plan of advertising, education and enforcement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Timothy Nichols, director of governmental affairs for the
American Lung Association, said: ``New York pales in comparison to
these other states. What they call an anti-tobacco program, they
might as well not even spend the money.''
</P>
<P>
   While anti-smoking groups in New York direct most of their
criticism at the governor, the leaders of the Legislature, in both
parties, have put little pressure on him to strengthen New York's
program.
</P>
<P>
   The rush by states to start anti-tobacco programs has been
propelled in part by research showing that aggressive advertising
can be highly effective in reducing smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies have reported that in the 1990s, smoking has
declined more than twice as fast in California, which has the
oldest such program, as nationwide. A report this year showed that
just one year into Florida's effort, middle-school students there
were 19 percent less likely to smoke, and smoking by high school
students had dropped 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called
the results one of the largest documented one-year changes in
smoking rates anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, as in the rest of the country, adult smoking has
declined in the 1990s. A 1996 study found the rate at 23 percent of
adults in New York, while in California it had dropped to 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of having billions of dollars to spend from
settlements with tobacco companies has also motivated states to
embark on new anti-tobacco campaigns, a trend that has taken on
particular intensity this spring, as states draft their budgets for
the next fiscal year. Some states have also been swayed by the
argument that the programs will save money, because the decline in
smoking could cut health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman has proposed $18.6 million
for anti-tobacco advertising, education and law enforcement in the
fiscal year that starts July 1, and legislative leaders have agreed
in principle. In Connecticut, Gov. John Rowland has proposed just
$200,000, which would make it the only state spending less per
capita than New York. But leaders of the Legislature are pressing
in budget talks for a much higher figure.
</P>
<P>
   In creating comprehensive anti-smoking programs, it was the
public that led the way. Voter-approved initiatives in California,
Massachusetts and Arizona created the first three programs, in each
case paid for with higher taxes on tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine states with such an effort, the bulk of the money
goes toward advertising, and to educational programs carried out by
schools or by private organizations that win state grants. Some
states also put some of the money toward better enforcement of laws
prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors.
</P>
<P>
   There have long been anti-smoking public service advertisements,
promoted by private groups and government agencies. Since 1991, the
National Cancer Institute has financed anti-smoking advertising and
education programs in 17 states, though they were small in scope.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale advertising paid for by the states began with
California, in 1990. Those first ads featured striking images, like
a skeleton posing coyly with a cigarette clutched between finger
bones, or a room full of tobacco executives, choking on their own
smoke, scheming how to ensnare young people. Massachusetts followed
in 1993, and Arizona in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   New York's ads, which began in 1996, are far too tame, critics
contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to work,'' Moore, of Mississippi, said of ads
like New York's. ``Kids aren't going to listen to someone like me
talk about smoking. What kids want to see is other kids talking to
them. You have to make it cool. Our ads look like MTV.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry contributed almost $400,000 to state
political races in New York in the 1997-98 election cycle,
three-quarters of it to Republican Party committees and Republican
candidates, according to a report by the New York Public Interest
Group. In that cycle, for the first time, the two most important
Democratic committees, the state Democratic Committee and the
Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee, did not accept tobacco
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that the political money of the tobacco
companies has been a major factor in stalling action in New York,''
said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public
Interest Group, which promotes anti-tobacco legislation. ``New
York, once the nation's leader in taking on the tobacco menace, has
done virtually nothing in the past several years.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Pataki has not been pushed by the Legislature to
expand the state's anti-tobacco advertising. This year, the
Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, has said that some of
the tobacco settlement should be used for anti-tobacco programs.
But he has not specified a figure, and it is not an idea he has
actively promoted. A group of Assembly Democrats last month called
for New York to spend more than $80 million, but Silver has not
responded to their plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 1990s, New York took the lead in
regulating tobacco use and sales, measures pushed primarily by
former Gov. Mario Cuomo. The state banned smoking in the workplace,
and then on school grounds and buses.
</P>
<P>
   It instituted civil penalties, including the possible loss of a
liquor license, for any business selling tobacco to someone under
18. It banned cigarette vending machines, a favorite way for minors
to buy cigarettes, except in places like bars and liquor stores,
where minors were not allowed. And it raised the cigarette tax from
39 cents a pack to 56 cents, one of the higher rates in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But no significant anti-tobacco legislation has been enacted
since Pataki became governor in 1995. And since then, many other
states and local governments have caught up to New York's
anti-tobacco laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, to settle a group of lawsuits, the tobacco industry
agreed to pay 46 states, the District of Columbia and U.S.
territories $206 billion over 25 years, to reimburse states'
tobacco-related health-care costs. The other four states _
Mississippi, Florida, Minnesota and Texas _ reached independent
settlements totaling more than $37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the distribution of the $206 billion settlement has been
held up by legal wrangles in California and New York, including the
dispute between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the Pataki
administration over how much of the state's share New York City
should receive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, payments cannot be made to the states
until states accounting for 80 percent of the money have resolved
all their internal legal disputes, or until June 30 of next year,
whichever comes first. California and New York each account for
almost 13 percent of the money, so if they remain tangled in court,
none of the 46 states will be paid for another 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   If either California or New York resolved its disputes, the
money would begin to flow immediately. New Jersey and Missouri also
have pending lawsuits, but they do not account for enough of the
money to affect whether the 80 percent mark is reached.

   TIANANMEN-REMEMBER _ Michael Browning, a staff writer for The
Palm Beach Post, lived in Beijing for nine years as a correspondent
for The Miami Herald and Knight-Ridder Newspapers. He covered all
the events leading up to and coming out of the massacre at
Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Now, at a decade's distance, he
says he has trouble believing it ever happened, more trouble making
up his mind about what it actually meant. In his own words: ``I was
there, but today in an era when Chinese students are throwing rocks
and bottles at our embassy in Beijing and Chinese spies are
apparently ferreting out our nuclear secrets, I am not really sure
where there was. Tiananmen seemed mythical, even during the moments
it was unfolding. It was like living inside a movie whose
screenplay was being written off-camera, someplace else. The actual
shooting script came to us minute by minute.'' A first-person
remembrance of the massacre. (Browning, Palm Beach Post). MOVED

southern Mexico, Manuel Gomez proudly shows guests horse manure
spread beneath a tangle of vines on his modest coffee farm. Manure,
ironically, is offering a healthier and more prosperous life to
this Mayan Indian farmer, who uses it to fertilize organic coffee
he grows for consumers tens of thousands of miles from his home. In
Takiukum (pronounced, ``Ta-kee-a-KOOM'') and other isolated hamlets
nestled in the hills of politically-troubled Chiapas state, more
and more subsistence farmers are growing organic coffee for export,
which provides them with about 80 percent of their cash income. The
farmers' organic coffee is ending up as brew or beans found in
American and European cafes, health food stores, grocery chains and
specialty shops from Germany to Atlanta, Ga., from Italy to Austin,
Texas. (Ferris, Cox News Service). 30. MOVED.

 &HT;    Hurricane forecast has true believers on Atlantic, Gulf coasts
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. _ Baker Clark doesn't need any weather expert to
remind him that hurricane season begins Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps a photo album under the reception counter at the Five
Flags Inn filled with scenes of terrible destruction from 1995's
Hurricane Opal, which devastated his 49-room motel and 100 miles of
Panhandle beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has owned this motel since 1965 and we've seen
hurricanes before,'' he said, paging through the photos of
sand-filled rooms and twisted debris. ``But it seems like we've had
more than our share lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts confirm his observation, saying the crowded Atlantic and
Gulf coastlines could be in for a cycle of punishing storm activity
that could last years _ even decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been saying ... we may be heading back to a period
like the '40s and '50s when we really had heavy hurricane seasons
with a lot of major hurricanes,'' says National Hurricane Center
Director Jerry Jarrell. ``I think it's no longer speculation. I
think we are in it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers bear him out: 1995 to 1998 was the most active
four-year stretch on record, spawning 53 named storms in the
Atlantic basin, with 33 hurricanes and 15 of those reaching major
status. Storms are named when winds reach 39 mph, become hurricanes
at 74 mph and are deemed major at 111 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the long-term predictions are based on research by
William Gray, a Colorado State University forecaster who tracks
tropical systems and the forces that create them.
</P>
<P>
   Gray's 1999 forecast, which will be updated this week, calls for
14 named Atlantic storms this year, with 10 reaching hurricane
strength and four growing into major storms.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most worrisome: Because of a complex mix of factors,
Gray thinks the Gulf Coast has a 150 percent greater chance of
being hit by a major storm than in a statistically average year,
while the Atlantic Coast has double the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful storms like Opal and last year's Mitch and Georges have
always done the most damage. But unlike the last period of high
hurricane activity, from roughly 1940 to 1960, the population of
the nation's eastern coastline has swelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a buildup of population and property values along
the Southeastern coast,'' Gray told The Associated Press. ``You're
going to see hurricane damage like you've never previously seen it
because there's just so much more there.''
</P>
<P>
   Panhandle residents know about the damage firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Hit by powerful Hurricane Frederic in 1979, the region escaped
major hurricane damage the next 15 years, which also was a time of
unprecedented growth. High-rise condos, golf resorts, marinas and
new neighborhoods sprouted from Gulf Shores, Ala., to Panama City
Beach, Fla. Even the long-neglected Mississippi coast boomed in the
1990s with the advent of casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane drought ended in 1995, when Erin slashed across
the region, leaving significant damage. Four months later Opal
roared ashore with winds approaching 150 mph, leveling homes,
tearing up docks, snapping power lines and eating away dunes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, first Earl and then Georges came calling, once again
filling streets with sand, blowing out windows and undermining
foundations. Georges also pummeled several Caribbean islands and
the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   The repeated storms scoured away sand dunes along much of the
Gulf Coast, leaving buildings exposed to sea water. Governments
scrambled to rebuild the dunes, pumping sand from offshore, setting
up sand fences and planting sea oats to hold the dunes in place.
</P>
<P>
   But the work can't compare to the slow, natural process of dune
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sand dunes used to be so high you couldn't even see the
water from here,'' Clark said, pointing out his office window to a
pool deck that drops directly to a flat beach. ``They renourished
our beach after Opal, but last year Georges took all that sand
offshore. Now there's nothing out there to protect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray thinks the weather patterns that control hurricanes have
shifted, part of a long-term cycle that sees hurricane activity wax
and wane. As part of his prediction theory, he tracks everything
from ocean temperatures to large-scale current movement and
rainfall in Africa, where many tropical systems are born.
</P>
<P>
   The La Nina weather phenomenon _ a cooling of ocean waters off
South America that began last year _ could also contribute to an
upswing in this season's activity.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, La Nina's ``brother,'' El Nino, may have inhibited
storm formation for a while. But it broke down in the fall, and two
powerful late-season storms, Georges and Mitch, roared ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch did unparalleled damage in Central America, where torrents
of rain triggered massive flooding in the mountains of Honduras and
Nicaragua. At least 10,000 died, 2 million were left homeless, and
much of Honduras' infrastructure was wiped out, along with its
banana crop.
</P>
<P>
   Despite getting hit by four storms in four years and the
disturbing predictions, the explosion of coastal building along the
Gulf Coast continues.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Dagenais, (cq) and her family who moved to Navarre from
Chicago five years ago, is now a hurricane veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Opal sent waves washing over low-lying Navarre Beach, destroying
dozens of homes and leading to a painstaking yearlong cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   But the area has bounced right back, with new high-rise condos
going up with high-priced homes. Gulf-front lot prices have
skyrocketed, with 100-foot parcels fetching $400,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't scared anybody off,'' said Dagenais, who lives on
the mainland but has learned to take evacuation notices seriously.
``People just love the beach.

PERSONALITY AND POLICY IN THE U.S. BALKANS CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Utah, Neb.)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The civilian at the top of the American military,
Secretary of Defense William Cohen, rarely speaks directly to the
commander running the war in the Balkans. Aides to the commander,
Gen. Wesley Clark, derisively call the secretary ``Senator Cohen,''
since he spends more time advising and cajoling his former
colleagues in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier at the top, Gen. Henry Shelton, is the general who
speaks when spoken to. He is said to be unwilling _ or unable _ to
air the Pentagon's misgivings about the war, though during a recent
White House meeting he bluntly ended a discussion about sending
ground troops into a ``semi-permissive'' situation in Kosovo
without a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being a little bit pregnant, sir,'' Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told President Clinton,
according to an official familiar with the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Cohen and Shelton are Clinton's top military advisers
as the Balkans war grows into its third month, but in a sense they
are not its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their predecessors from the Persian Gulf War, Dick Cheney
and Gen. Colin Powell, who drew up war plans and gave Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, the commander in the field, more troops and weapons
than he wanted, they have an entirely different relationship with
their field commander.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton serves as commander in chief, responsible
through Cohen and Shelton for American forces, the war is not being
run from war rooms at the White House or at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clark, an American, is charged with running it from
Belgium. But he must answer not only to his own political leaders
but also to the leaders of an often unwieldy NATO alliance of 18
other nations that demands consensus even if the United States is
its dominant power.
</P>
<P>
   That has turned Cohen and Shelton more into managers than war
strategists or policy-makers, trying to balance the various
domestic and international demands while helping retain support for
the effort. How they have played their parts has shaped some of the
day-to-day conduct of the war. The nature of the campaign has
shaped their roles as well.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, perhaps, tensions have emerged. Clark's aides say
that the Pentagon's penchant for bureaucratic checks and balances
simply clashes with his war-fighter's urgency to press the fight.
But for Cohen and Shelton, the immediate concern is less to wage
war than to maintain the fragile consensus behind it both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen says his role is to rally support not only within NATO but
also within the Pentagon and, he adds, on Capitol Hill, where he
was a Republican lawmaker for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never purport to be a military strategist, where I was
going to start drawing military plans,'' Cohen said in an interview
in his office. ``What I've done, as part of what I see as my job,
is to hold a group of teams together.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the war itself, Cohen and Shelton have
supported some of Clark's requests, aides say, whether for weapons
or for more ambitious tactics. But they have also acted as a brake
on Clark's most aggressive proposals _ from his eagerness to use
Apache helicopters to his desire to base rockets in Croatia to fire
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, they review Clark's bombing targets and, despite the
intensification of the air war, still reject some as too risky.
``You always want to make sure that you have civilian oversight of
an operation like this,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   For Cohen, who has served as secretary since January 1997, and
Shelton, who took over as chairman nine months later, NATO's air
war will be a lasting mark on their terms, which have already seen
the running military confrontations with Iraq, including last
December's four-day miniwar, and the cruise missile strikes against
the Sudan and Afghanistan last August.
</P>
<P>
   How their stewardships are judged, though, will largely depend
on the outcome of a war they have overseen but, by Cohen's own
account, would have fought differently ``if this were simply a U.S.
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been wider and more intense from my
perspective,'' Cohen told a group of reporters on Friday. ``Any
time you're dealing with an alliance you have to take into account
the need to hold that alliance together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the United States acting unilaterally,'' he added,
``this was certainly the best option and the only option.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has always seen himself as a consensus builder _ from his
days as mayor of Bangor, Maine, to his tenure as the only
Republican in Clinton's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, at 58, is erudite, dapper and detached, leading a
department inclined to brawn and backslapping. He did not serve in
the military, in the years leading up to the Vietnam War, because
of student and marriage deferments.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, though, he developed an expertise in military
issues, driven in part by the importance of defense contracts to
Maine's economy, from the B-52s at Loring Air Force Base to the
warships built at Bath Iron Works. He also dabbled with literary
aspirations, publishing several books, including two volumes of
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Baker's Nickel'' (1986, William Morrow &AMP; Co.), Cohen
wrote a poem about flying in the backseat of an F-15.
</P>
<P>
   We were quicksilver
</P>
<P>
   sliding on the blue
</P>
<P>
   water of thought,
</P>
<P>
   unmindful, almost, that
</P>
<P>
   on the gleaming wings
</P>
<P>
   of the death machine
</P>
<P>
   hung the terrible paradox
</P>
<P>
   of peace.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been his long experience in Congress that has helped
the administration immensely in fending off the worst of the
Republican attacks on the war and on other issues, both
administration officials and lawmakers say. Cohen constantly briefs
his former colleagues in the House and Senate on the war's
progress, both in formal committee hearings and in private
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, rose on the Senate
floor and, revealing the deep ambivalence many conservatives feel
toward the war, called for the bombing to stop. The next morning
Cohen invited Bennett and half a dozen other senators to his office
in the Pentagon for breakfast with him and Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Bennett sounded tempered, if not completely won over.
``I was more tempted to believe the optimistic reports'' on the
war's progress ``when it was Cohen and Shelton describing them to
us, with no keepers from the White House to monitor what they were
saying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican senator, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, said Cohen
had been effective at explaining and defending the administration's
policy because ``he knows all the back alleys over here.'' With the
air war now into its third month, however, he said he was far from
convinced that Cohen and Shelton were overseeing a sound strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cohen has bought this president some additional time,
just because of who he is,'' Hagel said, ``but I think that time is
running out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's lobbying in Congress has limits, though, as was clear
when the House, in a split vote last month, refused to support the
administration's war effort. Cohen noted that the House only
narrowly endorsed the Gulf War before it began and claimed that it
was more important that the House has since supported an increase
in military financing intended partly to pay for the Balkan
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Cohen, Shelton appears far less comfortable with
his public role of articulating _ and defending _ the war effort.
As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he serves as the senior
uniformed adviser to the president and secretary of defense. But
compared with his predecessors, Gen. John Shalikashvili and before
that Powell, he has had a profile so low he is almost absent from
the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not uncomfortable being silent,'' one aide said.
</P>
<P>
   He is widely respected as a soldier, a former commando and
paratrooper who led two of the Army's most coveted combat commands:
the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., and the entire 18th
Airborne Corps. In the Persian Gulf War he led a helicopter assault
deep into Iraq. As commander of the 18th, he oversaw the American
intervention in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton declined to be interviewed about his role, but officials
have described him as deeply ambivalent about the use of military
force in the Balkans, reflecting misgivings that many uniformed
officers have about the strategy and what they see as a lack of a
clear exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does not consider it his role to advocate strongly
for one position or another, but rather to provide precise, clear
military advice, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In briefings on Capitol Hill, Shelton sticks to the operational
details, which has led to frustration and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us would like to hear more from Shelton, to have him
step forward more and give the real soldier's view,'' Hagel said.
``A lot of us here would just like to hear him talk for five
minutes about what the concept is.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman, Shelton is the military conduit between Washington
and the commanders fighting the war.
</P>
<P>
   While Clark is the supreme allied commander, he also serves as
commander of American forces in the region, a dual role that often
proves awkward since he must also answer to the NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, as one of the nation's nine commanders in chief,
Clark reports directly to Cohen, but in practice he has dealt day
to day with Shelton, particularly on military matters and
operational updates. Cohen said he prefers it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Shelton meet virtually every morning at 7:30 in the
secretary's office, along with their deputies, John Hamre, the
deputy secretary of defense, and Gen. Joseph Ralston, the vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a week, Cohen receives a briefing from Clark through a
video camera in a highly secured conference room deep inside in the
Pentagon's national military command center. Several weeks into the
campaign, he began inviting the chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force
and Marines, even though they have no direct war-fighting role. It
is another of his efforts to forge consensus, this time within the
Pentagon, where senior officers were becoming increasingly critical
of Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Although both are Army four-stars, Clark and Shelton could
hardly be more different in style and temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 54, is a former Rhodes scholar who, as he rose through
the ranks, became savvy in the bureaucratic battles of Washington.
He served as Richard Holbrooke's top military aide in the 1995
Dayton negotiations over Bosnia, and as an officer on the Joint
Staff he developed a close relationship with Sandy Berger, then the
president's deputy national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides say that Clark and Berger, now the senior
adviser, talk regularly, but that this is not a back channel, as
some at the Pentagon suspect. When Clinton met with his senior
advisers at the White House last week on the same day Clark was in
town for consultations, Clark did not attend, but Shelton did,
honoring Cohen's insistence on communicating through the chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions that have emerged between the Pentagon and Clark's
staff often reflect institutional differences over approach and
strategy, but they also involve the personalities and egos of the
men involved.
</P>
<P>
   On matters of strategy, Clark feels the Pentagon has not been as
responsive as it could be, second-guessing and nitpicking his
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Top aides to Shelton say that NATO's planning staff in Mons,
Belgium, is inexperienced in the art of war-planning, and should
appreciate Pentagon aid. ``The SACEUR's staff is not a war-fighting
staff,'' a Shelton aide said, using the military acronym for the
staff of the supreme allied commander in Europe. ``It's never
fought or planned a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton must also balance Clark's requests for forces with the
demands from other American field commanders around the world.
``We're stretched,'' Hamre said. ``We can't have any marginal
requests for forces.''
</P>
<P>
   In other respects, though, Cohen has strongly supported Clark,
cajoling his counterparts in the NATO allies to approve more
bombing targets and resisting calls for pauses in the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   For Cohen, this is a turnaround. As a senator, he opposed
sending American troops to Bosnia, but as secretary of defense he
was ``an early and strong advocate'' for bombing Yugoslavia,
according to Berger. Cohen said his view changed last fall when he
saw that the Yugoslav campaign was forcing hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanian rebels to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the air war drags on, Cohen said that it was essential
to preserve unity _ both in NATO and among American commanders _
even if that sometimes required strategic compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more important,'' he said, ``to have a consensus to take
some action than to have a disagreement and take no action.''

FITTING FORBES FOR OVAL OFFICE FALLS TO ADMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)  (See also FORBES-AD) 
(lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ William Eisner, who heads an advertising agency in
Milwaukee, is best known for his commercials about Mrs. Paul's fish
sticks, including one that features a sloppy little boy lassoing
his head with spaghetti. ``Not impressed with pasta anymore?'' the
announcer asks. ``Break the monotony with fish sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Eisner is turning his handiwork to another product that he
says needs sprucing up: Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Forbes campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination is opening an unusually early and heavy
multimillion-dollar advertising offensive nationwide, with an
emphasis in primary battleground states, that is intended to
repackage Forbes just as Eisner repackaged fish sticks. The
message: Forbes, far from the monotonous advocate of a flat tax who
ran in 1996, has the breadth and the personality to sit in the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to resuscitate brands all the time that lost
their luster with consumers,'' said Eisner, who is known for his
quirky, offbeat work. ``We're doing the same with Steve.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the campaign, Eisner said, is a drive to
overcome voters' twin misgivings about Forbes, a wealthy publisher:
They cannot imagine him as president, because he has never been
elected to anything, and they think he is a rich man running on a
lark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first, most important, fact is having people see Steve in
the position of president, which they have trouble seeing right
now,'' Eisner said. ``A lot of people who don't understand Steve
would probably say, `He's got money so he can afford to do this to
satisfy his ego.' So it's something we have to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, some commercials were shot in black and white and
with Forbes against backdrops that resemble the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a study of presidential archival photography,'' Eisner
said. ``The way people are used to seeing a president is in that
context _ black and white. We also put him in environments that
look presidential, offices that resemble the Oval Office. The
gathered drapes and plastered ceilings, all the architecture is
very similar to the presidential office so they could envision him
in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaign, which includes 30- and 60-second
commercials on matters from Social Security to taxes to values,
underscores why no one should underestimate Forbes' quest for the
White House. By dipping into his vast fortune, Forbes can guarantee
that he will be a potent force in the Republican campaign until the
very end.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to forgo federal subsidies so he can disregard the
spending limit of $33.5 million in the primaries may be driving
what appears to be an increasingly likely decision by the early
favorite for the Republican nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, to also forgo the limits.
</P>
<P>
   If other Republican candidates deplete their resources, it is
not unthinkable that the race could end up as a competition between
Forbes and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' advisers said they were primed to spend up to $50
million in the primaries. Once the advertising begins on Wednesday,
the advisers said, assorted commercials will run almost
continuously until voting in the primaries and caucuses begins
early next year. They said the campaign could put $10 million into
commercials this summer.
</P>
<P>
   William Dal Col, Forbes' campaign manager, would not confirm
those figures but said, ``Whatever resources Bush has for the
campaign, I can assure you we will be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Forbes' aggressive, early efforts to stake out
stands, there is one overriding reason he is a player in the
presidential race: money, buckets of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be one of the last guys at the table, because he can
always write a check,'' said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media
consultant here, ``even if the American people are never going to
accept him as a serious candidate for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Jacobson, a political science professor at the University
of California at San Diego, was blunter: ``He has no political
base. He has no claim to any kind of political experience. If he
didn't have any money, he'd be considered a crackpot.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week at his headquarters across the Potomac
River in Virginia, Forbes, 51, scoffed at such comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could ask that about anyone in terms of circumstances of
birth, circumstances of life,'' he said. ``You don't often control
those things. But the key is, what foundations are you willing to
build on? What are you trying to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Saying his message would overcome concerns that he was not
presidential, Forbes added, ``Ronald Reagan, one of my heroes, he
didn't seem the stuff of a formidable, forceful president before he
got elected governor of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Practically an overnight sensation, Forbes surged in the polls
soon after he burst onto the political scene in the 1996 campaign
for the Republican presidential nomination. He lavished more than
$35 million on that race. But his appeal faded as his opponents
depicted him as a Johnny-one-note on the flat tax who was out to
savage other candidates in his commercials.
</P>
<P>
   He scored victories in the Delaware and Arizona contests, but
ranked fourth in the all-important Iowa caucuses and the New
Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   While money did not buy Forbes the nomination then, he insists
that in 2000 his prospects are far brighter because he has devoted
the subsequent years to following a methodical plan to reposition
himself. He has crisscrossed the country building political support
and offering generous fees to attract some of the best political
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who once wrote that Pat Robertson, the founder of the
Christian Coalition, was a ``toothy flake,'' has managed to win
many converts among social conservatives. These days, Forbes says,
prohibiting abortion is more important than overhauling the tax
code.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dwell on the flat tax, Forbes formed an advocacy
organization, Americans for Hope, Growth and Opportunity, which has
spent more than $2 million on advertisements to help him become a
voice on moral issues like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the advertising campaigns his group sponsored on
issues like taxes in Iowa and Virginia, Forbes said, ``Even though
I may not have held a political office, I've had as much or more
impact shaping the political landscape and making real things
happen on the federal level than many of those who hold formal
office.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign, Forbes has set out positions on an assortment
of issues. Recently he announced an ambitious plan for the
privatization of Social Security. Last month, he put forth a
proposal to promote patient choice in health care. With the help of
voice coaches, Forbes has also loosened up a bit on the stump. And
his new close-cropped haircut and wider-framed glasses make him
look less like a stiff club chair and more like a cozy recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Because of all those efforts, Forbes probably made more progress
than any other candidate in 1997 and 1998. Even so, the preparation
has yet to yield perceptible results: He is mired in single digits
in most early popularity polls. And despite his high-profile
courting of religious conservatives, he is losing endorsements to
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes insisted that his early preparation would pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of a campaign based on message, in terms of
principles, we're light-years ahead of the others,'' he said. ``And
the longer they wait, the more the window of opportunity they give
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, other Republicans are eyeing Forbes closely.
Anticipating that Forbes will go negative again in his
advertisements, they are making public calls for clean campaigns.
Even the party's national chairman, Jim Nicholson, who clearly had
Forbes in mind, issued an early plea that candidates not speak ill
of one another.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said they were bracing for Forbes to go after
the governor as he did in 1996 with Bob Dole, who emerged as a
battered nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changed my favorable rating in Iowa from about 80 to 60 in
five weeks,'' Dole said in an interview. ``He'll say it's nothing
personal. But if you're running at what, 6 percent in the polls,
and if you've got somebody at 53 percent, where Bush is, who knows
what will happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Forbes' advertisements in 1996, Bush said: ``I can
only go from what Senator Dole told me: They were really negative
as far as he was concerned. I think it's important to run positive
campaigns.'' Yet in the next breath, he suggested that he would not
sit still if attacked, saying, ``I'm vowing to defend myself.''
</P>
<P>
   While his first round of commercials does not mention other
candidates, Forbes would not say whether he would be more cautious
in the tone of his commercials than in 1996, saying, ``We're going
to have some forceful ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said, ``It is too early to get in a fist fight'' with
Bush. But, he said, in the future there will probably be
commercials that the press would label negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negative ads work,'' he said. ``That's why people do them. You
can spike your numbers pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Forbes, Eisner said, ``Until they learn to like him
and accept him'' as a president, ``it doesn't matter what he says
on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthering the expectation that Forbes will not shy away from
lambasting his rivals, his pollster, John McLaughlin, said he had
recently conducted focus groups of prospective voters and found
that Forbes had no lingering scars on his image from his attacks in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these focus groups, there were no negative perceptions from
the last campaign,'' McLaughlin said. ``There were positive
perceptions about where Steve stood, positive perceptions on the
flat tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Several candidates hope that the Forbes commercials will cripple
Bush and provide them with an opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, a negative barrage of attack ads will only reflect
poorly on the candidate that chooses to issue those attacks,'' said
Howard Opinsky, a spokesman for the campaign of Sen. John McCain of
Arizona. ``But with this many candidates in the race, it is unclear
how it could enhance your chances or diminish someone else's.''

THE AD CAMPAIGN: COUNTING ON `OUTSIDER' APPEAL

<P>
   The Forbes campaign is planning to begin broadcasting a series
of 30- and 60-second commercials nationwide on Wednesday, with the
heaviest barrage in California, Arizona, Iowa and New Hampshire _
all important states in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   This commercial, titled ``Dream,'' is 60 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: William Eisner
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: Opens on black-and-white film with Steve Forbes
talking directly to the camera. He is in a high-ceiling room with
gathered curtains, made to resemble the Oval Office. The frame
freezes and these words flash on the screen: ``Steve Forbes for
America.'' Forbes continues talking until the end, when these words
appear, ``Steve Forbes for President.''
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION SCRIPT: Forbes: ``You know the American people, God
bless them, spend most of their time concerned about their
families, their communities, their work. They don't always pay a
lot of attention to politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at a time like this, America's direction is being decided
each and every day. It's going to take an outsider, who's not part
of the political process, who's not caught up in the day-to-day
give-and-take of compromise with special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take someone with executive experience, who
knows how the world works and doesn't work, who has an appreciation
for the greatness of the American people, but also knows what the
barriers are to people truly moving ahead, truly realizing the
American dream, which, as you know, is allowing each of us and all
of us the chance to discover and develop to the fullest our
God-given talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``And anything that stands in the way of the dream we must
fight. And anything that enhances the dream we must support.''
</P>
<P>
   SCORE CARD: The commercial attempts to make the most of the fact
that Forbes has never held public office by depicting him as a
Washington outsider and playing up his background as a publishing
executive. It also works to appeal to people who are not focused on
politics and seeks to portray Forbes as more thoughtful and warmer
than he was in 1996, when he dwelled on the flat tax. The Oval
Office-like setting is intended to make him appear presidential.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A large gorilla sits on top of a tree, gazing toward
infinity, while two young gorilla twins hug each other, then
scamper playfully up a rock. Others concentrate purposefully on
peeling tasty leaves off branches. A tall female stands as erect as
a human and dances a jig. Youngsters pound their chests like little
King Kongs.
</P>
<P>
   This is the new Congo Gorilla Forest at the Bronx Zoo, which
opens June 25, and its occupants are still getting used to the lush
surroundings and the newfound freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Unseen, but far from forgotten, are three senior apes, including
Dan, the ``silverback,'' as dominant males are called; Pattycake,
who became an instant city celebrity when she was born at the
Central Park Zoo in 1972, and Julia, who has pretty reddish hair
and relishes being the center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   These three have not ventured from the indoor bedroom where they
have lived since early February, even as the seven younger gorillas
now frolic daily outside in romps that exceed an hour.
</P>
<P>
   James Doherty, the zoo's chairman of mammalogy, thinks Dan will
ultimately be seduced by curiosity, a trait he says no gorilla
lacks. Then the females will follow him. Then, again, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan may just decide he doesn't want to go out,'' Doherty said
with the weakest of smiles. ``We're not going to push him.''
</P>
<P>
   These are frantic but heady days at the zoo, celebrating its
centennial with the new exhibit, the most ambitious and costly in
the history of this zoo, and probably, any zoo, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It cost $43 million and, at six and a half acres, is larger than
the entire Central Park Zoo. For the first time, the zoo will
charge extra for an exhibit _ $3 on top of the $7.75 to get into
the zoo _ but all of the $3 will go to African conservation
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be able to view the forest through soaring
windows, intended to give a sense of being within touching distance
of the gorillas. In part of the exhibit, visitors are in a tunnel
and can watch gorillas above them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to set the new standard for exhibits,'' said
Cynthia Vernon, a vice president of Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Congo, as it is nicknamed, includes 300 animals of 75 species,
and all are gradually being introduced to their new digs. The first
okapi, a graceful deerlike creature with horizontally striped legs,
is gobbling up everything vegetative, including the rather
expensive bamboo, which she was not supposed to like.
</P>
<P>
   The red river hogs are using their snouts like rototillers,
obliterating any hope that grass would be part of their landscape.
A female hornbill of stable disposition is being allowed to adapt
to her monkey neighbors, well before her mate, who is considerably
more skittish, is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spending a lot of time staring at the animals to see
what's working and what's not,'' said Rob Halpern, the director of
horticulture who 10 years ago started a nursery to grow 15,000
plants of more than 400 species found in Congo. (The initial
finding: almost all plants are distressingly tasty.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the undisputed stars _ the ones for whom Congo with its
11 waterfalls, 55 artificial rain forest trees, misting machines
and soundtrack of eerie jungle sounds is simply a terrific stage _
are the gorillas.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Africa. Only for eight months or so a year will
gorillas be outside. In winter months, they will be on display in
more traditional circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Dan's group of 10 prowling 22,000 square feet,
there is another group of nine, this one led by Timmy, who moved to
the Bronx from Cleveland. Because work is being completed on
plantings, they have so far been prevented from checking out their
new 28,000-square-foot forest. Three babies born last year are in a
separate bedroom, but will ultimately join one of the two main
groups, probably Tim's.
</P>
<P>
   Easing animals' acclimation to a new environment is common to
all new exhibits, and it can be tougher when the animals are of
different species. In 1990, zoo officials decided to put ibexes, a
kind of mountain goat, and baboons in the same exhibit.
Immediately, the leaders of both groups eyed each other.
</P>
<P>
   The baboon bared his teeth as his hair fluffed up, making him
appear larger and more menacing. The ibex pawed the ground, lowered
his head and charged. The two butted heads _ not exactly
traditional baboon behavior _ looked at each other for a long
moment and wobbled away. Doherty said the two, and others of their
species, then got along fine.
</P>
<P>
   The gorillas are actually making their second move. In February,
they were removed from the old Gorilla House, a throwback to an
earlier zoo era that has already been torn down. It was a place of
bars, cold porcelain tile, little light and less than one-tenth the
space the gorillas will have in their Congo environment.
</P>
<P>
   When Gorilla House opened in the early 1950s, it quickly became
the scene of death: a gorilla drowned in the 6-foot-deep moat. That
was how keepers, who quickly lowered the water level, learned that
members of the species couldn't swim.
</P>
<P>
   Last February's move to the new bedrooms was considerably
smoother. The gorillas immediately took to the rooms, which had
high ceilings, hammocks and plenty of vegetation to build nests, as
all do each night.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Kalko, collection manager for mammals, said young gorillas
immediately began swinging from artificial vines and playing a game
she said looks remarkably like break-dancing. ``It was very
stressful for us, but they didn't seem to exhibit stress at all,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing aiding the first transition was the decision not to
change the groups in any way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last quarter-century, wildlife scientists say, this is
the most important factor helping gorillas to thrive and breed in
zoos. They point out that when William T. Hornaday, the first
director of the Bronx Zoo, said at the turn of the century that
gorillas would never survive in captivity, his only experience was
with gorillas as individuals or couples. But since groups were put
together with a dominant male and his harem, more than 300 gorillas
have been born at North American zoos, including 44 in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy was assigning the same keepers from the old
gorilla exhibit, giving the animals a strong sense of continuity.
They know all their keepers as individuals, Ms. Kalko said. The
courtesy is reciprocated by keepers, who eagerly describe
15-year-old Tunko's sweetness or Pattycake's independent
middle-aged habits or 5-year-old Tuti's devotion to the role of
self-appointed big sister to the other youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   So keepers, curators and William Conway, president of the zoo's
parent, the Wildlife Conservation Society, were on hand when the
metal door of the gorillas' bedroom first slid open at 3 p.m. on
May 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time waiting for this,'' whispered one
keeper, Wendy Camino, smiling like it was Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Then nothing happened. All the gorillas stared at the lush
expanse outside. They made a rumbling sound, and looked at each
other, then back out the door. Suddenly, Holli, a 10-year-old
female who is known for her confidence, leapt out. Tunko, known for
her hesitant, but sweet, demeanor, followed daintily. Soon all but
the three most senior gorillas were out. The 4-year-old twins,
Ngomo and Tambo, emerged and amazed curators by separating to
explore on their own. They are usually inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be human and not be moved by this,'' said Colleen
McCann, associate curator of primates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Conway, who is retiring in September and pushed Congo as the
culmination of his long career at the zoo, seemed to prove her
point. ``Look at that little devil,'' he said as Ngomo scurried up
a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Dan remained unfazed. He came to the door and took a long look.
He took a tentative step outward, as he has several times since.
Then he turned around and went back inside. Though zoo officials
would be thrilled if he wanted some time alone with the two females
closest to his own age, 30, he has shown no interest in their
advances. He remains disturbingly childless.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty does not profess to know why the older gorillas have
stayed inside, though when food begins to be hidden around the
exhibit he thinks interest may heighten. He also suggests that
there might be some evolutionary logic to their decision. On one
hand, he said, younger animals need to practice such gorilla skills
as climbing and foraging. On the other, he said, more mature
animals might be taking extra care because they are more likely to
reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   He added that gorillas, unlike chimpanzees, feel no need to make
people happy. ``Chimps are like dogs and want to please you,'' he
said. ``Gorillas are like cats.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Very warm weather with plentiful sunshine will cover a large
area from the northern Mississippi Valley to the East Coast states
as expansive high pressure remains strong. A few cooling sea
breezes will develop near the Northeast and Middle Atlantic coasts,
otherwise afternoon temperatures will average 6 to 12 degrees above
seasonal values. Humidity will remain comfortable in much of the
Northeast, but sticky air will gradually spread into the Ohio
Valley and Great Lakes states as breezes from the south become
established.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air and a mixture of clouds and sunshine will prevail in
the Gulf of Mexico states. Scattered afternoon thunderstorms will
develop, especially in central and eastern Florida where sea
breezes force the very warm, moist air to rise rapidly. Farther to
the north and west, a weak jet stream disturbance will combine with
humid air to produce a few thunderstorms from eastern Texas and
Oklahoma to the central Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Periods of cool rain will dampen northern parts of the Rockies
and Dakotas in the wake of a slow-moving cold front. South of the
front, some potent thunderstorms will erupt during the midday and
afternoon from western Minnesota to western Nebraska and Wyoming.
Scattered afternoon thunderstorms will form over many peaks in the
central and southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Offshore winds will favor abundant sunshine near the Washington
and Oregon coasts. In California, there will be morning coastal
clouds and a few afternoon thunderstorms over the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: When Summer Begins
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures will gradually rise in much of the East during the
Memorial Day weekend, which is traditionally seen as the start of
the summer season. Nevertheless, for ease of record-keeping,
climatologists consider summer to be the months of June, July and
August. The warmest 90-day period in most of the contiguous United
States begins around June 6th. On the calendar, the season will
begin on June 21st, when the summer solstice occurs. The solstice,
an astronomical event, is when the noontime sun is directly
overhead at the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees of latitude north of
the equator.

   KUKES, Albania _ What happened to the thousands of ethnic
Albanian men _ from boys barely of fighting age to grandfathers _
who were separated from their families in recent weeks in Kosovo
and shoved into trucks, and who then disappeared?
</P>
<P>
   A partial answer to one of the scarier questions in the
devastation of Kosovo has been staggering across the border here.
</P>
<P>
   The fear was that the men had been killed by Serb militias, and
perhaps some were. But in the last week, about 2,300 men crossed
the border into Albania, most unshaven, some weeping, with no money
or belts around pants that have recently grown baggier.
</P>
<P>
   Beslim Selimi, 38, came on Friday with his feet purple from
beatings, a black left eye, marks on his back left by rifle butts
and hands swollen as if he had frostbite.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my neighbors, a Serb, was the one who beat me,'' he
said. ``He wanted to kill me, but the others wouldn't let him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all the accounts of the men who came across the border last
week, Selimi's remarks could not be independently verified. But the
individual accounts, given separately over several days, suggested
that the men were routinely subjected to interrogation and
sometimes to beatings.
</P>
<P>
   Those tactics have been hallmarks of the tough police hand with
which the Serbs have ruled Kosovo since stripping it of broad
autonomy in 1989. According to many Kosovo Albanian men, such
detentions and beatings have increased since the spring of 1998,
when the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Serbian security forces
began heightened battles for control of the province.
</P>
<P>
   The men who arrived in the last week all said they were held
prisoner at a notorious jail in Smrekovnica, north of Kosovo's
capital, Pristina. The men said they were beaten, stripped of their
identification cards and given little to eat. A sign there, painted
recently, reads: ``Welcome to Alcatraz.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most chilling detail is the confession many said they
were forced to sign saying that they were members of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the rebel group fighting Serb forces in Kosovo.
With the stroke of a pen, without having to kill anyone, the Serbs
had a piece of paper giving them an excuse to expel any Kosovar
Albanian with no right ever to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they have all these documents, but we were forced to
sign,'' said Shyqri Qeliku, 35, who said he was held for nearly two
weeks before being released on Friday morning. ``The Serbs can use
these documents to say we were all in the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's accounts suggest that Serb officials, in essence, are
cycling Albanians through that prison _ and at least one other
closer to Macedonia, officials from the U.N. refugee agency say _
as yet another means to purge Kosovo of ethnic Albanians. Refugee
officials agree, adding that stripping them of their identification
cards seemed aimed at making any return to Kosovo harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a huge problem, even if things pan out,''
said an official. ``Down at the micro level, in the villages, they
can say: This guy never lived here.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, according to Rupert Colville of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees here, is that in at least one case, a
Serbian policeman tried to retaliate against the brother of a
prisoner who was interviewed about his experience on Italian
television. The policeman, who sought the brother at the prison,
failed to find him, but in anger beat another prisoner, Colville
said, citing an account from a released prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   According to the accounts of the men who have arrived here, Serb
police officers at the prison also seemed bent on extracting as
much information as possible about the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which Western military analysts say has been on the offensive in
recent days and making some gains on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept asking: `Are you a soldier in the KLA?''' said Ekrem
Halili, 38, from the city of Mitrovica, just north of the prison.
Halili said that as the police beat the men, they asked: ``Do you
know them? Who are the commanders of the KLA?'' Even amid false
confessions, presumably the Serbs have managed to extract some
genuine information about the KLA from the thousands of men who
have been interrogated at the prison since the start of May.
</P>
<P>
   The first prisoners who were released _ gaunt figures who showed
up at the border crossing in Morini in Albania on May 22 _ said
they had been taken to the jail on May 2. A man who would only give
his name as Zena, a 45-year-old engineer, said that on that day
Serb soldiers came to the village of Kqiq i Madh, not far from the
prison, and ordered all ethnic Albanians to form convoys to head
toward Albania.
</P>
<P>
   They did so, and Zena gathered with his three brothers and
family, which totaled 40 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``After half an hour they took all the men out and they took us
to another place and they started to beat us,'' Zena said. ``They
said, `You are all terrorists.' They even said it to 14-year-olds
and 80-year-olds.'' One man in his group was deaf, he said, ``and
they said to him that he was a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   The vast range of ages of those held prisoner was evident in the
stream across the border last week.
</P>
<P>
   He said they were carted into trucks and taken to the prison,
described by others as a chilly old concrete building with several
cell blocks and a short wall surrounding it. Many men said they
were not fed for the first several days, and later were given a
little bread and occasionally an egg or cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Musli Hyseni, 20 years old, said he was herded into a room with
a television along with 600 other people. The prisoners, he said,
were not allowed to use the toilet for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Hyseni, who used to work at a car wash, said nearly everyone in
that room was beaten, he himself on four different days. At one
point, he and 60 other men were separated from the main group and
forced to kneel, with their faces against the concrete floor and
their fingers laced behind their necks. He said they stayed in that
position for four hours, which human rights groups say is an
extremely painful form of torture.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, he said, police officers asked what they knew
about the rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have anything to tell them,'' said Hyseni, who like
most prisoners, denied any connection with the guerrilla force. ``I
knew nothing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several of the men interviewed said that the police officers
also forced prisoners to fight each other, sometimes pitting father
against son or brother against brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just took us out into the hallway and said, `Come on,
beat each other up and just pretend you have a Serb in front of
you,''' said Shevqet Hoxha, a 48-year-old factory worker from
Mitrovica who was forced to fight another prisoner whom he did not
know. ``And when I didn't hit hard enough, the policeman beat me.''
The two men, who left the prison and crossed the border together,
are now friends.
</P>
<P>
   Some men reported that fellow prisoners disappeared, but they
were unable to give further details and the scant accounts
suggested the disappearances did not occur in great numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Only one prisoner interviewed said he saw anyone being killed,
which he said happened during a beating with police batons that he
said he saw from perhaps 100 feet away through the window of his
cell.
</P>
<P>
   The prison reportedly holds about 3,000 people, and each day,
the prisoners said, new groups of men were brought there. Then on
May 22, the police began calling out names and put several hundred
people on buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know where they were going to take us,'' Hyseni
said. ``I didn't think they would free us. I thought they were
going to take us to another prison and kill us.''
</P>
<P>
   But they arrived at the border, and every day since, another
group of men in groups of several hundred at a time have walked
across, several pounds lighter, many stripped of everything they
own, down to watches and rings, shoelaces and belts. Many said they
were astounded the Serbs let them live.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all waiting for death,'' said Zena's brother Bajra.
``To go on, it is like being reborn.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many others, he said he could not feel happy, because
he believed his family was still inside Kosovo. ``I am very, very
bad,'' a 39-year-old man said, hours after he was released on
Thursday. ``I don't know anything about my family.''
</P>
<P>
   As he made his way down the border road to food and a bus ride
to the refugee camps, he insisted he was not a rebel. But 10 days
in prison may have changed things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want three or four days to rest,'' he said. ``Then I'm
going to join the KLA.''

NATIONALIST GROUP FIGHTS FOR IDENTITY IN SOUTH AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The party whose slogan used to be
``one settler, one bullet'' is trying to stay in office by
appealing to the nostalgia vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Africanist Congress now preaches ``non-racialism'' and
says it welcomes anyone who considers himself an African first,
including white Afrikaners.
</P>
<P>
   But it insists it is the true torchbearer of the ideals upon
which the African National Congress was founded in 1912. The ANC,
it argues, went off track in 1959 when it embraced the Communist
Party, Indians and mixed-race voters, thus diluting what was then
supposed to be a black nationalist struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Its leader, the Rev. Stanley Mogoba, reminds voters that, like
President Nelson Mandela, he too was imprisoned on Robben Island.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, the party was a serious challenge to the ANC
for leadership of the struggle. It led the 1960 Sharpeville
demonstration that ended in the massacre of 69 protesters by
police. It, too, had a guerrilla army in exile. It tended to hit
soft targets like bars; in 1993, its partisans stabbed to death Amy
Biehl, a California college student dropping friends off in a black
township.
</P>
<P>
   Having formally abandoned violence, the party still seems
stranded on the banks of the river of history. Pollsters say it
will get only 1 percent of the vote on Wednesday. It got 1.2
percent in 1994. Since then, its five members in the National
Assembly did not really make names for themselves by taking the
government to task as, for example, the seven members from the
Democratic Party did.
</P>
<P>
   Mogoba, a Methodist bishop, did bring the party back into the
headlines recently by publicly musing that murderers and rapists
should have their offending parts amputated. He said the party had
not ``worked out the details,'' such as whether the chopping would
be done in an operating theater or a public square.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't say we'd like to cut people's limbs off,'' he said.
``But rather than allow criminals to cut throats, to rape, we'd
contemplate it.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues that the present government is soft on crime and soft
on corruption, has let moral standards decline so children no
longer defer to their elders, and has developed a ``trickle down''
economic policy while he prefers a focus on the poorest of the
poor. He also favors aggressive redistribution of white-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   He and his secretary-general, Ngila Michael Muendane, reject
their lowly 1 percent poll rating, saying some poll sponsors are
controlled by the ANC. They accuse the national television network
of giving them short shrift on the evening news. ANC members tear
down their posters and even threaten gullible farm workers,
Muendane said, ``by saying they can see their vote, and if they
vote PAC, they'll lose their housing or their pension.''
</P>
<P>
   In its literature, the party assures voters that ``the PAC has a
plan'' for every ill of the country: crime, disastrous public
schools, overwhelmed hospitals, the housing shortage. The plans
apparently involve ``investing massive resources,'' although it is
not clear where the money would come from.
</P>
<P>
   Its literature contains a seven-stanza poem honoring the
struggle of the homeless, the jobless, the worker, the student, the
woman and the aged. One verse:
</P>
<P>
   You can't earn a cent
</P>
<P>
   And all your money's spent
</P>
<P>
   So you think about crime
</P>
<P>
   But why do time?
</P>
<P>
   For you the jobless,
</P>
<P>
   The struggle continues.
</P>
<P>
   There is an odd echo to the party's platform. With its emphasis
on renewing morality and zero tolerance for crime, it sounds like
the other angry opposition parties, including even the National
Party, the latest incarnation of the party that instituted
apartheid but which now also proclaims itself multiracial, and
would probably back all the PAC goals except farmland
redistribution and aggressive affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition is fragmented and the ANC is expected to sweep
more than 60 percent of the vote.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE MONUMENT WHERE JOE LOUIS TRAINED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMPTON LAKES, N.J. _ When Joe Louis was the heavyweight
champion, he put this leafy little town on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the Pacific during the war,'' Russ Pagana, a
retired contractor, was saying, ``guys would ask me where I was
from. When I'd say, Pompton Lakes, N.J., they'd say, `Yeah, that's
where Joe Louis trains.'''
</P>
<P>
   And now the town has put Joe Louis on a monument.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Anthony Sgobba in glossy Italian black granite, Joe
Louis' life-size likeness is on a monument dedicated here yesterday
in what is now Joe Louis Memorial Park next to the Elks Lodge No.
1895, a left jab away from what was Doc Bier's training camp, where
Louis prepared to knock out Max Schmeling and Billy Conn (twice).
</P>
<P>
   ``As kids, we'd watch Joe train on Sunday,'' Pagana recalled,
``then we'd go to the movies at the Colonial theater on Saturday
and watch the Movietone news of what we had watched.''
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, Louis would go to the movies, too. If a few kids
were standing around outside, he'd tell the ticket-taker, ``Let `em
in. I'll take care of it.'' If the kids were standing around
outside the ice-cream parlor, he bought cones. And the Pompton
Lakes kids never had to pay to watch him train.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he did his roadwork,'' said Howard Ball, a former editor
of the local Suburban Trend newspaper, ``he'd stop to talk to my
grandmother in her rocking chair on our porch. I'd peek through the
window to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   After a local resident died in 1935 and before an ambulance
arrived from a nearby town, Louis boxed an exhibition that raised
$2,600 to buy Pompton Lakes its own white Packard ambulance. He
raised $2,000 to help build a police communications tower.
</P>
<P>
   And every so often, Lou Duva, then a teen-ager in nearby
Paterson, hitch-hiked here to watch the champion train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody trained like Joe Louis,'' recalled Duva, the
77-year-old Hall of Fame trainer. ``He always wore white knit
trunks with a white tank top, black boxing shoes and white socks.
He was all business. On the weekends, there'd be as many as 5,000
people around the outdoor ring under the trees next to the big
house where he and his sparring partners lived.''
</P>
<P>
   For a big fight now, boxers don't train like that. They stay in
casino-hotels now. They spar in glitzy ballrooms with chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now they all have their entourages,'' Duva said with a
smirk. ``Every lawyer, every accountant, every hustler is hanging
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Duva and Pompton Lakes Police Chief Al Ekkers were the
fund-raising co-chairmen for the Joe Louis Memorial Park and
monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing will probably cost $80,000 before we're
through,'' Duva said. ``We've raised a lot already, but I'll put up
whatever we need to finish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up here to see Joe Louis train is where I learned to
watch trainers train fighters,'' he said. ``I never learned
anything from fighters. I learned it all from the trainers.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1923, boxers began coming to the barracks-like house
next to the home of Dr. Joseph Bier, an eye-ear-nose-and-throat
specialist who operated what he called a Health Farm on the shore
of Pompton Lake in this tiny town of 3,000 in the woods and lakes
of northern Passaic County. The population is now 11,500.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best boxing names of that era trained here _ Benny
Leonard, Harry Greb, Pancho Villa, Ace Hudkins, Tony Canzoneri,
Jimmy McLarnin, Jackie (Kid) Berg, Lou Brouillard, and Primo
Carnera.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1935, when Louis was about to come here to train for his
first fight in New York, against Primo Carnera, at least one
resident objected to the presence of a black fighter along with
John Roxborough, a black manager, and Jack Blackburn, a black
trainer. Doc Bier never blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've rented the place,'' Doc said, ``and they'll be here.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of Louis' fights in New York, they returned here. He
considered Pompton Lakes his ``lucky camp,'' especially after he
trained at Lakewood, N.J., before being knocked out by Max
Schmeling in the 12th round at Yankee Stadium in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Before his 1938 title defense against Schmeling at Yankee
Stadium, Louis trained here, then knocked out Schmeling in 2
minutes, 4 seconds of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great place this would be for a training camp,'' Lou
Duva was saying now. ``That house over there, that's where Doc Bier
lived. I'd like to buy that house and use it as a training camp for
some of my young fighters. Put up an outdoor ring like they had
when Joe Louis was here.''
</P>
<P>
   And it would be only a left jab away from the Joe Louis
monument.

GOING OVER THE EDGE, AND APPLAUDING IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Owen Hart, a 33-year-old professional wrestler known as the
Blue Blazer, plunged more than 50 feet from the rafters of a Kansas
City arena to his death in the ring last week, fans thought it was
part of the show, the kind of grand entrance they had come to
expect. They cheered as his body was carried off. After all, the
World Wrestling Federation had billed the nationally televised
pay-for-view event as ``Over the Edge.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy enough to dismiss this tragedy as a circus accident
without much resonance in ``real'' sports. State athletic
commissions conveniently delineate between an exhibition such as
pro wrestling and a so-called true competition such as boxing (in
which the occasional ``accidental death'' is actually caused by the
purpose of the sport, not by a faulty harness hookup). Exhibitions
don't carry the same legal and moral weight as real sports, so we
think we don't have to care if the bouts are scripted or if the
obviously scripted racism, sexism and violence should be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should think again. This popular entertainment may be
a glimpse of a future toward which most of sports is inexorably
slouching. It is getting harder to figure out where ``over the
edge'' begins, and how soon that dangerous territory on the other
side will become our home field. One season's coach-choker becomes
another season's sentimental star. I, too, want to know why Latrell
Sprewell has not been starting for the Knicks. But then I'm filled
with strange new questions. Why doesn't my heart jump anymore when
a hockey goon slams an opponent's face into the Plexiglas? Do I
need teeth spilling out like Chiclets? When the racing car spins
into the crowd, will they show replays? Am I ghoulish or just
jaded? How soon will Mike Tyson be ready to bite someone's head
off?
</P>
<P>
   Are we already beyond Rollerball? Is it time to start getting in
line for Christians and Lions in their Garden update?
</P>
<P>
   Pro wrestling, most notably the WWF, made a conscious commercial
decision to push out its boundaries to include an audience that
wanted more intense bangs. Pro wrestlers are wondrous athletes,
traditionally in better shape than baseball players and even most
football players, and they work harder at entertaining us. But they
have always seemed cartoonish, from the campy Gorgeous George
through the earnest Bruno Sammartino right up to Hulk Hogan of this
fading ESPN Ironic Age in which we can enjoy all the thrills and
chills of the true believer while pretending we're too hip for the
hype.
</P>
<P>
   But those good and evil 'toon characters of wrestling were
Disneyed off. Video games, animated and computer-enhanced movies,
were all more exciting than large men, women, dwarfs, in Halloween
costumes snarling at each other and obviously pulling their
punches. We needed riskier scenarios and more outrageous
characters. Evil versus Worse in increasingly vile little psychotic
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   As wrestling was pushed into more violence by technology, were
other sports pushed by wrestling or just by their own marketing
projections to expand their boundaries of bad behavior and even
violence? Were they fearful of being left behind by a down-market
trend?
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe, for example, that hockey methodically set
out to make the games more physical, more damaging to players, more
breathtaking to the increasing number of warm-climate fans who did
not grow up skating on ice and appreciating finesse. Yet the
high-sticking and the league's relentless merchandising of thumping
checks feels something like a trend. (For all the eulogies to the
Great Gretzky, he will not be missed by this generation of fan.)
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic of concussions in football, of exploding
physicality in basketball, of head-hunting in baseball, were these
sales-conference conspiracies, a reflection of the times, a natural
expression of the gladiator classes coming into sports? Keep
watching the officiating or lack of it; risky business is easy
enough to stop.
</P>
<P>
   No question the stakes are much higher now, reason enough for
cities to bribe those Olympic officials with their hands already
out, for Dave Checketts to lie about negotiations like any other
business executive or politician, for Robbie Knievel to dare the
Grand Canyon. So why wouldn't some poor kid put a helmet in
someone's stomach, an elbow in a chest, a stick in a groin?
</P>
<P>
   Especially if coach and the market approve. In our ongoing forum
on Jock Culture and its effect on common sensibilities, pro
wrestling is worth discussion. It may still be a cartoon, but the
pressure it puts on other live entertainments to crank up the
action is real.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Hart was not a cartoon, he was a real person who died in a
choreographed stunt while making a living trying to entertain the
fans. It almost feels like a cheap shot to mention that the
headliners of his last show (which went on as planned) were the
Undertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin or that Hart learned his
craft in the Dungeon, as his father's basement training school was
called. Hart often wrestled with his brother, the Hitman.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably worth noting that the WWF's chairman, Vince
McMahon, is interested in building a New York arena for his
traveling show, and in taking the company public. Risky business
like Hart's last leap should send the stock through the roof.

 &HT;    Year after E. Coli outbreak, White Water expects a busy summer
 &HT;    WITH STORY SLUGGED: WHITEWATER-WEISS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Henry Farber
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Vicky Hawkins of Woodstock says she has a memory for
dates, and she knows where she was June 11, 1998. She was at White
Water in Marietta, watching her two children splash around the
giant play pool known as Captain Kid's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   Little did she know _ nor could anyone have known _ that dozens
of children visiting the giant water park that day were being
infected by a deadly strain of E. coli bacteria. Twenty-six of them
would be hospitalized, and some would end up on respirators or
dialysis machines. One would die.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins and her children were lucky. They had no symptoms at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what was she doing back at White Water 11 1/2 months
later, again with her two children, now 5 and 10?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a one-time fluke,'' Hawkins, a labor and
delivery nurse at Northside Hospital, said of last year's outbreak.
``It could happen in a subdivision pool just as easily as it could
happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   She's just the kind of customer White Water is counting on as it
resumes its full summer schedule this weekend, operating seven days
a week through Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   As the anniversary of White Water's E. coli crisis approaches,
park officials are confident they've delivered their message to
potential customers: The park is safer than ever because of changes
that have been made. It's even a part of the recorded message
callers hear when they phone for park hours and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Park administrators won't release attendance figures, but crowds
have been thick since the park opened for weekends May 1. And
executives say season tickets are being sold at a pace that will
make 1999 the second-busiest summer ever. About 40,000 season
tickets were sold last year, a park record.
</P>
<P>
   Safety signs are the first thing visitors see after they park.
At the ticket windows, a new clock tells the time when chlorine and
pH (acidity) levels were last checked.
</P>
<P>
   Deedie Dowdle, White Water spokeswoman, said the clock shows
that the levels are checked every hour. But actually, she said,
that's just how often readings are taken by hand. Computerized
chlorine readings are registered every six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorine levels have been the main focus of allegations that
White Water bears responsibility for the outbreak. The park's
accusers say the levels were allowed to dip, permitting bacteria to
flourish. Park officials say industry standards were met.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the additional signs, some changes at the park affect the
way children play _ and even the way parents change diapers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Captain Kid's Cove, the shallow pool that was ground zero of
the outbreak, is off-limits to anyone thought by lifeguards to be
younger than 4. It is widely believed that the outbreak was caused
by a child soiling his or her diaper in the pool, although park
officials contend the spread of the infection probably started
outside the pool.
</P>
<P>
   _ Little Squirt's Island, formerly a pool adjacent to Captain
Kid's Cove, has been filled in so that it is a wet, flat surface
with fountains and large plastic animals. No longer can infants put
their heads underwater and risk swallowing water.
</P>
<P>
   _ Day care groups of children younger than 5 are forbidden.
``What we're pushing for is parental supervision _ not a baby
sitter situation,'' Dowdle said. ``Parental supervision is going to
be far superior.''
</P>
<P>
   _ There are more diaper-changing areas, and they include faucets
for washing babies and the changing surface. Poolside diaper
changes are forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   _ Restrooms are ``no-touch'' zones. Faucets turn on and toilets
flush automatically. There are no outside doors to push open;
privacy is ensured by angled entrances.
</P>
<P>
   _ Water is changed every half-hour and recirculated just as
quickly by a new filtration system.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Marek Cyzio of Duluth felt comfortable watching
his 5-year-old daughter splashing in Captain Kid's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is related to money in this country, and I think
White Water's operators will do the best to make sure it doesn't
happen again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there were no water parks in his native Poland, and
he's making up for lost fun.

 &HT;    Weiss can't just forget E. coli scare
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS AND STORY SLUGGED: WHITEWATER-REOPENS
 &HT;    By Henry Farber

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Walt Weiss is leadoff hitter for one of the best teams
in baseball and a National League All-Star. But he'd trade it all
to undo what his family went through last summer, when son Brody,
then 3, nearly died after a bacterial infection caused his kidneys
to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a helpless feeling, watching your boy lie there like
that,'' Weiss said, recalling the week his middle child spent
hooked up to tubes at Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Brody's was the household name among the 26 children
hospitalized after an outbreak last June at White Water, a Marietta
amusement park, of an illness related to a deadly form of E. coli
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The nation watched, literally, as Brody made what seemed a
miraculous recovery. Cameras at the All-Star game zoomed in on his
seat at Denver's Coors Field, where he watched his father play just
a week after leaving the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Braves shortstop became a spokesman for the
families of these very sick children, including one who died.
</P>
<P>
   The park resumes full-time operations this weekend, and with the
swimming season approaching, Weiss talked about last summer's
trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brody's doing real well now,'' Weiss said. ``But I'm afraid
his immune system's not what it used to be. He catches everything,
and what he catches turns into infections.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's heaven compared to 11 months ago. It was bad enough
seeing Brody decline day after day, succumbing to the clocklike
pattern of symptoms: stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, stool
turned to almost pure blood, then kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the hell, the Weisses were able to see in advance what
would go wrong next for Brody. Two of the other victims, Jordan
Shook and McCall Akin (the child who died), were at White Water the
same day. But because individual immune systems are different, the
bacteria took hold in Brody's body two days after the others. The
Weisses watched the two other children, also at Scottish Rite,
worsen as the days wore on, knowing that Brody's symptoms would
match theirs 48 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Brody's condition declined to the point that he needed
a respirator. At the same time, McCall's family was told that her
colon was so badly damaged that it must be removed. Would that be
Brody's fate?
</P>
<P>
   ``They said there's virtually nothing we could do _ just treat
the symptoms as they arise,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for reasons that Weiss can sum up only as a blessing,
Brody turned the corner _ on the day his father was named to the
All-Star team. A week later, the family got a standing ovation back
home in Denver, where Weiss' wife, Terri, and children live during
the school year.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, two hours before game time, the Braves'
locker room had a championship feeling. Players looked relaxed and
confident about their upcoming game with the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Only Weiss, straddling a bench, looked intense. But it wasn't
because of his hitting streak, which was about to reach nine games.
It was the memory of Brody's battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just looking at him, it's a constant reminder,'' Weiss said,
his voice shaking slightly. ``We feel really blessed at how he's
doing. Now he runs around like a normal 4-year-old, and it's just
amazing how bad he was for that week.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Terri still monitor Brody's condition closely. His
kidneys are the main concern. Doctors say there's an outside chance
that Brody will need dialysis treatments or even transplants.
</P>
<P>
   The prognosis is basically the same for the dozen or so most
seriously stricken survivors, doctors have said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the publicity that has come with recent E. coli
outbreaks, particularly the worst strain _ 0157:H7 _ much remains
unknown. Why, for example, do up to 5 percent of patients develop
the potentially fatal kidney failure condition known as hemolytic
uremic syndrome?
</P>
<P>
   One of the lucky ones at White Water was Brody's 1-year-old
brother Bo. A test detected E. coli in his blood, but he didn't get
sick.
</P>
<P>
   The Weisses still keep in touch with some of the other victims'
parents. Terri Weiss in particular exchanges calls with Marisa
Akin, who lost her only child.
</P>
<P>
   For the Weisses, the tangible daily impact of last year's crisis
is twofold: a family ban on hamburgers, which have often been
associated with E. coli; and the construction of a pool in the back
yard of the family's summer home in Marietta. ``We've been to water
parks all over the country in the past. You could go a million
times and nothing would happen,'' Weiss said. ``But there are just
too many bad memories for us to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's worst E. coli crisis was the 1994 outbreak that
sickened 500 people and killed four children who ate contaminated
hamburgers at Jack in the Box restaurants in the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   From that scare, Seattle lawyer William Marler built a
reputation as the nation's leading counsel for litigants in E. coli
cases. He represents five White Water families, four of whom have
sued. ``We are in what I would consider a rapid road toward a
trial, maybe later this year,'' Marler said.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss is the only Marler client who has not sued. Weiss said he
is keeping his options open, depending on Brody's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Is he angry at White Water? ``None of us is exempt from the
problems of life,'' he said. ``Maybe it could have been avoided.
Maybe there was some negligence because of the chlorine levels. Who
can say?

WRIGHT GETTING REPUTATION AS A HEADHUNTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ At the age of 27, Pedro Martinez is not exactly the
wise old veteran offering the benefit of his experience to the
youth sitting at his knee. But 23-year-old Jaret Wright would
probably do well to heed Martinez's advice because he knows whereof
he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, the Cleveland Indians' hard-throwing pitcher, is fast
gaining a reputation as a head-hunter. He was suspended for five
games earlier this season, was fined $500 last week and has been
summoned to the principal's, that is, the American League
president's, office in New York this week to discuss his
``deportment on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez was a raw flamethrower with the Montreal Expos, he
quickly gained a reputation himself. He hit batters, just missed
some others and precipitated a series of brawls. Now he is a
full-blown star with Boston, leading the major leagues in victories
(9), earned run average (1.98) and strikeouts (108) before his
start against the Indians Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he has to do is not what I'm doing right now, talking,''
Martinez said. ``It's do what I did then, shut my mouth, listen to
what they have to say, put up with everything they have to do and
improve. I never quit pitching inside. I still hit some people, but
I did it in the right position, I got a lot better with my control.
All he has to do is improve himself as a pitcher, prove that he's
able to pitch inside and do it effectively without hurting
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In spring training last year, Luis Sojo of the Yankees suffered
a broken hand when he tried to protect his face from a Wright
pitch. Last October Wright hit Darren Lewis of Boston in the head.
A week ago Saturday he hit Tony Clark of Detroit in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day when he hit Clark in the head,'' Martinez said,
``I don't know what the reason was; I don't know what the situation
was. I just know it's dangerous. I don't go along with hitting
people in the head. I don't do it. I don't like anybody doing it to
me. I think a lot about the players as human beings. Those people
have families. They have to be there for their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was sympathetic toward Wright's plight, Martinez
candidly said no. ``Not really,'' he added, ``because I don't know
what the reasons are that Jaret Wright is hitting people in the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, son of former major league pitcher Clyde Wright, has
exacerbated the ill feeling toward him with his combative gestures
after he has hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to control that anger,'' Martinez said. ``That's why I
can't tell you I'm sympathetic. If he is doing it on purpose, boy,
he's going to get his butt kicked. Somebody's going to get him out
of baseball. All they have to do is drag the ball down the first
base side and step on one ankle.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, no heavyweight at 5-feet-11 and 170 pounds, avoided
injury in his early Wright-like experiences. There was the episode
in 1994 when he had a perfect game going into the eighth inning and
hit Reggie Sanders with a pitch. Sanders charged the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the heck could you be thinking when you charge the
mound in a perfect game in the eighth inning?'' Martinez asked.
``The ball just barely ticked him in the elbow and the guy charged
the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Derek Bell incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a ball close to his chin,'' the Dominican Republic
native related. ``Then he dared me to throw a fastball. He said
throw that stuff over. I did throw it over, I struck him out and I
said go sit your butt down. He got upset after he was in the
dugout. He charged the mound. All of a sudden the word spreads
around. I'm pitching in and people are charging the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those and other incidents, Martinez said, his and
Wright's situations are not comparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time he has in the big leagues,'' he said, ``he's got way
far more starts than I had. I came up as a reliever, never really
got a chance to start. I got in all this trouble trying to become a
starter in the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright has made 65 starts in the majors. His 6.95 earned run
average in 10 starts this season, though, indicates an obvious need
for much more experience. One experience he seemed to have against
Boston Friday night matched another of Martinez's experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The attention focused on throwing inside, Martinez said, can get
to a pitcher mentally. ``It did get to my mind sometimes,'' he
recalled. ``I was afraid sometimes to give up a home run or throw a
fastball in.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Alomar, the Indians' second baseman, thought Wright
suffered from that mindset Friday night when the Red Sox battered
him for eight runs in 3 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he didn't want to throw nothing close inside,'' Alomar
said. ``As a pitcher, you have to throw inside, especially against
good hitters like Boston. But today he tried to stay away.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he overcame that problem and added that Wright
can, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he has to do right now is focus on his work,'' Martinez
said. ``If he wants to do what I did, it's up to him. He's going to
have to learn to act different. If you give up a homer, stay away
from the batter. Stay away from the anger that you get when you
give up that homer. You keep yourself poised enough to get that
batter out, make your pitch and stay out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The advice is probably sound. It has worked for Martinez.

   INTERLEAGUE PLAY ON DECK
</P>
<P>
   American League pitchers were in the batting cage swinging alien
instruments last week, meaning only one thing: Interleague play is
here for the third season.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase begins Friday and runs for 10 days, through June
13. Mets-Yankees, Angels-Dodgers, Athletics-Giants, Expos-Blue
Jays, these are the natural rivalries that will be featured next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' pitchers won't have to bat against the Mets in the
first of their two three-game series because the games will be at
Yankee Stadium, where the designated hitter is permitted to play
under the most bizarre split rule in professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   But David Cone and friends began hitting last week in an
exercise of futility that didn't even command the attention of
Chris Chambliss, the Yankees' hitting coach. ``It's a lost cause,''
Chambliss said. ``I think it takes a guy a lot smarter than me to
teach these guys how to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone was the most impressive with a bat in his hands, although
that's a relative term. He hit one pitch into the right field
stands, strutted out of the cage and said to his fellow pitchers,
``All you got to do is look at the back of my bubble gum card.'' He
alluded to his World Series hitting record _ 3 hits in 8 at-bats
for a .375 average.
</P>
<P>
   WRONG WORDING
</P>
<P>
   On an ESPN baseball cablecast last week, Rick Sutcliffe
suggested that Trevor Hoffman, San Diego's talented closer, and not
Tom Glavine of Atlanta should have won the National League Cy Young
award last season because he gained 53 saves in 54 save
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to get hold of one and see what it says on it,''
Sutcliffe, the 1984 winner, said. ``I know because I was fortunate
enough to win one. It says most valuable pitcher, and who was a
more valuable pitcher than Trevor Hoffman last year?''
</P>
<P>
   Sutcliffe was correct to an extent. His award and many others
indeed say the award was given to the most valuable pitcher. But
they weren't supposed to say that. The wording subsequently was
changed to reflect what the award has always represented: the most
outstanding pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   HEADS ARE ROLLING
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Hough paid the price last week for the Los Angeles
Dodgers' $105 million expenditure on Kevin Brown. Not that Brown
has been a pitching flop; he has a 5-3 record and a 2.39 earned run
average, losing a compete-game five-hitter, 3-2, to Cincinnati last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the team's pitching staff as a whole has disappointed the
people who made that expenditure, among other high-priced
decisions, so Hough, the pitching coach, was fired. It's a practice
that George Steinbrenner made popular in the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' braintrust wasn't thrilled with the team's
run-scoring rate either. Rick Dempsey, the third base coach,
apparently couldn't get enough runners to the plate so he was
banished to the bullpen, replaced by Glenn Hoffman, Trevor's older
brother and the team's manager last year after Bill Russell was
fired.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' defense hasn't been terrific either, but they
didn't fire the defensive coach.
</P>
<P>
   BAD TIMES IN COLORADO
</P>
<P>
   Jerry McMorris, manager partner of the Colorado Rockies, is
having a bad year. He filed for bankruptcy 10 days ago for one of
his three trucking companies, and his team's pitching staff
continues to be bankrupt despite his decision to fire Don Baylor as
the team's manager and hire Jim Leyland for $2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   McMorris could take some of the Teamsters whose salaries he has
been unable to pay, put them in the Rockies' pitching rotation and
the team could still have the National League's highest earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   NO LEAD IS SAFE
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Pirates weren't happy last week when Roger Cedeno
stole second base in the eighth inning with the Mets leading, 7-2.
The old unwritten rule is that teams with big leads don't rub it in
by stealing. But the game's offensive explosion has rendered that
gentlemen's agreement archaic.
</P>
<P>
   No lead seems to be safe anymore. Most dramatic example of that
development came earlier this month when the Cleveland Indians fell
behind Tampa Bay, 10-2, after 5 1/2 innings, then erupted for 18
runs in the next three innings and won, 20-11. Larry Rothschild,
the Devil Rays' manager, only wishes he could have had a chance to
run up the score even more.

RISKS ARE HIGH IN KASHMIR CLASH, U.S. EXPERTS WARN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is warning that fighting between
India and Pakistan in the icy mountains of Kashmir risks ``spinning
out of control'' and could result in the fourth war between two
nations that last year declared themselves to be nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials and American-based specialists
say they see little threat of a nuclear confrontation, but they
also say that little is ever predictable in a confrontation over
Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan territory that stirs passions in
both countries like little else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always the possibility of events spinning out of
control,'' said Karl Inderfurth, assistant secretary of state for
South Asian affairs. ``Clearly the ingredients are there for
miscalculation. Our hope is that both sides will take steps to move
this in a peaceful direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say that U.S. diplomats in
India and Pakistan have offered their services as mediators in the
dispute and that Inderfurth called in the Indian and Pakistani
ambassadors in Washington on Thursday to encourage a peaceful
resolution of what may be the most dangerous confrontation between
the two nations in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American officials acknowledge that the United States and
other nations may ultimately have little influence in ending the
fighting in Kashmir, over which India and Pakistan have fought two
of their three wars since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to help them find a solution to Kashmir for
50 years, and they're still at it,'' said a senior U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think history suggests that there's not much we can do. We
are very much of the view that this should be resolved by the
parties themselves. And we think they are capable of resolving it
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting intensified seriously on Wednesday when India
turned to airstrikes to drive out several hundred Islamic
separatists who have taken up positions inside the
Indian-controlled part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   India lost two fighter jets Thursday on the Pakistani side of
the cease-fire line under disputed circumstances. On Friday, India
confirmed that one of its helicopters was destroyed by a portable
Stinger missile, killing all four crewmen. The use of the Stinger
by the separatists, who have dug themselves in on high ground,
introduced a new and lethal element into the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Inderfurth said in an interview that he believed the fighting
would end only after the Muslim separatists who entered
Indian-controlled Kashmir had left of their own accord or been
forced out.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials have alleged that the insurgents are being
supported by the Pakistan military, and many scholars of the region
say it is almost impossible to imagine that the guerrillas could
operate in such treacherous terrain without such help.
</P>
<P>
   Inderfurth would not comment on the question of possible
Pakistani backing for the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   But he said: ``Clearly the Indians are not going to cede this
territory that these militants have taken. They have to depart, and
they will depart, either voluntarily or because the Indians take
them out. And the use of air power was a very clear demonstration
that the Indians are serious about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Askari Rizvi, a professor of South Asian studies at Columbia
University, said he thought the confrontation was the most
dangerous since 1971, when India and Pakistan went to war, leading
to the creation of Bangladesh from what had been East Pakistan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It is potentially very dangerous in the sense that it could
escalate,'' said Rizvi, who was born in Pakistan. ``I think both
countries have to share the blame for this, in the sense that they
have been fighting a kind of proxy war in Kashmir for some years,
and now this proxy war is gradually becoming a real war.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Cohen, a South Asian specialist at the Brookings
Institution, noted that Kashmir had been the scene of a ``whole
series of little roller-coast bumps like this'' and that ``my
judgment is that the risk of war is not greater than it has been
before.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course if I'm wrong,'' he added, ``the miscalculation could
be ghastly, because both countries have the ability to kill at
least 100 million on the other side.'' He was referring to the
Indian and Pakistani nuclear arsenals. ``The cost of a
miscalculation is infinitely greater than it was before.''

RIVALS IN ARGENTINA RALLY AROUND THE PESO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ As the race to replace President
Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina heated up in recent weeks, the two
major candidates thought they had found an ideal campaign theme:
Blame the incumbent's free market economic policies for rising
unemployment and promise major changes if elected.
</P>
<P>
   But investors got so nervous that rumors swirled of an impending
devaluation of the peso, and the already jittery local stock market
took a nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   So in recent days the candidates _ the mayor of Buenos Aires,
Fernando de la Rua, and the Buenos Aires provincial governor,
Eduardo Duhalde _ have joined Menem in circling the wagons to
defend the peso and even to coordinate economic policies in the
Congress. The display of unity has eased concerns of instability
leading up to the October election and the December change in
government, and helped to calm a still turbulent local stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   De la Rua and his top economic advisers in the left-of-center
Alianza opposition coalition have publicly pledged to keep the peso
pegged one-to-one to the dollar, an eight-year-old policy that is
the linchpin of Menem's successful efforts to end years of
hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, de la Rua's allies in Congress quietly ended a
campaign to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in spending
cuts ordered by Menem to control a growing budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   In a further gesture intended to reassure investors,
congressional members of the governing Justicialist Party and the
Alianza coalition are putting the final touches on legislation that
would cap the budget deficit at 1.5 percent of gross domestic
product in 2000 and 1 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde, who seems virtually certain of the official
Justicialist nomination, has also pledged to retain the currency
peg. He has dropped the mantra of his stump speech that ``the Menem
model is exhausted,'' although he still yearns to return the party
to the populism that was its trademark before his bitter rival,
Menem, took charge.
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde had been as much as 20 points behind de la Rua in some
polls over the last year. But by distancing himself from the
increasingly unpopular Menem, he has bridged the gap.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Duhalde publicly buried the hatchet with Menem's
economic policies by meeting with Domingo Cavallo, the former
economy minister who conceived those policies, including the peso's
one-to-one peg with the dollar, known here as ``convertibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina should not abandon convertibility,'' Jorge Remes
Lenicov, a senior economic adviser to Duhalde, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   His words were echoed by Adalberto Rodriguez Giavarini, a top
Alianza economist expected to play a major role in a de la Rua
government, who said, ``It is highly irresponsible even to discuss
the possibility of abandoning convertibility.''
</P>
<P>
   After dropping 18 percent between May 10 and May 24 and pausing
for a holiday on Tuesday, the Argentine Bovespa stock index climbed
4.5 percent between Wednesday and Friday. The bond market also
steadied.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine stock market became turbulent after the government
conceded a month ago that it could not meet the International
Monetary Fund target for a $2.95 billion fiscal deficit, saying
that a deepening recession and lower tax receipts would expand the
deficit to $5 billion. The fund eased its restraints, but only
after the government promised to make $1 billion in cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market woes increased after student demonstrations
around the country persuaded the Congress two weeks ago to restore
more than $300 million in cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The market slide then gathered momentum after Cavallo suggested
that Argentina could eventually float its currency. He quickly
clarified that such a move could be a decade or more away. But the
damage was furthered when George Soros, the international
financier, suggested that an overvalued peso was hurting
Argentina's competitiveness on world markets, especially after the
Brazilian devaluation in January. Soros later said he did not
support a devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Menem and his aides have said they will never
devalue. In a dire emergency, they say, Menem will do away with the
peso altogether and make the dollar Argentina's currency.

MACEDONIAN VILLAGE TYPIFIES PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE AND DORMANT
HOSTILITY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RADIOVCE, Macedonia _ The Macedonians and Albanians living in
this village of 1,500 people till their soil side by side,
experiencing birth, marriage and death within easy earshot of one
another.
</P>
<P>
   But they inhabit separate worlds, speaking different languages,
sending their children to different schools and never
intermarrying. The village is even physically split, bisected by a
thin asphalt road with Albanian homes largely on one side and
Macedonian ones on the other.
</P>
<P>
   While the dividing line is thin, NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia
and the arrival of more than 230,000 Kosovar Albanian refugees in
Macedonia have widened the distance between the dual worlds of
Radiovce. About 260 refugees from Kosovo have been taken in by
Albanian families here. Not one has been taken in by Macedonians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not interested at all,'' said Ejup Ziberi, 33, an
Albanian who heads a local emergency aid committee. ``We haven't
had any help from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Macedonians, who make up two-thirds of the nation's
population, are Orthodox Christian. Albanians, who account for most
of the remaining third, are typically Muslim. Macedonian is a
Slavic language; Albanian is Indo-European.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the village is a travel poster for what the
United States says can work in the Balkans: people of different
backgrounds and religions living peacefully side by side. But
critics see folly in the Western notion of a multiethnic Balkan
society, which they consider a contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the villagers here, while on edge now, have peacefully
lived out their dual existence for decades. Western diplomats
desperate to hold Macedonia together argue that if the tenuous
society in villages like Radiovce can hold together, Macedonia will
stand as a bulwark of peaceful coexistence next to Croatia, Bosnia
and now Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But listen to Slavko Kirovski, a Macedonian store owner here:
``I don't hate them, but if the Albanians in this village make any
problem with my child I will kill them. You cannot believe their
talk. You cannot trust a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the ethnic Albanian refugees from Kosovo had only
themselves to blame for their plight. They should not have pushed
for independence from Yugoslavia, he said, and any similar demands
or violence from local Albanians will not be tolerated here.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, Kosovo has stood as the first domino in a
theory that envisions ethnic conflict spreading south across the
Balkans. Macedonia would be the second. Radiovce, for its part, is
wobbling.
</P>
<P>
   It is an atypical village. In most rural areas Albanians and
Macedonians live entirely apart, with Albanian villages
concentrated in the country's northwest. Macedonia's cities, which
account for just over half the country's population, tend to be
more mixed ethnically. But even in Skopje, the capital and by far
the most integrated city, Albanians tend to live on one side of the
Vardar River and Macedonians on the other.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the differences between the groups are vast.
Macedonians are Slavs, like Russians and Serbs, with whom they
generally sympathize, while Albanians are an ethnic group unique to
Europe. The Macedonian language uses the Cyrillic alphabet and is
closely related to Serbo-Croatian, which is spoken in Serbia,
Croatia and Bosnia. Albanian uses the Roman alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little physical difference between them, and young
Albanians and Macedonians have trouble telling one another apart.
Both groups wear Western clothes and covet Levi's, Nike sneakers
and the latest in American and European fashions and music. Older
Macedonians and Albanians can be picked out by some clothes they
wear, particularly the white, cone-shaped hats called pils, worn by
many older Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   Schooling, a common magnet for integration elsewhere, is largely
separate here. Following a system from the former Yugoslavia,
Albanian and Macedonian children go to school together until the
fourth grade. Then, through high school, students are segregated,
sometimes within the same school. In Radiovce, for example,
Macedonian children are bused to a nearby all-Macedonian village
while Albanians stay in the local school.
</P>
<P>
   Festim Baftaijari, a 13-year-old Albanian boy from Radiovce,
said he had a few Macedonian friends in the village.
</P>
<P>
   Avramoska Rosana, an 11-year-old Macedonian girl who lives on
the other side of the village, said she had Albanian friends but
conceded that they were not close. ``We say hello and make
conversation with the Albanian kids,'' she said. ``But we don't
play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions among teen-agers were difficult to gauge, with some
saying fights were common and others not. But it is clear that
dating is strictly taboo. There is not a single mixed marriage in
the village. Each side blames the other for the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macedonian men consider Albanians like a second class,'' said
Esat Ebdiu, 31, an Albanian electrician in Radiovce, ``so you can
imagine what they consider Albanian women. They don't even speak to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Albanians complained that the job market, the police force and
the university all favor Macedonians. But Macedonians said the
opposite, saying local preference programs unfairly give jobs and
university admission slots to Albanians who do not deserve them.
</P>
<P>
   And Macedonians complained at length about the high birth rate
of Albanians _ one of the highest in Europe. They said that
although Macedonians were in the majority in Radiovce 50 years ago,
the village was now evenly divided because of the Albanian birth
rate. Albanians denied this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanian women have many children, eight or 10 kids, like
worms,'' said Milevska Jaglika, 62, a Macedonian villager.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the criticism there was evidence of peaceful
coexistence. For every negative comment about Albanians that Ms.
Jaglika made, her soft-spoken neighbor, 60-year-old Markovska
Sofija, said something conciliatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the refugees,'' Ms. Sofija said. ``It's
difficult for both sides, for the Macedonians and the Albanians,
for the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   And Baskim Nuredini, a 29-year-old Albanian cafe owner, emerged
from a Macedonian friend's home in Radiovce and predicted war would
never come here. ``We see what's happening in Kosovo,'' he said.
``I think we can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the clearest message from both communities in
Radiovce was fear. Macedonians fear that they will soon be
outnumbered. Albanians fear that like their kin in Kosovo, they
will be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Milcin, a Macedonian playwright and the director of the
Open Society Institute in Skopje, says much depends on whether the
Macedonian government and society develop structures that assuage
visceral fears, instead of fueling them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many things in the Balkans are not in the field of
rationality,'' he said. ``A lot of emotions are still running our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Milcin said that most people in the Balkans would probably
prefer not to live in a multiethnic society. But they realize that
on a practical level, after witnessing the wars that destroyed
Yugoslavia, their lives and land are so intertwined with each other
that trying to separate into new, ethnically separate nations would
prove catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, the will to fight is lower than the resistance to
living together,'' he said. ``I still believe we are going to
survive.''

U.S. MAY TRY TO STOP LOAN SEEN AS BAD FOR TIBETANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States appears to be heading for
another clash with China, this time over a divisive World Bank
development loan that would help Chinese authorities resettle tens
of thousands of Chinese in regions traditionally inhabited by
Tibetans and Mongolians.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration seems to be getting ready to oppose
the resettlement plan when it comes before the World Bank's
executive board for a final approval next month, though White House
officials say no final decision has yet been made.
</P>
<P>
   Private pro-Tibetan groups are lobbying against the project,
which would spend $160 million to resettle 60,000 poor farmers from
eroded hillsides in China's western Qinghai province to better
lands about 300 miles farther west.
</P>
<P>
   China and the World Bank see the plan as part of a joint
campaign to alleviate rural poverty in remote areas by offering
farmers the chance to make a better living and relieving population
pressures in the areas they vacate.
</P>
<P>
   But critics argue that moving these farmers, who are mainly Han
Chinese and members of the minority Hui, Tu and Salar ethnic
groups, will further erode the culture, language and social
position of the Tibetan inhabitants of Dulan County in Haixi
Prefecture, where the farmers are to be resettled and which is a
designated Tibetan and Mongolian Autonomous Area. Tibetans are
already in a minority there.
</P>
<P>
   Qinghai province is outside the borders of the Tibetan region
China annexed in 1959, but has traditionally been strongly
ethnically Tibetan and is the birthplace of the Dalai Lama, the
Tibetan spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   Although Qinghai has been a province of China since the 17th
century, critics see the proposed resettlements as part of a
broader campaign by the Chinese authorities to weaken the national
identity of Tibetan people under their control.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the project during an appearance before the House
Banking Committee recently, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said,
``We are enormously concerned about it,'' adding that the United
States is ``inclined to oppose it.''
</P>
<P>
   John Ackerly of the International Campaign for Tibet, a
Washington-based organization fighting for Tibetan rights, said:
``This relocation, which the World Bank now proposes to help
finance, is part of a larger Chinese policy which is now the
greatest threat to the continued existence of the Tibetans as a
distinct people and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to further weakening the position of Tibetans in the
region to be resettled, critics say the plan violates the World
Bank's own guidelines, which state that indigenous ethnic
minorities should ``not suffer adverse effects from bank-financed
projects and that they receive culturally compatible social and
economic benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed resettlement will make the indigenous Tibetans
even more marginal than they are already,'' said Kate Saunders of
the London-based Tibet Information Network, which first highlighted
the dangers of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also argue that the scheme is part of a broader plan to
establish the infrastructure needed to exploit the region's mineral
resources, which would inevitably attract additional inflows of
non-Tibetans. They also warn that in view of the many prison camps
in the area, China might use prison labor on the project.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the World Bank is standing behind the project.
In a briefing paper issued last week it defends the resettlement
plan as an integral part of its efforts to reduce poverty in China,
which has already cut the number of rural poor from 280 million to
80 million over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers to be resettled, it argues, are ``among the poorest
people in the world, with incomes of about $60 a year,'' who only
survive on help from the government and from relatives elsewhere in
China.
</P>
<P>
   But it admits that the resettlement would weaken the position of
indigenous Tibetans and Mongolians in the area.

   In Haixi Prefecture, the Tibetan percentage of the population
would fall from 11.1 percent to 10.3 percent, while in Dulan County
it would decline from 22.7 percent to 14 percent. For Mongolians
the comparative declines are from 7.6 percent to 6.5 percent and
from 14.1 percent to 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of Han Chinese in Haixi Prefecture would
rise from 236,918 to 261,375 and in Dulan County from 27,977 to
52,434. But the bank says it has assurances from the Chinese
authorities that prison labor would not be used in the resettlement
project.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Former President Suharto used to call them
``festivals of democracy'' _ ritual one-candidate elections in
which vocal opponents were jailed, voters were pressured and the
results were manipulated at his whim.
</P>
<P>
   One year after Suharto's forced resignation, an extraordinary
spectacle is unfolding on the streets of Indonesia's cities: a true
festival of democracy _ a free and contested campaign with 48
parties, an unpredictable outcome and giddy daylong rallies with
all the exuberance of a carnival.
</P>
<P>
   After a yearlong interregnum during which Suharto's vice
president, B.J. Habibie, held the presidency, many voters are
clearly eager to do what they were never allowed to do before: vote
against Suharto, even though he is not running.
</P>
<P>
   His incumbent party, with Habibie as its presidential candidate,
is still a major player, with the strongest nationwide
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears to be on the run, opposed by a cluster of
opposition parties with different agendas but a common theme: Throw
out the old order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is changed; everything is upside down,'' said Jusuf
Wanandi, who heads the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a policy institute.
</P>
<P>
   That change is all the more extraordinary given that only
Suharto left office last year. His once subservient legislators
remained in place, but laid the groundwork for the election that
may soon cost them their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first freely contested general election in more
than 40 years and, if it is successful, will bring democracy to the
world's fourth-most-populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails, political analysts fear that Indonesia could plunge
back into the disorder and violence of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue that we genuinely have open politics now,'' a
senior foreign diplomat said. ``The situation right now is better
than anyone had thought conceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   The election is part of a process that will complete the
transition of power that began when Suharto resigned on May 21,
1998, following riots and student demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on June 7 will elect 462 members of Parliament, the
bulk of a 700-seat assembly that will choose the next president
before the end of the year. No party is expected to win a majority
and few analysts are bold enough to predict the shape of a future
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The post-election time is going to be the most dicey,'' said
Sarwono Kusumaatmaja, the environment minister under Suharto.
``It's going to be a time of wheeling and dealing and plotting.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate to beat has become Megawati Sukarnoputri, the
longtime symbol of opposition to and victimization by Suharto. Her
popularity derives largely from the fact that she is the daughter
of Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno, whom Suharto deposed in
1967, and from Suharto's more recent attempts to silence her.
</P>
<P>
   The two other most prominent candidates, with whom she has
forged a tactical opposition alliance during the campaign, are
Amien Rais and Abdurrahman Wahid, both of whom have large Muslim
bases here in the world's most populous Islamic nation, with more
than 200 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   The election is an experiment and a learning process as well as
a crucial moment in the country's history. Nobody knows how
Indonesians vote when their vote belongs to them. And with a tangle
of complex new procedures, some of which are still being worked
out, election experts foresee the possibility of confusing and
anomalous outcomes and widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
   There is already a fair level of confusion in rural areas, said
David Timberman, an American expert on elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the villages people say, `Why are we having elections
again? We just had them in 1997. And why are there all these
parties? How are we supposed to choose?'''
</P>
<P>
   Already, many analysts seem to have been proved wrong about this
election. Almost everybody, judging by past history, had predicted
violence during the three-week campaign. With one week to go, the
relative lack of violence, said one diplomat, ``is fully consistent
with Indonesia's pattern of unpredictability.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, Indonesian and foreign analysts list a number of
scenarios for possible post-election chaos, and foremost among them
is a big win by Habibie's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because Mrs. Megawati's party, the Democratic
Party for Struggle, has cultivated a sense of inevitability aided
by huge, enthusiastic rallies through much of the main island of
Java and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Its momentum grows in part from the reform movement that ousted
Suharto and that continued through the end of last year to pressure
Habibie for more liberalizations. Its supporters demand victory as
the culmination of their long campaign for change.
</P>
<P>
   If the ruling party, Golkar, outdoes the opposition in the
election, many people are sure to cry foul and the demonstrations
and violence of last year may well resume in a new attempt to bring
down the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's Golkar, people are going to be hopping mad,'' said
Sarwono, the former environment minister.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if Golkar loses, some analysts foresee a
struggle as an incumbent power structure resists giving up its
patronage and perks. And the removal of Golkar officials at all
levels would strip Indonesia of virtually all the people who have
experience in actually running a government.
</P>
<P>
   For all the uncertainties of the process and for all the novelty
of an electoral choice, there seems to be a common theme among
people at the campaign rallies here: They want a new Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   For all the country's ethnic, religious, social and geographical
divisions, Suharto left behind a surprisingly united electorate,
even among supporters of Golkar. They want ``reformasi,'' or
reform, a break with the past in a nation whose political growth
has been stunted and whose freedoms have been limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reform means new faces, a new system, more justice, a better
economy, everything,'' said Retno, a real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   For Hadi Sunaryo, a driver, reform means ``changes in the
structure, in the culture, in the legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   For Eman, a student, it is ``total change, in the Cabinet, in
the Parliament. Erase the old regime.''
</P>
<P>
   An office manager named Eky said, ``I don't care who is my
president. The important thing is to make my country better than
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, with this election campaign, those changes have begun,
Ms. Eky said. The difference is freedom, both for those who give
orders and for those who must obey. For both, the yellow shirts of
Golkar are no longer obligatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before,'' she said, ``my village chief pushed us to choose
Golkar. If not, you can have trouble. Oh, he was very strong.
Before, he was afraid and he made everyone else afraid. Now he is
not afraid anymore, and he is walking around in a green shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Green is the color of the Moslem parties that oppose Golkar. Ms.
Eky noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, you changed your shirt,''' she said, ``and he
just smiled.''

SLOVAK ELECTION OFFERS CHOICE OF REFORM OR ISOLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia _ Slovaks faced a simple choice in the
second round of their presidential election on Saturday: vote for
further democratic progress and joining Europe, or slide back into
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Schuster, the official candidate of the four-party
coalition government and the popular mayor of eastern Slovakia's
industrial hub, Kosice, faced Vladimir Meciar, the ebullient former
prime minister. In his years in power, Slovakia slipped behind the
Czechs, Hungarians and Poles in the postcommunist scramble to join
NATO and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls indicated that Schuster, who finished first in
the first round of the presidential race two weeks ago, was leading
with 55 percent support, while Meciar had 44 percent. Although such
polls in Slovakia have proved chronically inaccurate in the past,
political analysts predicted a smooth victory for Schuster in
Saturday's runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Schuster finished less than three percentage
points short of the 50 percent threshold required for outright
victory in the crowded first-round field of eight candidates. The
candidate who finished third, a former actress and diplomat, Magda
Vasaryova, urged her supporters to vote for Schuster on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Voters here in Slovakia's capital brimmed with optimism about a
victory for Schuster, 65, a former communist who since the
anti-communist revolution in 1989 has served as ambassador to
Canada as well as mayor of Kosice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meciar doesn't stand a chance,'' said Robert Jahn, echoing
other passers-by. ``What would happen if he won? It would be a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   During his six years in power, with a nine-month hiatus in 1994,
Meciar tarnished Slovakia's reputation abroad and made enemies at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption and cronyism flourished at the expense of democracy
and freedom of the press. One of the journalists most critical of
Meciar narrowly escaped death when his car blew up. The police
recently arrested the former director of the Slovak Intelligence
Service, Ivan Lexa, and charged him with kidnapping the son of the
former Slovak president, Michal Kovac.
</P>
<P>
   The police are also investigating Meciar's former interior
minister, Juraj Svec, for allegedly stalling a 1997 referendum
about NATO membership and direct presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Meciar, 57, dropped from the Slovak political scene after his
opposition, led by Mikulas Dzurinda, won parliamentary elections
last September. In a theatrical appearance on Slovak television,
Meciar performed a tearful song with impromptu lyrics, singing
``Goodbye, I am leaving you, I have never hurt any of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuster portrays himself as a hard-working servant of the
public and says that was also what he was during the communist era,
when he at one point was head of Slovakia's communist Parliament,
which then was subservient.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters reproach him for that past. Others brush it off,
noting that he held the prominent post in 1989 to 1990, during and
after the collapse of communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the important thing is what he has accomplished,''
said Karol Ferstl, a Bratislava teacher. ``Last summer I went to
Kosice, and when I saw how much the city has flourished since he
became the mayor, tears ran down my face.''

MICHIGAN ENCOUNTERING OPPOSITION TO PLAN TO TEST WELFARE APPLICANTS
FOR DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., La., Md., Minn., N.J., N.Y., S.C., Wis.)  (rk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In a controversial and unusual effort to move more
welfare recipients into the work force, Michigan plans a pilot
program that would require thousands of those applying for aid to
take drug tests to qualify for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in October, Michigan welfare applicants under 65 in
three locations yet to be chosen will be required to take drug
tests or forfeit their benefits. People already receiving benefits
at those locations would be randomly tested.
</P>
<P>
   Those who test positive for illegal drugs would be required to
get treatment to collect welfare money, and those who refuse
treatment would be dropped from the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Against a tide of opposition from civil libertarians and welfare
experts and mixed reaction from welfare recipients themselves, Gov.
John Engler explained that the program would help those who needed
drug treatment to get it and to obtain jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that workplace testing today is so common,''
Engler said. ``This is a tool that will help identify some of the
problems that need to be treated.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan was one of the early leaders nationwide in the effort
to end the decadeslong system of guaranteed welfare benefits and to
replace it with time limits and other changes intended to force
those on welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 1992, when Michigan's welfare changes began, the
state's caseload has dropped about 60 percent, to 89,866 families
from 225,359, the 14th largest drop among states, according to
federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   With many of those most able to find jobs already working,
Michigan is trying a new approach on welfare. The mandatory drug
tests, which other states have considered but rejected, are just
one indication of its new direction.
</P>
<P>
   Other initiatives include a plan to reduce fraud by taking
computerized fingerprint images of those applying for welfare. And
the welfare agency plans to expand its ``Project Zero'' program to
25 additional welfare offices around the state, bringing to 60 the
number of locations offering flexible, expanded social services,
like child care and transportation, with a goal of reducing welfare
cases in a given area to zero.
</P>
<P>
   But of all the initiatives, mandatory drug testing has raised
the most concern, especially among civil libertarians, social
workers and welfare experts.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have considered similar drug testing programs but
have backed away.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Florida set up a pilot program in two regions to
detect drug-abusing welfare recipients. It asks drug-use questions
of all applicants, but uses physical drug tests only on those it
has reasonable cause to believe use drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana passed a law in 1997 requiring drug testing for
welfare recipients and certain public employees. But after a task
force was set up to carry out the law, the state decided instead to
require applicants to answer a questionnaire about drug use.
Answers to the questions determine whether a drug test is
administered.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Maryland planned to require drug tests but found
that other types of screening like questionnaires were cheaper and
more effective. Four other states _ New Jersey, Minnesota, South
Carolina and Wisconsin _ randomly test welfare recipients with
felony drug convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union is
considering suing the state to challenge the program on
constitutional grounds, arguing that the mandatory drug test
violates the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable
search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is starting from the assumption that the poor are
criminals,'' said Kary L. Moss, executive director of the ACLU of
Michigan. ``The state is saying that if you want money for food and
shelter you have to give up the Fourth Amendment rights that others
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Social workers are concerned that the new program could have
unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very demeaning,'' said Sharon Parks, senior research
associate at the Michigan League for Human Services, a nonprofit
organization. ``It might have a real chilling effect on people even
coming in and applying.''
</P>
<P>
   Welfare experts object to the program and say it has a number of
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michigan is the only state in the country that is doing
this,'' said Gwen Rubinstein, director of policy research at the
Legal Action Center, a nonprofit organization based in New York
that focuses on alcohol and drug policy and tracks drug testing
efforts nationwide. ``Drug testing often sounds on the surface like
a good idea, but it has so many flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Ms. Rubinstein said, drug testing will not turn up those
with alcohol abuse problems, which are more prevalent among welfare
recipients. The tests are intrusive, she said, and casual drug
users who are able to work will test positive along with addicts
who need treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Because testing is also expensive, it can divert money that
could otherwise be used for drug treatment and other social
services, Ms. Rubinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Danziger, an economist and professor of social work and
public policy at the University of Michigan who conducted a study
of Michigan welfare recipients, said money used to test for drug
use could be put to better use screening for mental health problems
that needed treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A much greater percentage of women have mental health problems
like depression, anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress
disorder than have substance abuse problems,'' Danziger said.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas E. Howard, the new director of the state welfare
agency, defended his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michigan's approach is very unique,'' Howard said. ``It is not
just testing; it is testing followed by treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the falling welfare caseload in the state dictated a
change in direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an economy now where job placement isn't as tough as
it was 10 years ago,'' he said. ``The challenge is in job
retention.''
</P>
<P>
   The state plans to select the three pilot sites in June, with
one likely to be in Detroit, one in another large city and one in a
rural area, Howard said. Drug treatment availability varies by
region, and the sites chosen will be those with adequate treatment
centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is remove barriers to work,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much the testing and treatment programs will
cost because neither the sites nor the testing material _ urine,
sweat or hair follicles _ have been decided on. Most drug tests
cost about $40 a person, Howard said, but he was not sure how many
people would fall under the jurisdiction of the three locations.
</P>
<P>
   Some welfare recipients here vehemently oppose his plans, and
others applaud them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely would be humiliating to me,'' said Barbara L.
Whitfield, 61, who has been raising four grandchildren since her
daughter died nine years ago. ``They should find a better way to do
that, a more dignified way.''
</P>
<P>
   Others supported the plan. ``I think it is a good idea,'' said
Talonda D. Loggins, 25, a mother of three who works as a nurse's
assistant when she can find good child care and collects welfare
when she cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some recipients are not using their money the way it is
supposed to be used,'' Ms. Loggins said, adding that the testing
would reduce recipients' use of drugs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The people who want to be president seem almost
indifferent to an issue of public policy that could affect one of
them personally: How much should the next chief executive be paid?
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated requests, fewer than half the candidates
commented the week before last on a proposal in Congress to raise
the pay of the president to $400,000. The salary has been $200,000
since Richard Nixon took office in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has spent his career in public service to help people,
not to go after a pay raise,'' said Melissa Ratcliff, a spokeswoman
for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic
nomination, had a similar view. ``You don't run for this job for
the annual salary,'' Bradley said through his spokesman, Tony
Wyche. ``I think we should leave it up to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading Republican candidate agreed entirely. ``It's the job
of the Congress to decide,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said
through his spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   One of his rivals for the Republican nomination, former Gov.
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, also declined to involve himself in
the debate. ``I shouldn't help to set the salary I will receive as
president,'' Alexander said through his chief press aide, Bo
Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, another Republican candidate, opposes a raise for
the next president, said his spokeswoman, Juleanna Glover Weiss.
The wealthy Forbes, of course, does not have to worry about money.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a social and religious conservative, is regarded by
pollsters as the longest of long shots for the Republican
nomination, but on the issue of presidential pay his views _ as far
as they go _ are in line with those of his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you that Gary opposes doubling the president's
salary all at once,'' Bauer's spokeswoman, Jessica Morris, said.
</P>
<P>
   So do most Americans, according to a recent survey by the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press in Washington. Only
one person in four thought the president's pay should rise by more
than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of those surveyed said the president should get
a raise at least once a decade. Told that the president's pay had
not gone up since 1969, 49 percent said the next one should get a
raise, while 39 percent said no.
</P>
<P>
   But when those surveyed were told that the president now makes
$200,000 (a fact only 19 percent of the respondents knew
beforehand), plus $100,000 for travel and $50,000 for expenses,
only 41 percent favored a raise, while 55 percent opposed one.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was based on telephone interviews of a nationwide
sample of 1,179 adults from May 12 through May 16 and had a margin
of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The public's feelings notwithstanding, witnesses who appeared
recently before a panel of the House Committee on Government Reform
were ``nearly unanimous'' that the president's pay should go to
$400,000, said Russell George, chief counsel and staff director of
the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and
Technology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Former presidential aides who might agree on little else,
politically or historically, were united in their view that the
president's compensation (even with its many fringe benefits) ought
to go up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not even a close call,'' said Kenneth Duberstein, a
former chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan. ``This needs to
be addressed now. It is a case of simple equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Haig, one-time chief of staff to Nixon, agreed, as did
John Sununu, who held the job under President George Bush, and Mack
McLarty, former chief of staff to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   McLarty said that other high officials, unlike the president,
are eligible for congressionally approved cost-of-living increases
but that those increases were becoming minimal out of fear that the
pay of some officials would overtake the president's. For instance,
the vice president, the chief justice of the United States and the
speaker of the House make $175,400.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress does not act on a presidential raise in 1999, it may
be even less likely to do so in 2000, since the pay of public
officials is a sensitive issue to take up in an election year. If
nothing is done before noon on Jan. 20, 2001, the next president
will not get a raise.
</P>
<P>
   Five Republican candidates, former Vice President Dan Quayle,
Elizabeth Dole, Pat Buchanan, Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire
and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, declined comment on whether the next
person in the White House should be paid more.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a safe bet that they agree with Bush and Alexander on
one point. ``He'd take the job either way,'' Ms. Tucker said of
Bush.

   ATLANTA _ Crack! goes the metal folding chair across the broad
shoulders of a professional wrestler, and Roar! goes the bear
mauling a man on a Fox special, andThwack! goes the boot of
``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' into the chest of a bad guy, and
``Jer-ry!'' goes the adoring audience on ``The Jerry Springer
Show,'' and Ka-ching! goes the jury that hit up ``The Jenny Jones
Show'' for $25 million and Click! goes the remote control of the
viewer at home, riding the adrenaline rush of Extreme TV.
</P>
<P>
   Flip around and see: Television has never been such a toxic stew
of aggression, ugliness and mayhem. Click some more, and be aware
that the really big shows _ the Nielsen Top 30 in network prime
time _ are more violence-free than they've ever been. The most
popular shows have been touched by an angel, while the fringes seem
to have been besmirched by the devil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more violence out there because there's more
television out there,'' sums up Robert Lichter, executive director
of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan TV
watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, of all the reasons for the explosion of Extreme TV in
the late '90s, the expansion of television itself is the most
important. Cable TV continues on a ratings rocket, three smaller
broadcast networks are challenging the former Big Three, and some
of the biggest money to be made is in first-run syndication, home
of ``Springer,'' ``Jenny Jones'' and others.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is what Lichter calls ``testosterone poisoning.
This is what happens when you cater to the tastes of chronological
and emotional teenaged males.''
</P>
<P>
   Television long ago figured out how to cater to kids, older
people and particularly women, says John Rash, a TV ad buyer for ad
agency Campbell Mithun Esty. But getting males who are just
developing their spending habits (aged 12 to 34, according to
advertisers' conventional wisdom) was tough, outside of televised
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger males watch significantly less TV than females, so the
value of young males increased in the marketplace,'' Rash adds.
``Programs are being built to win this elusive audience's hearts
and minds and wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, because television has become so sprawling and so
fragmented, it's harder than ever to say there are clear trends.
There's more Extreme TV, but these days there's also a counter
swing, toward more responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   A quick Extreme TV checklist:
</P>
<P>
   _ Professional wrestling is more popular than ever. Driven by
USA Network's ``WWF Raw'' and Ted Turner's ``WCW Nitro,''
professional wrestling has moved way beyond the old days of baggy
trunks and body slams. A recent study by an Indiana University
professor found that out of every two hours of World Wrestling
Federation (WWF) programming, an average of only 36 minutes was
given to actual grappling, and the remainder to shouting
obscenities, crotch-grabbing and elaborate theatrics. And this
fall, UPN Network will add two prime-time hours of WWF on Thursday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fox's victim verite specials _ ``When Animals Attack,''
``Train Wrecks!'' _ are sweeps month staples and rack up impressive
ratings. A recent ``World's Scariest Police Chases,'' for example,
drew almost 13 million viewers, more than that week's ``Simpsons''
or ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Roller derby, off TV for 25 years, has returned on The
Nashville Network, re-christened ``Roller Jam'' and glitzed up like
professional wrestling. Elbows fly, bodies crash to the floor, and
ratings are up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even documentary-laden The Learning Channel tried to join the
fray last week, hyping a show on emergency rooms as an ``Adrenaline
Rush Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's also evidence of an Extreme TV backlash, from within
and outside the industry:
</P>
<P>
   _ The company that makes ``The Jerry Springer Show'' announced
last week it would edit out the show's infamous fights. The show
made the exact same pledge a year ago, but when ratings went down,
they restored and even promoted the brawls. In May sweeps this
year, with the fights, ``Springer'' was drawing 6.6 million viewers
nationally, a very healthy number for a syndicated show.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reality TV shows like ``Cops'' may be tamed by the Supreme
Court's decision last week that police violate people's rights when
they bring TV crews and journalists into private homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The WB postponed the season finale of ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'' because it contained fantasy violence at a high school;
the WB felt that was inappropriate after the shootings in
Littleton, Colo., and Rockdale County.
</P>
<P>
   _ CBS took a violent Mafia drama, ``Falcone,'' off its fall
schedule. ``This wasn't the right time to have people getting
whacked on the streets of New York,'' CBS president Leslie Moonves
told advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme TV has its defenders, but they tend to be more
half-hearted than those who attack it. ``You don't necessarily want
to rely on that stuff for the long term,'' says Doug Herzog, Fox's
entertainment president. ``You could probably say maybe we've been
doing a bit too much of that lately. But there is a place for it, I
do believe, on Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an identity crisis in the industry itself,'' says
Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for the
Study of Popular Television. ``The left hand is doing one thing and
the right hand is doing another.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV industry seems willing to _ and perhaps must _ try
anything to attract viewers, an increasingly difficult task.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average home now receives more than 50 channels,'' says
Rash. ``Now programming appeals to specific audiences, from MTV to
the Food Network. Because of audience fragmentation, the measure of
success has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning: You used to have to get 20 million or 30 million
viewers to be a success in TV. With fragmentation, particularly if
you dwell in the fringes of cable and syndication, you can be a
success with 5 million, or even fewer if they're the right viewers
for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, television has always been about tapping viewers'
wallets. But overall community standards have changed, Thompson
says. In addition, a voluntary broadcasters' code was jettisoned in
the early '80s, and the networks down-sized their Standards and
Practices departments (censors) in economic cutbacks in the late
'80s and early '90s. All of that helped feed the anything-goes
atmosphere of Extreme TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've established the economic logic, it's just a matter
of seeing how far down you can go,'' Lichter says.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Extreme TV, the further down you go, the more
the ratings rise. ``WWF Raw'' is considered much nastier than ``WCW
Nitro,'' and when the two go head-to-head on Monday nights, ``Raw''
slams ``Nitro,'' 4.3 million homes to 3.3 million homes. Fox's
``World's Scariest'' specials virtually always out-peform the tamer
series they pre-empt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sit with their remote controls, thumb poised, and
anything that makes their attention go away for a minute makes them
flip,'' Thompson says. ``You're flipping through and you see a
train wreck and it's arresting. A long, drawn-out dramatic scene
doesn't have that impact.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all about arousal, says Paul Klite, executive director of
Rocky Mountain Media Watch, an advocacy group that monitors local
TV news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence attracts people's attention and produces a strong
emotional reaction that advertisers covet,'' Klite says.
``Marketers call it arousal. ... Arousal helps move merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   Extreme TV has even spilled over into news, particularly local
TV news and the network newsmagazines. Barry Glassner is the author
of ``The Culture of Fear'' (Basic Books, $25), a new book that
looks at the media's over-hyping of stories that push viewers' hot
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start watching the screamer shows in the afternoon,
then the local news, then the extreme shows, then a newsmagazine or
two, then the local news again, you're pretty much guaranteed to
have nightmares,'' says Glassner. ``It's a shortcoming of the
people who put together local TV news that they can't tell a story
without extreme violence and fear-mongering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent topics consistently comprise 40 to 50 percent of all
the air-time devoted to (local) news,'' Klite says. ``Crime rates
are down across the U.S., but not on local TV news. Murder, one of
the least common crimes committed, is the No. 1 topic on
newscasts.''
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that Extreme TV is here, it's big, and it's ugly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to go away in the future,'' says
Thompson of the Center for the Study of Popular Television. ``Like
it or not, there's something about watching a real car chase that's
exciting, an adrenaline charge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actions have eventual reactions,'' counters ad buyer Rash.
``There's already a hue and cry about the media role in the recent
incidents in high schools. The subsequent decade could be a
reaction to the cultural excesses of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we'll look in the mirror and decide to become more class
than crass.

 &HT;    Wrestling rivals no-holds barred battle means violence, sex _
and now death
 &HT;    Packages with: RIVALS -TIMELINE and EXTREME-TV
 &HT;    With: 1-column chart
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott and Harry Thomas
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The battle between the two major wrestling leagues, Time
Warner's World Championship Wrestling and Vince McMahon's World
Wrestling Federation, may not have killed wrestler Owen Hart, as
his family claims, but it has shaped the ``sport'' to become, in
many ways, the sport of the '90s: An unruly, high-hokum,
high-ratings hybrid of athletics and entertainment, sex and
violence, melodrama, good, bad, evil _ and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   From its humble beginnings, with overweight men sweating and
grunting in shorts too tight, professional wrestling has attained
the tawdry gloss of a slickly produced TV soap opera with the box
office appeal of a Schwarzenegger film.
</P>
<P>
   It's a billion-dollar industry. And two titans of pop culture
are divvying it up, pitting in the ring two of the more daring
pioneers of cable programming.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Vice Chairman Ted Turner is the entrepreneur who was
cable before cable was cool. And McMahon is the wrestling
impresario who made gross grossly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Turner came to wrestling from TV; it was a mainstay on his
flagship WTBS, and that led to his purchasing what's now the WCW in
1988. McMahon came to wrestling through his father, also a
promoter, and blazed the trail of glitzy, overwrought events into
America's living rooms as the WWF's leader and the producer of
NBC's ``Saturday Night's Main Event'' from 1985 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon has characterized his role this way: ``My job is to
entertain the masses at whatever level they want.'' And for more
than a decade, McMahon ruled the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the mid-90s, WCW raided WWF for some of its marquee
talent (Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash) with the allure of
million-dollar contracts. WCW's TV ratings ``began to skyrocket,''
says Bill Apter, editor-in-chief of World of Wrestling magazine.
For 83 weeks straight, WCW won the war for America's living room.
</P>
<P>
   WCW's growth didn't bankrupt the WWF, however. Instead,
wrestling's rising tide of popularity, caused in part by the hoopla
over the rivalry, lifted both federations. Last year the
Atlanta-based WCW and the Connecticut-based WWF each turned at
least $500 million in revenues, according to Journal-Constitution
research. The weekly audience for the federations' 15 hours of
programming is estimated at 35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, McMahon chafed at Turner's talent raid as he watched
WCW become the premier wrestling federation, and he decided to
settle the battle in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (WWF) had to do something,'' Apter says. ``Nothing made
their ratings rise until they tried some of the borderline stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``borderline stuff,'' meant ratcheting up the violence. In
``hard-core'' matches wrestlers beat one another with chairs,
tables _ even forklifts. Sex and theatrics (such as crucifixion)
became central to the scripted story lines in and out of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   After WWF's Hart fell to his death from a cable last week, his
family claimed that the federation's desperation for extreme stunts
was to blame. Others, however, have pointed out that hanging by a
cable is not so extreme _ a staple of Broadway shows and circuses,
and something other wrestlers have done without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   With its new approach, WWF caught and passed WCW in the ratings
about a year ago. Today, Apter contends, the gap between the WCW
and the WWF televised matches is so wide ``it's like comparing a
classy kids show to Jerry Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   WCW president Eric Bischoff says his federation will continue to
be the class act, despite the WWF's recent successes.
</P>
<P>
   WCW bases some of its strategy on a report it commissioned, by a
Northwestern University professor of marketing and cultural
anthropology, to figure out the appeal of wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he told us is that wrestling is for young males what soap
operas are for women,'' says Joe Uva, TBS President of
Entertainment Sales and Marketing. ``The need for heroes, conflict
resolution, action and adventure vicariously through television.''
</P>
<P>
   Bischoff, displaying the bluster that once prompted him to
challenge McMahon to a grudge match, predicts McMahon's antics will
eventually undo him: ``He's going to self-destruct, although he has
lasted a lot longer than I would have expected. He's a TV version
of a cockroach. Just when you think you've got the problem licked,
it comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bischoff says WCW won't waver from its ``family oriented''
standards, and there are provisions in place to keep its wrestlers
in check _ including fines. The network uses a seven-second delay
during cablecasts in case a WCW wrestler, in the heat of a match,
gets carried away.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF declined to comment on the rivalry, citing a mourning
period for Hart.
</P>
<P>
   At least one advertiser _ Wrigley's _ says that because of
risque programming it isn't renewing its advertising contract on
WWF. And there are indications of a wider backlash against
professional wrestling, generally.
</P>
<P>
   Boston pediatrician Dr. Howard Spivak, chairman of the American
Academy of Pediatrics task force on violence, says wrestling is
``totally unfit to be watched by children _ of any age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially dangerous to very young children, because they
can't tell the difference between reality and fantasy,'' he says.
Atlantan Tom Holder shares those concerns. His sons Danny, 7, and
Michael, 4, are big fans.
</P>
<P>
   Danny returned from a week at a YMCA camp and blurted something
about oral sex, Holder says. ``I thought 'Whoa, where did he hear
that?''' It turns out Danny was repeating an oft-used WWF
buzzphrase.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Wrestling rivals no-holds barred battle means violence, sex _
and now death
 &HT;    Packages with: RIVALS -TIMELINE and EXTREME-TV
 &HT;    With: 1-column chart
 &HT;

<P>
   The battle between the two major wrestling leagues, Time
Warner's World Championship Wrestling and Vince McMahon's World
Wrestling Federation, may not have killed wrestler Owen Hart, as
his family claims, but it has shaped the ``sport'' to become, in
many ways, the sport of the '90s: An unruly, high-hokum,
high-ratings hybrid of athletics and entertainment, sex and
violence, melodrama, good, bad, evil _ and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   From its humble beginnings, with overweight men sweating and
grunting in shorts too tight, professional wrestling has attained
the tawdry gloss of a slickly produced TV soap opera with the box
office appeal of a Schwarzenegger film.
</P>
<P>
   It's a billion-dollar industry. And two titans of pop culture
are divvying it up, pitting in the ring two of the more daring
pioneers of cable programming.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner Vice Chairman Ted Turner is the entrepreneur who was
cable before cable was cool. And McMahon is the wrestling
impresario who made gross grossly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Turner came to wrestling from TV; it was a mainstay on his
flagship WTBS, and that led to his purchasing what's now the WCW in
1988. McMahon came to wrestling through his father, also a
promoter, and blazed the trail of glitzy, overwrought events into
America's living rooms as the WWF's leader and the producer of
NBC's ``Saturday Night's Main Event'' from 1985 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon has characterized his role this way: ``My job is to
entertain the masses at whatever level they want.'' And for more
than a decade, McMahon ruled the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the mid-90s, WCW raided WWF for some of its marquee
talent (Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash) with the allure of
million-dollar contracts. WCW's TV ratings ``began to skyrocket,''
says Bill Apter, editor-in-chief of World of Wrestling magazine.
For 83 weeks straight, WCW won the war for America's living room.
</P>
<P>
   WCW's growth didn't bankrupt the WWF, however. Instead,
wrestling's rising tide of popularity, caused in part by the hoopla
over the rivalry, lifted both federations. Last year the
Atlanta-based WCW and the Connecticut-based WWF each turned at
least $500 million in revenues, according to Journal-Constitution
research. The weekly audience for the federations' 15 hours of
programming is estimated at 35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, McMahon chafed at Turner's talent raid as he watched
WCW become the premier wrestling federation, and he decided to
settle the battle in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (WWF) had to do something,'' Apter says. ``Nothing made
their ratings rise until they tried some of the borderline stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``borderline stuff,'' meant ratcheting up the violence. In
``hard-core'' matches wrestlers beat one another with chairs,
tables _ even forklifts. Sex and theatrics (such as crucifixion)
became central to the scripted story lines in and out of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   After WWF's Hart fell to his death from a cable last week, his
family claimed that the federation's desperation for extreme stunts
was to blame. Others, however, have pointed out that hanging by a
cable is not so extreme _ a staple of Broadway shows and circuses,
and something other wrestlers have done without a problem.
</P>
<P>
   With its new approach, WWF caught and passed WCW in the ratings
about a year ago. Today, Apter contends, the gap between the WCW
and the WWF televised matches is so wide ``it's like comparing a
classy kids show to Jerry Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   WCW president Eric Bischoff says his federation will continue to
be the class act, despite the WWF's recent successes.
</P>
<P>
   WCW bases some of its strategy on a report it commissioned, by a
Northwestern University professor of marketing and cultural
anthropology, to figure out the appeal of wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he told us is that wrestling is for young males what soap
operas are for women,'' says Joe Uva, TBS President of
Entertainment Sales and Marketing. ``The need for heroes, conflict
resolution, action and adventure vicariously through television.''
</P>
<P>
   Bischoff, displaying the bluster that once prompted him to
challenge McMahon to a grudge match, predicts McMahon's antics will
eventually undo him: ``He's going to self-destruct, although he has
lasted a lot longer than I would have expected. He's a TV version
of a cockroach. Just when you think you've got the problem licked,
it comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bischoff says WCW won't waver from its ``family oriented''
standards, and there are provisions in place to keep its wrestlers
in check _ including fines. The network uses a seven-second delay
during cablecasts in case a WCW wrestler, in the heat of a match,
gets carried away.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF declined to comment on the rivalry, citing a mourning
period for Hart.
</P>
<P>
   At least one advertiser _ Wrigley's _ says that because of
risque programming it isn't renewing its advertising contract on
WWF. And there are indications of a wider backlash against
professional wrestling, generally.
</P>
<P>
   Boston pediatrician Dr. Howard Spivak, chairman of the American
Academy of Pediatrics task force on violence, says wrestling is
``totally unfit to be watched by children _ of any age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially dangerous to very young children, because they
can't tell the difference between reality and fantasy,'' he says.
Atlantan Tom Holder shares those concerns. His sons Danny, 7, and
Michael, 4, are big fans.
</P>
<P>
   Danny returned from a week at a YMCA camp and blurted something
about oral sex, Holder says. ``I thought 'Whoa, where did he hear
that?''' It turns out Danny was repeating an oft-used WWF
buzzphrase.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the moment, putting a submission hold on this
billion-dollar business of men in shorts will be difficult.
Advertisers see it as a main vehicle for reaching young males, ages
12 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the only way to reach that group that doesn't watch
a lot of TV,'' says Keith Wachtel, a buyer with Zenith Media
Services in New York. ``Almost every other sport skews too old.''

Yes. But it will take something different, another type of

BAN ON FLAG BURNING: IT'S TIME AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Ill., Ohio, N.Y., N.C., N.D., Utah)  (lb) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of these days _ not on Flag Day, June 14, and
not even by the Fourth of July, but probably sometime this year _
Republicans in the Senate will bring up a proposed constitutional
amendment that would permit laws banning flag-burning.
</P>
<P>
   Every nose has been counted, and the outcome is known in
advance. The amendment will fail, most likely by two votes, to get
the necessary two-thirds majority, just as it has been rejected
every other time it has come up since the Supreme Court ruled in
1989 that laws prohibiting flag-burning are unconstitutional
infringements on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   But the amendment's certain defeat and the fact that
flag-burning is rarely in the news nowadays have not lessened the
passion on both sides of the issue. Nor have they diminished the
delight of the sponsors, mostly Republicans, as they watch the
opponents, mostly Democrats, squirm when they speak and vote
against a measure that polls show has the support of about 80
percent of the public.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments on both sides are familiar. At a Judiciary
Committee hearing last month, Sen. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., made
the case in favor of the amendment. With an array of flags on
display _ one that was carried by the Rainbow Division in World War
I, one made by a prisoner of war in World War II, one carried by
U.S. troops that liberated Kuwait _ Smith called flag-burning ``an
act of violence against the symbol of America _ our flag'' and also
``an act of violence against our country's values and principles.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said that the
amendment would violate one of the basic rights that the flag
represents, the right of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we prohibit people from criticizing the government by
burning a flag,'' Leahy asked, ``why not stop them from burning a
cross, or a Bible, or a copy of the Constitution? Why not prohibit
other forms of political expression?''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment, only 17 words long, would be one of the
shortest and simplest in the Constitution. It states, ``The
Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of
the flag of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate approval is the only obstacle in the way of its becoming
the 28th Amendment. In 1997, the proposal was approved by the House
of Representatives by a vote of 310-114, much more than a
two-thirds majority, and a similar vote can be expected this year.
An amendment must also be adopted by the legislatures of
three-quarters of the states, but 49 states _ all but Vermont _
have in one way or another expressed support.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Senate voted on the amendment, in 1995, the
margin in favor was 63-36, or three votes short of a two-thirds
majority. There was one vacancy in the Senate at the time. Last
year a head count showed that the measure was still three votes
shy, and no vote was taken.
</P>
<P>
   In November, three new senators who favor the amendment were
elected to replace senators who had voted against it. The new
supporters are Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, a Democrat, and Peter
Fitzgerald of Illinois and George Voinovich of Ohio, both
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But two opponents of the amendment, Charles Schumer of New York
and John Edwards of North Carolina, both Democrats, defeated
senators who had voted in favor of it. So the proponents gained a
net of one vote and needed two more.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it looked as if the two Democratic senators from
North Dakota, Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan, who have been heavily
lobbied by veterans and who have spoken out about their disgust at
flag-burning, might change their votes and favor the measure. But
last month they announced they would not do so.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of emotion,'' Dorgan said in an interview,
``when a veteran comes to me and says, `I was lying on Omaha Beach
with dead buddies all around me, and in the first light of day, I
saw the flag, and it meant the world to me.' That's what makes it a
very difficult thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Constitution is a marvelous document, and this doesn't
rise to the extraordinary level required to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Dakota senators and several other opponents of the
amendment are sponsoring an ordinary bill that would outlaw
flag-burning if it was intended to incite violence. They believe
this would be constitutionally acceptable under the Supreme Court's
doctrine that ``fighting words'' are not protected by the
free-speech clause.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, the bill offers some political cover, but
other senators and many legal scholars are not so sure the Supreme
Court would allow it to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, the chief sponsor of the
constitutional amendment, said Republican leaders had promised him
a vote this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the eyes of the veterans' groups,'' Hatch said, ``it's
important to have a vote to get on the record who's with them and
who's against them.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he was under no illusion he could win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the two North Dakota senators stayed off the
reservation,'' Hatch said, ``that made it very problematic for our
side.''

YELTSIN URGED TO FREE RUSSIA FROM `PUPPET MASTERS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Yegor Gaidar, a former prime minister who began
Russia's economic reforms in 1992, appealed urgently to President
Boris Yeltsin on Saturday to stop the ``puppet masters'' who Gaidar
and several political analysts say are manipulating the country's
10-day-old government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be impossible to gain confidence in democracy in
Russia, if it becomes clear to all that the government is not
governing anything, that the puppet masters behind it are guiding
and manipulating the government as if it were a puppet,'' Gaidar
said at the opening congress of a new liberal party called the
Right Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Gaidar's call came one day after a top Cabinet minister's abrupt
resignation, which has threatened to unravel the government of
prime minister Sergei Stepashin, nominated by Yeltsin on May 12 to
replace Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of former Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, a
respected financial expert, has seriously undercut Stepashin's
authority, and signaled the tightening grip of a small group of
insiders and financiers on the Kremlin, and through it, on the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin had backed Zadornov's appointment as one of his two
top deputies in an attempt to counterbalance the growing influence
of Nikolai Aksyonenko, a former railways minister who is seen as
the agent of a clique lead by Boris Berezovsky and his onetime
business partner Roman Abramovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surrender,'' read the headline Saturday in the business
newspaper Kommersant, accompanied by the clarification, ``Yeltsin
is not president, Stepashin is not prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Even by Russian standards, which long ago were stretched to
accommodate widespread corruption and malfeasance in government,
the blatant and seemingly venal struggle over the Stepashin Cabinet
is disturbing. In particular, political observers are shocked by
the fight over appointments to such traditionally lucrative posts
as the head of the pension fund, the customs committee and the
giant government arms-trading agency.
</P>
<P>
   On its evening news program Friday night, a reporter for NTV,
Russia's largest private TV channel, warned of an attempt to
``privatize the government.'' Mikhail Berger, editor of the daily
Sevodnya, wrote in a front-page commentary Saturday that ``the
small Politburo that has taken shape inside the Kremlin has
practically no limits and most importantly is absolutely
indifferent to all that is said and thought about its actions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's not a problem,'' Berger added, ``it's a real
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Aksyonenko, who had publicly challenged Zadornov's authority to
conduct Russia's macroeconomic policy, calmly disputed such
alarmist reports. ``I don't feel any crisis,'' he told reporters.
``The crisis exists only in your talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaidar urged Yeltsin Saturday to step in and protect not only
his chosen prime minister but also his legacy as Russia's first
democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The developments of the past few days are discrediting Russian
democracy in the world,'' Gaidar said, ``and what is even more
dangerous, they are discrediting Russian democracy inside Russia.
We have paid too high a price for democracy to carelessly dissipate
trust in democratic institutions.''

BLACK GROUPS IN FLORIDA SPLIT OVER SCHOOL VOUCHER PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Exposing the sharp debate over school vouchers
among black people, two long-time allies from the civil rights
struggle in Florida find themselves on opposite sides on whether
the state should help pay for some children to attend private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, passed last month by the Florida Legislature and
awaiting the expected signature of Gov. Jeb Bush, would permit
pupils from the lowest-rated public schools in the state to attend
private schools, including religious ones, with vouchers paid by
taxpayers' money. Florida would become the first state to have a
statewide school voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
and several other liberal groups have vowed to sue to block the
voucher plan, contending that it would reduce support for public
education and violate the constitutional separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Urban League of Greater Miami, breaking with
its national headquarters, supports the voucher plan, and has
retained a Washington law firm to intervene in court on the state's
side in defense of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that healthy?'' T. Willard Fair, president of the Miami
Urban League, said, referring to the differences of opinions among
civil rights leaders. ``It shows that we are now getting to the
point where we can behave like human beings. We can like and
dislike. We can select and reject. We are not bound by color the
way we used to be bound where people said, `You can't think that
way because you're black.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent civil rights leaders and organizations, including
the National Urban League and its president, Hugh Price, remain
firmly opposed to school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's New York headquarters issued a statement in
the name of Price, who was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Urban League of Greater Miami affiliate must do what it
feels is best for the communities it serves,'' the statement said,
``and the National Urban League will continue to do what we feel is
best for our constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the NAACP, which insists that its local chapters hew to a
policy line worked out at its convention or by its board, the
National Urban League is much more decentralized. Local affiliates
have their own boards, raise most of their own money and can take
independent positions.
</P>
<P>
   While describing Fair as ``one of the most successful Urban
League directors in the country,'' Leon Russell, president of the
Florida Conference of NAACP Chapters, sharply disagreed with his
stand on school vouchers. Russell and other critics assert that
vouchers would damage the public schools by siphoning off the best
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be correct in terms of wanting to do something to
improve public education,'' Russell said. ``But I think his concept
of how to do it is all wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The split between the two civil rights groups in Florida mirrors
the divisions among black people over the voucher issue. While
liberal civil rights groups generally oppose school vouchers, polls
show that many low-income African-Americans, especially those with
children in poor-performing public schools, support the concept.
Conversely, more affluent and college educated black people are
much more wary of such programs.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 survey by the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a research organization specializing in issues involving
black people, found that 48.1 percent of African-Americans favored
allowing state money to be used for private school tuition while
39.8 percent opposed it. The poll also indicated that whites oppose
such vouchers by a margin of 50.2 percent to 41.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fair of the Miami Urban League is a strong ally of Bush's and,
like the Republican governor, an enthusiastic advocate of using
changes in education policy to put pressure on public schools to
improve, for example, the vouchers plan and charter schools, which
are public schools licensed by local school boards to pursue
innovative teaching methods. In 1996, Fair and Bush founded the
Liberty City Charter School in a poor black neighborhood in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we plan to make the system do things it's never done
before,'' Fair said, ``we have to be prepared to do things that
we've never done before.''
</P>
<P>
   The voucher program, if signed by Bush, is expected to go into
effect in September. The plan calls for all public schools to be
graded A through F, based on statewide standardized test scores,
attendance, disciplinary actions taken against students and
graduation rates. All pupils in public schools that received a
grade of F in two out of four years would be eligible to receive a
voucher worth about $4,000 to pay tuition at private schools.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fair's group has also angered some liberal civil rights groups
by retaining the Institute for Justice, a conservative legal
foundation, to represent it in any litigation involving the Florida
school voucher program. The institute has been an outspoken critic
of affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Bolick, the institute's director of litigation, said he
approached Fair's group two weeks ago and persuaded it to join in
the defense of the school voucher program if the NAACP carried
through its threat to file suit. Bolick said he wanted to ensure
that any judge hearing the case did not have the impression that
black opinion was ``monolithic'' when it came to school vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the first name you see on a lawsuit is the NAACP,'' he
said, ``that unquestionably creates an impression that the black
community is on one side of that lawsuit. That image in this case
would be demonstrably false. Having the Urban League on the other
side evens the equation.''

NEW DETAILS EMERGE ABOUT CANADIAN TEEN-AGER'S MURDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Once, the polite and courtly city
of Victoria was known principally as a choice destination for
honeymooners and retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Then in November 1997 a 14-year-old social outcast named Reena
Virk was burned, beaten and drowned in a frenzy of teen-age rage.
</P>
<P>
   Six girls were convicted of assault charges, but publication of
details was banned under Canada's young-offender laws.
</P>
<P>
   Now the gruesome facts are emerging as charges of second-degree
murder against Warren Paul Glowatski, 18, and Kelly Ellard, 16, are
pursued publicly in adult courts. Victoria's youth culture is once
again under scrutiny, particularly in light of the fatal school
shootings in Littleton, Colo., and in the Alberta city of Taber,
which also concentrated media attention on bullying.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict in Glowatski's trial is expected in early June. Ms.
Ellard is scheduled to be tried in November.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Virk's killing was reported throughout North America and
Europe. Britain's GQ magazine published a feature story on the
victim and the ways of teen-agers in the city on the southern tip
of Vancouver Island. A teen drama, ``The Short Life and Lonely
Death of Reena Virk,'' written by two British Columbian teen-agers,
is performed in schools and at public events.
</P>
<P>
   Her death has become a catalyst in British Columbia for programs
and conferences about youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the case created a stir because people are shocked
when girls kill. ``We still have this unfounded belief that females
are incapable of violence,'' said Dr. Sibylle Artz, director of the
School of Child and Youth Care at the University of Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in Glowatski's trial suggests that on the night Ms.
Virk died, girls posing as friends lured her to a park near the
Gorge Inlet. There, watched by as many as 50 other teen-agers, one
girl accused Ms. Virk of trying to steal a boyfriend, and six to
eight of them, ages 14 to 16, swarmed around her.
</P>
<P>
   Using a cigarette, someone burned Ms. Virk, whose ancestry was
East Indian, in the middle of her forehead; another tried to set
her hair on fire. She was kicked, punched and scratched until she
eventually stumbled away, dazed and bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Glowatski and Ms. Ellard followed, beat
her again and then drowned her in the Gorge.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cause of death was drowning, Ms. Virk's brain
injuries were so severe that she could have died from them, a
forensic pathologist, Laurel Gray, testified at Glowatski's trial.
</P>
<P>
   No one reported the attack. The police responded to school
rumors about a dead girl and, more than a week later, found Ms.
Virk's body floating in the cold water of the Gorge, naked except
for a bra and a shirt up around her neck.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although Ms. Virk and some of her assailants knew each other
from group and foster homes in which they had lived, others,
including Glowatski, had never met her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Virk was unpopular, according to her peers. In a rebellion
against her parents _ Jehovah's Witnesses who refused to let her
smoke and objected to teen-age sex _ she once told child-welfare
officials that she had been beaten and sexually assaulted at home
(she later recanted her allegations), so she could live in
relatively unsupervised group and foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday that Ms. Virk was killed, she told her parents
that she would return for the night. When she did not show up, they
assumed she had gone to her foster home.

NORTH KOREA UNRESPONSIVE IN TALKS, U.S. ENVOY REPORTS
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Former Defense Secretary William Perry said Saturday
that during his just-completed trip to North Korea, he had
``clearly and firmly'' expressed concern about North Korean
military programs, but that he did not get any definitive response.
</P>
<P>
   Perry spoke in Seoul, South Korea, after concluding a four-day
visit to North Korea, where he apparently outlined a Clinton
administration proposal to offer North Korea a major expansion of
economic and diplomatic ties in exchange for the North curbing its
nuclear and missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   If accepted, the arrangement could eventually lead to a
far-reaching relaxation of tensions in northeast Asia, but there is
widespread skepticism that the deal will work smoothly, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   One inauspicious sign was that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong
Il, declined to meet with Perry, despite American hopes for such a
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Kim almost never meets foreigners, so it was not a great
surprise, but it reflected a lost opportunity to signal a new start
in relations.
</P>
<P>
   Perry did pass on to North Korean officials a message to Kim
from President Clinton, as well as from South Korean and Japanese
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Although former President Carter visited North Korea in 1994 on
his own, Perry as a presidential envoy was heading the
highest-ranking delegation to North Korea since the Korean War, yet
his North Korean counterparts were mostly at the vice minister
level.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said in Seoul that he had spoken to officials close to Kim
and had tried to convey to them ``clearly and firmly U.S. and
allied views and concerns,'' The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   But he said ``it will take some time'' for each side to reflect
on the visit and decide what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   From Seoul, Perry flies back to Washington to brief Clinton and
to put the finishing touches on his review of policy toward North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the review is to achieve a more bipartisan policy,
with backing from Congress, dealing more consistently with North
Korea and seeking a way out of the existing stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   One underlying problem in achieving any breakthrough in
relations is the deep distrust with which each side views the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans, including a number in Congress, see North Korea
as a Communist menace that does not keep its bargains and is
starving its own population, yet has somehow become the largest
recipient of American aid in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   North Koreans argue, however, that they have kept their side of
the landmark 1994 agreement to improve relations, and that it is
the United States that has backed out of its promises to lift
economic sanctions and normalize ties.

HOFFA FACES HIS FIRST BIG TEST AS TEAMSTERS' PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Va.)  (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a Monday night strike deadline, James P. Hoffa is facing
his first big test as teamsters president in seeking to secure
higher wages and pensions and beat back concessions for 12,200
drivers who haul new cars to dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Having assumed the union's presidency in March, Hoffa has
promised the nation's unionized car haulers their best contract
ever. And they are looking to him to show the same bargaining
prowess for which his father, James R. Hoffa, was famous when he
headed the International Brotherhood of Teamsters three decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his first major contract, and I'm sure he will be judged
significantly by that,'' said Michael Belzer, a professor of
industrial relations at the University of Michigan. ``He seems to
be taking it at that level. It certainly is going to be a measuring
stick, and unfortunately that makes it rather difficult to
negotiate this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a year when auto sales are booming, the threat of a strike is
worrying the Big Three automakers because a walkout that lasts even
a week or two could cause shortages of the hottest-selling cars.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the union and management acknowledge that
negotiations have been difficult. The teamsters are demanding
stronger job security, higher wages and a better pension for
drivers with 25 years of experience. Negotiators for 17 unionized
car-hauling companies are demanding a lower starting wage for new
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   As the two sides negotiate in Arlington, Va., union officials
are talking tough, insisting they are serious about striking, while
noting that 96 percent of the drivers who voted favored a strike if
talks broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car-haul companies are making record profits, they're
making record deliveries, and in spite of that, they are demanding
concessions,'' said Chip Roth, a union spokesman. ``The members are
united behind Jim Hoffa on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's four-year contract expires at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday,
and both sides say it is possible the talks could be extended
without a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Hunter, executive director of the National Automobile
Transporters Labor Division, which bargains for the car-haul
industry, said the companies ``fully expect to meet the teamsters'
reasonable expectations to improve their health plans, pensions and
wages.'' But he added, ``We have to get some win-win approach to
preserve the work we have.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the number of unionized car haulers had fallen to 12,200
from 14,100 since 1994, while the number of miles driven by
unionized haulers had dropped 23 percent since then. The cause, he
said, was lower-cost nonunion truckers and railroads that have
greatly increased the share of cars they transport from factories.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said a starting wage 25 percent below the standard wage,
rising to the standard level in three years, would make the
unionized industry more competitive and help keep it from losing
work to railroads and nonunion drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said unionized car haulers averaged $68,000 in wages and
benefits last year; the union said they averaged $55,000 before
benefits. Union officials say the drivers often work far more than
40 hours a week and have a dangerous job, often risking falls when
they climb on the trucks to load and unload cars in the snow and
sleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make good pay, but they're often away from their family
six and seven days a week,'' Roth said. ``And this is the most
dangerous job in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to car haulers last week, Hoffa promised he
would not return from the negotiations without a significant
increase in pensions. He also insisted that a two-tier wage system
was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   With the North American Free Trade Agreement expected to allow
more Mexican trucks into the United States, Hoffa also said he
wanted job-security language to protect teamster car haulers from
losing work to Mexican truckers. &QL;

A `BUSH' WEB SITE, WOVEN FROM MISCHIEF  
 ATTACKING ATTACK ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Texas, Ore., Calif.)  mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every major presidential hopeful has an Internet site that
voters, journalists and the just-plain-curious can visit for
biographical information, campaign schedules, speech texts and the
like. Some have several sites. It's the way the political game is
played on the cusp of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But there is mischief afoot on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   It costs only $70 and imagination enough to come up with an
unclaimed Internet address to establish a Web site. More to the
point, anybody can set one up as long as nobody else has laid claim
to the particular combination of words and letters used for the
address.
</P>
<P>
   Thus www.gwbush.com does not necessarily have to be the official
Web address of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The real George W. Bush site is www.georgewbush.com.
</P>
<P>
   So what is www.gwbush.com?
</P>
<P>
   A click of the mouse reveals what appears to be an official Bush
campaign site, one patriotically tinged in red, white and blue and
filled with thoughtful thoughts from a man running ``a campaign
with compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   But on closer inspection, it turns out that www.gwbush.com is a
comedic, caustic, cajoling anti-Bush site, the creation of one Zack
Exley of Somerville, Mass. An ``Amnesty 2000'' proposal posted on
the site turns out not to be an imaginative new approach to law and
order but ``a bold new policy initiative to free all `grown-ups'
from prison.'' The ``life experiences'' that shaped the governor
and merit his election are said to include ``his rambunctious youth
in which he doesn't deny there was use of cocaine and other
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough, says the real George W. Bush, who has never proposed
freedom for all jailed grown-ups and who insists that he did
nothing while growing up that would disqualify him from being
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aware of the site,'' he said the other day when asked
about www.gwbush.com and Exley. ``This guy is just a garbage man.''
</P>
<P>
   Exley responds that all is fair in politics, especially freedom
of speech, and adds: `Click HERE for an earlier Bush `garbage'
initiative.'
</P>
<P>
   What comes up is a sweeping accusation of shady financial
dealings by the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Bush campaign have filed a complaint about the
site with the Federal Election Commission and have sent a letter to
Exley with this warning:
</P>
<P>
   ``In your wholesale misappropriation of the georgewbush.com Web
site, you violate a host of copyright and trademark laws.''
</P>
<P>
   A campaign spokesman, David Beckwith, said the letter had
resulted in some artistic changes in the Exley site and some
``toning down'' of its material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we scared him off a bit,'' Beckwith said. ``But it's
still a very objectionable site.''
</P>
<P>
   Reborn Campaigner Takes On Gutter Ads
</P>
<P>
   The special election called in Oregon in 1996 when harassment
and ethics charges forced Sen. Bob Packwood to resign was one of
the harshest ever seen on the West Coast. For weeks on end, the two
candidates seeking to succeed the veteran Republican _ Ron Wyden, a
Democrat, and Gordon Smith, a Republican _ went at it with
television attack advertisements, accusing each other, usually
through the voice of an announcer rather than in person, of
dishonesty, ineptitude and whatever else struck them as politically
useful at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   They ended up, a few weeks before Election Day, in a dead heat,
according to the polls. They also ended up, those same polls found,
in deep trouble with voters, with two of every three saying the
campaign had been conducted in the gutter for so long that serious
issues never got discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden had second thoughts. He pulled his negative
advertisements, asked all special interest groups supporting him to
pull theirs, then told voters in a new commercial: ``Unfortunately,
when my opponent began running his negative ads, I responded. It
spiraled out of control. Like many of you, I'm sick of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith grumbled that Wyden was being politically cynical, that
the damage had been done already and that in any event Wyden could
not stop his supporters from continuing to run negative
advertisements. But by then Wyden had grabbed an edge in the race.
</P>
<P>
   He hung on to it to win, and two years later, having completed
the Packwood term, went on to win a full six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wyden says it is time for Congress to pass legislation that
will encourage more candidates to forswear negative television
advertisements. He proposes a significant amendment to the law that
permits every congressional hopeful to buy advertising time at a
station's lowest rate, a law originally meant to encourage campaign
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Wyden wants the law rewritten to require that every time a
candidate's opponent is mentioned in an advertisement, the words
must be spoken by the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to take advantage of this subsidy and you feel the
need to talk about your opponent instead of your own beliefs, have
the courage to say it yourself,'' Wyden said as he dropped his bill
into the hopper the other day. ``Take accountability for your
campaign, or you can't take advantage of the discounted rates. No
more hiding behind grainy photographs and blood-curdling music.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the proposal go anywhere, given that old political saw that
``candidates go negative because negative campaigning works''?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly worth exploring,'' said Trevor Potter, a former
FEC chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Voter Registration at the Last Minute
</P>
<P>
   Only six states permit voters to register on Election Day:
Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The
remaining 44 prohibit such same-day participation, mainly out of
fear of fraud or, in some cases, because political leaders favor
low turnout, figuring it makes races easier to control and predict.
</P>
<P>
   Some election experts calculate that Election Day registration
increases voter participation, on average, by almost 10 percent, a
significant jump given that turnout in the country as a whole has
slipped close to a record low. In Minnesota, election officials say
that 16 percent of the votes that gave Jesse Ventura his surprise
victory in the 1998 governor's race came from people who registered
for the first time on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   That figure made an impression on two California state
legislators, Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg of Sherman Oaks and Sen.
Kevin Murray of Los Angeles, both Democrats. So now they are
pushing legislation that would permit Election Day registration in
California, where voter turnout fell to 41 percent last November,
compared with 64 percent in Minnesota and Maine, 62 percent in
Wyoming, 60 percent in New Hampshire and Wisconsin, and 59 percent
in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The bills have drawn the support of California labor leaders and
several major civic organizations, like People for the American
Way, but they have had mixed legislative success. Murray's proposal
went down to defeat on Thursday in an appropriations committee
vote, but in the Assembly, Hertzberg's was approved and forwarded
to the floor for later consideration.

FAMILIAR FACES ON THE MARCH: GRAF, SELES AND DAVENPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ They don't exactly resemble dowager's row, but Steffi
Graf, Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport have had their rackets
full trying to remain formidable in the face of an invasion by
minimally deferential teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The three women have been smacked around, and off, the hard
courts by teen-agers this year, but here on the slow and staid clay
at the French Open, the old hands have been having their say.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, a five-time Roland Garros champion, Seles, a three-time
champion who was last year's runner-up, and Davenport, the
defending U.S. Open champion, all advanced to the round-of-16
Saturday, joining a select list of their contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the fourth round are the defending champion Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario; Conchita Martinez; Jana Novotna, the 30-year-old
defending champion of Wimbledon; the comebacking Jennifer Capriati
and 27-year-old Mary Joe Fernandez, whose third-round upset of
10th-seeded Serena Williams was an inspiration to the entire bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like we've been written off,'' Graf said after
collecting her 80th victory, a Roland Garros record, with a cursory
6-1, 6-4 dismantling of Sweden's Asa Carlsson. ``We've just been
around so long that the story's gotten a little boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf, 29, became the youngest player ever to win a main draw
match here in 1983, when she qualified at 13 and reached the second
round. Now appearing in her 16th French Open in the last 17 years
(she missed the 1998 French Open because of left knee surgery),
Graf was 17 when she won the first of her 21 Grand Slam titles here
in 1987. Her record as the youngest French Open champion was
eclipsed by Sanchez-Vicario in 1989, a record that held up only
until the following year when Seles, then 16, won the first of
three consecutive titles here.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Seles, seeded third, won her 10th straight match and
improved her 1999 clay-court record to 11-1 with a 6-1, 6-4
pummeling of Maria Antonia Sanchez-Lorenzo, a 52rd-ranked player
who is a clay specialist from Spain. Ever the perfectionist, Seles
was annoyed with herself for not applying the same stultifying
pressure in the second set that she had used in the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a little bit off my balls, and that was enough for her
to start retrieving better,'' Seles said. ``Then I got a little bit
uptight and just started missing a few shots: that will be an area
for my next match that I plan to improve upon.'' Seles then gave
herself a first-week grade of 5 on a scale of 10.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Davenport wasn't quite as charitable with
herself after needing to pull off an excavation job against Fabiola
Zuluaga of Colombia to avoid being upset for the second match in
succession. ``You know, you can't keep sliding along just by barely
winning matches and getting breaks,'' Davenport said. ``I have to
be at a higher level if I want to stay in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, 16-year-old Justine Henin, the 1997 French
Open junior champion from Belgium, served for the match against
Davenport before succumbing to stage fright at 5-4 of the third set
and submitting, 6-3, 2-6, 7-5. Saturday, Davenport had to repair a
5-2 opening set deficit, and save a trio of set points, before
overpowering Zuluaga, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down 3-love in just like six minutes, just getting
killed,'' said Davenport, whose French Open preparation was limited
because of a lingering wrist injury. ``You just have to keep
hanging in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport did, and won the tie-breaker thanks to a net cord that
fell her way and a double fault from Zuluaga at set point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things really went my way on the big points today,'' Davenport
said, ``but you know, when I won the Open last year, every match I
was playing really well and carried the momentum through.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's next opponent, Capriati, is performing at her
highest level in six years, and Saturday she reached her first
Grand Slam round-of-16 since 1993 Wimbledon with a 6-2, 4-0 victory
against Sylvia Farina of Italy, who defaulted with a leg injury
after being pelted with a furious succession of ground-stroke
winners.

 &HT;    Candidate Bush's first obstacle: slaying the expectation dragon
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ As he emerges from the cocoon and morphs into a
full-fledged presidential candidate, Texas Gov. George W. Bush is
about to run head-first into a formidable foe who hasn't raised a
dime, doesn't have a bumper sticker and has been even less specific
on issues than he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations,'' said Bush political adviser Karl Rove, not
missing a beat when asked to name his guy's most challenging
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, proclaimed the front-runner by poll and press, is about to
try to meet those expectations, an effort that has derailed more
than one high-flying politician.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign will go public shortly after the legislative
session is gavelled to an end Monday. Though he won't formally
declare his candidacy until later in the summer, the campaign's de
facto start will come June 12 when he heads to Iowa, home of the
nation's first caucuses of 2000. Then it's off to New Hampshire,
home of the first primaries, and the next week, South Carolina,
Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Though the pent-up demand is great for Bush to begin active
campaigning _ he has taken some direct hits for offering few
details on some issues _ don't look for these first trips to be
heavy on specifics. For Bush, the opening trips will be part first
date, part job interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too premature'' for specific policies, Rove said.
``People say, `Wait a minute. Before you lay out the detail, I want
to get the general principles.'''
</P>
<P>
   That will be disappointing to people like Alida Weergang of
Hudson, N.H., president of the state's Federation of Republican
Women. The organization is expecting 1,000 people at its June 14
Lilac Luncheon in Manchester, N.H. Bush is the long-awaited
featured speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know specifics, where he stands on a lot of
things,'' said Weergang, who has not picked a presidential favorite
for 2000. ``I would and a lot of other people would. We've had the
opportunity to hear other candidates, some with specifics and some
not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rove believes most voters are interested in image before
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a point where they'll say, `I want to hear your
plan on tax cuts, and I want to hear your program about
modernization of Social Security. But let's start off by telling me
why you're running. What are your principles? Do you understand
what the job is all about? Do you seem to know how to operate? Are
you competent at it? Are you going to be able to handle the job?'''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, slaying the expectations dragon will be a work in
progress as campaign 2000 evolves. Rove believes there is no way to
do it quickly. The plan is to get voters personally comfortable
with Bush and then begin fleshing out his stance on issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rove says high expectations are neither a blessing nor a curse.
``It's a reality. Things are blessings or curses if you can do
something about them. We can't do anything about it. So it's just a
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove said nothing in the principles that Bush will espouse in
the first trips should surprise anyone who has paid attention to
Bush's two Texas campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be phrased in a different way because they apply to
a different stage and a different responsibility,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Bush's successful gubernatorial campaigns have been
longer on concept and philosophy than on specific proposals. He
laid out a short list of policy priorities ranging from improving
public education to reforming welfare to cutting taxes while
hitting hard on core values of limiting government and encouraging
individuals to behave responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   Rove believes voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, states where
presidential politics is 'up close and personal,' are keenly
interested in getting a line on Bush as a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you somebody I can like and relate to? Are you somebody
who can convince me you are going to be a good campaigner and that
you are going to be able to win this thing?'' said Rove, ticking
off a list of questions he thinks are out there.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Morin of Nashua, N.H., president of her local Federal of
Republican Women, is hearing questions like that about Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are waiting for him to be him,'' Morin said. ``They
want to see what he is like and compare that to his father. He
still doesn't have his own identity in the masses' mind. He is a
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team is well aware of that sentiment as part of the
challenge the candidate faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the expectations are going to be here,'' Rove
said, gesturing high, ``and it's going to be hard to satisfy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And the expectations are being fueled from within the Bush
campaign with comments like these from supporter U.S. Rep. Henry
Bonilla of San Antonio: ``George W. Bush is the kind of leader who
comes along once in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a plan for handling those expectations. He jokes that
he will ``tell people I'm not as cool as they think.''
</P>
<P>
   He will also tell people what makes him tick, using stump
speeches and as much one-on-one as the trips, with as many as 100
media members in tow, will permit.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa and New Hampshire voters demand retail politics,
small-group gatherings in which body language can count as much as
positions on global warming. By reputation, developed in his two
gubernatorial campaigns, Bush is a good retail politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing when you're the governor of the state of Texas
and you are campaigning in those towns,'' Rove said. ``And it's
another thing when you are a presidential candidate. I do think
they're transferable, but the expectations _ again, I repeat, the
expectations _ of his abilities are so high that that's the
obstacle he faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival Lamar Alexander, who has been to New Hampshire and Iowa so
many times that he might soon qualify to vote in one of those
states, knows from experience that being a governor is not always
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a pretty good governor,'' Alexander said recently at his
Manchester headquarters. ``All of us who were governors think we
were pretty good governors. But going from being governor to being
president is like going from the playground to the NBA finals, and
the people of New Hampshire know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will hit the road as a candidate for whom the planets seem
to be fortuitously aligned. Stout poll numbers have helped fuel
successful fund raising. Successful fund raising adds to the
inevitability quotient that is attracting Republicans eager to
regain the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has landed so many major GOP endorsements (114 Republicans
in Congress, more than half, gathered on the U.S. Capitol lawn last
week to line up as Bush backers) that the other candidates' best
gambit is to paint Bush as the establishment candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It all adds up to the expectations problem about which Rove is
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural process is you can't lead from the starting gate
to the finish line. You just can't,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some can, but not without stumbles. In 1996, Bob Dole was the
early GOP front-runner and eventual nominee. But along the way he
took some hits, including Steve Forbes' wins in Arizona and
Delaware and Pat Buchanan's triumph in New Hampshire, that
temporarily dulled Dole's star.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's first major stumbling block could come in the Iowa
caucuses. In a field that could have 11 candidates, it will be hard
for anyone to pile up a killer advantage, especially somebody
measured against high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, with nine major contenders, Dole won support from 26
percent of the Iowans who attended GOP caucuses. Pat Buchanan was
second at 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, the 1996 Iowa caucuses went a lot further in
determining who would not be president than who would be.
Traditionally, the top three finishers move on to New Hampshire.
The others return to real life. Alexander, who ran third with 18
percent in 1996, could be the surprise in Iowa. He has a solid
organization there, led by Terry Branstad, a former 16-year
governor.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, as the effort moves to the next step, the Bush camp
is quietly, but supremely, confident. The months leading up to the
campaign have, in general, been good ones for Bush. Endorsements
and cash poured in as he passed enough of his legislative program,
including tax cuts, a plan to end social promotion in public
schools and parental notification before minors get abortions, to
declare the session a success.
</P>
<P>
   Probes into his background have yet to produce a silver bullet.
Several major newspapers dispatched journalistic SWAT teams to
scour Bush's past. The Wall Street Journal, in a peculiar effort,
printed a lengthy front-page story detailing some of the many
rumors and how the newspaper could not confirm any of them.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bush _ who maintains a reputation as something of a
hothead despite showing no public evidence of it since taking
office _ is taking the rumor-mongering in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point from a recent Q-and-A session with Salon, an
Internet magazine: Salon: ``I'm sure you've heard the scurrilous
rumors that you were once a party animal, perhaps even the one who
danced on a table naked. Can you put these to rest or do you wish
to plead the Fifth Amendment?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush: ``I'll just say those questions are ridiculous, and I'm
not going to participate in that kind of gossip. There's no picture
of me, but it's trying to disprove a negative. It's just
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon: ``What can you tell us about your successful battle to
overcome alcohol abuse and are you willing to use this personal
experience to help fight America's No. 1 drug addiction?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush: ``One time I was dancing on a table naked, and got drunk,
and fell off. Just kidding. Say that again, now.''

LIONS DIAL SANDERS, BUT THE PHONE KEEPS RINGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, mum is the word in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Sanders is not talking. The Lions have tried reaching
Sanders at his off-season home in Wichita, Kan. _ Coach Bobby Ross
has dialed for four months now _ but Sanders won't bother picking
up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Hear no evil.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead, Sanders' father, William, has done plenty of
talking. He has said he believes his son is ``sick of losing'' in
Detroit, desires a new offense and has contemplated retirement at
age 30 and in his prime. Mind you, Barry said none of that. Dad
did. Nonetheless, the Lions have been turned upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Ross says he would like to hear from Sanders by Tuesday. The
Lions, Ross says, need to know what Sanders' plans are, especially
if he is going to retire, so the team would have time to acquire a
new big-time running back.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Sanders is making 'em sweat _ the team, the franchise, the
entire city. A swift juke. A deep freeze. Sanders missed a
mandatory minicamp in late April. He has not returned Ross' calls.
His fans are antsy.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanders is silent. He is enjoying his off-season, as he
always does. He is reflecting. Reflecting on 10 years laced with
teasing moments of hope and sullied by the realities of ineptness
and failure with Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions could think of it this way: Sanders' being silent is a
plus. Think of the alternatives. He could nearly blow the franchise
to bits with a volcanic display of his displeasure. He could wax
forever about the Lions' inability to field a Super Bowl-caliber
club in nine seasons. He could talk about coaching changes and
offensive coordinator changes and quarterback changes and
offensive-line changes and poor drafts and game-day decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He could bark and say what a lot of the Lions' National Football
League brethren often say about them: too little vision and not
enough dynamic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if this were Michael Irvin. Or Bryan Cox. Goodness
grief, just think if this were Ricky Watters, or even Troy Aikman
or Brett Favre. Any of those guys might have blown the roof off the
place long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, though, is silent. He is not talking about the fact
that the Lions are 78-82 since he arrived in 1989. How they only
twice have won the NFC Central. How they are 1-5 in playoff games,
including two blowouts and five consecutive losses. How they were
5-11 last year and 5-11 a year before that. How, despite being
misused at times and seemingly always amid turmoil, he is 1,458
rushing yards from becoming pro football's career rushing leader,
beating Walter Payton's record of 16,726 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Ross says he and Sanders do not have a problem. Well, this isn't
exactly Earl Campbell and Bum Phillips and a new-wave version of
Luv Ya Honolulu Lions Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was pampered by Wayne Fontes, the previous Lions coach.
The Lions were notoriously slow starters who finished fast, and
Fontes would absorb the criticism and fight for his players and
stand tall with Sanders. Fontes nurtured the relationship. Though
Sanders hated the way the Lions would eventually wilt, he loved
Fontes' fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, who arrived two seasons ago, was supposed to provide
ironclad leadership and vision.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two games under Ross, Sanders got the ball 15 times
for 33 rushing yards against Atlanta and 10 times for 20 yards
against Tampa Bay. Off on the wrong foot, even though Sanders would
finish that 1997 season with 2,053 yards and Detroit would finish
with a 9-7 record and a first-round playoff loss.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders could have said that if Ross knew what he was doing all
along, had he believed in Sanders from the start, Sanders would now
be the career single-season rushing leader rather than second to
Eric Dickerson, who holds the record with 2,105 yards. But Sanders
did not say that. He was silent on that one.
</P>
<P>
   Hear no evil.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanders-Ross relationship took its greatest hit last season
when Ross benched Scott Mitchell for good in the second game. That
wound up killing the Lions' chances to make the playoffs. Later, in
Ross' biggest gaffe, he distanced himself and his coaches from his
team's poor play. It's them, not us, he said in effect. Bad move.
Sanders could play football another 40 years and never forget that.
Ross is no-nonsense and he is tough, and the Lions are still
adjusting to his bluntness. Can Sanders? Yes. But this relationship
is still very bruised.
</P>
<P>
   And so is Sanders' with the Lions' front office. He is being
paid the highest salary among all running backs in the NFL _ $6
million this year as part of a six-year, $36 million deal that
includes a $12.75 million signing bonus. It runs through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lions have ridiculously clawed and scratched during
every negotiation with Sanders. They have never come to him like
other owners have for Aikman and Favre and Steve Young and Terrell
Davis. The Lions have never come and said, ``Hey, let's rework your
deal for all you've done for us, and with all the new TV money
intact let's always work together.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the Lions inserted a clause in Sanders' current contract
that says he will be paid more than the game's highest-paid back in
the last year of his deal. Nice move. But if the Lions had done
more in a more readily appreciable fashion over the last 10 years,
if they had had an aggressive vision for his contracts and his
psyche and for winning teams, this situation would not be as
strained as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders will eventually call.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking here is he will play in Detroit in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   No voice from Sanders, but loud messages still ring.
</P>
<P>
   You won't trade me, he appears to be saying. Retirement goes too
far. Is there any hope for a new image, a winning atmosphere, a
Super Bowl? Can we work as one, as a team, with vision and daring
and boldness? Do you have any idea how frustrating this
merry-go-round has been? Get serious or let's part for good. Time
is short.
</P>
<P>
   No evil intended.
</P>
<P>
   In silence, can you hear?

 &HT;    FALCONS NOTEBOOK
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the fuss about Falcons running back Jamal Anderson
missing offseason workouts, only one of the five players absent is
cause for outright alarm. And Anderson's not the one.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, right guard Gene Williams, snapper Adam Schreiber, and
wide receivers Tim Dwight and Ronnie Harris are not in Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is training at home in Salt Lake City. Dwight is
running track at the University of Iowa, with the coaches'
blessing. Schreiber has a record for fitness. And Harris checks in
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Williams doesn't, and his absence is the largest concern,
largely because of his ``largeness.''
</P>
<P>
   He was fined more than $2,000 during training camp last season _
more than any other Falcon _ for being more than 20 pounds over his
assigned 315-pound playing weight.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Anderson are starters, creating a greater sense of
urgency to participate in a program that coach Dan Reeves believes
had a lot to do with the team's paucity of injuries last season.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries forced Atlanta starters to miss just 16 of 352 combined
games, or 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 30, lives in Cleveland, his wife's hometown, where he
played for the Browns in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
   He has told friends he'll report in great shape. There are
skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say anyone who is not here is falling behind,'' pro
personnel chief Ron Hill said, ``and the people who are here are
moving ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta carried three guards last season, plus guard/centers
Schreiber and Dave Widell, who has been cut. Seventh-round draft
choice Todd McClure, a center, could fill Widell's spot.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber, recently signed to a one-year, $425,000 contract, is
by far the best deep snapper.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta also gave former Giants guard Greg Bishop a two-year, $4
million contract with a $1.2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's second-round choice, Bob Hallen, has been working
more at right guard.
</P>
<P>
   Also, last year's starting left guard, two-year veteran Calvin
Collins, is scheduled to make just $325,000, while Williams makes
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns, by the way, have penciled in offensive-line starters
everywhere but right guard.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: Medical Report
</P>
<P>
   Running back Byron Hanspard's surgically repaired left knee is
improving, and his limp appears gone, but he's still not a lock for
the July 29 start of training camp. ... Backup quarterback Danny
Kanell had laser surgery Tuesday to correct cornea problems. He
said he now has 20/15 vision without contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: Fiscal forecast
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are about $1.5 million under the salary cap.
Although their rookie allotment is nearly $2.9 million, because of
the way the cap is calculated in the offseason Atlanta will be
about $400,000 under the cap once all draftees sign.
</P>
<P>
   That minimal breathing room makes difficult the idea of
extending the contracts of some of the 10 starters who will become
unrestricted free agents after the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Six will command contracts that probably would increase modest
'99 cap charges, ranging from $807,700 for fullback Bob Christian
to $1.63 million for center Robbie Tobeck.
</P>
<P>
   Two exceptions are middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, with a
team-high charge of $3.85 million, and Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's cap charge of $1.6 million grew to more than $3.6
million, the second-highest, because incentives earned last year
count against this year's cap.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a $10 million signing bonus, his cap charge could be
lowered with a contract of at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   There's been little progress, though, as Anderson's agent, Jim
Sims, and Atlanta officials have differing interpretations of the
average salary numbers of the game's highest-paid backs.
</P>
<P>
   The cap charges of defensive end Chuck Smith ($2.8 million) and
wide receiver Terance Mathis ($2.1 million) are modest relative to
their peers, yet they could be lowered with extensions.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for the Falcons is that large annual salary
increases could accelerate their future cap charges quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials have made minimal progress on Mathis, although
they want to keep him around, and none on Smith, who will fetch
more than $4 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   A factor with Tuggle is his age; he will be 34 this season.
Atlanta might begin signing draftees this week, perhaps beginning
with seventh-round wide receiver Rondel Menendez.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: Standing pat
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are not expected to make cuts on Tuesday, when teams
can waive players with multiple years left on their contracts and
spread the residual effect on the salary cap over two years instead
of one.
</P>
<P>
   They could be interested if the right player were released
elsewhere, particularly if a wide receiver with deep speed and/or
size _ and modest price tag _ became available.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, projected cuts by other teams meet those criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Passing camp, not mandatory but strongly encouraged, begins June
14. ... Right offensive tackle Ephraim Salaam, who began last
season at 290 pounds, now weighs 310 and is noticeably thicker from
neck to waist. ... Two-year veteran safety Chris Bayne signed a
$325,000 contract. ... The Falcons are now a Nike team, having
switched from wearing Reebok shoes and apparel. Tuggle still wears
Reeboks because he has a contract with the company. ... With the
Falcon Inn hotel closed, rookies are living at a hotel next to
Gwinnett Place Mall. ... Ninety-eight percent of last year's 29,715
season-ticket holders have renewed, and the team has sold about
8,200 new season tickets.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The date talent-needy teams are waiting for, June 1, arrives
Tuesday and personnel directors leaguewide will be scouring the
waiver wire for players cut loose by clubs in desperate need of
salary-cap relief. Among those looking hardest will be New Orleans
team president Bill Kuharich. The Saints had a one-man draft _
tailback Ricky Williams _ and signed just one veteran of note,
guard Wally Williams, as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got about half the teams in the league with less than
$1 million (in cap room), so there are going to have to be some
veterans coming free,'' Kuharich said at a league meeting here last
week. ``We're hoping we can find a couple guys who will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   While speculation persists that Deion Sanders will be released,
Dallas owner Jerry Jones is apt to take a few more weeks to
evaluate the cornerback's rehabilitation from toe surgery. Several
veterans who will be cut _ QB John Elway (Denver), OT Jeff Criswell
(Kansas City) and DE Chris Doleman (San Francisco) _ already have
announced retirement plans. So, while Kuharich seems convinced
there will be some quality in the post-June 1 market, others insist
it probably will be no better than in past years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year at this time, people act like flood gates are going
to open,'' New York Giants GM Ernie Accorsi said. ``But it's
usually more like a trickle.''
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: The list
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at veterans who could be released or asked to
accept pay reductions in coming weeks: FB Kimble Anders (Kansas
City), OT Harris Barton (San Francisco), RB Mario Bates (Arizona),
WR Billy Davis (Dallas), DT Reuben Davis (San Diego), OT Andy Heck
(Chicago), OG Corbin Lacina (Carolina), LB Dixon Edwards
(Minnesota), CB Deon Figures (Jacksonville), LB Ken Harvey
(Washington), DT Marcus Jones (Tampa Bay), WR James McKnight
(Seattle), OT Zefross Moss (New England), WR Mike Pritchard
(Seattle), CB Thomas Randolph (Cincinnati), DE Neil Smith (Denver),
OT Jamain Stephens (Pittsburgh), FB Nicky Sualua (Dallas), CB Dave
Thomas (Jacksonville), RB Harvey Williams (Oakland), LB James
Willis (Philadelphia), FS Tito Wooten (Giants) and SS Toby Wright
(St. Louis).
</P>
<P>
   Subhead: The Deion watch
</P>
<P>
   Last week's report by Chris Mortensen that the Falcons could be
interested in Sanders if he's cut was more than speculation by
ESPN's crack NFL insider. Agent Eugene Parker noted last week that
it ``would be extremely premature'' to discuss options. ``He's
still in Dallas, and the team hasn't given us permission to talk
with interested (franchises),'' Parker said. But Sanders still owns
a home here, along with a tract of land in Lawrenceville, and the
relationship between him and Falcons president Taylor Smith is
solid. Also, Parker represents Atlanta's other corner, Ray
Buchanan, and thinks that a more mature Sanders would be a smash
here.

   Still seeking a reliable deep threat, Baltimore coach Brian
Billick talked with former boss Dennis Green about a deal for
Vikings wideout Jake Reed. Billick was told that Reed, thought to
be expendable with the emergence of Randy Moss, isn't available.
... Scratch Tennessee from the teams interested in tailback
Lawrence Phillips, who continues to lead the NFL Europe League in
rushing. GM Floyd Reese would like him as a backup to Eddie George
but probably can't convince owner Bud Adams that Phillips is worth
the risk. Reese fought a similar losing battle with Adams when he
wanted to sign free agent linebacker Jamir Miller, a two-time
offender of the league's substance abuse policy. Marco ColemanMike

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing is as stubborn as a grass stain on white linen. As
he marched defiantly down a set of stairs leading from the practice
floor to a locker room last week, he shook his head ``no'' like a
toddler to every question floating in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   He was not in the mood to give in; he never is. For the 14 years
Ewing has been in the frustrating pursuit of an elusive National
Basketball Association championship, this inflexibility has
sustained his confidence through errant finger rolls and Michael
Jordan's reign.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 12 months, this quality has saved him from breaking
beneath the most difficult year of his career. The year has seen
him rising from each physical and personal wound like the star of a
horror movie, surviving to stagger to a dramatic ending that could
make everything worthwhile. Now, seemingly without warning, a
Knicks team recently labeled least likely to succeed will tip off
Game 1 of the Eastern Conference final series with Indiana Sunday
at Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   One more chance for Ewing. One more try at posting up the ghosts
that have defended him well over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never my last chance,'' a typically adamant Ewing barked
out with a smile as he crossed the threshold of the Knicks weight
room. ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be his last chance in a Knick uniform, though. If there
is failure, there could be an opening for Phil Jackson's arrival to
replace Jeff Van Gundy as coach. Ewing wants no part of this
transition, and has made it clear that he would like to be traded
if it happens, preferably to some place warm for his old bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami,'' Ewing said recently. ``I'm moving to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned this remote option with a wide grin, as if
tantalized by the thought of palm trees and ocean breezes. But
those closest to this most aloof of superstars, the ones who
understand his loyalty to Van Gundy and his distaste for Jackson,
take him seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he says to me that he won't play for Phil, he's not
smiling and he's not joking,'' said Herb Williams, Ewing's
long-time friend and teammate. ``He's for real. He's not budging.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Ewing to the core. When many feared he would never find
his touch again, after a wrist injury that doctors said they had
seen only in car accident victims, Ewing made a gallant but futile
return last May in Indiana for Game 2 of the Knicks' second-round
series. He shot 3-for-11, and scored 10 points in 27 laborious
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to go out, have a great game and score
50,'' Ewing said at the time, confident as always.
</P>
<P>
   This unwavering attitude helped him push through the tedium of
rehabilitation and lead him to where he is now, with excellent
range of motion in his wrist and the return of his touch. But just
when the wrist began to flick smoothly, his legs failed him in
March. As he prepares to face Indiana's towering Rik Smits _ the
man of a thousand shot fakes _ Ewing's lateral movement will be
limited by a sore left Achilles' tendon. The injury did not stop
him from putting on a dominating performance in Game 5 of the
Knicks' first-round victory over Miami, or an endless array of
jumpers over Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected him to come back from his wrist injury,''
Williams said. ``Everyone thought it was career-ending. He started
to feel good, and then the Achilles' injury came. Mentally, he went
back down a little bit. And he may still be down. I think he's just
pushing his way through it right now because he has to.''
</P>
<P>
   For a fleeting moment, that desire to push ahead was flat at the
start of the season. His best friend, John Starks, had just been
traded for Latrell Sprewell, and his protector, Charles Oakley, had
been cast away as well. There was talk about his role diminishing,
and the need for his ego to be submerged.
</P>
<P>
   All of this on the heels of a summer and fall spent in the
thankless role of union president. He took an unpopular stand,
endured the heat for suggesting players were ``fighting for our
livelihood,'' but was left out of the eleventh-hour meeting that
ended in an agreement he did not support.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, he was upset at how things turned
out,'' said Williams, an officer in the union. ``He thought we
should have held together as a body and been a lot stronger. But
some of the players started to rattle, and he pretty much had to do
some things he didn't agree with. I don't think he knew that job
was going to be as tough as it was. He didn't know it would be so
draining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you looked around, there was a meeting and then no
meeting. Or we thought we were making progress, and we weren't
making progress. It was his first time going through anything like
that. He was disappointed when all was said and done.''
</P>
<P>
   When the vote was over, and the new proposal was put in place in
mid-January, Ewing stood outside a Manhattan office amid the snow
flurries looking weary and overweight. In a matter of a few days,
he had to gather himself and go to training camp. His conditioning
was poor, his wrist was stiff and his mind was still on the
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season came, and he just wasn't there,'' said Don Chaney,
the assistant coach who shoots with Ewing every day. ``He'd been
through a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   There was still more to come. After 14 years as the team's major
name, Ewing had to make the glacial movement to auxiliary star. He
is still capable of dominating a game _ and may have to against the
Pacers to give the Knicks a chance _ but more often than not he is
the looming figure spotting up for 15-foot jumpers. He is the one
trailing the fast break for the sleek, redesigned Knicks, the one
focusing on the rebound. It's just another adjustment he has had to
make over a difficult 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been through the grind, the wringer, I should say,''
Chaney said. ``There was the wrist, the focus on him as president
during the lockout, the pressure of whether he is still the `Man'
to carry the team; is it Allan Houston or is it Latrell Sprewell
now? Then another injury after last year, and the compressed
season. It takes a big man to stay afloat through all that. And he
has.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is not looking for sympathy as an amendment to his
legacy. Those who know him say this most private of players wants
to be accepted by the public, longs to be embraced fully by New
York, but understands why there's been a reluctance to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The championship,'' Williams said. ``He knows that embrace
won't come until he wins the title. Why do you think he wants it so
badly? What people don't understand is that he doesn't care what
his role is, and he doesn't care how much pain it takes to get
there, he just wants to win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want to win a championship, you'll put your body and
life through anything. I think that is still what's burning in the
back of his mind. He's still got something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   He's still stubborn enough to keep trying after 14 years, a span
capped by a tumultuous 12-month span that led him back for another
attempt _ whether it's his last or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance,'' Ewing said. ``Another chance. That's all.''

3 FRIENDS, STARS IN COLLEGE, ARE ROLE PLAYERS IN THE SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   All three were taken in the first round of the 1991 draft, and
all asked to wear No. 2 jerseys with their new teams. They also
entered the NBA after a bitter Final Four experience.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Larry Johnson, Stacey Augmon and Greg Anthony
left the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, the three have, in a way,
returned to the national semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   When they were humbled by Duke in 1991, Johnson, Augmon and
Anthony were stars on the nation's most explosive team. This time,
they come as role players: Johnson a starter at small forward with
the Knicks, and Augmon and Anthony coming off the bench in
Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the first pick in the draft and the eventual rookie of
the year, thrived in Charlotte before souring on the franchise and
being traded to the Knicks. His selflessness and leadership are big
reasons they are in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Augmon, taken ninth by Atlanta, never developed offensively. But
he has stayed in the league because of his ability to change games
with his defensive tenacity and wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, the former Knick and the 12th pick, was a large part of
Portland's Western Conference semifinals victory over Utah. He
hounded John Stockton and Howard Eisley, exerting full-court
pressure on the Jazz guards and not allowing Utah to get set
offensively until about 10 seconds had expired on the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   UNLV had a reputation as a fun-loving, carefree program when
they attended the school, and Johnson, Augmon and Anthony have all
remained friends. If the Knicks and Trail Blazers somehow reach the
finals, pity the poor hotel clerk who has to tell them to keep it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Draft Talk ... and Rumors
</P>
<P>
   It's about six months early to forecast an NBA champion for the
millennium, but the Charlotte Hornets almost make you want to go
out on that limb.
</P>
<P>
   The team has apparently set its sights on Steve Francis with the
No. pick in the draft, opting for the skywalking Maryland guard
instead of players like Corey Maggette and Elton Brand of Duke and
Lamar Odom of Rhode Island, who could be taken before the Hornets
choose.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has the No. pick and is said to be leaning toward
Maggette. There is also talk that the Bulls are interested in Miami
University's Wally Szczerbiak, perhaps enough that they would make
a trade in which they use the No.1 pick for another team, which
would then pick Szczerbiak for the Bulls. Vancouver has the No.2
selection.
</P>
<P>
   If Francis is Charlotte's choice, he will join a potent Hornets
roster that features Eddie Jones, Anthony Mason, Derrick Coleman, a
rejuvenated Elden Campbell, David Wesley and Bobby Phills.
</P>
<P>
   Throw Francis into the mix and you have one of the most athletic
teams in the league, with a nice blend of youth and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a part of me that didn't want to leave L.A. because
of all the talent and youth we had,'' said Jones, who was traded by
the Lakers to Charlotte along with Campbell at the trading deadline
this season. ``But then I started realizing what we have here, all
the building blocks for something special. You had that in L.A.,
too, but the rumors just got to me after a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just a good situation for me. If you look down the
road in a couple of years, it's going to be a good situation for
everyone here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Makes His Point
</P>
<P>
   To fill their void at point guard since 1992, the Knicks have
tried six-month stopgaps, long-term contracts and even Gary Grant.
And while Charlie Ward and Chris Childs have combined to bring
respectability to the position, little the Knicks have done has
worked since the day they got rid of Mark Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   He does not gloat anymore, or chastise the team he grew up with
for trading him. Jackson merely goes about his job of leading the
Indiana Pacers toward the NBA finals, the job that resumes Sunday
in Indianapolis in the Eastern Conference championship series
against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   He is not fast, and he cannot jump high. Along with John
Stockton, he is merely the last of a dying breed: the pass-first
point guard who worries about his own points last.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at me and you don't see anything special,'' Jackson
said recently. ``I pass the ball, but there's nothing that's going
to knock you out. But later you look back and say, `Hey, when this
guy's on the floor, his team is a better team.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was traded to the Clippers in 1992 for Doc Rivers and
Charles Smith, two players who helped the Knicks return to
prominence in the early 1990s. The Pacers traded him once, too. But
in one of the great moves of the last decade, the team's president,
Donnie Walsh, realized he had erred, swallowed his pride and
reacquired Jackson from Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing once called Jackson his favorite teammate, a
player who could deliver the ball to his teammates at just the
right moment as they were streaking toward the basket.
</P>
<P>
   His defensive liabilities aside, Jackson's gift of impeccable
court sense never received its due in New York until all the
helter-skelter play at the point after he was traded.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in The Indianapolis Star, after the Pacers
lost to the Bulls in the conference finals last season, Jackson was
invited to Coach Larry Bird's house to watch one of the
Utah-Chicago games. As they march toward the finals together, the
two have formed a strong bond built on mutual ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was limited as a player, but he got the most out of his
ability with heart and desire,'' Jackson said of Bird. ``He saw a
poor man's version of that in me _ a guy who's limited, who's
supposed to not be able to play defense. But for some reason, I was
still getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after he was traded.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Expect Van Gundy Back
</P>
<P>
   A hunch: No matter how far the Knicks advance in the playoffs,
Jeff Van Gundy will not return as the Knicks' coach.
</P>
<P>
   It has little to do with Dave Checketts' cloak-and-dagger
dealings with Phil Jackson, Van Gundy's off-the-court disagreements
with Ernie Grunfeld or even the most quantifiable reason of all:
his winning percentage as Knicks coach.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling comes from the notion that most 10-year employees
move on when they don't feel that their bosses value their loyalty
enough to trust them through hard times.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of Madison Square Garden executives, Van Gundy is
still very much the mail-room clerk who just happened to be in the
right place at the right time. Even if he were to be rewarded with
a more lucrative, multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract after the
season, Van Gundy's tenure on the firing line would begin all over
again if, say, the Knicks were 10-8 in December.
</P>
<P>
   And as Van Gundy may have found out this season, no amount of
money is worth that grief.
</P>
<P>
   If he were Pat Riley or Lenny Wilkens, Van Gundy would have been
labeled a visionary for stubbornly insisting that Latrell Sprewell
come off the bench and Marcus Camby earn his minutes _ hard
decisions that the players finally embraced and that have paid off.
Instead, he is portrayed as the petty coach who's been burying his
talent to spite the former general manager.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Van Gundy became a Garden shark for a
couple of weeks this season, regretfully swimming in management's
cesspool to get his points across instead of merely coaching the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he doesn't trust his bosses, and they don't trust him. It
would not be surprising if management and the coach went their
separate ways for good after this thrilling playoff run.

   ``In this league, coaches always take the brunt of everything,''
Larry Bird, the Indiana coach, said last week. ``If your team is
not doing well, that's part of the game. I'm sure Jeff, if he's not
in New York next year, he'll be somewhere. He's a fine coach. He's
a very good coach. He'll survive it.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be more interesting to see the Knicks survive without
him.

PACERS' MILLER ENJOYS PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE NBA VILLAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ In Salt Lake City last week, Cheryl Miller
confronted a woman who kept directing profanities toward her during
the Western Conference semifinals between the Utah Jazz and the
Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   The insults had nothing to do with her skills as a courtside
reporter for TNT or as a coach in the Women's National Basketball
Association. They had everything to do with her brother, the lanky
and loquacious Indiana Pacers guard who plays many miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just wouldn't stop,'' Cheryl Miller said. ``The second
time she started in on Reggie, I couldn't handle it anymore. I
finally went over and said: `What is your problem? You know what
most people would do to you if you insulted their family member?' I
told her I'm saving her life right now by letting her know that.
Usually, I don't mind some of the stuff. But sometimes, they just
go too far. There's a fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Center in May. Madison Square Garden in June. It does
not matter where or when he plays, or even whether he is playing.
Reggie Miller is an equal-opportunity villain, despised from coast
to coast for the last 12 seasons. He has been enflaming passions in
the National Basketball Association for nearly that long, running
his mouth while running through screens and delivering devastating
3-pointers in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is he more reviled than in New York, whose basketball
team he will face, and have a chance to shoot down, for the fifth
time in the last seven postseasons beginning Sunday at Market
Square Arena. In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, the man
who authored ``I Love Being the Enemy'' will return to his favorite
role, again assuming his alter ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do love it,'' Miller said earlier this week after a Pacer
practice. ``Everyone can't be applauded or the fan favorite. Not
everyone can be Kobe or Michael Jordan _ the smile, the glitter and
the commercials. There has to be some guys that wear black hats. I
just happen to relish in it. I just happen to like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys wear black hats and that's not their persona. I
think Karl wears a black hat, but he wants people to believe he's a
good guy,'' Miller said of Karl Malone. ``I'm a black hat and I
don't care what people think. You don't have to like me as long as
you respect me. That's all I ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his bravado, Miller has been uncharacteristically
subdued before the conference finals, saying little to intensify
the Knick-Pacer rivalry. After Game 7 losses to the Bulls in 1995
and the Magic in 1998 prevented his team from making its first NBA
finals appearance, he seems to understand his best opportunity to
win a title is near.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Bird, the Indiana coach, regulated his minutes during the
regular season, and Miller missed his share of potential
game-winners. But he has returned to the cocksure marksman of
playoffs past in the last three weeks, dropping in knifing jump
shots and taking off on scoring binges for several minutes at the
ends of games against Milwaukee in the first round and Philadelphia
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it's the same old Reggie _ poised to flap his gums
and make teams that sag off him pay. But in other areas of his
life, a more reserved and private Miller is evolving.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Marita, lost their dream home to arson two
years ago. Though they had not yet moved into the three-story,
14,000-square foot lakefront house in the city's Geist area, it
contained many of their possessions when it burned down on May 15,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   With no suspects or leads, the fire is still under
investigation. Among the losses were Marita's wedding ring and
almost all of Miller's memorabilia from his playing days. Though
Marita, a model, was away in California, Reggie had considered
sleeping in the house the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I told him I was moving out and not coming back
to Indianapolis,'' said Marita. ``It was traumatic. You wonder who
would do that. You start looking in the rearview mirror, wondering
if someone is following you. That little inkling of concern is
still there for me. It's why I have trouble living here. I feel if
you don't want me there, I don't want to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cheryl Miller: ``I remember the night it happened, and he
called me. His exact words were: `Cheryl _ it's gone. It's all
gone.' I just told him, `The main thing is, you're here.' There's
not a lot you can say because it's such a violation.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, Reggie Miller began to gain
perspective. Slowly, copies of the memorabilila began filtering in.
``Karl and Charles sent me back a copy of a behind-the-scenes
videotape I had made at the Olympics,'' Miller said, referring to
Karl Malone and Charles Barkley. ``They also sent some autographed
shirts and things.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's scary, because the person who did that is still
out there. I can take that one of two ways. That could have been an
attempt on my wife's life, my life. Was it a random hit because
they didn't know? I'm a little bit better now. The first year, I
was skeptical of everyone trust-wise. I've gotten a little bit
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the ashes emerged a charity sponsored by Miller. Three
weeks ago, he was host to an inaugural celebrity bowling party in
Indianapolis. The proceeds benefited a children's burn unit and two
burn camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't have the means to wait for the insurance
company after they've lost everything, so with that in mind we
started the foundation to help families that lose everything in a
fire _ more so kids that were ever burned in a fire,'' Miller said.
``It's definitely given me perspective about the losses we
suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   If the game was an emotional outlet before, it became even more
cathartic after the fire. At least on the basketball court, he
could control the environment around him. It's part of the reason
why his confidence is unmatched and he has essentially inherited
the role of the best clutch player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   At age 33, a more reserved and resilient Miller prepares for
another contentious series against the city and the team that loves
to hate him _ a gunner of great renown still looking to shoot the
Knicks down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like a Broadway play coming to New York,'' he
said. ``It's going to be electrifying going there. By already
hearing the chants on TV and everyone calling and saying, `Hey,
they really want you.' The papers are saying it's Miller time. I'm
really gearing up for it. The waiting is killing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Miller added: ``The bigger the hatred, the more Reggie
thrives. If New York wants to do themselves any good, shut up.''

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The civilian at the top of the American military,
Secretary of Defense William Cohen, rarely speaks directly to the
commander running the war in the Balkans. Aides to the commander,
Gen. Wesley Clark, derisively call the secretary ``Senator Cohen,''
since he spends more time advising and cajoling his former
colleagues in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier at the top, Gen. Henry Shelton, is the general who
speaks when spoken to. He is said to be unwilling _ or unable _ to
air the Pentagon's misgivings about the war, though during a recent
White House meeting he bluntly ended a discussion about sending
ground troops into a ``semi-permissive'' situation in Kosovo
without a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being a little bit pregnant, sir,'' Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told President Clinton,
according to an official familiar with the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Cohen and Shelton are Clinton's top military advisers
as the Balkans war grows into its third month, but in a sense they
are not its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their predecessors from the Persian Gulf War, Dick Cheney
and Gen. Colin Powell, who drew up war plans and gave Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, the commander in the field, more troops and weapons
than he wanted, they have an entirely different relationship with
their field commander.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton serves as commander in chief, responsible
through Cohen and Shelton for American forces, the war is not being
run from war rooms at the White House or at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clark, an American, is charged with running it from
Belgium. But he must answer not only to his own political leaders
but also to the leaders of an often unwieldy NATO alliance of 18
other nations that demands consensus even if the United States is
its dominant power.
</P>
<P>
   That has turned Cohen and Shelton more into managers than war
strategists or policy-makers, trying to balance the various
domestic and international demands while helping retain support for
the effort. How they have played their parts has shaped some of the
day-to-day conduct of the war. The nature of the campaign has
shaped their roles as well.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, perhaps, tensions have emerged. Clark's aides say
that the Pentagon's penchant for bureaucratic checks and balances
simply clashes with his war-fighter's urgency to press the fight.
But for Cohen and Shelton, the immediate concern is less to wage
war than to maintain the fragile consensus behind it both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen says his role is to rally support not only within NATO but
also within the Pentagon and, he adds, on Capitol Hill, where he
was a Republican lawmaker for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never purport to be a military strategist, where I was
going to start drawing military plans,'' Cohen said in an interview
in his office. ``What I've done, as part of what I see as my job,
is to hold a group of teams together.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the war itself, Cohen and Shelton have
supported some of Clark's requests, aides say, whether for weapons
or for more ambitious tactics. But they have also acted as a brake
on Clark's most aggressive proposals _ from his eagerness to use
Apache helicopters to his desire to base rockets in Croatia to fire
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, they review Clark's bombing targets and, despite the
intensification of the air war, still reject some as too risky.
``You always want to make sure that you have civilian oversight of
an operation like this,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   For Cohen, who has served as secretary since January 1997, and
Shelton, who took over as chairman nine months later, NATO's air
war will be a lasting mark on their terms, which have already seen
the running military confrontations with Iraq, including last
December's four-day miniwar, and the cruise missile strikes against
the Sudan and Afghanistan last August.
</P>
<P>
   How their stewardships are judged, though, will largely depend
on the outcome of a war they have overseen but, by Cohen's own
account, would have fought differently ``if this were simply a U.S.
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been wider and more intense from my
perspective,'' Cohen told a group of reporters on Friday. ``Any
time you're dealing with an alliance you have to take into account
the need to hold that alliance together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the United States acting unilaterally,'' he added,
``this was certainly the best option and the only option.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has always seen himself as a consensus builder _ from his
days as mayor of Bangor, Maine, to his tenure as the only
Republican in Clinton's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, at 58, is erudite, dapper and detached, leading a
department inclined to brawn and backslapping. He did not serve in
the military, in the years leading up to the Vietnam War, because
of student and marriage deferments.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, though, he developed an expertise in military
issues, driven in part by the importance of defense contracts to
Maine's economy, from the B-52s at Loring Air Force Base to the
warships built at Bath Iron Works. He also dabbled with literary
aspirations, publishing several books, including two volumes of
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Baker's Nickel'' (1986, William Morrow &AMP; Co.), Cohen
wrote a poem about flying in the backseat of an F-15.
</P>
<P>
   We were quicksilver
</P>
<P>
   sliding on the blue
</P>
<P>
   water of thought,
</P>
<P>
   unmindful, almost, that
</P>
<P>
   on the gleaming wings
</P>
<P>
   of the death machine
</P>
<P>
   hung the terrible paradox
</P>
<P>
   of peace.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been his long experience in Congress that has helped
the administration immensely in fending off the worst of the
Republican attacks on the war and on other issues, both
administration officials and lawmakers say. Cohen constantly briefs
his former colleagues in the House and Senate on the war's
progress, both in formal committee hearings and in private
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, rose on the Senate
floor and, revealing the deep ambivalence many conservatives feel
toward the war, called for the bombing to stop. The next morning
Cohen invited Bennett and half a dozen other senators to his office
in the Pentagon for breakfast with him and Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Bennett sounded tempered, if not completely won over.
``I was more tempted to believe the optimistic reports'' on the
war's progress ``when it was Cohen and Shelton describing them to
us, with no keepers from the White House to monitor what they were
saying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican senator, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, said Cohen
had been effective at explaining and defending the administration's
policy because ``he knows all the back alleys over here.'' With the
air war now into its third month, however, he said he was far from
convinced that Cohen and Shelton were overseeing a sound strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cohen has bought this president some additional time,
just because of who he is,'' Hagel said, ``but I think that time is
running out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's lobbying in Congress has limits, though, as was clear
when the House, in a split vote last month, refused to support the
administration's war effort. Cohen noted that the House only
narrowly endorsed the Gulf War before it began and claimed that it
was more important that the House has since supported an increase
in military financing intended partly to pay for the Balkan
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Cohen, Shelton appears far less comfortable with
his public role of articulating _ and defending _ the war effort.
As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he serves as the senior
uniformed adviser to the president and secretary of defense. But
compared with his predecessors, Gen. John Shalikashvili and before
that Powell, he has had a profile so low he is almost absent from
the public debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not uncomfortable being silent,'' one aide said.
</P>
<P>
   He is widely respected as a soldier, a former commando and
paratrooper who led two of the Army's most coveted combat commands:
the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., and the entire 18th
Airborne Corps. In the Persian Gulf War he led a helicopter assault
deep into Iraq. As commander of the 18th, he oversaw the American
intervention in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton declined to be interviewed about his role, but officials
have described him as deeply ambivalent about the use of military
force in the Balkans, reflecting misgivings that many uniformed
officers have about the strategy and what they see as a lack of a
clear exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does not consider it his role to advocate strongly
for one position or another, but rather to provide precise, clear
military advice, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In briefings on Capitol Hill, Shelton sticks to the operational
details, which has led to frustration and criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us would like to hear more from Shelton, to have him
step forward more and give the real soldier's view,'' Hagel said.
``A lot of us here would just like to hear him talk for five
minutes about what the concept is.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman, Shelton is the military conduit between Washington
and the commanders fighting the war.
</P>
<P>
   While Clark is the supreme allied commander, he also serves as
commander of American forces in the region, a dual role that often
proves awkward since he must also answer to the NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, as one of the nation's nine commanders in chief,
Clark reports directly to Cohen, but in practice he has dealt day
to day with Shelton, particularly on military matters and
operational updates. Cohen said he prefers it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Shelton meet virtually every morning at 7:30 in the
secretary's office, along with their deputies, John Hamre, the
deputy secretary of defense, and Gen. Joseph Ralston, the vice
chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Twice a week, Cohen receives a briefing from Clark through a
video camera in a highly secured conference room deep inside in the
Pentagon's national military command center. Several weeks into the
campaign, he began inviting the chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force
and Marines, even though they have no direct war-fighting role. It
is another of his efforts to forge consensus, this time within the
Pentagon, where senior officers were becoming increasingly critical
of Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Although both are Army four-stars, Clark and Shelton could
hardly be more different in style and temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 54, is a former Rhodes scholar who, as he rose through
the ranks, became savvy in the bureaucratic battles of Washington.
He served as Richard Holbrooke's top military aide in the 1995
Dayton negotiations over Bosnia, and as an officer on the Joint
Staff he developed a close relationship with Sandy Berger, then the
president's deputy national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides say that Clark and Berger, now the senior
adviser, talk regularly, but that this is not a back channel, as
some at the Pentagon suspect. When Clinton met with his senior
advisers at the White House last week on the same day Clark was in
town for consultations, Clark did not attend, but Shelton did,
honoring Cohen's insistence on communicating through the chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions that have emerged between the Pentagon and Clark's
staff often reflect institutional differences over approach and
strategy, but they also involve the personalities and egos of the
men involved.
</P>
<P>
   On matters of strategy, Clark feels the Pentagon has not been as
responsive as it could be, second-guessing and nitpicking his
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Top aides to Shelton say that NATO's planning staff in Mons,
Belgium, is inexperienced in the art of war-planning, and should
appreciate Pentagon aid. ``The SACEUR's staff is not a war-fighting
staff,'' a Shelton aide said, using the military acronym for the
staff of the supreme allied commander in Europe. ``It's never
fought or planned a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton must also balance Clark's requests for forces with the
demands from other American field commanders around the world.
``We're stretched,'' Hamre said. ``We can't have any marginal
requests for forces.''
</P>
<P>
   In other respects, though, Cohen has strongly supported Clark,
cajoling his counterparts in the NATO allies to approve more
bombing targets and resisting calls for pauses in the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   For Cohen, this is a turnaround. As a senator, he opposed
sending American troops to Bosnia, but as secretary of defense he
was ``an early and strong advocate'' for bombing Yugoslavia,
according to Berger. Cohen said his view changed last fall when he
saw that the Yugoslav campaign was forcing hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanian rebels to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the air war drags on, Cohen said that it was essential
to preserve unity _ both in NATO and among American commanders _
even if that sometimes required strategic compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more important,'' he said, ``to have a consensus to take
some action than to have a disagreement and take no action.''

<P>
   Almost any Canadian who grew up during the 1950s or 1960s
remembers at least one otherwise dignified old gentleman _ a
friend's grandfather, perhaps _ who spent Saturday afternoons
feinting and jabbing at his television screen.
</P>
<P>
   The old man would have been a true believer whose heroes and
villains were nicknamed Bulldog, the Giant, the Butcher and the
Assassin. They starred in a TV morality play and cult ritual known
as ``Big Time Wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoted by the Calgary, Alberta, wrestler Stu Hart and his
Bronx-born wife, Helen, the shows _ later reborn as ``Stampede
Wrestling'' _ were syndicated around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   And a certain old gent would sooner have absorbed a body slam
from Whipper Billy Watson than skip an episode. Or admit to
anything dubious about the shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, I remember Archie the Stomper mauling my dad in the
ring,'' said Bret ``the Hitman'' Hart, one of a dozen children of
Stu and Helen Hart and the elder brother of Owen Hart, who died on
May 23 in Kansas City after falling more than 50 feet while being
lowered onto a World Wrestling Federation stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then later, I'd see Archie the Stomper come to get his check,
and hug my mom,'' said Bret, a former WWF wrestler who is now a
star of Ted Turner's rival World Championship Wrestling. ``I
couldn't figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harts _ 84-year-old Stu, Helen, their 10 surviving children
and 34 grandchildren _ are the uncrowned first family of North
American wrestling. They remain in shock on the eve of funeral
services for the youngest of the children, Owen, 34, who leaves a
widow, Martha, and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Although Monday's service is private, thousands of mourners are
expected to surround the chapel in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   Glossy names from pro wrestling will be there, too _ maybe even
Vince McMahon, the WWF owner, against whom the Harts harbor a
grudge. ``I have hard feelings towards the WWF, because they
continued the show after Owen's death,'' said Bret, 42. ``It was
very cold-blooded.''
</P>
<P>
   Bret Hart, a premier drawing card in professional wrestling, is
that rare creature, a world-famous Canadian. In select circles,
he's better known than hockey's Wayne Gretzky or the singer Celine
Dion.
</P>
<P>
   But in the days since the death, he, his mother and his sisters
have spoken candidly, sometimes bitterly, of the theatrical
``sport'' which has dominated Hart family life since Helen and Stu
paid $50,000 Canadian for ``Big Time Wrestling'' in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   It's a game which several Harts have long regarded with mixed
emotions. ``When we were first married, I'd say, `Stu, how long are
we going to stay in this business?' and he'd say, `About two
years,''' recalled the former Helen Smith, born in the Bronx and
raised on Long Island. ``Twenty years later, I said, `Stu, we're
still in it,''' said Helen, who spent 45 years keeping the books
for ``Stampede Wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother hates the wrestling business,'' said Alison, one of
four Hart daughters. ``We've all been uncomfortable with the way
the business was going.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen was horrified when WWF dream weavers created a story line
which required that Bret, a Civil War buff, incorporate
anti-American elements into his stage persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me, and said, `Mom, I hate to tell you. They want me
to turn against the United States.' I said, `Oh, God.' I was so
upset,'' Helen said. ``I still stand up when I hear either national
anthem.''
</P>
<P>
   Then WWF writers dreamed up bouts between Bret, an established
star, and his younger brother Owen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that broke my heart, too,'' said Helen, who couldn't bring
herself to watch. ``Bret and Owen both called me about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Owen saw the Hart-to-Hart battles as a chance to vault
into the big money, and his brother felt obliged to help. The
brothers fought for the WWF title in 1994, later reprising the act
in Italy, France and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Helen, sports-minded but never a wrestling fan, met Stu, a
Canadian amateur champion, during a wrestling circuit stopover in
New York. They married on New Year's Eve, 1947.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, the Harts' rambling Calgary home served as
hotel, dining lounge and watering hole of choice for an eccentric
parade of large, aggressive men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very bizarre childhood,'' Bret Hart said. ``When he was
little, I remember Owen was terrified of Bull Ramos. Bring up that
name, and Owen would go right to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   There was Killer Kowalski, the vegetarian wrestler who wolfed
salad from the Harts' 10-gallon silver bowl. There was Andre the
Giant, who threw furniture, and the Cuban Assassin, who pulled a
shiv.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most were more gentle than you'd think,'' said Helen, who
remembers discussing books and folding diapers with the hulking
Ivan Kalmikoff.
</P>
<P>
   Taught by their father, the eight Hart sons learned to wrestle
in the ``dungeon,'' a ring in the basement of the twin-gabled, red
brick home. Then they fought to defend the integrity of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be at school, taking my shirt off to defend wrestling
again, at the drop of a hat,'' Bret said, laughing. ``While I was
doing it, I'd ask myself why.''
</P>
<P>
   As teen-agers, both Bret and Owen were provincial high school
wrestling champs. But they swore they would never stoop to the pro
ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, positively, I will not be a wrestler,'' Bret
remembers insisting. ``My dad was on the road all the time, and we
missed him. We both never wanted to be away like that, but in the
end, that's all we ever did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just found me,'' Bret says of the career that has made him
a wealthy man. ``Same with Owen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hitman'' has never denied that pro bouts are tightly
scripted and choreographed, but he considers himself an
accomplished actor-athlete, a cross between Robert De Niro and Cal
Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw `Shakespeare in Love,' how the Elizabethan actors and
stagehands set up the stage and the set,'' Bret said. ``It sounds
bizarre, but wrestling's much like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``When Owen got the upset victory over me in
Wrestlemania, it was great drama, we took pride in it. Owen and I
created things nobody saw before. No words. Just the intensity in
facial expressions, a physical contest.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Owen's death, both brothers worried that pro
wrestling _ once a relatively harmless diversion, with relatively
harmless stars _ had reached perverse new lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have trouble with someone pointing at his crotch for two
hours,'' Bret said. ``There's no family aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister Alison, speaking of the WWF and its fans, said:
``These people are absolutely desensitized. It would be nice for me
to say Owen's death could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it would be like telling you Snow White really did marry a
prince, and she lives down the road. But the prince is gone _ our
prince.''

<P>
   POMPTON LAKES, N.J. _ When Joe Louis was the heavyweight
champion, he put this leafy little town on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the Pacific during the war,'' Russ Pagana, a
retired contractor, was saying, ``guys would ask me where I was
from. When I'd say, Pompton Lakes, N.J., they'd say, `Yeah, that's
where Joe Louis trains.'''
</P>
<P>
   And now the town has put Joe Louis on a monument.
</P>
<P>
   Created by Anthony Sgobba in glossy Italian black granite, Joe
Louis' life-size likeness is on a monument dedicated here yesterday
in what is now Joe Louis Memorial Park next to the Elks Lodge No.
1895, a left jab away from what was Doc Bier's training camp, where
Louis prepared to knock out Max Schmeling and Billy Conn (twice).
</P>
<P>
   ``As kids, we'd watch Joe train on Sunday,'' Pagana recalled,
``then we'd go to the movies at the Colonial theater on Saturday
and watch the Movietone news of what we had watched.''
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, Louis would go to the movies, too. If a few kids
were standing around outside, he'd tell the ticket-taker, ``Let `em
in. I'll take care of it.'' If the kids were standing around
outside the ice-cream parlor, he bought cones. And the Pompton
Lakes kids never had to pay to watch him train.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he did his roadwork,'' said Howard Ball, a former editor
of the local Suburban Trend newspaper, ``he'd stop to talk to my
grandmother in her rocking chair on our porch. I'd peek through the
window to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   After a local resident died in 1935 and before an ambulance
arrived from a nearby town, Louis boxed an exhibition that raised
$2,600 to buy Pompton Lakes its own white Packard ambulance. He
raised $2,000 to help build a police communications tower.
</P>
<P>
   And every so often, Lou Duva, then a teen-ager in nearby
Paterson, hitch-hiked here to watch the champion train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody trained like Joe Louis,'' recalled Duva, the
77-year-old Hall of Fame trainer. ``He always wore white knit
trunks with a white tank top, black boxing shoes and white socks.
He was all business. On the weekends, there'd be as many as 5,000
people around the outdoor ring under the trees next to the big
house where he and his sparring partners lived.''
</P>
<P>
   For a big fight now, boxers don't train like that. They stay in
casino-hotels now. They spar in glitzy ballrooms with chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now they all have their entourages,'' Duva said with a
smirk. ``Every lawyer, every accountant, every hustler is hanging
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Duva and Pompton Lakes Police Chief Al Ekkers were the
fund-raising co-chairmen for the Joe Louis Memorial Park and
monument.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing will probably cost $80,000 before we're
through,'' Duva said. ``We've raised a lot already, but I'll put up
whatever we need to finish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming up here to see Joe Louis train is where I learned to
watch trainers train fighters,'' he said. ``I never learned
anything from fighters. I learned it all from the trainers.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1923, boxers began coming to the barracks-like house
next to the home of Dr. Joseph Bier, an eye-ear-nose-and-throat
specialist who operated what he called a Health Farm on the shore
of Pompton Lake in this tiny town of 3,000 in the woods and lakes
of northern Passaic County. The population is now 11,500.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best boxing names of that era trained here _ Benny
Leonard, Harry Greb, Pancho Villa, Ace Hudkins, Tony Canzoneri,
Jimmy McLarnin, Jackie (Kid) Berg, Lou Brouillard, and Primo
Carnera.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1935, when Louis was about to come here to train for his
first fight in New York, against Primo Carnera, at least one
resident objected to the presence of a black fighter along with
John Roxborough, a black manager, and Jack Blackburn, a black
trainer. Doc Bier never blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've rented the place,'' Doc said, ``and they'll be here.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of Louis' fights in New York, they returned here. He
considered Pompton Lakes his ``lucky camp,'' especially after he
trained at Lakewood, N.J., before being knocked out by Max
Schmeling in the 12th round at Yankee Stadium in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Before his 1938 title defense against Schmeling at Yankee
Stadium, Louis trained here, then knocked out Schmeling in 2
minutes, 4 seconds of the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great place this would be for a training camp,'' Lou
Duva was saying now. ``That house over there, that's where Doc Bier
lived. I'd like to buy that house and use it as a training camp for
some of my young fighters. Put up an outdoor ring like they had
when Joe Louis was here.''
</P>
<P>
   And it would be only a left jab away from the Joe Louis
monument.

ON THE BANKS OF THE DELAWARE, A REASON TO BELIEVE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By PETE BODO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LORDVILLE, N.Y. _ We sloshed through the brook, in the cool
darkness of the tunnel beneath the railroad tracks, and emerged in
brilliant sunshine on the banks of the Delaware River. The ash and
cherry trees on the mountainside opposite us were not yet leafed
out. Their pale green buds appeared supercharged, nearly
fluorescent, in striking contrast to the opaque black surface of
the river at this place called Bouchoux Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Franklin and I were joined by Frank Rodriguez, a mutual
friend from Portland, Ore., who had come east to fish with us. As
he beheld the Delaware for the first time, Frank remarked, ``This
is something I could believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   I met Frank nearly 20 years ago on the banks of a different
river, the rugged Deschutes in Oregon. I was communing with nature
in my own ecologically incorrect way, living out of a rented Ford
Taurus station wagon under a pile of fishing gear, books and empty
potato chip bags. Frank was the squared-away guy with the Volvo
wagon and a real folding chair and cookstove encamped 50 yards from
me. Being the only two people around, we got to talking.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that in a few days, Frank would be hooking up in
Montana with my friend Richard, a New Yorker, whom he had met the
previous summer on the Henry's Fork of the Snake River in Idaho.
Richard and Frank have camped and fished together out West for a
month every summer since then.
</P>
<P>
   In angling, the ties that bind are often rivers. As we walked up
the gravel bar, I pointed out a distinct feature of our river in
the spring, the bathtub-sized mounds of small stones built by
spawning lamprey eels. As far as sex appeal goes, lampreys are
right up there with moray eels. But the care and precision with
which they build their spawning nests is touching.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 seconds later, Frank said, ``Thank you, Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered what he was thanking me for, and realized it was
about the lamprey nests. It was a very Frank thing to do, and it
made me wish I saw him more often.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, a March brown mayfly emerged from the edge of the
river and delicately spun away, upward, but there weren't enough
bugs to get the trout rising. So Richard and I set about making a
small fire. We were making one of our simple shore lunches in
Frank's honor. We cut three sticks from a maple sapling for cooking
the hot dogs. I put the unshucked corn at the edge of the fire. The
menu is always the same.
</P>
<P>
   Frank came back from the river with the cool beers. When I last
saw him, on the Missouri River in Montana last July, I noticed that
he wore a tiny white ribbon embroidered with red hearts pinned to
his vest. I remarked on it this time, and Frank said, ``Laura gave
it to me 15 years ago, for the first trout season after we started
dating.''
</P>
<P>
   I remembered meeting Laura in Portland one year. She was a
quiet, delicate, friendly woman. I was sad to learn that she and
Frank divorced about a year ago, but was cheered to see that the
ribbon had survived half a dozen fishing vests, and that Frank
still wore it.
</P>
<P>
   A trout rose about 40 yards out in the river, a silver pockmark
on the dark water. Nobody felt like fishing for it. Frank told us
about the Mankind Project, a movement to which he belongs, which
seeks to make men better and happier for all the right reasons and
in all the right ways. A stiff breeze kicked up out of the south,
and the air smelled of hemlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this, here's one of our March brown nymphs,'' Richard
said. Frank and Richard squatted at the river's edge, peering at
the underside of the wet rock in Richard's hand. ``They migrate to
the shoreline before hatching, for survival reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank hunched further over, observing, ``They look a lot like
our western gray drakes, and they're the same size.''
</P>
<P>
   The men continued to talk about the bugs. The scene had been
enacted on dozens of rivers, in various parts of the country, on
occasions too numerous to count. It never gets old, and there's
something a little goofy about it. Common interest is the flexible
bond of a lasting angling friendship. It may be better glue than
having gone to school together, or even emotional empathies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you go out upstream of that rock and fish down along
that foam line?'' Richard suggested to Frank a while later. ``It
would be a good place to prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Frank replied. ``I wouldn't fish it that
way in this wind. Hey, Richie, I just saw a rise; it was a big
head, over near the far bank.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, a few fish were beginning to show. We waded out,
and soon all three of us were casting. A giant rainbow trout
engulfed my fly just 12 feet in front of me, leaped furiously and
snapped my fine 5x tippet before I understood quite what was
happening. Some good things develop slowly. Others are here and
gone in the blink of an eye.

LUYENDYK HOPES FOR A FAST FAREWELL AT INDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ They know how to win, but just as important, most
champions know when to quit. Michael Jordan knew when it was time.
John Elway and Wayne Gretzky did. So now does Arie Luyendyk, who
will race around the Brickyard for the final time on Sunday, two
years after taking his second checkered flag at the Indianapolis
500.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk is leaving auto racing while still on top of his game.
At 45, his driving skills haven't eroded. His drive here last
Saturday, when he put his race car on the pole, proved that he
hasn't lost his skills. That qualifying effort showed his
competitors that Luyendyk, the Flying Dutchman, the 500 champion in
1990 and 1997, is ready to take flight once again. Driving the Fred
Treadway Racing G-Force-Aurora, Luyendyk is more than just a
sentimental favorite.
</P>
<P>
   So, why now?
</P>
<P>
   The thought of retiring first crossed his mind three years ago.
It was a crystal clear day here in May. Luyendyk was speeding
around the track during a routine practice session when the
trackside yellow caution lights began flashing. He pulled onto pit
lane. Scott Brayton, Luyendyk's close friend and former teammate,
had crashed at high speed into the Turn 2 wall after losing a tire.
Half an hour later, he was dead. At that moment, Luyendyk says, he
knew. He did not want to risk his life for a paycheck much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now at my age, I decided I've had enough,'' said Luyendyk. ``I
believe I'm still competitive. And I think I would be two years
from now. But I don't want to find out that I've lost my reflexes
when I'm in the race car. I want to be ahead of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things change. You have different interests when you get
older. Now, on Sundays, I would like to be on my boat as much as
driving my race car.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk's wife, Mieke, influenced his decision. She too was
devastated by Brayton's death. So before the 1996 500, Luyendyk
told her that he would retire if he won. He ran well, but was
caught up in a late wreck.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he told Mieke the same thing: He would quit if he won.
This time he did win, beating Scott Goodyear in the final lap, and
she reminded him of his promise. But he couldn't quit, he explained
to her. There were too many obligations to his team and sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk now is sorry he didn't quit. Last year was a bitter
one, as Luyendyk crashed five cars. His most serious crash came
during the International Race of Champions here May 1998 when he
spun, hit the wall and was pulled from the wreckage unconscious.
That accident cemented his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't been thinking about it much,'' Luyendyk said
on Friday when asked about his Indy car farewell. ``I've been
thinking mostly about going fast and being competitive. That's what
is really on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Going fast has been on his mind at least since 1972, when he
began racing in Formula Vee series in the Netherlands. A year
later, he got his first victory, winning the Dutch Formula Ford
series. He won again in 1975 and continued winning championships on
small circuits in Europe until 1980, when he came to race in the
United States for the first time. In 1984, Luyendyk won the Bosch
Super Vee championship and made his Indy Car debut at Elkhart Lake,
Wis., where he finished eighth. The next May he was named rookie of
the year at his first Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk owns two Indy 500 qualifying records: 237.498 mph for a
single lap and an average of 236.986 mph for four laps, both set in
1996. He also holds the 500's average speed mark, 185.981 mph in
1990. He tops the list of money winners, having taken home more
than $5.2 million. He has seven Indy car victories in 166 starts
since making his American debut at Elkhart Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arie has had a wonderful career,'' said the driver Greg Ray.
``He's been a great spokesman for racing in general. He's a
gentleman. He races you clean on the track. He's very fast and he
certainly has that natural gift for the speedway. He's able to get
something out of the car that's not always there.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of Indianapolis has embraced Luyendyk. Last Thursday,
the final day of practice, was Arie Luyendyk Day, and Luyendyk,
long a fan favorite, was given a key to the city by Mayor Steve
Goldsmith.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's next for someone who seems to have everything?
</P>
<P>
   He's already a television commentator for Fox on its Indy Racing
League series. And he will work as a consultant with Fred Treadway
Racing when he is not coaching his 17-year-old son, Arie Jr., who
is a rising star on the Formula Ford series in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll race as long he wants to race,'' Luyendyk said,
referring to Arie Jr., the oldest of his four children. ``I won't
force him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as no one forced him to quit. It is simply time. He was
given an ovation by the fans and the race crews when he drove down
pit lane after winning the pole last Saturday. Two days ago,
Goodyear, who lost to him in '97, presented him with a transparent
case, inside of which was the autographed driving gloves from every
driver in Sunday's race, one more item for his collection of racing
memorabilia at home in Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his cool temperament and humility, Luyendyk hasn't
shown much emotion during the past week. But he knows when the
emotions will start flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the cool-down lap, I might take a long time to come around
so I can compose myself,'' he said with a sad smile.

REAL ESTATE: THE MAKING OF THE CHRYSLER CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Tishman Speyer Properties acquired the
landmarked Chrysler Building, with its stainless-steel peak,
gargoyles and elaborate lobby, it also took possession of a far
less glamorous structure at the other end of the block on 42nd
Street, an office building with the address of 666 Third Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Chrysler building, which was built as a prestige
project from the start (and was part of a race in the early '30s to
build the world's tallest building), 666 Third Ave. was
relentlessly average, with a tiny lobby, plain brick walls and an
inefficient layout.
</P>
<P>
   Named the Kent Building after its former owner, the late Jack
Kent Cooke, the structure was generally seen as an annex to the
Chrysler Building. Indeed some tenants occupied space in both
buildings at lower levels on the 43rd Street side, although the
floor levels do not match.
</P>
<P>
   Although most attention focused on the Chrysler Building, the
purchase included the entire block between Lexington and Third
avenues and 42nd and 43rd streets, with some smaller buildings
occupying the midblock area on 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners decided that with suitable alterations they could
brand the entire block as the Chrysler Center, and promptly put up
signs proclaiming the new name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we could create a new neighborhood there, an
eastern anchor for the new 42nd Street,'' said Valerie Peltier, an
official of Tishman Speyer who is the project manager for the
Chrysler Center. Tishman Speyer officials say the budget for the
entire Chrysler Center project is on the order of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Working with the architect Philip Johnson, company executives
decided to demolish the small midblock buildings, use some of the
air rights to add 130,000 square feet to the west side of what is
now being called the Chrysler East building, expand and embellish
the lobby and clad the entire building with a new metal and glass
facade.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining midblock space will be occupied by 85-foot-tall
triangular glass structures that Johnson calls trylons, that are
meant to evoke the distinctive shape of the top of the Chrysler
Building. Tishman Speyer officials say they expect to sign up a
first-class restaurant to occupy the space under the trylons.
</P>
<P>
   The addition to the east building was critical, said Ms.
Peltier. ``It was a side core building and it didn't work,'' she
said, referring to the section of a building that contains the
elevators, stairs and basic utilities that serve the adjacent
office space.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the addition to the western side of the building the
core area is now in the middle, and occupants of offices there can
walk easily from one side of a floor to another without bumping
into the core. Existing tenants have inquired about leasing space
in the new section of the building to unify their operations, said
Ms. Peltier, who is a daughter of Tishman Speyer's chief executive,
Jerry Speyer.
</P>
<P>
   The new space is column-free, so operations that require open
space, such as financial trading floors, can be accommodated.
</P>
<P>
   Although the project is far from complete, Tishman Speyer has
got an important vote of confidence. Credit Agricole Indosuez, a
French-based bank that is the product of the merger two years ago
of Credit Agricole and Banque Indosuez, is leaving two other
locations to occupy 130,000 square feet at Chrysler East.
</P>
<P>
   As a result they get to hang their name on the building, which
will become the Credit Agricole Indosuez building, its third name
in just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Steir, a broker at Julien J. Studley who represented
the bank, said the decision to move to the Third Avenue site from
locations on Avenue of the Americas and Madison Avenue was made
after an extensive study of real estate options, including the
possibility of moving out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Because operating in two locations made daily operations and
postmerger integration difficult, the bank wanted to consolidate
its operations in one location. And by moving the a new location,
the bank avoided the problems that might arise if one company moved
into the other's home office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see this as a trail-blazing location for an
international bank,'' Steir said. ``But when you examine the
quality of the renovation, the efficiency of the 32,000-square-foot
floorplates and the ability to expand over time and the economics,
the deal makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   By moving to that location, brokers said, the bank can save as
much as $10 a square foot in rent compared with prime locations in
the upper 40s and mid-50s. The bank will initially occupy the
seventh through 10th floors with expansion rights for the fifth and
sixth floors available for growth.
</P>
<P>
   And by signing up while the project was under way, the bank was
able to exert influence over the design and save money by avoiding
a duplication of efforts.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like most financial institutions with elaborate record-keeping
systems and trading operations, the bank wanted to install backup
generators to ensure a continued supply of electrical power in case
of a blackout. Since the building owners wanted generators for
other sections of the building, the prospective tenant and landlord
worked together on the installation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to open the sidewalk to lower in the generators, so
you don't want to have to do that twice,'' Steir said. ``They can
also share some things, like air shafts for the exhaust pipes. In
general, a tenant can significantly lower the cost of installing
power and telecommunications if it is done before the renovation is
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank expects to move in next April. Its move was delayed
over complications involved with converting to the new European
currency, the euro, and preparations for dealing with the year 2000
computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Agricole Indosuez's metal sign will hang over a greatly
revised and enlarged lobby. ``There really wasn't a lobby there
before, just three hallways from street entrances to the
elevators,'' Ms. Peltier said.
</P>
<P>
   The enlarged lobby will be faced with white granite and graced
with art works and other Class A building touches. ``It is going to
look like a Park Avenue office building,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The building's other systems, the heating and ventilating, the
power and telecommunications are all being improved, she said, but
the elevators turned out not to be a problem. ``They had been
redone in the '90s,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the most obvious changes are being made to the east
building, there is plenty of work to do on the Chrysler Building
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it involves the facade which, though protected as a
landmark, must be brought into compliance with city regulations
intended to prevent pieces from falling off buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to replace bricks in the facade due to deterioration,''
Ms. Peltier said. ``So we had some bricks made up and took them to
landmarks for permission to use them on the building. The bricks
that were in storage were useless.'' In addition to replacing
bricks, contractors are replacing lintels and repointing the mortar
on much of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes of the past are being repaired in the lobby of the
Chrysler Building, where temporary lights now help illuminate a
mural on the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The mural had been hard to view, both because it had been poorly
coated in the past and because holes had been cut in it in the past
to accept recessed light fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to spend a couple of hundred thousand dollars repairing
the holes in the ceiling that had been cut for light cans,'' Ms.
Peltier said. She said the temporary lighting would eventually be
replaced by fixtures that produce subdued, but adequate light,
similar to the lighting at Rockefeller Center, which Tishman Speyer
also manages.
</P>
<P>
   One issue still under discussion is how to actually build
Johnson's trylons, which will tilt at odd angles to each other.
``It has taken months to do the engineering for them,''she said.
``The concept is cool, but the trick is to figure out how to make
them stand up.''

DRUG-TESTING CONTROVERSY OVERSHADOWS GIRO D'ITALIA
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ That's some battle going on, isn't it, in the Giro
d'Italia, the world's second-most important bicycle race? Constant
attacks, challenges, everybody on the offensive, champions refusing
to yield.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what's happening away from the race.
</P>
<P>
   The race? They're also having a race? This year's Giro is not
simply a three-week fight over drug testing, politics and turf?
</P>
<P>
   That's only the way it looks. The Giro is more than half over.
It finishes in Milan on June 6, and the drug issue has dwarfed
anything taking place on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Marco Pantani, the winner of the last Giro and the Tour
de France, and forget his victory last weekend when he simply rode
away from everybody. Forget Laurent Jalabert, ranked second in the
world, and the way he crushed the field last Sunday in the first of
two time trials, taking back the overall leader's pink jersey from
Pantani, who finished an unexpected third. Jalabert was still in
that jersey as the race took a day off Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Mario Cipollini, who has won three sprints and broke his
tie with the immortal Eddy Merckx for a record 25 victories in the
Giro. Cipollino now has 28 victories, and counting. Forget the
emergence of the sprinter Ivan Quaranta, at 24 eight years younger
than Cipollini and nearly his equal in this race with two victories
before he dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Think, instead, Philippo Casagrande, ranked 183rd in the world,
who failed a doping test and continues nevertheless to ride for the
Vini Caldirola team from Italy. Think another unknown, Guido
Trombetta of Mobilvetta, who failed the same test and also remains
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Think Lampre, Saeco and Polti, three Italian teams that refuse
to take the tests that Casagrande and Trombetta failed.
</P>
<P>
   Their defense is that the tests are administered by the Italian
National Olympic Committee, which is seeking to re-establish itself
after it was discredited last year in a coverup of doping in
soccer. The riders, and their governing body, the International
Cycling Union, do not recognize the right of the Olympic Committee
to test them.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation began building as the race set off in Sicily
on May 16 and the International Cycling Union tested the number of
red blood cells _ the hematocrit level _ in each of the 162 riders.
A level above 50 percent is regarded as proof of doping with the
synthetic hormone erythropoietin (EPO), an illegal
performance-enhancing drug that is undetectable in standard tests.
EPO allows more oxygen to reach tired muscles by augmenting the red
blood cells that carry oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the riders exceeded the 50 percent norm and were barred
from the race, following a practice that has been in effect for
three years. Then the pack set off in sweltering heat for the usual
first week of mass sprint finishes.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to the Dolomites. On May
21, the Italian National Olympic Committee sent its doctors to
check two teams, or 16 riders, not for their hematocrit level but
for creatinuria, a substance that indicates diluted blood. When an
athlete has been using EPO and faces a drug test, a standard way of
passing it is to dilute his blood with a saline solution. The
Olympic Committee's reasoning is that diluted blood indicates EPO
use and thus it accused two of 16, not two of 162 as the
International Cycling Union did.
</P>
<P>
   Thereupon the riders rebelled. Pantani, their leader on and off
the road, promised that one more attempt by the Olympic Committee
to test them and they would all go home. ``We're racers, not blood
donors,'' he said. The race organizers looked elsewhere for
support.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the International Cycling Union, through its
president, Hein Verbruggen, said in a letter to the organizers that
his group did not recognize the jurisdiction of the Olympic
Committee. That freed the teams to refuse further tests unless they
were administered by the cycling union. On Tuesday, 15 riders from
three teams passed such a test; nobody failed it.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Italian teams, only Mapei agreed to take further
Olympic Committee tests, and pledged to finish the Giro. As a
result, the team leader, Andrea Tafi, has been slurred and
threatened by riders from other teams.

FEMALE YACHT MANAGER IS AN AMERICA'S CUP FIRST
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Dawn Riley, the skipper and founder of a
San Francisco America's Cup syndicate, introduced the mayor here at
her yacht's christening last Wednesday, she referred to him as
``Millie.'' His name is Willie.
</P>
<P>
   It was a slip of the tongue that made Willie Brown laugh. But
the gender flub probably had deeper meaning for anyone wanting to
delve into the psyche of the first woman in the 148-year history of
the America's Cup to manage her own yacht-racing syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, Riley's is the first coed team. Except for
token crew positions for women, and a failed attempt at an
all-women's crew in 1995, the America's Cup is a parapet of male
domination.
</P>
<P>
   For Riley, a coed team makes the most sense. ``The bottom line
is, every job on the boat has its own specific requirements,'' she
said last Thursday. ``If you look at both men and women, you have
the perfect combination _ power, agility, finesse and knowledge.
Together on a team, they become very efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   At 34, Riley is the only female sailor in the world with crew
experience in two America's Cup campaigns. With her team's new
75-foot yacht, America True, becoming the first U.S. boat to be
commissioned for the 1999-2000 races, Riley has moved from
contender to front-runner. At least until someone else's new boat
is christened.
</P>
<P>
   ``She certainly deserves a lot of credit here,'' said Buddy
Melges, the veteran America's Cup skipper who was her America3 boss
in the 1992 cup trials, and a current crew coach. ``If this boat is
fast, they've got as good a chance as anybody to win the cup back.
Boat speed is going to be the determining factor. But at this
point, Dawn's got a boat now to rally her team and crew with.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley did not actually launch America True at its christening
party. As a matter of fact, the yacht remained shrouded in a
blue-and-white tarp with shrink-wrap underneath, the slender hull
shape as hidden as a chocolate caramel still sealed in foil. But to
mark the official opening of her campaign, Riley had Melges throw a
bucket of San Francisco Bay water across the boat's topside.
</P>
<P>
   Riley apologized for the deception under the guise of America's
Cup secrecy. To catch a glimpse of the yacht's brightly painted
hull_ deep yellow with a linear graphic of peaks in red, black,
white and blue _ the audience of about 100 onlookers was allowed to
see only a swatch of color at the sailboat's stern. A poster
rendition of the yacht would have to do, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other team, Prada of Italy, has launched a new boat so
far. That leaves 11 other international syndicates still building
new boats, or planning on them. Four of those teams are American.
Yet even for Riley, sailing is a month away. The yacht will have to
wait until its arrival by ship in Auckland, New Zealand, in June
before the first waves pass its bow. The challenger trial races
begin Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are spending millions to outfit and campaign one or two
new boats. Overall, design innovation is their most expensive
commodity. Already a stir is being caused by leaks that one or more
cup syndicates, including the New Zealanders, are testing out new
wing shapes for masts. The idea, used mostly by multihull
designers, improves sail efficiency and, ultimately, boat speed.
</P>
<P>
   Riley would not disclose whether America True would have one.
But with a budget of $20 million, her San Francisco Yacht Club
syndicate has pared itself down from early hopes for a $28 million
package. That has meant building one new America's Cup contender
instead of two, as the rules allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a one-boat program, it's critical to get down there and
get confidence,'' Riley said. ``We feel we could completely modify
this boat if we had to, but it's not something we are
considering.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategy, of course, is part of winning. Paul Cayard, Riley's
opponent across San Francisco Bay, is founder of America One, a
syndicate sponsored by the city's St. Francis Yacht Club. But he
sees no reason to take his team to Auckland so early.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no advantage to going to New Zealand now,'' Cayard
said. ``Their party line is they want to be practicing on the
Auckland race course. But not if it's blowing 50 knots. It's winter
down there, and half the time you can't go sailing at this time of
year anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley ignores the criticism. ``You have to rise above it,'' she
said. She hopes to do the same thing in competition in New Zealand
this fall.

SPORTS COLUMN: 2 FRIENDS AND THE PUZZLE OF THE KNICKS' POPULARITY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)   (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They have partied together, and lived together, and
cried together. Mark Jackson confides in his best friend, Dave
Snowden, and so he has logged on to his computer several times this
past week and e-mailed his unexpurgated forecasts of how the New
York Knicks-Indiana Pacers showdown will go.
</P>
<P>
   Snowden, in turn, has responded with his own playoff prophecy,
brief, but directly to the point guard: ``Knicks,'' he says,
defiantly, ``in six.''
</P>
<P>
   He loves Mark Jackson like a brother but has found it impossible
to relinquish the Knicks as his team. Madison Square Garden is
where he served as a ballboy, where he is currently and gainfully
employed. Of course, he will celebrate with Jackson if the Pacers
advance, but he is for the Knicks, as he says he was long before he
became the Garden's director of disabled services in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His best friend is just one familiar piece to another city's
puzzle but, as Snowden said, ``I'm a New York guy and I've rooted
for the Knicks, no matter who they've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Who these Knicks have and what kind of organization they
represent is a subject that could make world-renowned sociologists
sound like sports talk radio. It is difficult at times to
understand the Knicks' popularity, and, at least for some,
uncomfortable to defend. I know more than a few Knick fans who
wonder if there will be a judgment-day price to pay for Latrell
Sprewell, who cringe at the ``Big L'' preening of Larry Johnson,
who have been appalled by the locker-room proselytizing of Charlie
Ward.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years at least, Knicks officials have been squabbling and
stabbing each other in the back, while the corporate bosses have
unaccountably hid behind well-groomed caretakers like Dave
Checketts. The basketball team that will seize hold of the city
late Sunday afternoon and not let go until its work is complete
also happens to be one that operates beyond the affordability of
most families, and whose parent company has positioned itself to
further propagate its earnings from television as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet beyond the broadcasting rights, which Charles Dolan's
Cablevision has monopolistically pursued in partnership with Rupert
Murdoch, has come ownership of the uniform, the history, the
memories. No matter how objectionable and dysfunctional these
Knicks have been, they are an extension of the legacy created by
Red Holzman's championship teams. Mark Jackson and Chris Mullin and
Sam Perkins are Pacers who could tell us more about the outer
boroughs than any current Knick, but the Garden is midtown, and
represents the heart of the beloved city game.
</P>
<P>
   As Dave Snowden said in so many words, the roots of Knick
rooting run much deeper than Penn Station. Besides, the comportment
of their fans has often been as distasteful as the behavior of the
most insufferable Knick.
</P>
<P>
   Snowden, 33, was a ballboy for the Knicks in the mid-1980s, on
the night the Garden handed out Patrick Ewing posters and the fans
returned them as projectiles, using Ewing and his then-hapless
teammates as targets. It was Snowden's job to help clear the court,
but what he remembers most was the astonished look on Ewing's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a human being with a family,'' Snowden said. ``At some
point, you've got to realize it's just basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowden has been too close for too long not to know that is not
going to happen anytime soon. Agonizing over the Knicks has become
a rite of New York spring, like hungrily consuming a thick deli
sandwich with fatty meat that leaves behind an aching heart. The
debate over the Knicks and their 26-year pursuit of a third
championship reached new discord levels this volatile season,
raging on in the organization and the stands and along press row
like so many cab drivers honking away at each other in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   It all reminded Snowden of a decade ago, when a Jackson not
named Phil was being hailed as the savior, when his friend was a
hot, young Knick and Snowden became business adviser to the
homegrown point guard from St. Albans, Queens, and St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   They had met in college, when Jackson was a sophomore and
Snowden a freshman, and Jackson's parents invited him to stay at
their home to alleviate the weekday commute to Amityville, N.Y.
Snowden shared Mark's early highs and later lows, until one fateful
night, July 9, 1991, when a car crawled along 197th Street and the
window rolled down and bullets sprayed all around the street near
the Jackson home.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a parked car, an innocent bystander, Snowden never
saw the gun. Five bullets left him in a wheelchair and the Jacksons
inconsolable, but it was one of those random acts in a city then
overrun with violent crime and a basketball team coincidentally
earning its reputation for thuggish play. In the years since the
shooting, since Mark Jackson left the Knicks, the friendship
remained a constant in Snowden's radically altered life, Mark there
for him, Snowden there for Mark when Jackson's father, Harry, died
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, after Snowden underwent rehabilitation of the body
and mind, Madison Square Garden gave him a job. The cold and
calculated corporation does have the leverage to command attention,
loyalty, and sometimes it can even convince the masses it is worthy
of their love.
</P>
<P>
   After he put Meg Ryan's children's book shop out of business in
the film ``You've Got Mail,'' didn't Tom Hanks wind up with her in
his arms? The superstore is what these Knicks remind me of,
spending wildly, wreaking havoc with mom-and-pop values, but
finally, forcefully, making everyone in the neighborhood admit that
they've got game.
</P>
<P>
   The small-market Pacers wanted to believe that their
championship plans in the post-Jordan season would not involve
shopping for a victory in New York. There was a Sunday afternoon
late last month when the Knicks, in a calamitous slump, were losing
in Miami by 20 points, with the Pacers glued to their television
sets in a New Jersey hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Snowden was visiting in Mark Jackson's room, where the
telephone would ring every few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Reggie Miller calling, poking a needle through the line.
``He kept saying, `Your boys are done,''' Snowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Which at the time matched the sentiments of most Knicks fans.
Surprise. The Knicks were about to evolve into a more artistic
team. They rallied to win in Miami that day. They reopened the
possibility of lasting achievement, or leaving the city with fresh,
deeper wounds. Love is too simple an emotion to describe the area's
relationship with its pro basketball team. It is more love-hate,
the inherent paradox of daily life in New York, New York.

LUKAS MAKES HIMSELF HEARD AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Wis., Wyo.)  (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ He calls them box-office horses, superstars
that can put a stable on the racing map. D. Wayne Lukas found his
first one 26 years ago in a gray mare named Native Empress whom he
had claimed for $3,500. She was one of seven horses the
coach-turned-trainer showed up with at Los Alamitos race track in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Native Empress was a 5-year-old, which by quarter horse
standards meant her peak earning years had passed. Lukas was broke
and unknown, a trainer from El Paso, Texas, desperate to go big
time. For Lukas, Native Empress ran to the Los Alamitos horse of
the year award in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   And Lukas ran her in a way that would come to embody his
record-breaking, sometimes controversial career. He was part
horseman, part horse trader. Eight times, he sold the mare _ the
last for $250,000. But each time she remained in his stable.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lukas leaned on a sawhorse outside his immaculate
barn at Churchill Downs with his cowboy hat pulled low and stared
from behind his ear-to-ear aviator shades and remembered Native
Empress.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, his latest superstar, Charismatic, shuffled in a stall,
one race from winning the Triple Crown. Three months ago, the colt
was running in a claiming race. Now, the chestnut has run four
times in the last eight weeks and won three major stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Lukas was believed to be a second-string
player in the Triple Crown races he has thoroughly dominated. Now,
he is once again the star of the spring, and he has also been
honored with induction into racing's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to have that big horse, that superstar, to get
noticed,'' Lukas said. ``To remind people we're still out here. And
winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, 63, is a proud man who dislikes the suggestion that he
ever lost his touch _ as much as he dislikes the perception that
the Lukas way means pushing horses close to, and often past, their
breaking points. He was cordial but irritated as he ticked off his
accomplishments: The unprecedented 14 training titles for earnings.
The record 19 Eclipse Award winners. The 12 trips to the winner's
circle in the Triple Crown races.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an arrogant man,'' said John Nerud, the Hall of Fame
trainer of the 1957 Belmont winner, Gallant Man. ``He's got his
opinions, and they come out quick. He wants you to hear them and
listen to them. But I believe he has earned that right for all he's
done for the game.'' Nerud gave Lukas the 1980 Preakness winner,
Codex, to train and became his friend and mentor when Lukas made
the transition to thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has made sure he has been heard, listened to and seen. He
pioneered a corporate approach with satellite stables coast to
coast manned by assistants to ensure he was represented at the best
races on any given day. It has helped his horses run off with a
record $199.4 million in purse earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has worked the box seats and turf clubs at race tracks in
expensive suits and with burning zeal to woo potential owners. He
has seduced enough of them to spend close to $200 million at horse
sales. His clients have ranged from the late owner of the San Diego
Chargers, Eugene V. Klein, to the rap artist Hammer, to the
hard-boot Kentucky industrialist William T. Young, to Satish Sanan,
whose Padua Stables in Ocala, Fla., spent $22.4 million at yearling
sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Lukas flew in his own corporate jet to race tracks
and training tracks across the nation to check on his 250 horses.
He drove his Rolls-Royce to meet with owners. He offered stock in a
stable that ultimately failed at a cost of $4 million to investors.
</P>
<P>
   From 1985 to 1990, Lukas' owners bought 337 yearlings at a cost
of $104.6 million, according to the Jockey Club's Equine Line
computer service. They bought what he told them to, relying on an
eye first developed as a boy in Wisconsin who would purchase horses
intended for the slaughterhouse and resell them to local farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were living in fairy tale land,'' Lukas said. ``We were
compulsive buyers. I still am. You walk a good-looking saddle pony
in front of me, and I want to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he turned his classy stock into a single-season
earnings record for a trainer, winning $17,842,358 in purses. But
in the '90s, the fairy tale faded into a parable about living too
large and too loud.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas lost $3.1 million of his own money when Calumet Farm, a
client and partner in ownership and breeding, went bankrupt in
1991. It was hardly his worst loss in a humbling decade.
</P>
<P>
   His integrity and horsemanship were savaged when Union City, a
horse some believed was not sound, fractured a leg during the 1993
Preakness Stakes and did not survive. Other breakdowns by Lukas
stars followed.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 Preakness winner, Tabasco Cat, was retired with a leg
injury at the age of 4; the 1994 champion juvenile filly, Flanders,
broke a bone in the Breeders' Cup and was retired. The 1995
Preakness winner, Timber Country, strained leg tendons and was
retired on the eve of the Belmont, and the 1995 Kentucky Derby
winner, Thunder Gulch, fractured a canon bone in his foreleg five
months after the Derby at the Jockey Club Gold Cup and was also
retired. In 1996, the Kentucky Derby winner Grindstone was injured
and retired while preparing for the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of his tactics came as Lukas was losing owners and
remained mired in a slump. His horses did not win a Grade I race
for more than two years, and Lukas fell from the top of the
trainers' standings in 1993. In the midst of the professional
setbacks, Lukas almost lost his son and top assistant, Jeff, when
Tabasco Cat ran over and nearly killed him in the barn area at
Santa Anita in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff sustained multiple skull fractures, lapsed into a coma and
almost died when his brain swelled and nearly herniated his brain
stem. He spent months in the hospital and years in rehabilitation,
but has returned to the Lukas barn in an administrative role. ``I
have bounced a few times, but that was the hardest thing,'' his
fathep said. ``I'm just grateful he's b!ck with us.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been Jeff, after all, who had organized a surprise
intervention for his father after Union City's breakdown. The
trainer had become isolated and depressed as attacks on his methods
mounted. Jeff Lukas gathered friends of his father _ some from his
childhood in Wisconsin _ at his home in California. For seven
hours, they took turns telling Lukas what he had meant to them. And
Lukas told them his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think I was down or anything, but it meant a
lot to have these people show they cared about me,'' he said.
``They supported me.'' He vehemently denies the charges that he is
hard on horses. Lukas attributes the breakdowns to the large size
of his stable and to his owners' interest in winning the lucrative
2- and 3-year-old races when the horses are developing and fragile.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas understands tha this bravado has alienated some rivals and
especially the news media. He points to the rough trips that the
Edward Plesa-trained filly Three Ring had in the Kentucky Derby and
another filly, the Bob Baffert-trained Excellent Meeting, had in
the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had trained those horses, I would have been absolutely
barbecued,'' Lukas said. ``Just ripped up because, I guess, I rub
people the wrong way.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has his defenders. Carl Nafzger, the trainer of the
Florida Derby winner Vicar, is one. The direct opposite of Lukas,
Nafzger is a real cowboy from Wyoming who prefers a smaller,
slower-developing stable.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Vicar, his only Derby horse was the 1990 winner,
Unbridled, who also went on to win the Breeders' Cup Classic that
year. In fact, Nafzger still bristles that Lukas' Criminal Type won
Horse of the Year over Unbridled in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne out-campaigned me. Old Criminal Type got sore ankles
before the Breeders' Cup and was retired so he couldn't race my
horse,'' he said with a disbelieving wink. ``It just shows Wayne is
smarter and shrewder than me. But he doesn't run unsound horses.
That's pure envy talking when anyone says that. He has a program
geared to winning early. He's a coach and he pushes his athletes _
that's the nature of the game. The thing about him is he's got
energy and goals. When he is on top he builds; when he is on the
bottom he builds.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Lukas' consistency, the Hall of Fame trainer Nerud says,
that has made him one of the best of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A shed row is a hospital, and Wayne had the best of everything
_ feed, hay, wraps,'' said Nerud, now 86. ``Even when he didn't
have much he always acted like the first-class horseman that he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been a detail and image man ever since his days as a high
school basketball coach and in the backwaters of quarter-horse
racing. He still rises at 3 a.m. each day and expects his barn to
be raked in symmetrical rows when he arrives at 4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stalls can be perfect, but if a saddle pony don't look
right or the pony tack isn't gleaming, he'll get all over you,''
said Randy Bradshaw, his California-based assistant. ``He always is
looking for a way to motivate you.''
</P>
<P>
   When Churchill Downs' Julian Wheat came by recently to tell
Lukas his workers had won barn of the month for upkeep and would
receive free pizza, the trainer stopped what he was doing. ``We
have the best barn every day of the year; it's nice of you to
recognize that once in a while,'' he hollered loud enough for his
employees to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has toned down his superstar image, sort of. The
Rolls-Royce has been replaced by a pickup truck, the jet traded for
commercial flights. ``You can buy a whole lot of first-class
tickets for a million a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has 160 horses in training _ one of them, Charismatic, will
try to become only the 12th Triple Crown winner. He concedes that
running Charismatic in a claiming race in which anyone with $62,500
could have bought him was his own mismanagement. So were a few
other things. But is he humbled? Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is like the NCAA tournament,'' he said. ``Coaches
rise up and win one now and then. But there was only one John
Wooden. I think I have proved I can sustain that high level of
excellence. And I believe we're going to be this good for a long
time.''

 &HT;    Witches stir the pot at Barr's town meeting
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr preached to the choir at a town meeting Saturday,
but he still contended with a chorus of witches in between the
``amens'' that favored banning Wiccan religion on military bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Republican fielded questions from witches,
Christians and other constituents in a packed room at Cobb County
library in Marietta. Barr criticized the commander of Fort Hood
this month for allowing a Wiccan rite on the Texas Army base.
</P>
<P>
   Wicca is a pagan, nature-centered religion, also known as
witchcraft. It has tax-exempt status as do mainstream religions and
is rooted in pre-Christian Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you afraid of witches?'' Amber Maeve Szmanski of Acworth,
a high priestess in the Grove of the Winged Scarab, asked between
interruptions from Barr supporters. ``Our Founding Fathers had more
intelligence than to try to establish a state religion. If you
remove the Wiccan, who will be next on your list?''
</P>
<P>
   Barr told the crowd of 120 that Wicca threatened to erode
military discipline _ a fear not uttered publicly by military
commanders _ and the First Amendment needed to take a backseat to
that concern.
</P>
<P>
   He favored the free exercise of Wicca in civilian life or by
soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen off military bases. He
claimed officially sanctioning Wicca would open the door to other
religious practices, such as peyote use by Native Americans. The
Department of Defense is drawing up regulations to cover the use of
the hallucinogenic drug, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr would leave it to elected leaders to decided which
religions could be practiced in the military, he said, adding that
it wasn't unreasonable to ban Wicca services on a military base
while permitting worship by Christians, Jews and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a nation that believes in God,'' he said. ``It's on our
money. It's on our documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the audience supported Barr, who received a standing
ovation and testimonials to his character. Several in the crowd
giggled at the Wiccans or tried to shout down ones protesting
Barr's letter to Fort Hood's commanding officer, Lt. Gen. Leon S.
LaPorte, asking him to ``stop this nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Hood celebration was described as a rite of spring
marking the vernal equinox, with more than 50 witches, male and
female, participating.

 &HT;    Big tournaments are big business in small towns
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the U.S. Women's Open comes to tiny West Point, Miss.,
population 12,500, and Old Waverly Golf Club this week, the goal is
to continue what's been a pretty good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Golf Association and the LPGA Tour players have learned
the value of secondary-market areas for their showcase event. Bring
the tournament to a place where it's clearly the biggest deal in
town _ including the Columbus and Jackson area _ and the odds for
excitement are greatly increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely get a crowd that otherwise would be blase,''
said Atlanta's Bob Cupp, who designed Old Waverly with former U.S.
Open champion Jerry Pate.
</P>
<P>
   Cupp also is part of a formula that has worked successfully in
the past for the USGA and the U.S. Women's Open. Old Waverly is
Cupp's fourth course to be used for the tournament; the most recent
had been Pumpkin Ridge Golf Club near Portland, Ore., in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the women like them,'' Cupp said about his courses.
``There's not any kind of billy-goat action.''
</P>
<P>
   The courses have no mammoth hills to wear out players and
further slow the pace of play. Last year's site, windblown
Blackwolf Run in Kohler, Wis., a Pete Dye layout that had hosted an
Andersen Consulting World Championship U.S. final, proved too
difficult for many players. Cupp's Pumpkin Ridge Witch Hollow
course, where Tiger Woods previously won his third consecutive U.S.
Amateur, evolved as a fairer, picturesque venue. It found
additional fanfare from the near-win by the LPGA's living icon,
Nancy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Cupp is not fond of the term signature hole, because it tends to
belittle the other 17, but he concedes that Old Waverly's par-4
18th, which the women will play to about 380 yards, has the
potential for pivotal peril _ especially with holes cut to the
green's left side, where water and bunkers crowd approach shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard hole,'' he said. ``The player who bails out takes
a real chance on a three-putt.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Se Ri Pak, who toured the 6,433-yard Old
Waverly course earlier in the spring, described the place as ``hot
and boring.'' But she probably meant that she was excited about a
Women's Open held at ``a quiet place where you can concentrate and
get more rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez has played the course several times; she has participated
in an annual pro-am tournament there.
</P>
<P>
   England's Laura Davies, the 1987 champion, likes the idea of a
longer, more demanding layout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to hit 3-irons and 4-irons into some of the
par-4's,'' said Davies, the LPGA's longest hitter. ``It's nice to
be really challenged. I don't like all these easy courses we
play.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of actually getting the Women's Open to Old Waverly
was spearheaded by George Bryan, of hot dog and luncheon meat fame.
The presentation by Bryan and his family blew away the USGA
committee during the 1995 tournament at the Broadmoor in Colorado
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Why Mississippi? Why Old Waverly?''' said Mary Capouch,
chairwoman of the USGA Women's Committee. ``We've been asked that a
lot. We like to take the championships to as many regions of the
country as we possibly can. There's never been a national
championship of any sport in Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to hit a familiar reference point for the South,
television ads in the West Point area have billed the Women's Open
as being to women's golf ``what the Daytona 500 is to NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament's usual July date was moved up a month,
attempting to avoid the most intense Mississippi summer heat.
Kendra Graham, the USGA's director of women's championships, said
the crowd might not equal the record 25,000 per day that attended
at Blackwolf Run, ``but if it isn't, it won't be for lack of
trying.''

 &HT;    Victims' parents attend SCLC gun buyback
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reason the parents of one of the victims of the Columbine
High School massacre were in Atlanta on Saturday seemed apparent:
Attending a gun buyback, they represened the families of the slain
students.
</P>
<P>
   But Vonda Shoels, mother of Isaiah Shoels, said that by making
the trip at the request of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, she and her husband, Michael, were actually keeping a
vow they had made to their son before his killing last month at the
Colorado high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaiah asked his father and I what would we do if someone got
a gun and killed all our kids,'' Vonda Shoels told about 75 people
at the National Football League's Youth Education Town Atlanta.
``We asked him if he was being threatened. He said no. We told him
vengeance is the Lord's, but we would speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a father, I got forceful and he told me it was just
hypothetical. I told him whatever foul play took you out, I'll
preach against that the rest of my life,'' said Michael Shoels.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Our children are dying for no reason at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Also present were Roger and Yvonne Thomas, the parents of 13
year-old Geno Thomas, who was gunned down April 22 near Martin
Luther King Jr. Middle School, which is next dto the NFL center.
They were joined by Martin Luther King III of the SCLC and Brenda
Muhammad, director of the Victim Witness Program.
</P>
<P>
   The SCLC's buyback was organized in part as a response to the
violence two weeks ago at Heritage High School in Conyers, Ga.,
where a student despondent over a breakup with his girlfriend
wounded six other students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the solution, but a step we are taking in our
community,'' said King.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women brought guns in brown bags, briefcases,
pocketbooks and shoeboxes. They stood in a line that at one point
numbered 50 people, waiting to exchange the guns for vouchers good
for a $50 payment. The guns collected will be destroyed, SCLC
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Colbert of East Point, was one of the first people in
line. He said he wanted to get rid of his gun because he has a
17-year-old at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he would use it, but I want to keep the
temptation away and have it destroyed,'' Colbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Ooten, 15 a Young Middle School student, accompanied his
godmother, Mary Jenkins, as she turned in a pistol she had hidden
from her brother two years ago. The teen said he supports the
program because he believes the fewer guns there are on the
streets, the better the chance he will be around to realize his
goal of becoming a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The periodic gun buybacks started in 1993 and have been held
``off and on'' since then, said the Rev. E. Randel Osburn,
executive vice president and chief operating officer of the SCLC.
Osburn said the SCLC has paid out $480,000 through the years to
collect 10,000 guns _ 3,000 in Atlanta alone.

PITCHING PROSPECT OVERCOMES CANCER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Greg Montalbano, the Northeastern University left-handed
pitcher, is virtually assured of being selected in the major league
draft Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Montalbano, a 6-foot-2-inch, 192-pound native of Westborough,
Mass., throws a fastball that surpasses 90 mph. In 64.2 innings
this season, he had an 8-2 record, allowed 44 hits, walked 24,
struck out 71 and had an ERA of 2.09, third best in Division I.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all his success, Montalbano is concerned about the
future. It has nothing to do with his pitching or his draft
position; Montalbano only hopes he stays out of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Since February 1996, he has undergone five surgical procedures
to remove cancerous and noncancerous tumors. In addition, he
underwent two three-week sessions of chemotherapy, which cost him
hair and weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been mentally tough for me,'' Montalbano said. ``This
thing has been dragged out for three years and it gets difficult to
deal with after a while. But I think the process has made me
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The first operation Montalbano had was when he was 18 years old
and a standout at St. John's High School in Shrewsbury, Mass.
Doctors discovered a cancerous tumor in his right testicle. In June
1996, he again underwent surgery after a nodule was discovered in
his right lung. After the procedure, he began the chemotherapy
treatments and redshirted his freshman year at Northeastern in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The third operation came in September 1996, when Montalbano had
two noncancerous tumors removed from his right lung. In order to
reach the tumors, doctors had to collapse his lung and make an
incision that stretched from his spine to his sternum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used my setbacks as motivation because I just wanted to get
back and play with the guys,'' Montalbano said. ``If the doctors
said it would take six weeks to get back, I would try to make it
back in five and a half, without putting myself at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Montalbano says his cancer has been in remission since March
1996 and he is looking forward to the draft. Scouts from the
Anaheim Angels, the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Boston Red Sox, the
Cincinnati Reds, the Colorado Rockies, the Milwaukee Brewers, the
Philadelphia Phillies and the Toronto Blue Jays have all come to
see Montalbano pitch at some point this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a good fastball, curve ball and a changeup,'' John
Brickley, a Reds scouting supervisor for New England, upstate New
York and Montreal, said. ``Montalbano is a very savvy pitcher and
he knows how to set up the hitters and battle the hitters while he
is on the mound. He is very poised and possesses great tenacity,
which I think is a part of his character and makeup that he got
from battling cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the scouts have inquired about Montalbano's
health, he does not take it personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready and I am looking forward to the draft,'' Montalbano
said. ``A lot of things are being said about my draft position
right now, but it doesn't mean anything until I receive that phone
call from a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Montalbano made his Northeastern debut in 1997, posting a 4-2
record primarily as a reliever. His ERA was 2.56 in 56.1 innings,
and he struck out 51, allowed 49 hits and walked 13.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997 and February 1998, Montalbano underwent surgery
to remove noncancerous tumors from his pelvic area.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern coach Neil McPhee said he and the players could not
help thinking the worst when Montalbano had surgery. But each time,
Montalbano had a positive outlook and promised that he would be
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates have been very supportive,'' Montalbano said. ``I
think the deal was that they were unsure because this is so unusual
for them. I did the best I could to explain the situation because I
wanted them to have more information than questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Montalbano made it back to the mound. In 1998, he
had a 3-2 record, with an ERA of 3.28 and 34 strikeouts in 35.2
innings, allowing 38 hits and 11 walks. In 1999, he was even better
and became a major league prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an incredible contrast as to what he has gone through
and what he has achieved,'' McPhee said. ``To make a full recovery
and have a year like this, a dream season, is incredible.''

DESPITE GRIM TEST SCORES, A SCHOOL MARKS ITS SMALL TRIUMPHS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day was winding down in a hectic week for Magalie
Pierre's class of fourth graders at Public School 129 in Harlem,
and so a party was in order.
</P>
<P>
   Every party has to have a toast, and the duty on Friday fell
first on Juriel Gomez, who set aside his plate of pizza, grapes,
popcorn and macaroni, pushed back his tiny classroom chair, and
held aloft a plastic cup filled with soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``A toast, to everyone who did well on the reading test,''
Juriel said to applause, as other students rose to offer more
salutes to themselves, the school, Ms. Pierre, the principal _ even
the people who wrote the test _ so they could have this party.
</P>
<P>
   The students had not yet received their individual scores from
the first sitting of the state's new fourth-grade reading exam, but
the school did on Tuesday, along with the rest of the state. And at
first blush, the festive mood and the toasts might appear to
contradict the statistical reality.
</P>
<P>
   At PS 129, one of 97 city schools on the state's roster of
chronically low-performing schools, just 25 percent of the 95
fourth-graders met or exceeded the state standard. That was 8
percentage points below the citywide average of 33 percent, and 23
points below the state average of 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the school scored above other ``schools under registration
review,'' as those on the state roster are officially called; they
registered an average of 16 percent. And it ranked third among 13
schools in District 5, whose average was 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly N. Lewis, the principal, who had prepped her students
with extra tutoring over Christmas break and on weekends and wrote
a special reading curriculum with teachers, greeted the results
with a mixture of optimism and concern.
</P>
<P>
   The school may have fared better than its low-performing peers,
but it is still forever compared with schools across the state that
lack the social ills her pupils face.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every one of her 800 students in kindergarten through
sixth grade come to the school, at 425 West 130th Street, from
families poor enough to qualify for free lunch. A quarter of the
students live in a shelter for homeless families down the street.
</P>
<P>
   And on top of it all, the stakes are higher than ever. The
school system plans to begin holding back failing students in the
third, sixth and eighth grades as early as this year, and the
fourth through 12th next year. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, reacting to
the reading scores, has called for the dismissal of principals of
schools performing most poorly on this and other tests.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the fourth graders will take the state's new math
test, which like one on reading given in January, is said to be
more rigorous than previous standardized tests because it asks
students more analytic questions in addition to the usual
multiple-choice questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of our progress, but want everyone to be aware
we have a long way to go,'' Lewis said in her office, festooned
with slogans such as ``Readers Are Leaders'' and ``When You Believe
in Yourself, Anything is Possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone'' extends to the children, too. And so later on, in
Ms. Pierre's classroom, Lewis picked up a cup and offered her own
toast: ``I'd like to toast all the children. I'm very proud of you
and I know we are going to continue to make progress.''

IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO LEARN A LUTZ
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (rk) 
 By NANCY GAVILANES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After years of practicing her lutz jumps and lay-back
spins, Linda Frances is going to her first international figure
skating competition this weekend in Villard delans, France.
</P>
<P>
   As she fine-tunes her program set to the music of ``Titanic,''
Frances' goal is simply to ``bring the technical and artistic
elements together to give a good performance.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is nothing unusual about her goal, Frances is far
from being a typical skater. She first laced up skates when she was
in her late 30s and will be making her international debut at age
47.
</P>
<P>
   Perfecting her technique and interpreting her music is far more
important than winning medals or attempting triple jumps, said
Frances, who skates eight hours a week at Sky Rink at Chelsea Piers
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're not going to the Olympics,'' said Frances, who
started skating after watching the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary,
Alberta, on television.
</P>
<P>
   Adult skating exploded in the early 90s, in part because of an
increase in televised competitions as well as the exposure given
the sport by the Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding incident, and the
result is a demand for competitive events for these
boomers-who-would-be-skaters.
</P>
<P>
   This year's adult nationals, in April in Ann Arbor, Mich., drew
600 competitors between the ages of 25 and 72. At this weekend's
Mountain Cup, the first international event for nonelite adults, 98
skaters are set to compete, with 67 of them Americans.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the Mountain Cup, competitors must have tested
before U.S. Figure Skating Association judges. Skaters are divided
into four levels according to the spins and jumps they execute
(there is a separate masters category for adults who were
competitive skaters as children) and into four age groups: 18-24;
25-35; 36-45; and 46 and above.
</P>
<P>
   Programs, both interpretive numbers without jumps and freestyle
routines which require them, last no longer than two minutes and
are performed in front of International Skating Union judges.
</P>
<P>
   While there are 44,000 adults registered with the figure skating
association, there are countless others who do not get tested or
compete. Also, adults not interested in jumping always have the
option of competing in ice dancing or trace figures.
</P>
<P>
   Many skate because ``it's an art, a skill and a sport all
wrapped into one,'' said Denise Beaumont, 38, who has been coaching
for 16 years and has choreographed programs for Frances.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps no coincidence that the skating association's
commitment has come as adult skating has become a big untapped area
of growth. Still, the competitive appetite of these elder skaters
and the response of organizations seeking to feed it has surprised
even those in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my mind did I think I'd be taking adults to
international competitions,'' said Kenny Moir, 41, who has been
coaching for 14 years at Sky Rink.
</P>
<P>
   Moir plans to accompany four New Yorkers to France, and there he
will also be coaching Karla Morales from Ecuador, who taught
herself how to skate through books and videos. ``That somebody is
skating in Ecuador, and an adult no less, is a really great sign,''
Moir said.
</P>
<P>
   His New Yorkers _ from Frances to Laura Moore, 42, a designer
who skates at 5:30 a.m., to Rose Auslander, 44, an attorney who
practices at 8:30 a.m., to Helen Chan, 46, an architect who is on
the ice 10-15 hours a week _ have found ways to balance family
life, careers and their love of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't skate I would get depressed,'' said Chan. Chan has
found ice time easier to come by now that her two children are
teen-agers and she can work from home. Along with providing Chan
``a new physical challenge which is much harder than my work,''
skating has helped her bond with her daughter, Jordan, 15, who also
takes lessons.
</P>
<P>
   There is always a risk of injury, of course, especially to older
skaters. Just last year, Chan and Frances had accidents. Chan broke
her ankle and tore two ligaments while swerving to avoid a
collision with another skater, and Frances broke her leg when she
landed wrong after a jump. Did either skater contemplate quitting?
No way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just worked very hard to come back,'' Frances said.
</P>
<P>
   They are spending ``their own hard-earned money,'' as Beaumont
points out, and it's an expensive passion. There is ice time,
lessons and choreography. Costumes begin at $100, custom boots are
$500 and blades cost $300. And this doesn't even address travel
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it keeps us sane,'' Frances said of skating, ``it's worth
it.''.
</P>
<P>
   Chan said, ``As long as I can walk, I can skate.''

EDITORIAL: THE CHINA AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Sunday, May 30:
</P>
<P>
   Washington's battered relations with Beijing suffered serious
new damage last week from the Cox committee report on Chinese theft
of American nuclear and missile secrets. Working ties will have to
be rebuilt, but on more realistic foundations than before. While it
still makes sense to encourage China to open its economy and play a
constructive role in international affairs, Washington must give
clear priority to protecting American security.
</P>
<P>
   The report showed that for the past 20 years Beijing has
exploited its commercial and scientific exchanges with the United
States _ and lax security at American nuclear labs _ to learn how
to increase the power and range of its nuclear arsenal. During
those same years, Washington unwisely relaxed controls over
militarily sensitive exports to increase opportunities for
commercial gain, a tendency that grew during the Clinton
Administration. Congress and the White House must move quickly to
restore better balance to American policy.
</P>
<P>
   That does not require freezing discussions with China on every
subject from trade to Kosovo, as some in Congress now propose. It
is in America's interest to complete talks on Beijing's entry into
the World Trade Organization as soon as possible. Meanwhile,
China's favorable trade status under American law should be renewed
for another year.
</P>
<P>
   But changes are urgently needed in other areas to address the
specific security problems uncovered by the Cox report. The Senate
made a promising start on this last week. A bipartisan majority
approved a useful package of measures introduced by Trent Lott, the
Senate majority leader. These included increased Pentagon
monitoring of satellite sales to China and a strengthened role for
intelligence agencies in reviewing export licenses. The Senate
package also provides for more rigorous security training at the
nuclear labs, with the FBI supervising employee background checks.
It also requires the CIA to report to Congress on foreign efforts
to steal sensitive American technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites and their launch by Chinese rockets require
particular scrutiny, since they incorporate technology that can be
used in ballistic missiles. Advanced computer sales also need
careful review because these powerful machines can be used to
simulate missile trajectories and nuclear weapons tests. Ideally,
all countries capable of exporting such militarily sensitive goods
should adopt common restrictions. But absent that, the United
States, the world leader in advanced technology, must tighten its
own controls.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear lab security can be improved without compromising civil
liberties or scapegoating Chinese-Americans. All lab employees
doing sensitive weapons or computer work must be carefully vetted
and supervised. Those known to have shared inappropriate
information with foreign colleagues or to have copied restricted
files onto insecure computers should be excluded from such work and
denied top-secret clearances. Clearances should be administratively
suspended whenever a lab employee comes under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Academic interchange, through publications and conferences, is
essential to the labs' scientific work. Additionally, exchange
visits by foreign scientists, including those from Russia and
China, are essential to arms control programs that strengthen
American security. But all exchanges must be carefully planned and
monitored to avoid leakage of military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Clearer lines of jurisdictional authority should be established
among government agencies responsible for nuclear and computer
security. Top Justice Department officials need to be made aware of
and take charge of suspected cases of nuclear espionage. The FBI
and CIA both need to develop greater expertise on Chinese methods.
Continued engagement with China is a necessity. But it can be
pursued without carelessly exposing American military secrets.

 REAL ESTATE: 2 IMPORTANT CASES UPDATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two subjects previously addressed in this column _
one that affects many rental tenants in New York City co-op and
condominium buildings and another that will change the way buyers
and sellers of real estate in Westchester County do business with
one another and their brokers _ are now in need of updating.
</P>
<P>
   The first has been affected by two recent Housing Court cases
that are at odds with a controversial 1998 ruling by Judge Marc
Finkelstein in an eviction case in Housing Court in Brooklyn known
as Paikoff vs. Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 case involved an eviction proceeding against a rental
tenant in a six-unit co-op in Park Slope. The tenant, who rented
his apartment from the co-op's sponsor nearly five years after the
conversion had taken place, contested the sponsor's decision to
decline to renew his lease after it expired.
</P>
<P>
   The tenant argued that he was covered by the Martin Act _ a
section of the state's General Business Law that protects
nonpurchasing tenants in co-op or condominium conversions from
eviction except for cause.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Martin Act was widely believed to apply only to
tenants who occupied their apartments at the time of conversion,
lawyers for co-ops and condominiums were stunned when Finkelstein
extended Martin Act protection to the tenant even though the rental
occurred long after the conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer, said
at the time that the implications of the decision could be
``enormous'' and that it could render ``thousands of apartments in
hundreds of buildings virtually unsalable'' by giving protected
status to tenants who rented from sponsors subsequent to
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Miller, a Queens lawyer who specializes in co-ops and
condominiums, said that most co-op and condominium lawyers believe
that Finkelstein's decision was flawed because it was based on an
erroneous interpretation of a critical term in the law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Martin Act, Miller said, tenants who rent apartments
from a ``purchaser under the plan'' subsequent to a conversion are
not entitled to protected status. In practice, he said, that has
generally been interpreted to mean that tenants occupying their
apartments at the time of conversion are protected by the Martin
Act, while those who rent subsequent to the conversion are not,
regardless of who they rent from.
</P>
<P>
   Miller explained, however, that what Finkelstein did in his
decision was to declare that a sponsor _ who is, in legal
terminology, a ``holder of unsold shares'' _ was not a ``purchaser
under the plan.'' The judge then concluded, Miller said, that
tenants who rent from sponsors _ even those who rent after the
conversion _ are protected by the Martin Act because they are not
renting from a ``purchaser under the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing Court judges in two recent cases, however, declined to
adopt Finkelstein's interpretation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision issued last month in a case known as Pembroke
Square Associates vs. Coppola, Judge Ellis Franke of the Housing
Court in Queens ruled that a sponsor could indeed be considered a
``purchaser under the plan'' because of the way that phrase is
defined in the law itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definition only requires that the `purchaser' be one who
owns the shares to the apartment,'' Franke wrote in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he ruled, a tenant who rents from a sponsor
subsequent to conversion is not protected by the Martin Act.
</P>
<P>
   A similar conclusion was reached by Judge Bruce Kramer in
Manhattan in a decision issued on May 12. In that case, Kramer
pointed out that there was no evidence of any legislative intent to
provide Martin Act protection to tenants who rent sponsor-owned
apartments subsequent to the conversion of the building.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the Queens lawyer, said that given the clear language of
the statute, as pointed out by Franke and Kramer, it was unlikely
that either case would be overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, while the original Paikoff case is currently
being appealed, it likely that the appellate court will overturn it
for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we're back where we started,'' Miller said. ``And
that's good news for co-ops and condominiums.''
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester County matter concerns a 1997 attempt by real
estate brokers to prepare contracts of sale for their clients. The
column, which appeared on Feb. 16, 1997, reported that as a result
of a legal opinion issued by then-Attorney General Dennis Vacco in
November of the preceding year, brokers could legally prepare
``fill-in-the-blanks'' contracts for their clients without engaging
in the unauthorized practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   The use of broker-prepared contracts, however, was put on hold
after the Westchester County Bar Association filed for an
injunction against the practice in court. ``The form the brokers
were trying to use was not appropriate for New York,'' said Ira
Goldenberger, co-chairman of the Unlawful Practice of Law Committee
of the Westchester County Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Goldenberger said that over the last year or so, lawyers for the
brokers and the bar association had negotiated a different form of
broker-prepared contract that was just now being put to use. The
contract, he said, consists of two parts _ the form contract itself
and a ``cover sheet,'' which the buyer and seller will sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cover sheet is the actual form the brokers will fill
out,'' Goldenberger said, adding that it was a
``fill-in-the-blanks'' form that contains all pertinent information
about the deal when all of the blanks have been filled in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contract itself is never touched by the broker,'' he said.
``But when the cover sheet is completely filled out and signed, it
becomes part and parcel of the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that once the cover sheet was completed and signed by
the parties, the broker then had three business days to deliver the
documents to the lawyers for the buyer and seller and must sign a
certification that the documents were, in fact, delivered on time.
After that, the lawyers have five business days to approve or
disapprove the contract. If no action is taken within the five
days, Goldenberger said, the contract is considered binding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broker is also required to deliver various other
significant documents to the lawyers along with the contract,'' he
said, including a copy of the deed, the survey, the current
certificate of occupancy and, if available, a copy of the seller's
title insurance policy. Moreover, Goldenberger said, under the
terms of an agreement between the bar association and the
Westchester County Board of Realtors, brokers and sales agents must
go through a training procedure and obtain a certification from the
bar association before they can prepare contracts for clients.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bell, chief operating officer of Balch Buyer's Realty, a
Mamaroneck, N.Y.-based agency that represents only buyers, said
that the ability of brokers to prepare contracts would benefit
buyers more than sellers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's great because we can at least get the parties to
put their signatures on a piece of paper,'' he said, adding that in
the current robust seller's market, deals can easily fall apart if
a new buyer makes a higher offer between the time the seller
verbally accepts the first buyer's offer and the contracts are
ultimately prepared by the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least now we can keep the deal together for a few days
while the lawyers review the contracts,'' Bell said. ``That's
better than nothing.''

BELGRADE SENTENCES AID WORKERS AS SPIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)  (lb) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Two Australian aid workers and a Yugoslav
colleague received long prison sentences on Saturday from a
military court after being found guilty on charges of espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pratt, the director of CARE Australia in Serbia and
Kosovo, was sentenced to 12 years, and Peter Wallace to four years.
Branko Jelen, the Yugoslav worker, received six years. CARE
officials said they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences were passed down by the military judge after a
three-day closed trial. The men sat with their heads bowed, each
guarded by two Yugoslav army soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and supporters, including Jelen's mother, were allowed
into the court for the reading of the verdict. Jelen's mother broke
into sobs when she heard the sentence. As the men were led from the
room, Jelen was allowed briefly to embrace his mother. ``Why?'' she
cried out as he was led away.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist not explained by the Yugoslav authorities or the
court, the men were found guilty of a new charge, simple espionage,
after the original charges of forming a spy ring were dismissed for
lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, a Sydney native in his 50s who was once a major in the
Australian army, had been accused of running a spy ring through a
group of employees. The other men had been accused of supplying
information to that ring.
</P>
<P>
   They were convicted of a new charge, straight espionage, which
is a lesser crime but in this case carried a heavier sentence. The
Australians were also fined about $1,000 each and Jelen was fined a
lesser amount.
</P>
<P>
   The men have denied the charges, although Pratt appeared after
his arrest on Serbian state television, saying he had used his
Yugoslav employees to gather intelligence. Friends and colleagues
have said they are convinced that the statement was made under
duress. The court subsequently ruled that his taped confession was
inadmissible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand their main work was humanitarian, but in the
process they committed criminal offenses,'' the judge said Saturday
in passing sentence.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what evidence the prosecution presented against
the men. The two Australians were arrested at the border with
Croatia on March 31, just days after NATO began its airstrikes
against Belgrade. They were on their way from Belgrade to relocate
their office to Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The police apparently found their belongings, mobile phones,
laptop computers and maps suspicious, and confiscated them along
with their vehicles. Jelen was arrested a week later on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues have suggested that the grounds for official Yugoslav
suspicion may have been doing something as simple as visiting
former military barracks during CARE's work with refugees in
Serbia. Many Serbian refugees from Croatia are living in old
military buildings and CARE Australia was working to improve their
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The length of the sentence surprised officials at CARE
International and Australian diplomats present at the court. While
they had been banned from the proceedings, they had expressed
satisfaction that the trial appeared to be working well, and the
judges were calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``From all reports, the trial has been professionally conducted,
in a calm atmosphere,'' CARE Australia said in a news release given
out on Friday. ``The men have been able to present their cases
strongly, clearly and convincingly.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials raised the issue of the detained workers with top
Yugoslav officials during a recent visit to Belgrade, as did the
U.N. commissioner for human rights, Mary Robinson, pointing out
that Belgrade could not expect assistance in caring for refugees
while it treated aid workers with such harshness.
</P>
<P>
   The men will be allowed to appeal once they have received the
written, translated verdict. Meanwhile they will remain in
detention, the judge said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The harsh sentence comes as the authorities have cracked down on
dissent in Serbia. The police arrested some 28 army reservists in
Krusevac who had been resisting military orders to report for duty
in Kosovo, according to reports published in Montenegro, where the
press is more independent than in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The men and their families have been demonstrating for over a
week against the war in Kosovo and have demanded that others serve
in the province before they themselves return for a second tour.
Two Serbian reporters covering the protests in Krusevac were also
arrested four days ago and remain in detention.

REAL ESTATE: THE ELUSIVE NEW YORK APARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With all the scarcity, hysteria, back-stabbing and
astronomical prices in the real estate market, it would hardly seem
possible for young people just out of college to find apartments.
</P>
<P>
   But while apartments go quickly, they can be found, even for
those more interested in what they do than in what they earn.
Regardless of whether they are making $20,000 a year as editorial
assistants or $45,000 (before bonuses) as starting investment
bankers, this year's class of graduates will find ways to live in
New York, even in Manhattan. But they have to be flexible about
where they will live and ruthlessly efficient in their approach.
There is no time to think things over, or to get to the bank for a
certified check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people to bring a briefcase with cash,'' said John P.
Burke Jr., a realtor at John P. Burke Realty on Seventh Avenue in
Brooklyn who specializes in Park Slope and neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
   Although brokers say the first or second person to see an
apartment nearly always takes it, they also say new places are
continually coming on the market, and that any new college graduate
with a job _ and without a dog _ who is also relatively presentable
as well as realistic about prices can find an apartment. The market
has even loosened a bit, because of new buildings going up and
people leaving rentals for co-ops and condos, making it slightly
easier than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't quite as hysterical this year,'' said Soozy Katzen,
director of relocation services for Fox Residential Group. ``If
somebody is looking for a one-bedroom, you can actually keep them
busy for a day, show them eight to 10 properties.'' Although it has
never been easy or cheap to find places in New York, it was only 12
years ago, she said, that there was a surplus of apartments and
clients could be offered dozens in every part of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Although brokers say that many young people want to live on the
Upper West Side or in the West Village, those are among the most
expensive areas. And while they probably associate the Upper East
Side with the un-young and the un-hip, it is the neighborhood with
the largest supply of bargains. They tend to be rent-stabilized
places in old walkup buildings around York and First and Second
Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, agreeing to a request to show his best picks in
Manhattan for less-expensive apartments, Gordon Golub, a manager at
Citi Habitats, showed a small but sunny one-bedroom apartment in
the 70's near York Avenue, for $1,015; a one-bedroom in the same
neighborhood on the sixth floor of a walkup building for $1,400
that could be shared by two people; a basement studio apartment on
32nd Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues for $1,250 in an
elevator building; a minuscule apartment with no kitchen and a
shared bath, at Broadway in the 20s, for $595 a month, and a large
and airy studio apartment on West 34th Street between Ninth and
10th Avenues, in a doorman building with elevator, for $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   That neighborhood, he said, has some relative bargains, just
like the Upper East Side. He said he had nothing he considered
well-priced for typical new graduates either downtown or on the
Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   The Hecht Group, a brokerage company that specializes in
rent-stabilized apartments on the Upper East and Upper West Sides,
recently could list a number of apartments available on the Upper
East Side, including a studio at Lexington Avenue and 96th Street
for $899, a one-bedroom that could be shared for $1,350 at 91st
Street and Second Avenue, and a two-bedroom at York Avenue and 84th
Street for $1,550.
</P>
<P>
   Amnon Hecht, an immigrant from Israel who started the company
three years ago with his brother Oded, said the company has access
to 300 apartments on any given day. Deciding who gets them, he
said, often involves a lot of intuition. ``When I'm sitting with a
person,'' he said, ``I see if they're a nice human being.''
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, brokers say, people get the most modern apartments
for the least money in the financial district, where a number of
buildings have been converted from commercial to residential use. A
two-bedroom apartment that would be $4,000 on the Upper West Side
might rent for $2,600 in the financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Most new graduates share apartments with friends from college or
home. Studios, brokers say, are more likely to be rented to people
in their mid to late 20s. One-bedroom apartments in Manhattan newly
occupied by only one person have become the province of the
well-heeled, of a single person making more than $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The sharing of apartments never meant to be shared has spawned
its own language, including the elegant and totally mystifying
``one-bedroom convertible.'' What that means is that a temporary
wall costing about $800 can be used to divide the living room,
creating another bedroom. It's really a continuation of dorm life,
because the living room almost disappears and becomes a place
holding little more than a couch and a television.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Kekesi, a Corcoran Group broker, recently rented an
apartment in the financial district to three men who will divide a
two-bedroom renting for $2,600. ``They would rather sacrifice space
than location,'' Ms. Kekesi said. ``I had somebody who was willing
to put bunk beds into a one-bedroom.''

   One of the rules of perspective, which nearly everyone
understands intuitively, is that distant objects only appear to be
smaller than nearby objects. But imagine a world in which distant
objects appear younger than nearby objects, and younger not only on
the narrow time scale of years or generations, but on an
evolutionary time scale. In a world like that you would confront
the paradox of looking at a horse on the distant horizon and seeing
not a modern horse but its distant ancestor, running rapidly, as it
happens, away from you. The same horse, if it chose in its
solipsistic modernity to look your way, would see only the rapidly
receding ancestral human in you. This would be a hard world in
which to measure time or distance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is the universe. Distant galaxies appear younger and
less evolved than nearer galaxies because we look at them not only
across distance, but also across time. Distant galaxies also appear
to be moving more rapidly away from us than nearer ones because, in
essence, they still preserve the momentum with which the earlier
universe _ as young as the light from those remote galaxies _ was
expanding. Looking out into space, we look into the past, and yet
the farther we look, the younger the objects we see. ``Here and
now,'' so to speak, is the oldest, or rather least young, place in
the universe.
</P>
<P>
   So how old is the universe? A team of scientists led by an
astronomer from the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., has
completed a survey of 800 stars called Cepheid Variables, and it
indicates that the universe is probably between 12 billion and 13.5
billion years old. These are comforting numbers if only because
they mean that the universe is not younger than the stars within
it, a result that earlier estimates had absurdly suggested. But for
most of us, these are still problematic numbers. Something about
reasoning in billions makes us dizzy. Previous estimates of the
universe's age ranged from 10 billion to 20 billion years. For some
reason, this does not sound like a very broad range of numbers,
though in fact a universe that is 20 billion years old is twice as
old as one that is merely 10 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   Around 300 A.D., Eusebius concluded that the universe was
created 5,198 years before the Incarnation of Christ. Even if the
universe were only 12 billion years old, it would be 2,182,612
times older than Eusebius thought it was. Somehow that does not
convey the immensity it should. Neither does the fact that, given
these new numbers, the universe is only a little more than three
times as old as life on Earth. The difficulty does not lie in the
age of the universe. It lies in our tendency to imagine all those
billions as a single sum and not as the slow progression of one
year after another and another and another from the Big Bang till
now.

NO HALT TO KASHMIR STRIKES, EVEN FOR TALKS, INDIA LEADER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said
Saturday that India would continue air strikes against what he
described as Pakistani-backed infiltrators dug into Indian
territory, and would only be willing to hold talks with Pakistan
about the conflict if they were not conditional on a halt to the
air raids.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's remarks came in response to a telephone call on
Friday from Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who offered to
send Pakistan's foreign minister to New Delhi to meet with his
Indian counterpart. Sharif said India and Pakistan, as the world's
newest nuclear powers, should try to resolve their dispute over
Kashmir, where India is now battling the infiltrators, through
diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, however, whether Sharif had made such talks
conditional on the suspension of air strikes. Pakistan's minister
of information, Mushahid Hussain, said Saturday in Islamabad that
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz would be going to New Delhi next week
for talks.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Karachi on Friday, Sharif said he had warned
Vajpayee that if any more Indian fighter jets ventured into
Pakistan-held Kashmir, they would be shot down, just like two
Indian jets that Pakistan says it downed on Thursday. Sharif said
he had told Vajpayee, ``Come and sit around the table to resolve
the Kashmir issue.''
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have been squabbling over Kashmir since they
were carved from British India in 1947. India claims Kashmir as one
of its states, while Pakistan maintains that the Kashmiris should
be allowed to choose whether to join India or Pakistan through a
plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest permutation of an old feud, India has asserted
that in early May, Pakistan sent almost 700 infiltrators, including
Pakistani soldiers and Afghan mercenaries, across the boundary that
separates Indian- and Pakistan-held portions of Kashmir to seize
control of a swath of Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee spelled out India's position during a meeting Saturday
morning with leaders of the major political parties. Afterward, the
government's parliamentary affairs minister, P.R. Kumaramangalam,
told reporters that the prime minister had explained to Sharif that
the air raids would continue until the guerrillas were driven out
of India.
</P>
<P>
   India cannot be expected to stop air raids on intruders in its
own country, Indian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth day Saturday, India pounded the icy hideouts of
the guerrillas with air strikes in an attempt to drive them back
into Pakistan, kill them or force them to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. J.J. Singh, an Indian Army spokesman, said India had
found incontrovertible proof that Pakistani soldiers were among the
``intruders'' trying to hold a chunk of Indian territory.
Originally the disputed area was about 90 miles long and 4 to 5
miles wide, but it has shrunk considerably under the Indian air and
ground assault.
</P>
<P>
   He said the proof, found by Indian troops on Friday, is a
Pakistan army identity card for Sepoy Abdul Ayub, a soldier in the
4th Northern Light Infantry, that was tucked into a rucksack
abandoned at a site of fighting in Indian-held Kashmir. The army
will soon display this document for the press, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials could not be reached for comment Saturday,
but they have denied involvement with the guerrillas, whom they
describe as indigenous Kashmiri freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The tally of Indian dead rose to 29 Saturday. On Friday Pakistan
returned the body of a pilot who died after ejecting from his jet
in Pakistan-held Kashmir. Indian officials said Saturday that it
appeared the pilot had bullet wounds and might have been killed
after he parachuted to the ground. A full autopsy will be
performed.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials said that one of their pilots inadvertently
strayed over the cease-fire line Thursday after he developed engine
trouble, and that a second jet was shot down when its pilot tried
to see where his compatriot had landed. Pakistan has said it shot
the jets down in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   General Singh also said that Pakistan had increased its troop
and arms strength all along the cease-fire line with India. ``These
are probably precautionary, defensive measures,'' he said.

U.S. FEARS A MISCALCULATION IN KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States is warning that fighting between
India and Pakistan in Kashmir risks ``spinning out of control'' and
could result in the fourth war between them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials and American-based specialists
say that although they see little threat of a nuclear
confrontation, the situation is unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always the possibility of events spinning out of
control,'' said Karl F. Inderfurth, Assistant Secretary of State
for South Asian Affairs. ``Clearly the ingredients are there for
miscalculation. Our hope is that both sides will take steps to move
this in a peaceful direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say that American diplomats in
India and Pakistan have offered to mediate the dispute and that
Inderfurth called in the Indian and Pakistani ambassadors in
Washington on Thursday to encourage a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American officials acknowledge that the United States and
other nations may ultimately have little influence in ending the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Inderfurth said in an interview that he believed the fighting
would end only after the Muslim separatists who have entered
Indian-controlled Kashmir had left.He would not comment on the
question of possible Pakistani backing for the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the Indians are not going to cede this territory that
these militants have taken,'' he said. ``They have to depart, and
they will depart, either voluntarily or because the Indians take
them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Askari Rizvi, a professor of South Asian studies at Columbia
University, said he thought the confrontation was the most
dangerous since 1971, when India and Pakistan went to war, leading
to the creation of Bangladesh from East Pakistan. ``It is
potentially very dangerous in the sense that it could escalate,''
said Rizvi, who was born in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen P. Cohen, a South Asian specialist at the Brookings
Institution, noted that Kashmir has been the scene of a ``whole
series of little roller coaster bumps like this'' and that ``my
judgment is that the risk of war is not greater than it has been
before.''

NATO SKEPTICAL OF RUSSIA'S EFFORT TO SWAY BELGRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NATO allies on Saturday reacted with skepticism
to the outcome of the visit by the Russian envoy, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, to Belgrade where he aired ways to end the war in
Kosovo with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As he left Belgrade late on Friday, Chernomyrdin pronounced
himself pleased with the results of his talks but gave no details.
In Moscow on Saturday, there were no public announcements on what
he had achieved.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters on Saturday, a spokesman, Peter Daniel,
said there would be no pause in the NATO air campaign until
Yugoslavia accepted its ``non-negotiable terms.''
</P>
<P>
   With little sign of a breakthrough on the diplomatic front, the
Pentagon announced that the air campaign against Milosevic would be
reinforced this week with 68 additional U.S. Air Force aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The official Yugoslav news agency, Tanjug, announced after
Chernomyrdin left Belgrade that Milosevic had accepted the
``general principles'' for a settlement agreed to by the seven
richest industrial countries and Russia last month.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic made a similar pledge after Chernomyrdin's previous
visit to Belgrade but took no concrete steps, such as withdrawing
troops from Kosovo, to show he was serious. There was no sign from
Belgrade on Saturday that Milosevic had agreed to a key demand that
NATO be permitted to send a well-armed force, with the alliance at
its core, into Kosovo to help the ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, described the
dialogue between Chernomyrdin and NATO as running into trouble
because of NATO's refusal to grant a pause in the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian efforts and the direct efforts of the special
representative of Russia for Yugoslavia, Viktor Chernomyrdin, have
not found the understanding of the leadership of NATO, which
continues to insist Belgrade accept the alliance's demands,''
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   France and Germany, in a joint statement, said that the Yugoslav
statement about accepting the ``general principles'' should be
examined to see whether it ``could lead to a political
settlement.'' France and Germany suggested that the political
directors of the so-called G-8 group of eight countries, including
Western allies along with Japan and Russia, should meet shortly to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   But the State Department was less enthusiastic about such a
meeting, saying that it was waiting to learn the details of
Chernomyrdin's trip and doubted that a new meeting of the political
directors of the G-8 was necessary. ``We think it would be
premature to make any procedural steps until we have a report,''
said the department spokesman, James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the foreign ministers of the G-8
were scheduled to meet on June 8 in preparation for a summit
meeting in Cologne, Germany, on June 18 where President Clinton and
President Boris Yeltsin will meet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Pentagon said that the 68 aircraft being sent were part of
the additional 176 that Secretary of Defense William Cohen,
approved on May 6 after a request from the NATO commander, Gen.
Wesley Clark. The new aircraft included the deployment of 12
F-16Js, 36 F-15Es and 20 KC-135s from the Air Force Air Mobility
Command.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters, the spokesman, Daniel, said that good
weather allowed the alliance to fly 600 sorties on Friday, about
half of them striking targets or suppressing enemy air defenses.
``Our strategy certainly has not changed,'' Daniel said. ``We have
heightened the pace of the campaign in the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade and Novi Sad, Yugoslavia's second-largest city, were
plunged into darkness overnight during the latest wave of NATO
airstrikes, which hit at the electricity system of Serbia,
Yugoslavia's main republic.

BRONX WOMAN IS CHARGED WITH MURDER OF NIECE, 10
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bronx woman tied her 10-year-old niece to a bed
with garbage bags and beat her repeatedly until she lost
consciousness and died, the authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, identified as Eileen Rodriguez of 645 Van Nest Ave.
in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, was charged with murder
late Friday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police had originally said the girl suffocated after her aunt
gagged her, but the city medical examiner's office revised the
cause of death Saturday after an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She died of blunt impact injuries to the head, torso and
extremities,'' said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the medical
examiner. ``She was beaten to death, and there was no
suffocation.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodriguez called paramedics to her home shortly after 5 a.m.
Friday, telling a 911 operator that she awoke to find the girl
unconscious in her bed, according to police. Ms. Rodriguez was the
legal guardian of the child, Christina, as well as of the girl's
twin sister and her brother, 11.
</P>
<P>
   At first, police believed that Christina might have died of
natural causes. The girl's mother had died of complications from
AIDS several years before, according to police investigators and
neighbors, and it was believed that Christina also might have had
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation, detectives found evidence that Ms.
Rodriguez had tied Christina to the bed on Thursday night and
gagged her when she became unruly. They said that it appeared the
girl had vomited and choked to death.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner, however, concluded that Christina had not
been gagged but that a towel had been placed over her face. Her
body also showed signs of a severe beating, Ms. Borakove said.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Rodriguez's arrest Friday night, workers from the city
Administration for Children's Services took custody of Christina's
sister and brother. Police said those children showed no signs of
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Most neighbors in the five-story brick building where Ms.
Rodriguez lived with the three children described her as always
pleasant. They said the children were clean and well dressed when
they went to school, and that the family had lived there at least
since December.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Administration for Children's Services said
there had been no complaints about the family.
</P>
<P>
   But one neighbor, Juan Cancell, 36, who lived two doors down
from the Rodriguez family on the fourth floor, said there had been
recent signs of strain in the household. A social worker often
checked on the family, he said, and a teacher had recently come
over to ask why the children had been missing school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought they were being punished, so I never said
anything,'' he added. On Thursday night, he said, ``I heard the
girl screaming a lot.''

WEST POINT COMMENCEMENT INCLUDES SON OF CAMBODIAN PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ All 934 cadets who graduated Saturday from
the U.S. Military Academy received applause and encouragement, but
only one was trailed by television crews who nearly interrupted the
orderly procession.
</P>
<P>
   Cadet Hun Manet, 21, the son of Cambodia's prime minister,
smiled and gave the thumbs-up sign to the television cameras before
climbing the dais and receiving his diploma from Gen. Dennis J.
Reimer, the Army's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to grad school for two years,'' he said, ``and after
that I have a four-year commitment back home, just like my
friends.'' He said he planned to get a master's graduate degree in
economics at New York University before returning to Cambodia to
serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The cadet's father, Hun Sen, 47, was elected prime minister of
Cambodia last year after a violent coup, and some Republican
legislators protested his visit to the United States for the
graduation because of allegations of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, a Republican from Middletown, N.Y., who
attended Friday's ceremony, said, ``As a father, I guess he's
certainly entitled to be here, but we have to be concerned about
his past.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department said the Cambodian leader's
visit to the United States was personal, not official. A State
Department spokeswoman said: ``Hun Sen is here strictly on a visit
for his son's graduation. He's here for no other reason but that.''
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday's ceremony, Reimer warned the graduates that,
like generations before them, they would be responsible for leading
troops into battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that in this modern era, every class that has
graduated from West Point has led soldiers into harm's way,'' he
said, ``and there's no reason to think you will be any different.
No one can predict the future, but as one of the great
philosophers, Yogi Berra, once said, `The future ain't what it used
to be.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reimer alluded to the Kosovo conflict, saying that despite
21st-century technology, the graduates would still have to deal
with ethnic and religious hatreds that go back hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, most of the graduates hugged on the
Astroturf at Michie Stadium here and posed for photographs with
their families, but Hun met with his parents in shaded bleachers
under the guard of Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fortunate. It is a pride for the nation as a whole,''
the prime minister said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, wearing a blue business suit, was
accompanied by a large entourage, including his wife, his father
and several members of his Cabinet. He congratulated his son, not
with a hug, but with his hands clasped as if in prayer and with a
slight bow.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Manet was one of seven foreign students to graduate
Saturday. West Point has spots for up to 40 foreign students, 10 in
each class, said Andrea Hamberger, a spokeswoman for the academy.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They have partied together, and lived together, and
cried together. Mark Jackson confides in his best friend, Dave
Snowden, and so he has logged on to his computer several times this
past week and e-mailed his unexpurgated forecasts of how the New
York Knicks-Indiana Pacers showdown will go.
</P>
<P>
   Snowden, in turn, has responded with his own playoff prophecy,
brief, but directly to the point guard: ``Knicks,'' he says,
defiantly, ``in six.''
</P>
<P>
   He loves Mark Jackson like a brother but has found it impossible
to relinquish the Knicks as his team. Madison Square Garden is
where he served as a ballboy, where he is currently and gainfully
employed. Of course, he will celebrate with Jackson if the Pacers
advance, but he is for the Knicks, as he says he was long before he
became the Garden's director of disabled services in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His best friend is just one familiar piece to another city's
puzzle but, as Snowden said, ``I'm a New York guy and I've rooted
for the Knicks, no matter who they've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Who these Knicks have and what kind of organization they
represent is a subject that could make world-renowned sociologists
sound like sports talk radio. It is difficult at times to
understand the Knicks' popularity, and, at least for some,
uncomfortable to defend. I know more than a few Knick fans who
wonder if there will be a judgment-day price to pay for Latrell
Sprewell, who cringe at the ``Big L'' preening of Larry Johnson,
who have been appalled by the locker-room proselytizing of Charlie
Ward.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years at least, Knicks officials have been squabbling and
stabbing each other in the back, while the corporate bosses have
unaccountably hid behind well-groomed caretakers like Dave
Checketts. The basketball team that will seize hold of the city
late Sunday afternoon and not let go until its work is complete
also happens to be one that operates beyond the affordability of
most families, and whose parent company has positioned itself to
further propagate its earnings from television as well.
</P>
<P>
   Yet beyond the broadcasting rights, which Charles Dolan's
Cablevision has monopolistically pursued in partnership with Rupert
Murdoch, has come ownership of the uniform, the history, the
memories. No matter how objectionable and dysfunctional these
Knicks have been, they are an extension of the legacy created by
Red Holzman's championship teams. Mark Jackson and Chris Mullin and
Sam Perkins are Pacers who could tell us more about the outer
boroughs than any current Knick, but the Garden is midtown, and
represents the heart of the beloved city game.
</P>
<P>
   As Dave Snowden said in so many words, the roots of Knick
rooting run much deeper than Penn Station. Besides, the comportment
of their fans has often been as distasteful as the behavior of the
most insufferable Knick.
</P>
<P>
   Snowden, 33, was a ballboy for the Knicks in the mid-1980s, on
the night the Garden handed out Patrick Ewing posters and the fans
returned them as projectiles, using Ewing and his then-hapless
teammates as targets. It was Snowden's job to help clear the court,
but what he remembers most was the astonished look on Ewing's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a human being with a family,'' Snowden said. ``At some
point, you've got to realize it's just basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowden has been too close for too long not to know that is not
going to happen anytime soon. Agonizing over the Knicks has become
a rite of New York spring, like hungrily consuming a thick deli
sandwich with fatty meat that leaves behind an aching heart. The
debate over the Knicks and their 26-year pursuit of a third
championship reached new discord levels this volatile season,
raging on in the organization and the stands and along press row
like so many cab drivers honking away at each other in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   It all reminded Snowden of a decade ago, when a Jackson not
named Phil was being hailed as the savior, when his friend was a
hot, young Knick and Snowden became business adviser to the
homegrown point guard from St. Albans, Queens, and St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   They had met in college, when Jackson was a sophomore and
Snowden a freshman, and Jackson's parents invited him to stay at
their home to alleviate the weekday commute to Amityville, N.Y.
Snowden shared Mark's early highs and later lows, until one fateful
night, July 9, 1991, when a car crawled along 197th Street and the
window rolled down and bullets sprayed all around the street near
the Jackson home.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a parked car, an innocent bystander, Snowden never
saw the gun. Five bullets left him in a wheelchair and the Jacksons
inconsolable, but it was one of those random acts in a city then
overrun with violent crime and a basketball team coincidentally
earning its reputation for thuggish play. In the years since the
shooting, since Mark Jackson left the Knicks, the friendship
remained a constant in Snowden's radically altered life, Mark there
for him, Snowden there for Mark when Jackson's father, Harry, died
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, after Snowden underwent rehabilitation of the body
and mind, Madison Square Garden gave him a job. The cold and
calculated corporation does have the leverage to command attention,
loyalty, and sometimes it can even convince the masses it is worthy
of their love.
</P>
<P>
   After he put Meg Ryan's children's book shop out of business in
the film ``You've Got Mail,'' didn't Tom Hanks wind up with her in
his arms? The superstore is what these Knicks remind me of,
spending wildly, wreaking havoc with mom-and-pop values, but
finally, forcefully, making everyone in the neighborhood admit that
they've got game.
</P>
<P>
   The small-market Pacers wanted to believe that their
championship plans in the post-Jordan season would not involve
shopping for a victory in New York. There was a Sunday afternoon
late last month when the Knicks, in a calamitous slump, were losing
in Miami by 20 points, with the Pacers glued to their television
sets in a New Jersey hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Snowden was visiting in Mark Jackson's room, where the
telephone would ring every few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Reggie Miller calling, poking a needle through the line.
``He kept saying, `Your boys are done,''' Snowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Which at the time matched the sentiments of most Knicks fans.
Surprise. The Knicks were about to evolve into a more artistic
team. They rallied to win in Miami that day. They reopened the
possibility of lasting achievement, or leaving the city with fresh,
deeper wounds. Love is too simple an emotion to describe the area's
relationship with its pro basketball team. It is more love-hate,
the inherent paradox of daily life in New York, New York.

 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kathleen Kellogg Meserve, an amateur horticulturist from Long
Island who produced a series of hardy holly hybrids that have
become standard in nurseries and gardens in the United States and
Europe, died last Sunday at her home in Vero Beach, Fla. She was
93.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Meserve's interest in holly began shortly after World War
II when she and her family moved to a 10-acre estate in St. James
on Long Island and she attended a local garden-club lecture about
the holly, the evergreen whose glossy, pointed leaves and clusters
of red berries decorate gardens and deck the halls at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the hollies used for Christmas foliage were the
fragile English variety, Ilex aquifolium, which were grown in the
Pacific Northwest and shipped as cut greenery to the East. Mrs.
Meserve decided to create a English-style holly that could
withstand the harsh winters of the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came when Mrs. Meserve cross-bred Ilex rugosa,
a low-growing native holly of northern Japan, with the handsome
Ilex aquifolium. The results were blue hollies, hybrids with
exceptionally dark blue-green, spine-tipped foliage and excellent
hardiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't foresee my success,'' she later recalled. ``I just
wanted to create something that was going to give pleasure and be
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Girl, Blue Boy, Blue Prince, Blue Princess and Blue Angel
were followed by China Boy and China Girl, each with subtly
different characteristics. As recently as 1997, she produced a new
hybrid she called Centennial Girl.
</P>
<P>
   The profits from the sale of Mrs. Meserve's holly patents helped
to maintain her estate, which came to be called Holly-by-Golly, and
her plants are sold by commercial growers throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   When honored by the U.S. Patent Office in 1980 for her
contributions to horticulture on the 50th anniversary of the Plant
Patent Law, Mrs. Meserve said she held more plant patents than any
other person in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The former Kathleen Kellogg was born in Manhattan and graduated
from Miss Chandor's School. She took pleasure in telling visitors
that her cultivars _ the name for varieties developed and
maintained in cultivation _ had been created in a kitchen by an
amateur gardener whose formal study of botany ended in the fifth
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``A professor from a leading university with a strong graduate
horticulture program visited me once,'' she told an interviewer in
1978 with obvious delight. ``He told me that he was amazed at how
his school spent thousands of dollars in research hoping to come up
with a new strain, but that here I did it on $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not knowing what I was doing was an advantage,'' she said.
``Especially, at the beginning. I didn't know what could be done
and what couldn't. So I just did it.''
</P>
<P>
   She once observed, ``Horticulture is the only field in which an
amateur can be on the same level as an expert.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 the American Horticultural Society honored Mrs. Meserve
for her ``outstanding contributions to amateur horticulture'' and
six years later she received the Eloise Payne Luquer Medal of the
Garden Club of America for her work in hybridizing hollies and
greatly extending their temperature range.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1992 the land of Christmas holly recognized her
contributions when the Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain
gave her the Reginald Cory Memorial Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, F. Leighton Meserve, died in 1968. She is survived
by a son, Frederick L. Meserve Jr. of Kennett Square, Pa; two
daughters, Anne Davis of Winnetka, Ill., and Marcia Poutiatine of
Vero Beach; seven grandchildren and a great grandchild.

RICHARD KOBLER, 90, THE INVENTOR OF THE FIRST `TALKING TYPEWRITER'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J.)  (rk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Kobler, an Austrian-born electronics engineer who
devised the first ``talking typewriter'' and scores of other
contrivances after being resettled in New York 60 years ago by
actress Gloria Swanson, died on May 8 at the JFK Medical Center in
Lake Worth, Fla. He was 90 and lived in nearby Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Kobler did much of his inventing at Thomas A. Edison Industries
and the Edison Research Laboratory in West Orange, N.J. He patented
the original Televoice, a remote-controlled dictation system whose
offspring spread worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he led a engineering group that developed the research
instrument that was developed into the talking typewriter. A
computerized learning system, it taught reading skills to autistic
and retarded children. Another adaptation introduced in 1966 taught
young children to read, typewrite and take dictation.
</P>
<P>
   He also invented Rapidial, the first telephone to store and
automatically redial frequently used numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Kobler is survived by his wife and longtime collaborator, Edith
Kobler; two sons and a daughter from an earlier marriage, Arthur,
of Hong Kong, Raymond, of San Francisco, and Linda of Erie, Pa.,
and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Vienna, he was educated at the Technical University
there. He worked in private laboratories and an engineering
practice, and by 1937 opened his own patent office.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nazis in power, he suffered arrests but made his way to
Zurich and Paris. Through friends, Swanson, a leading box-office
draw in the 1920s, learned of him and three other bright Austrian
colleagues who were at risk.
</P>
<P>
   She and her third husband, the Marquis Henri de la Falaise de la
Coudraye, a French nobleman, used their influence with French
officials to spirit the young men out of France just before war
broke out in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate her four charges, Swanson in 1939 set up an
engineering firm, Multiprises, with headquarters in Manhattan and a
factory in Queens. Under Kobler's management, it offered products
and services in the four men's specialities: sound recording,
metallurgy and plastics.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted until America's entry into the war, when the four
Austrians left the company to work for the government and large
laboratories with big military contracts. Swanson, who died in
1983, described her encounter with Kobler in her autobiography,
``Swanson on Swanson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At 40 therefore,'' she wrote, ``I was a factory owner,
something I had always wanted to be, surrounded by brilliant
engineers, the sort of men whose minds had always excited me, and I
might have made a considerable fortune had not the war come
along.''

dedicated herself to the care of children and their families, died
last Sunday at White Plains Hospital. She was 93 and lived in
Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1930s, Mrs. Marx had been involved in community
affairs and a wide array of agencies. She set up remedial programs
in five school districts and helped establish Westchester County's
first full-time child guidance clinic.
</P>
<P>
   More recently she devoted herself to the creation and expansion
of a day care center at Westchester Community College. Now known as
the Virginia Marx Children's Center, it serves nearly 100 children.
</P>
<P>
   Many of their parents are single mothers on public assistance
who attend the college. She created another center at Teachers
College, Columbia University, for training educators in child care.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, a New York developer, endowed the Virginia
and Leonard Marx Professorship in Child and Parent Development and
Education at Teachers College in 1993, as well the Marx Lecture
Series at Teachers College. That program allows the college to give
a platform to top researchers in child development. She also served
on the advisory board of the Center for Infants and Parents.
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Louis, she graduated with a degree in psychology
from Washington University, then received a master's in social
work. She earned a master's in child psychology at Teachers College
and spent a fellowship year in clinical psychology at what was then
its Child Guidance Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Before her marriage in 1930, she designed children's toys for
Macy's and was a contributing editor for Parents magazine. Her
quarterly articles advised readers about child development.
</P>
<P>
   Among Mrs. Marx's beneficiaries were the Jewish Board of Family
and Children's Services, where she was a trustee for over 40 years
and a longtime member of its Child Development Center committee.
She supported its training branch, the Selig Educational Institute,
and the Center for the Study of Social Work Practice, a joint
undertaking with Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Other charities included UJA-Federation of New York, White
Plains Hospital Center, Scarsdale Edgemont Family Counseling
Service, and Camp Rainbow, a UJA affiliate serving handicapped
children.
</P>
<P>
   Her interest in American antique furniture fueled her support of
the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Friends of
American Art at Yale University, and the Art Museum of Sarah
Lawrence College.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marx is survived by her husband; their son, Leonard Jr. of
Greenwich, Conn.; two daughters, Mary Lynn Bianco of Los Angeles,
and Jennifer Gruenberg of Scarsdale; two sisters, Muriel Ducibella
of Orange, Conn., and Jane Smith of St. Louis; a brother, Rudolph
Wise Jr. of Baldwin, Mo.; six grandchildren, and five
great-grandchildren.

   TEWKSBURY, N.J. _ As a story, it was too good to write without a
snicker: all-American dad builds a full-size ball field in his
backyard for his son and his son's friends, snooty neighbors take
dad to court.
</P>
<P>
   When the story of Bill Ingraham's backyard ballpark ran on the
networks and in the papers across the country last summer, a lot of
people got a good chuckle about the magic of the national pastime
and shook their heads about the cluelessness of some people.
</P>
<P>
   But as Kathy DeSerio, 42, found out when she joined a lawsuit
against Ingraham, the truth is more complex than funny stories
sometimes suggest, and the costs of taking on the myths and magic
of the national pastime are counted in more than legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   In her quest to reclaim the peace and quiet of her carefully
restored house, which sits out by Ingraham's short left field, Ms.
DeSerio has felt portrayed as the lady who hates children and
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I went into this that I would subject myself to
ridicule, because the story was just too perfect _ dad and baseball
and `Field of Dreams' and all,'' Ms. DeSerio said. ``Now I have to
ask myself, do I really need this?
</P>
<P>
   Do I need letters from a dentist in Oregon asking why I'm taking
the national pastime away from these little boys?'' Or, she
wonders, does she need the whispers at the supermarket about the
childless, unmarried woman who hates children? Or the anonymous,
threatening phone messages?
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, the Township of Tewksbury, Ms. DeSerio and
another neighbor are charging that the field, which has cost
Ingraham $75,000 to build and $1,500 a month to maintain, violates
zoning and is a public nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Final written arguments were presented Friday after three weeks
of testimony. And what came out in the trial is evidence that the
diamond behind Ms. DeSerio's house is no field of dreams, and that
Ingraham, a barrel-chested, blunt-talking businessman who made his
fortune with peel-and-stick shipping labels, is no Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham confirmed under cross-examination that he has called
opponents of his ball field ``white trash'' and homosexuals. In a
letter admitted into evidence, he told the mayor of Tewksbury that
``you can't decide if you want to be a man or a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, he has said that anyone trying to take away his
ball field will have to go through him personally. In testimony
about the kind of people he allows to use the field, Ingraham was
asked _ hypothetically _ whether he would invite even a Little
Leaguer who had beaten up his 11-year-old son, Brian. ``Yes, I
would,'' Ingraham replied, ``to give Brian a chance to beat him
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview whether people might be getting a negative
impression of him, he said, ``When somebody attacks me or my
family, I attack back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham's personality has been mostly lost in articles
straining to be lighthearted, and the lights and noise of the
practices, parties and games behind Ms. DeSerio's house have
largely been left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People write letters to the paper _ `I like it when kids play
ball in my backyard' _ like this was just Johnny and Timmy
playing,'' Ms. DeSerio said. ``If it was just a couple of kids
playing and an occasional ball falls in my yard, who the heck would
care? I certainly would not. But these are men hitting balls into
my backyard, and the `ping ping ping' of aluminum bats, and the
pitching machine, and it's hard for people to understand the extent
of it all. So I come off looking like Mrs. Crabtree.''
</P>
<P>
   So the letters have come. ``This is America, land of the free,
home of the brave,'' a dentist in Astoria, Ore., wrote to Ms.
DeSerio. And the anonymous phone calls have come as well, some
supportive, and some bad enough to make her upgrade her home
security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is who I am, this is my dream,'' she said, taking in the
house and its carefully landscaped yard and patio while a red
tractor groomed the outfield 100 feet away. ``I came here to live
in the country, in open, quiet farmland, and now I have an active
ball park in my backyard. Is this how my dream ends?''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision on that could come as early as this week.

ALL LAKERS, ALL THE TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's ``NBA Notes'' column has been pre-empted in favor of
``Laker Chatter,'' which we join in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Host: Let's go to Kazaam on a car phone.
</P>
<P>
   Kazaam: Thanks for takin' my call, bro.
</P>
<P>
   Host: Please speak up, Kazaam, and ixnay on the rap music.
</P>
<P>
   Kazaam: Sorry, bro. OK, I know how to fix the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Host: I'm listening.
</P>
<P>
   Kazaam: Cool. Well, I think Jerry West should trade up and draft
Baron Davis to play point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Host: Really? The Lakers have the 23rd pick. You package that
and what, exactly? Sean Rooks? Robert Horry? Sean Rooks, Robert
Horry and Travis Knight? Who do you think these other GMs are, Dan
Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   Kazaam: None of the above, bro. All you have to do is trade Kobe
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Host: Seriously?
</P>
<P>
   Kazaam: I'm serious as a heart attack, bro. The only thing Kobe
can't jump over is his ego. So ... trade him.
</P>
<P>
   Host: I have two words for that, Kaz. Stu and pid. Let's go to
Jack in Hollywood. You there, Jack?
</P>
<P>
   Jack: I'm here. Hey, get a load a this ... About 10 minutes ago,
I saw Shoeless Phil Jackson and that Knicks guy, Dave Checketts, at
a Winchell's.
</P>
<P>
   Host: We just deal in the truth here, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Jack: You can't handle the truth. Oh ... you got any ``Phantom
Menace'' tickets?
</P>
<P>
   Host: No, but we do have a traffic report. Let's go to Roy in
Chopper I.
</P>
<P>
   Roy: We got heavy delays on the northbound 405. It seems that
Kobe Bryant is driving wildly in the diamond lane with nobody else
in his car. Back to you.
</P>
<P>
   Host: Too bad we can't get Glen Rice to drive more. Anyway,
let's go to Barry in Inglewood. What's up, Barry?
</P>
<P>
   Barry: My patience. Everybody wants the Lakers to trade up for
Baron Davis, but nobody offers any suggestions on how to do that.
Or they want the Lakers to go out and just ``find'' a power forward
to match up with Tim Duncan. There's no cap room and we ... I mean
the Lakers ... don't pick until 23, like you said, and the draft is
about as deep as an episode of ``Walker, Texas Ranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Host: I'm sorry, my headset went dead. Could you repeat that,
Barry? Barry? OK ... our next caller is, uh, Burt ... Burt
Incognito.
</P>
<P>
   Burt: Yeah, I'm a first-time caller, first-time listener and I
think I know what the Lakers should do ... they should keep Kurt
Rambis as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Host: But he sucked.
</P>
<P>
   Burt: Given the situation, what first-time coach wouldn't?
</P>
<P>
   Host: Larry Bird, last year.
</P>
<P>
   Burt: Larry Bird took over a Pacers team with defined roles and
a deep bench. Kurt, who happens to be way handsomer than Bird, as
well, needs an entire training camp. Remember, Rome wasn't built in
a short season, and if NBA players can learn to accept a balding
weasel like Jeff Van Gundy, I think they'll follow Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   Host: Sorry, you're out of time, Burt, and so are we. Stay tuned
for ``Clipper Banter.''
</P>
<P>
   CLIPPER BANTER
</P>
<P>
   What does falling from the second seed to fourth position in the
draft rotation mean to the Clippers?
</P>
<P>
   It means they could be in an ugly predicament on draft night
(June 30).
</P>
<P>
   At the top of their prioritized wish list is the job of point
guard. Two swell suspects for that role are Maryland's Steve
Francis and Baron Davis of UCLA. But both may be goners before the
Clippers choose at No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   There are other playmakers available, but they (at this time)
seem dreadfully unworthy of the fourth pick. This could inspire the
Clips to trade down (in the unlikely event they can fleece someone
else out of a proven player) to get one, or pray that two of the
teams picking 1-3 bypass either Francis or Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has the first pick, but unless coach Tim Floyd decides
to bury the triangle offense, the Bulls may not be in the market
for a point guard. Vancouver, home of rookie playmaker Mike Bibby,
has the second pick, but may try to unload it in exchange for a
veteran who can rebound and score.
</P>
<P>
   The Charlotte Hornets, whose point guard, David Wesley, would
rather shoot first and ask questions later, figure to stay put and
draft a new floor leader.
</P>
<P>
   One nasty threat to trade up and pluck a point guard is
presented by the Toronto Raptors. The Raptors have two lottery
picks (5 and 12), and are waving them in front of Bulls personnel
poo-bah Jerry Krause. By the way, putting the first pick in
Krause's hands could be as tricky as giving Jerry Springer a
nuclear launch code.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors reportedly are lusting after Francis, an aerial
maniac who would team with rookie of the year Vince Carter and his
cousin, Tracy McGrady, to give Toronto more style points than a
victory lap at Spago.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' guest list for this week includes Arizona point
guard Jason Terry, Miami of Ohio forward Wally Szczerbiak and
Davis. They also are attempting to bring in Francis, Duke deserter
Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case Francis and Davis are history before it's their
turn to strike, the Clippers are exploring all options. On
Thursday, for instance, they conducted an audition that included a
high-brow two-on-two series involving William Avery, Trajan
Langdon, Shammond Williams and God Shammgod.
</P>
<P>
   Avery is the point guard who's leaving Duke after his sophomore
season and has been known to become derelict in his duties when
he's not scoring in bunches. Langdon is a deadeye 6-foot-3 shooting
guard who's leaving Duke after five years (one redshirt), and has
the pedestrian quickness that could keep him on the board until the
Clips make the second pick of the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a 6-2 combo guard who finished his senior year at
North Carolina in 1998, was drafted by the Bulls in the second
round, acquired and dumped by Atlanta, and cut his playmaking teeth
this season in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Shammgod is the former New York City prep star who spent one
season at Providence and one on the end of the Washington Wizards'
bench. The Wizards cut God, who is a ballhandling revelation,
before this season.
</P>
<P>
   Should events conspire to bring Shammgod into the Clipper fold,
it could present a serious dilemma for broadcast great Ralph
Lawler. Unless he's Catholic, Lawler may find it unholy to shout
``God!'' and ``Bingo!'' in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   SHOT-CLOCK VIOLATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Jazz, who could use another young turk or two, have
three first-round picks next month. OK, the earliest is 19 (the
others are 24 and 28), but they did find Bryon Russell and Shandon
Anderson in the second round. Then again, if the newcomers require
a similar incubation period, Karl Malone (the No. 13 pick in 1985)
and John Stockton (16th in 1984) will be in rocking chairs before
the kids are ready to help. ... The Atlanta Hawks have four
first-round picks (17, 20, 21 and 27), but they haven't exactly
killed in the draft lately. Their three best players -- Steve
Smith, Mookie Blaylock and Dikembe Mutombo -- were drafted by other
teams. In fairness to the Hawks, making the playoffs for seven
consecutive years ruins your opportunities to score with the
college kids. ... Alexsandar Radojevic, the 7-3, 245-pound prospect
from Barton County (Kan.) JC (by way of Montenegro), is making
pre-draft visits and is expected to be chosen in the middle of the
first round. ...According to our source in Roswell, N.M., Phil
Jackson and Dave Checketts, king of the Knicks, were seen swilling
espresso at Denny's. Could be a bogus report ... we're pretty
certain Denny's doesn't serve espresso.

   TIANANMEN-REMEMBER _ Michael Browning, a staff writer for The
Palm Beach Post, lived in Beijing for nine years as a correspondent
for The Miami Herald and Knight-Ridder Newspapers. He covered all
the events leading up to and coming out of the massacre at
Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Now, at a decade's distance, he
says he has trouble believing it ever happened, more trouble making
up his mind about what it actually meant. In his own words: ``I was
there, but today in an era when Chinese students are throwing rocks
and bottles at our embassy in Beijing and Chinese spies are
apparently ferreting out our nuclear secrets, I am not really sure
where there was. Tiananmen seemed mythical, even during the moments
it was unfolding. It was like living inside a movie whose
screenplay was being written off-camera, someplace else. The actual
shooting script came to us minute by minute.'' A first-person
remembrance of the massacre. (Browning, Palm Beach Post). MOVED

   MEXICO-COFFEE _ TAKIUKUM, Mexico _ In an obscure village in
southern Mexico, Manuel Gomez proudly shows guests horse manure
spread beneath a tangle of vines on his modest coffee farm. Manure,
ironically, is offering a healthier and more prosperous life to
this Mayan Indian farmer, who uses it to fertilize organic coffee
he grows for consumers tens of thousands of miles from his home. In
Takiukum (pronounced, ``Ta-kee-a-KOOM'') and other isolated hamlets
nestled in the hills of politically-troubled Chiapas state, more
and more subsistence farmers are growing organic coffee for export,
which provides them with about 80 percent of their cash income. The
farmers' organic coffee is ending up as brew or beans found in
American and European cafes, health food stores, grocery chains and
specialty shops from Germany to Atlanta, Ga., from Italy to Austin,
Texas. (Ferris, Cox News Service). 30. MOVED.

problem of mechanical and human flight ever since as a boy I
constructed a number of bats (toy helicopters powered by rubber
bands) of various sizes . . . My observations since have only
convinced me more firmly that human flight is possible and
practicable...'' Wilbur was writing to ask the Smithsonian to send
any papers that could help him in a ``systematic study'' of flight
that he expected to undertake apart from his regular business,
selling bicycles. He wanted the Smithsonian to know he was sincere.
In a sentence that became famous _ in a letter that Wright
biographer Tom Crouch calls ``the most important exchange of
correspondence in the history of the Smithsonian'' _ Wilbur wrote:

pet theories as to the proper construction of a flying machine.''

US FINDS NOTHING NEW IN LATEST STATEMENTS FROM BELGRADE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A declaration by Yugoslav leaders that they would
accept the outlines of a Western peace plan revived a familiar
debate among leaders of NATO countries Saturday, as two European
nations urged fresh diplomatic efforts and US officials
characterized the Yugoslav statement as meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   The prime ministers of Germany and France called for a meeting
of the G-8, consisting of the world's top industrialized countries
and Russia, to assess last week's talks between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and Russian envoy Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   But Pentagon officials, who dispatched a new unit of planes to
the Balkans Saturday to step up airstrikes, said they had ``not
seen any signs'' Milosevic was ready to submit to key NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not seen any signs of an end to the fighting,''
Pentagon spokesman Captain Michael Doubleday said. ``We have not
seen any signs of troops moving out of Kosovo. We have not heard
from him in a very direct way indicating that he is looking for an
international peacekeeping force.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NATO warplanes pounded Yugoslavia with bombs for a
67th straight day. The Pentagon announcement that 68 additional
planes are heading to the Balkans will swell a NATO force that
already has more than 1,000 aircraft. With the arrival of the 20
KC-135 tankers, 12 F-16 jets and 36 F-15 jets, the United States
will account for more than two-thirds of the allied air power in
the Balkans, with 769 planes.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright addressed the high
number of mistakes that NATO warplanes have made, admitting allied
forces have killed civilians during the 10-week attack. But she
said that NATO, unlike Yugoslavia, has taken ``great pains'' to
avoid civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best that can be said for Milosevic is that he doesn't
kill people by accident,'' Albright told graduates of Georgetown
University's School of Foreign Service. ``On the contrary, the
death and destruction of Kosovo's Albanian community is the whole
point of Milosevic's war.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   --The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees continued to
move Kosovar refugees in Albania away from the border, where
fighting between Serb troops and the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
Albanian Army has intensified in recent days. Some 30,000 of the
approximately 450,000 Kosovar refugees now living in Albania still
remain in the camps near Kukes, close to the border of their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to convince them to move,'' said the Albanian
government's coordinator for human affairs, Kaspriot Islami. ``So
far, we have been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   --On Friday afternoon, NATO planes bombarded targets on the
Adriatic coast of Montenegro, the small and largely autonomous
Yugoslav republic to the west of Serbia. Military leaders had been
trying not to hit the republic out of concern for its pro-Western
government, but were drawn in by Yugoslav antiaircraft radar along
the coast. NATO said it was the largest attack on Montenegro in a
month.
</P>
<P>
   --Australian officials called the imprisonment of two Australian
aid workers ``incomprehensible.'' Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace,
who work for the aid agency CARE, were arrested March 31 along the
border of Croatia and Serbia. Australian authorities said the men
were trying to bring food and supplies to Serb refugees, but were
arrested when Yugoslav border guards mistook their humanitarian
reports for spying material.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt was sentenced to 12 years in jail, and Wallace was
sentenced to four years, after being found guilty by a Yugoslav
military court.
</P>
<P>
   --The Japanese prime minister, Masahiko Komura, issued a public
plea for the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia to stop. During a visit to
Moscow Saturday, Komura's spokesman said the prime minister was
``very worried'' about the air campaign after meeting with Russian
leaders, who vehemently opposed the bombings from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although our possibilities are limited _ we are not a
permanent member of the UN Security Council _ Japan appeals to NATO
to halt its attacks,'' the spokesman, Masaki Ikada, said, according
to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Komura met with Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   But a meeting with Chernomyrdin, who had just returned from
talks with Milosevic in Belgrade, was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is expected to return to Belgrade this week. Both
he and Yugoslav officials emerged from the latest round of talks
expressing optimism, with sources close to Chernomyrdin saying he
was ``very satisfied by his visit to Belgrade'' and members of the
Yugoslav government saying the meeting was ``positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials also said they were amenable to the basic
outlines of an earlier plan drawn up by the G-8. Milosevic's office
issued a statement saying it wanted the United Nations Security
Council to deal with ``the entire problem.'' But the statement did
not explicitly agree to the central tenets of the peace plan: the
withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo and the acceptance of an
international peacekeeping force to protect Kosovars as they return
safely to their homes inside the province.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, France and Germany, which have been reluctant to
assemble the invasion force repeatedly requested by Britain,
reacted warmly to the development. Issuing a joint statement,
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and President Jacques
Chirac of France asked for a meeting of the G-8 to assess the
latest talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``France and Germany consider it necessary to examine whether
the content of this declaration can lead to a political solution on
the basis of our principles,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials were far more skeptical. Spokesman Peter Daniel
reiterated NATO's commitment to continuing the bombardment, saying
that ``Milosevic's military commanders and the troops they direct
should understand that there will be no relief until Yugoslavia
accepts the non-negotiable demands of the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning was accompanied by reports from Yugoslav media that
NATO airstrikes Saturday killed three people and wounded 20,
including three children who were seriously hurt when a missile
struck their house.

THREE HUMANITARIAN WORKERS CONVICTED OF SPYING IN YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ Three humanitarian aid workers Saturday were
convicted by a Yugoslav military court of spying and given
sentences ranging from four to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy jail sentences could have a chilling effect on the
ability and willingness of various humanitarian groups to bring in
the aid workers needed in all parts of Yugoslavia, including
Kosovo. But CARE, the humanitarian group for which the three men
work, vowed to appeal the sentences, insisting the men were
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-day trial, the presiding judge, Ratko Korlat,
simply read out that Australian aid workers Stephen Pratt and Peter
Wallace had been sentenced to 12 and 4 years, respectively. Their
Yugoslav colleague, Branko Jelen, was sentenced to six years. They
had faced up to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians showed no emotion when the sentences were read,
but Jelen's mother, watching in the gallery, screamed that her son
was innocent. Jelen then wept.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the court, the Australian ambassador to Yugoslavia,
Christopher Lamb, said he could not fathom the conviction, and
thought the sentences were unusually harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Because the court was closed to reporters and international
observers while evidence was heard, it was unclear on what basis
the five-judge military panel had ruled. The men were originally
charged with organizing a spy ring, but their conviction was for
simple espionage. Their lawyers were studying whether that
discrepancy was fertile ground for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A legal source said that the military officers who presided over
the trial had said they did not consider Pratt's alleged confession
to spying, which had been shown on government-controlled television
April 11, nearly two weeks after Pratt and Wallace were seized at
the Croatian border.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt, 49, who is the chief of operations for CARE Australia in
Yugoslavia, and Wallace, 30, were headed to neighboring Croatia
when they were arrested by Yugoslav border guards who apparently
became suspicious of the maps, laptop computers, and computer disks
carried by the pair. Authorities have not said why or how Jelen was
subsequently arrested.
</P>
<P>
   When they were arrested, the two Australians were en route to
the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro to help set up a camp for
Kosovar Albanians driven out by Milosevic's forces, according to
former Australian prime minister Malcolm Fraser, who is the head of
CARE Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers in other parts of the Balkans who know Pratt said he
kept copious notes about the location of military checkpoints so
that his workers could avoid them if necessary, and suggest that
information may have been seized upon by Yugoslav officials as
evidence of spying. A friend of Pratt's suggested that his status
as an Australian Army veteran was also held against him, even
though Australia is not a member of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Tapp, head of CARE Australia, said the verdict was ``a
political decision. It has no basis in justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb predicted that the men would be acquitted on appeal,
hinting that diplomatic efforts behind the scenes were trying to
win the men's release on the basis of an amnesty.

BOSTON GANG LEADERC CONVICTED IN SLAYING OF PROSECUTOR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gang leader Jeffrey L. Bly Saturday was convicted of
first-degree murder for the 1995 killing of Assistant Attorney
General Paul R. McLaughlin, who made bitter legal history when he
became the first state prosecutor murdered while doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   A racially mixed jury delivered its verdict in a Suffolk
Superior courtroom crowded with McLaughlin's father, siblings,
fellow prosecutors, Special Assistant Suffolk District Attorney
Thomas Brennan, and a team of Boston and State police officers who
pieced together the case against Bly.
</P>
<P>
   Suppressed cheers echoed softly through the chandeliered
courtroom as the verdict was announced. Tears of relief ran down
the faces of many of McLaughlin's friends as nearly four years of
waiting for justice for a friend finally ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won his last case,'' McLaughlin's older brother, Rick, said
after the verdict. ``He died doing it, but he won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk Superior Court Judge James D. McDaniel Jr. sentenced Bly
to the mandatory life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Bly tried to leave as McLaughlin's father, Edward F. McLaughlin
Jr., prepared to give a victim impact statement, but was ordered to
stay by Judge McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hurt and damned angry. My natural instinct is to lash
out,'' Edward McLaughlin said as Bly fidgeted in his seat, hands
cuffed behind his back. ``But I won't do anything to denigrate
Paul's memory. I can only hope and pray that he has now found peace
with God, to whom I think his dedicated work . . . has so richly
entitled him.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict ended an extraordinary chapter in state law
enforcement history in which the pursuer became the prey, the
dogged prosecutor targeted for assassination by the ruthless gang
member who broke the unwritten rules of law enforcement officers
and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   While police routinely face the possibility of dying on the job,
prosecutors were considered insulated from the fury of the street
by the passion-draining rituals of the courtroom, where personal
contact between prosecutor and defendant rarely occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that happens in Mexico or Colombia,'' said
Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II, for whom McLaughlin
was working gang cases when he was killed. ``Not in America, much
less Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was one of McLaughlin's many friends who had been drawn
to the 42-year-old by his passion for politics, his desire to help
tougher Boston neighborhoods rid themselves of crime, and by a
sense of decency that often saw McLaughlin search out an
alternative to prison for defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The elder McLaughlin noted that a scholarship has been set up at
Suffolk University Law School in his son's name, and that an
addition to the Daniel Marr Boys and Girls Club in Dorchester has
been named for him. A tree has been planted outside the West
Roxbury Library in his son's memory as well.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said he last saw his son in August 1995, about a
month before the murder. He gently urged McLaughlin to consider
getting a more lucrative job in private practice. ``Not yet, Dad,''
the father quoted the son as saying. ``I still think I can make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, a friend and co-worker of
Paul McLaughlin's for 15 years, was asked after the verdict if he
wished the death penalty was available for Bly. He waved away the
question and said only, ``I want Paul back.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan C. Stanley, Bly's lead attorney, said in court that the
murder was a ``terrible tragedy'' for both the McLaughlin and Bly
families. Bly's mother, whom Bly appeared to ignore even though she
faithfully attended each day of the monthlong trial, left after the
verdict was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant attorney general and Dartmouth College graduate
was shot about 7 p.m. on Sept. 25, 1995 _ the night before he was
to prosecute Bly a third time, a pursuit that his superiors later
thought was a mistake because two earlier trials had ended in
acquittals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not my DA no more,'' a prosecution witness quoted Bly as
saying the night McLaughlin was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, Bly plotted and carried out the
audacious killing with the same cold-eyed ferocity he displayed as
he rose to the top of the Theodore Street Posse, a loosely
organized drug-dealing street gang whose home turf was a few
hundred yards from the Morton Street police station in Mattapan.
</P>
<P>
   One week before Bly's third trial _ for armed robbery and
carjacking _ he was searching for a way to get at Dana Alston, a
carjacking victim who had already survived a murder attempt by a
Bly associate.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, Bly could not find Alston and decided
that killing McLaughlin would buy him more time to take care of
Alston.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before the murder, Bly sent 16-year-old fellow gang
member Anthony Houston to tail McLaughlin as he left the Suffolk
district attorney's office in downtown Boston for his home in West
Roxbury. With $5 in train fare, a notebook, and a pen, Houston
shadowed McLaughlin as he rode the commuter rail to the Highland
station in West Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Houston followed McLaughlin to the parking lot,
where he saw him get into his rust-colored 1982 Toyota. They
exchanged nods, Houston recorded the prosecutor's license plate,
and reported back to Bly.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the murder, Bly and his associates, including
Ricardo Gittens, gathered at a second-floor apartment on Theodore
Street. Bly, according to prosecution witness Sandra Brown, told
his allies that McLaughlin had to die that night.
</P>
<P>
   Bly was driven to West Roxbury by Gittens, accompanied by a
younger gang member who was later told by Bly to leave. They
stopped in a bowling alley parking lot across from the station and
spotted McLaughlin's car parked on Railroad Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Gittens and Bly mapped out an escape route and drove over to
Clement Avenue, which parallels the railroad tracks. Gittens parked
at a bend of the street, while Bly returned to Railroad Avenue, hid
in the bushes, and was ready when McLaughlin got off the train
shortly before 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed as a combination Wild West outlaw/modern urban assassin,
with a bandana covering the lower half of his face, a knit wool cap
on his head, brown cotton gloves on his hands, and an oversized
black hooded sweatshirt drawn over his face, Bly called out to
McLaughlin as he got into his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted Paul McLaughlin to know who shot him,'' Brennan told
the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Bly then pounced on the prosecutor, pinned him against the car
door, and fired one .38 caliber bullet into the prosecutor's left
temple. McLaughlin, his left eye shattered by the bullet, collapsed
into his car. Bly leaned in and fired again.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the noise, another commuter shouted and Bly ran down
the tracks. About 150 yards from the station, he shed the clothing
that he believed would conceal his identity, but which actually
ended up tagging him as the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's blood was found on the outside of the discarded
clothing and a tiny piece of human tissue inside the ring finger of
the left glove was linked to Bly through DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   After the murder, Bly raced into a nearby backyard, tossed the
gun under a camping trailer, and rode off in Gittens' car.
</P>
<P>
   The massive investigation that began that night spent a year
focusing on a Jamaica Plain gang member, Jesus Carrasquillo, before
DNA testing excluded him but not Bly.
</P>
<P>
   With relentless pressure from the Boston and State police
detectives on the McLaughlin ``team,'' Bly's onetime allies began
to implicate him in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   And Bly himself aided detectives when Murray and Sergeant
Detective William Mahoney visited him in prison in 1996. They let
him smoke cigarettes, which were used to confirm DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   Bly was finally indicted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He had been imprisoned since late 1995, after a colleague of
McLaughlin's, Michael Pomarole, took over the carjacking case
following his murder and won a conviction with the help of Alston's
testimony. Bly was sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Judge McDaniel ordered Bly's life sentence to begin
only after he has completed his current term. The Supreme Judicial
Court will automatically review the case.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Police Lieutenant Detective Stephen Murphy, one of the
investigators, said there was special significance that the verdict
came on the weekend when Americans honor fallen servicemen and
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a war,'' Murphy said of McLaughlin. ``He was in a
war on drugs. He was in a war against crime. And he paid for his
service with his life.''

   Coca-Cola bubbling with anticipation
</P>
<P>
   By Al Levine
</P>
<P>
   c 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ Kyle Petty ripped the state of Winston Cup stock
car racing the other day, testifying that it has become ``boring.''
Boy, did he pick the wrong weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway has a
garage-full of storylines, including one of the tired old ones
involving Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   It's the big-league debut of Dale Earnhardt Jr., the most
heavily hyped introduction in years, starting in the eighth
position in the No. 8 Chevrolet. He did nothing to diminish the
hype Saturday with the third-fastest lap in morning practice,
179.533 mph, and the second-fastest in happy hour, 176.321 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them guys are tough,'' Junior said of his new running mates.
``I just got my car running pretty good in practice this morning.
At least we'll be competitive with some of these guys. It's a
different program over there, the cars drive different.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the second leg of Tony Stewart's iron-man effort:
Indianapolis 500 in the afternoon, Coke 600 in the evening. He'll
be bumped to the back of the field (he qualified fourth) if he
misses the 4:15 p.m. driver's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was late Saturday afternoon, running the fastest
lap in the final Cup practice, 176.528 mph, before jetting to
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Jeff Gordon factor: He's going for his third
consecutive win in the Coca-Cola 600. He qualified 10th. Bobby
Labonte starts on the pole for the second time in two weeks at this
track.
</P>
<P>
   Points leader Dale Jarrett will try to pick his way through the
field _ as he did to win at Richmond _ starting 28th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long day and the main thing we're trying to ensure is
that we're gonna be there all day,'' Jarrett said. ``I just want to
make sure I take the time to get it up in the top five and then get
it adjusted at night because the track is probably gonna change
more the last 200 miles compared to what we see the first 300 or
400.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than all that, it's just another NASCAR weekend. The
results may well bear out Petty's contention: ``It's a homogenized
sport. Everybody looks the same, does the same, talks the same and
gives the same answers. The bigger it gets it seems to lose a
little bit of its character.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pre-race anticipation is anything but routine. Perhaps a
Little E can make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, after beating Earnhardt Jr., in the Busch Carquest
300, Mark Martin said he wouldn't be surprised to see Little E in
victory lane today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might win this thing,'' Martin said. ``One of his (team's)
greatest assets is they don't know for sure how hard it's going to
be, and that's good. They'll just go out there and do it. Nothing
will hold them back if they go with what they feel and no history
to consider. I have no idea how he'll finish but he`s obviously an
incredibly talented young man.''

BONDS REHAB A GIANT BOOST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Giants have survived so far without
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds , going 19-16 entering the weekend since his April
20 elbow surgery. Now it looks like he could return well before the
All-Star break target date.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday's 12-inning loss in St. Louis, Bonds took
batting practice in the indoor cage at Busch Stadium for a second
straight day, and hitting coach Gene Clines was raving.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked real good,'' said Clines, who threw to Bonds for
about 15 minutes before Wednesday's game. ``It was probably the
best I've seen him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds was scheduled to take batting practice on the field for
the first time during the weekend series in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Clines would not speculate on whether Bonds could be back sooner
than 10 weeks, which is the expected length of his rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to him,'' Clines said. ''Right now, he's remarkable.
You can't put a time and date (on his return). He's got a
reputation as a fast healer. Anything could happen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TAKING OFF
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, who set a major-league record by hitting 20 homers
last June, is getting hot again. Sosa's game-winning homer against
Florida on Wednesday at Wrigley Field was his 12th in the last 24
games and his 73rd in 154 games since last May 25. Mark McGwire had
59 in the same time span. Before Sosa's homer off Atlanta's Kevin
Millwood
</P>
<P>
   on May 25, 1998, he had just nine home runs on the season. Sosa
finished with 66, four behind McGwire, who hit his 14th Thursday
against the Giants' Mark Gardner. Exactly one year earlier, McGwire
also took Gardner deep at Busch Stadium. It was his 21st. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AROUND
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, like everyone else, needs bullpen help. Closer
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Olson , who has a 5.40 ERA in 18 appearances, is just 5
for 10 in save situations. Right-hander Darren Holmes
</P>
<P>
   might not be available out of the bullpen until early next week,
since he had a shot Tuesday to relieve a nerve impingement in his
back. Further hindering the trade efforts is the injury to pitcher
Todd Stottlemyre, since Brian Anderson
</P>
<P>
   has moved into the rotation and is not expendable. Of their 16
road losses, seven came on home runs that ended the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIG BREAK
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers face Pittsburgh this week, they'll see Pirates
closer Mike Williams , who signed a two-year, $2.2 million contract
last Wednesday after resurrecting a career that appeared lost.
</P>
<P>
   Handed the closer's role in the first week of the season when
Rich Loiselle went down with an elbow injury, Williams has gone 1-1
in 21 appearances with eight saves in 10 chances and a 1.59 earned
run average.
</P>
<P>
   Williams signed with the Pirates as a minor-league free agent
Dec. 18, 1997, after spending the previous year bouncing from the
Phillies to the Red Sox to the Royals organizations. He pitched at
Triple-A Nashville until June 16, when he joined the Pirates after
Jose Silva fractured his right forearm. Williams made 36 middle
relief appearances and one emergency start, going 4-2 with a 1.94
ERA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARTY TIME
</P>
<P>
   Giants pitcher Kirk Rueter grew up in tiny Hoyleton, Ill., about
60 miles north of St. Louis. The population is around 200 and
there's one stop sign in the town. Before the Cardinals series,
Rueter invited the whole team to his house in Nashville, Ill.,
Hoyleton's big-town neighbor (population: 2,000). Seventeen players
turned out, which says a lot of team unity. They hung out in
Rueter's 4,500 square-foot game room, adjacent to the main house.
The room is filled with video games, a full bar, a big-screen TV
and a shuffleboard. ``It's my dream room,'' said Rueter, who beat
St. Louis on Wednesday and is 4-0 with a 2.21 ERA in six career
starts at Busch Stadium. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FINALLY
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Padres had nine players make a total of 10 trips
to the DL. This year, eight Padres have gone on the DL. The
opening-day starting eight has not started together since. . . . .
Phillies rookie second baseman Marlon Anderson
</P>
<P>
   is hitting .485 with 21 RBI when runners are in scoring position
and just .139 when there is nobody in scoring position. Broadcaster
Harry Kalas suggested on the air that the Phillies put a mannequin
on second whenever Anderson bats. &QL;

LITTLE TOWN SAYS NO TO BIG-GOVERNMENT MONEY FOR NEW LIBRARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SWEET SPRINGS, Mo. _ Five years ago folks here decided they
needed to replace their 40-year-old, book-jammed library, which _
with just 700 square feet of space _ was smaller than most
convenience stores.
</P>
<P>
   The cost? Estimates came to $70,000. Over the years the city had
squirreled away $40,000 for just such a project. The rest seemed
easy _ the federal Library Services Construction Act would pony up
the remaining $30,000 in the form of a grant.
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries were made, forms were filled out. Officials at the
Missouri State Library, which administers the act, assured F.C.
Dohrman, now mayor but then acting as a member of the town's
library board, that the money was in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the grant was approved, an odd thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Springs turned the federal money down flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd gotten around to really reading the fine print on the
forms,'' Dohrman said. ``Instead of jumping through all those
hoops, the library board recommended that the city turn the grant
down and raise the money ourselves. I'm sure we didn't make the
people who give out the grants real happy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed,'' said Barbara Reading, development
director at the state library. ``The Sweet Springs library had done
a lot of work. So had our staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month volunteers here started toting the first of an
estimated 10,000 books out of the former library at 325 Spring St.
and over to a new, 2,900-square-foot brick library just half a
block away at 217 Turner St.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just love it,'' said Jennie Aiken, the librarian.
``There so much more space, so much more light. And we didn't miss
a day of being open.''
</P>
<P>
   Dohrman's convinced that Sweet Springs' new library wouldn't be
open today if the city had gone for the grant money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have made it federal,'' he said. ``Out here,
construction companies won't even bid on federal projects. Won't
touch 'em. Too much red tape, too many forms to fill out, too many
people in the way. Add what the regulations and assurances and all
the rest would have meant and you're looking at double what it
ended up costing.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Dohrman said, even if a willing bidder/builder could have
been found, Sweet Springs isn't exactly the big city. The library
project would have been low priority, one of those small jobs
construction companies fit in between big ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have gotten to us when they could,'' he said. ``Which
means we'd still just have a vacant lot. Our construction began in
December (1998) and was pretty much finished by March. ''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Chuck Ahlemann, pastor of the First Baptist Church and
also a library board member, recalls that some residents weren't
overly pleased when they learned that what seemed like a $30,000
windfall had been rejected. That much money, for a town of 1,900,
is a sizable piece of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all you had to do was read some of the regulations to them
_ continual on-site inspections, a certified architect, an
engineer, paperwork about paperwork, and on and on,'' Ahlemann
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that some of the requirements, all of which would have
to have been accounted for on reams of more paper, were just plain
common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, in building the library, Sweet Springs wasn't about
to use lead-based paint, block access for the disabled or
discriminate against anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go through the forms closely and you begin to wonder who
they're talking about,'' Ahlemann said. ``This is a good town and
these are decent people. This is their town. What sort of people do
they think we are?''
</P>
<P>
   Once people here knew the score, they jumped in with both feet.
</P>
<P>
   There were chili suppers, bake and rummage sales, pancake
breakfasts. A former resident stopped by a tavern, heard about the
drive while drinking a beer and left a $100 check on the bar. The
newspaper publicized what was happening. Elementary school teachers
here came up with $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did all sorts of things,'' said resident Winifred
Lynch. ``People even came out and watched the building go up. You
just can't imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Zumbehl, president of the Friends of the Sweet Springs
Library, said the fund drive, which has raised more than $28,000
with money still coming in, has been an eyeopener in regard to
community involvement. Several bequests for specific
library-related projects are waiting in the wings, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have just been so helpful,'' she said. ``It's just been
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Markenson, executive director of the Missouri Municipal
League, said a city turning down a federal grant, while not unheard
of, was rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, there's not that much grant money floating around,'' he
said. ``Where we see it happen is mainly in water and wastewater
systems. A town or city will figure that the all the red tape isn't
worth it in the long run. So they'll go out and borrow the money,
build the system to their specifications, not some government ones,
and figure they're ahead because they're out from all the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``But turning down federal money. We don't keep track of it. But
no, it doesn't happen very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading of the state library said other towns in Missouri _
Salem and Sikeston, for instance _ had used grant money for library
construction. Unfortunately, she said, that particular grant
program has now ended.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Springs is just getting started. Money now is needed for
more shelving, Internet access, additional furnishings and, as
always, more books. Donations can be made to the Friends of the
Sweet Springs Library, 217 Turner St., Sweet Springs, MO 65351.
</P>
<P>
   Ahlemann said he found humor in some of the regulations,
especially one that assured the federal government that the Sweet
Springs library wouldn't create a ``vibration'' that would damage
nearby historic structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can figure that one out,'' he said. ``What do you think they
thought we'd be doing in a library that'd cause damaging
vibrations?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, the only historic structure even near the library is
our old, 19th century city jail. Everybody here knows not even a
tornado would budge it.''

MUSINGS ON RUBIN, MUSER AND MORE TO LAST THE LONG WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marketplace musings for a long holiday weekend: Nothing about
the stock market has been more reassuring than the way investors
have begun to rediscover honest-to-goodness, real-world value.
</P>
<P>
   - Reasonable minds may disagree on what performance rating to
give outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, but a grateful
nation should be thankful to him for his probity in office.
</P>
<P>
   - Speaking of performance, those who theorize that a baseball
manager doesn't have much effect on a team's fortunes should pay
closer attention to the what the Royals' Tony Muser is doing with
the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   - Why are the chips at the bottom of the package always so
crumbly?
</P>
<P>
   - Wake me when the ``Star Wars'' wretched excesses have run
their course.
</P>
<P>
   - John McCain is so far the only presidential candidate to
emerge with anything remotely resembling the leadership qualities
Americans once demanded of candidates for the nation's highest
office.
</P>
<P>
   - Whatever happened to Robert Blake?
</P>
<P>
   - ``Law &AMP; Order'' is the best prime-time drama on television.
</P>
<P>
   - You're getting old if you can remember when men's billfolds
were routinely referred to as wallets.
</P>
<P>
   - You can bet that when a television program opens with a
``warning'' about adult language and situations, what follows isn't
likely to have anything to do with how reasonably mature adults
behave.
</P>
<P>
   - Is it my imagination, or were Kansas and Missouri legislators
particularly unproductive during this year's sessions?
</P>
<P>
   - The seeming progress in the push to abolish boarding
restrictions at Missouri's riverboat casinos is certainly good news
for everyone who thinks adults should be treated like adults.
</P>
<P>
   - With all the high-tech gizmos television stations blather
about to woo viewers, surely some resident genius could come up
with a way to show the weather-alert graphic without superimposing
it over the on-screen score and clock display during NBA playoff
games.
</P>
<P>
   - My goal in life is to spend my entire existence on the planet
without ever seeing a ``Star Wars'' movie, and so far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   - You know the new era on Wall Street has finally been
recognized as such because nobody gets spastic anymore when the Dow
Jones industrial average suffers a low triple-digit loss.
</P>
<P>
   - Even though Jeff King's retirement didn't cost him his entire
'99 pay package, the former Royal still wins this year's Diogenes
Award for being honest enough to walk away instead of faking it
just to keep the big paychecks coming.
</P>
<P>
   - The big-money television match pitting Tiger Woods against
David Duval as prime-time entertainment risks making golf a trash
sport.
</P>
<P>
   - Forget about it if you're expecting the same magnitude of
media reaction over Chinagate that it showed over Iran-Contra.
</P>
<P>
   - Are African violets still as popular as houseplants as they
were during my youth?
</P>
<P>
   - The decision by Ford to build another new vehicle model at its
Claycomo plant is yet another big vote of confidence in Kansas City
and its labor force.

CHICAGO SCHOOLS HELD AS A MODEL FOR WHAT KC COULD DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Beethoven Elementary is indicative of how far this
city had to go to turn around its deeply troubled public school
system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, just 5 percent of Beethoven's nearly 900 students
scored at or above national norms in reading. Only 11 percent
scored at those levels in math.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were struggling,'' said Frances Oden, who worked at the
school 30 years before becoming principal in 1994. ``We were
struggling for parental involvement, for children to achieve, to
get teachers to go back to school for additional degrees. We were
struggling for repairs, to get more money for things we wanted to
do. There was a lot of instability.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the problems Beethoven and Chicago faced were
representative of those faced by Kansas City, Mo., and other major
U.S. cities that are failing to educate their children, especially
poor minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see in America now is urban flight because of
schools,'' said Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, who took over
responsibility for the schools in 1995. ``Any city over 100,000 (in
population) is in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade after reform began in the 430,000-student
Chicago Public Schools, things are much different at Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   More than 35 percent of Beethoven's students now score at or
above national norms in reading. Math scores show similar
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   And while academic performance at Beethoven and districtwide
still trail national standards, a steady trend of improvement is
evident. Truancy is down across the district. By 1997, test scores
had shown a seven-year upward trend at 157 of the district's nearly
560 public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Graduation rates are also up slightly. Expectations are high.
And people are moving back into the public schools in the nation's
third-largest district.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is sold on the Chicago way. Nor are they convinced
that the changes enacted there can work for every city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chicago's progress is drawing the attention of political
leaders and educators across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Emanuel Cleaver even flirted with the idea of a
mayoral takeover of the Kansas City School District, similar to
what happened in Chicago, before he left office in April. Mayor Kay
Barnes says she has no interest in running the district.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Chase, the district's interim chief administrator for
curriculum and instruction, said Kansas City planned to introduce a
summer school program based on the Chicago model. The district also
plans to require third-, fifth- and eighth-grade students to pass
mandatory tests before advancing to the next grade. Chicago already
requires such tests.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said the Chicago reforms provided hope for improving the
Kansas City district.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a system as large as Chicago can initiate some of these
positive changes, I certainly think it is possible in a smaller
district like Kansas City,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of Chicago's reform movement were planted more than a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of turmoil and bolstered by educational and business
studies detailing the failure of the schools, Chicagoans in 1988
descended on the state capital to demand change.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers responded with the Chicago School Reform Law.
</P>
<P>
   The law stripped much of the power and money from a highly
politicized central bureaucracy and redistributed it to every
school through local school councils. The councils have six
parents, two teachers, two community members and the principal; in
high schools, one student sits on the council.
</P>
<P>
   They meet about once a month and are responsible for developing
school improvement plans, making budget decisions, and hiring and
evaluating the principal.
</P>
<P>
   For the first several years, however, reforms moved forward
unevenly, with many schools showing no progress. Most agree it
wasn't until 1995, when the state gave Daley sweeping authority
over the troubled system, that true reform took hold.
</P>
<P>
   Daley immediately appointed his chief of staff to head a reform
board. And he chose the city's budget director, Paul Vallas, to
take over day-to-day administration of the district.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's team immediately overhauled a bloated budget, made peace
with the teachers union, and invested millions of dollars of city
money in school building repairs and construction.
</P>
<P>
   The district next turned its attention to academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the district put on probation 109 schools that had 15
percent or less of their students scoring at or above national
norms. The district then gave those schools intensive help to
improve. Seven high schools that continued to fail were
reconstituted. Three principals were fired, and nearly 200 teachers
were removed from the schools.
</P>
<P>
   The system also extended the school day and added preschool
classes, tutors and after-school programs. Schools once again
became the centers of community activities. Some schools now stay
open until 10 p.m. on weeknights and 6 p.m. Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   The district also ended the practice of social promotion by
requiring students to pass tests in reading and math in the third,
sixth, eighth and ninth grades before being allowed to advance to
the next grade. In 1997 alone, the district held back 16,000
students. Students held back must attend summer school. &QL;

<P>
   The community also responded.
</P>
<P>
   The philanthropic community pumps about $20 million annually
into the district, and businesses now routinely provide services,
mentors or supplies. Local universities aid the district by doing
in-depth research to determine which reform initiatives are working
best.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is sold on the Chicago model, and problems
still exist.
</P>
<P>
   High school reform has not gone as well. Many schools still
struggle academically. Teacher training needs to be improved. Some
worry that teachers may be focusing too much on the high-stakes
tests and not enough on instruction. Others are concerned that
holding back so many students could lead to a surge in dropouts
later on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree that it has really worked at anything more than
a cosmetic level,'' said Arthur A. Benson II, attorney for the
plaintiff schoolchildren in the Kansas City desegregation lawsuit.
``Some of the things they've done promise short-term gains at the
expense of long-term improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Chicago, Benson said the Kansas City School District
didn't need help from City Hall, but from a qualified
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most in Chicago are convinced that Daley has the city's
school system headed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no simple formulas or miracles,'' Daley said. ``Our
performance is doing much better. Not great, but better.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Beethoven, Principal Frances Oden said the effect of reform
was obvious and immediate.
</P>
<P>
   New paint. New furniture. New books. A new gymnasium. Dingy and
scratched plastic windows replaced with glass.
</P>
<P>
   City workers fixed the school's balky heating system.
</P>
<P>
   The school eventually used its new discretionary money to extend
the school day and hire more teachers to reduce class sizes. The
building focused intensely on reading. Students now spend 90
minutes on language arts each morning and an additional hour
reading in the after-school program.
</P>
<P>
   Oden said the reforms also brought about accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew they had to produce _ principals, teachers and
children,'' Oden said.
</P>
<P>
   Ending social promotion also seemed to make children more
focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realized that at the end of the year, they might not get
promoted,'' Oden said.
</P>
<P>
   The school also tried to make parents accountable. All are asked
to sign a contract agreeing to help with their children's homework
every night. The school also sends home a progress report every
five weeks so parents are constantly aware of their children's
school performance.
</P>
<P>
   Oden also began emphasizing teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best change, according to Oden, is the ability to pick
up the telephone and reach a decision-maker in the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're able to talk to people, get answers and get things
done,'' she said. ``You don't get the runaround anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Parent volunteers now roam the hallways. Teachers willingly work
longer hours and are motivated to take additional training because
they see the positive results in student test scores.
</P>
<P>
   A health clinic opened in the school. A recreation program was
added. The school now serves dinner to many of its students.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the changes in the building also have created a change
in the students, nearly all of whom live in the Robert Taylor Homes
public housing project, one of the city's poorest and most
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Today, gangs still roam and gunfire still echoes through the
concrete canyons of the project. But for children accustomed to
despair, Beethoven now serves as an oasis of hope and high
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come in with aggressive tendencies because they have to
fight in the Homes,'' Oden said. ``They live in a society totally
different in the projects than what's acceptable here in a school
setting. They may have their gangs outside, but not in here. This
is a safe haven for the children.''

RED SOX AWAIT MARTINEZ DUO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The surprising Boston Red Sox got more good news
this past week when former Dodger Ramon Martinez
</P>
<P>
   threw two simulated games and reported no problems in his
rehabilitation from right shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez pitched four innings and threw a total of 60 pitches.
He is scheduled to undergo a similar workout in five days as he
continues toward a July return to the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' said brother Pedro Martinez , who leads the
majors with 10 victories. ``I am very excited for him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still early, but on a team already encouraged by two
recent victories over the Yankees by minor-league call-up
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose , plans are being made.
</P>
<P>
   The first has Martinez pitching in his first minor-league game
by the middle of June. Such a timetable could have Martinez
pitching for the Red Sox just before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Boston still wants Martinez to throw live batting practice or
simulated games at least three times before his first minor-league
start June 16. He will make at least three or four appearances in
the minors before pitching again in the majors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RAFFY IS IFFY
</P>
<P>
   Interleague play begins Friday and the Texas Rangers will be at
Dodger Stadium the following Monday. There is no DH in the National
League parks, meaning Rafael Palmeiro must either be ready to play
first base or sit the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a decision to make pretty soon,'' said Palmeiro, off to
a great start offensively but limited to DH duty because of a
spring-training knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how I feel when I get home. We'll make an evaluation
to see how I am and see if I can get out there. I might play before
then. You never know. This stuff is day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are 16-9 away from home, which could be a good sign
for them since they play 20 of 28 on the road during June. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WILD THING
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the White Sox's red-hot John Snyder drop his last
two starts before Saturday's win, their closer Bob Howry has walked
10 over his last 41/3 innings. Howry, who for now has lost his job
to veteran Bill Simas , openly compares himself to Mark Wohlers.
``It's Pitching 101,'' said Howry, 8 for 10 in save situations.
``Learning how to throw strikes.'' The White Sox believe the
problem began May 4 at Camden Yards when Howry got caught up in
having the speed of his pitches shown on the stadium scoreboard. It
ruined his focus and mechanics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NUMBERS GAME
</P>
<P>
   With two more RBI on Wednesday, Cleveland's Manny Ramirez
</P>
<P>
   had 59 in the Indians' first 45 games. He's on pace to drive in
212. ``The way Manny has produced last year and this year, says a
lot about his maturation,'' said Indians manager Mike Hargrove.
``If he stays on the road, people have to look at him as a major
force in baseball. He's not there yet, but he's on a road very few
of us get to travel.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   In six games against the Twins over the past two weeks, the
Seattle Mariners hit 23 homers. ``Go ask them what they're
eating,'' Twins DH Marty Cordova said, ``besides pitchers.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND GETS AN A
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics are planning a special day to honor Hall of Fame
pitcher Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter on June 12 before the A's play the
Dodgers in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, ace of the 1970s A's World Series championship teams,
has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's Disease _ Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis _ and the day will be dedicated to raising money for the
Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter ALS Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   During pre-game ceremonies, Hunter, a four-time 20-game winner
with the A's and the owner of three World Series rings, will be
joined on the field by his family and a number of former teammates,
including Reggie Jackson, Bert Campaneris, Ray Fosse, Rick Monday,
John ``Blue Moon'' Odom and Joe Rudi in addition to former A's
manager Dick Williams . This is the 25th anniversary of the A's
third consecutive World Series win, a five-game victory over the
Dodgers. &QL;

MOBILE PHONES CREATE ETIQUETTE QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When a wireless phone started ringing at a
showing of the movie ``Life is Beautiful,'' Bob Moore was not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   What annoyed him was that a man answered it and carried on a
normal conversation as if he were in his own living room watching a
video.
</P>
<P>
   When it happened again, Moore's ire grew. The third time was too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think was, `What is the deal with this guy? Where
is his common courtesy?' &UR; '' said Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing for me is that you would think that if the
phone rings, a person at the very least would get up and leave if
he needed to carry on the conversation,'' said Moore, director of
public relations for the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Often, however, that is not the case. As wireless phones become
more popular, the chance of someone's call interrupting your
enjoyment is increasing.
</P>
<P>
   From school recitals to restaurants, theaters to college
lectures, and churches to golf courses, the phones seem to be in
use everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   People have witnessed others answering and placing calls in
stalls at public restrooms and at grave sites at funerals.
</P>
<P>
   For those who believe they must be reachable, wireless companies
are reminding people to mind their p's and q's when they reach to
answer or make calls. A backlash is growing against those who do
not consider that their calls can be an annoyance to others.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``phone rage.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Southwestern Bell Wireless survey found that Americans,
indeed, were growing increasingly frustrated with the bad behavior
of some wireless phone users.
</P>
<P>
   Already people curse and complain about those who talk on the
phone while driving. Some have suggested banning wireless use in
the car except for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   But such bans don't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Chicago White Sox baseball players banned the
use of cellular phones in their clubhouse before and after games,
saying, ``When you come to work, you come to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals and the Chiefs also ban the use of such phones in the
clubhouse and the locker room. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not limited to the United States. In Korea, ``No
Mobile Phone'' signs are being added next to ``No Smoking'' signs
in public places. The measure came after a young female athlete and
a university professor got into a brawl after the professor scolded
her for talking too loud on her phone while on a bus.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is allowing the installation of call-blocking technology
to create call-free zones. An Israeli company offers similar
technology for sale on the Internet. That technology, however, is
illegal in the United States. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tim Ayers, a spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications
Industry Association, said people were noticing wireless phones
more because the industry had grown rapidly. There are about 74
million subscribers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That leads to them being in places where they never were in
the past,'' he said.

<P>
   Locally, phone rage is just beginning to pop up.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to some area restaurants and theaters revealed no bans.
But at a recent screening of the new ``Star Wars'' movie, an
official at AMC's Studio 30 in Olathe asked filmgoers to turn off
their modern-day communications devices, along with their light
sabers, so they did not disturb others. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the New Theatre Restaurant in Overland Park, Kan., co-owner
Richard Carrothers said the phones had not been that big of a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, before the show, we always make an announcement for
people to turn off their cell phones and beepers,'' Carrothers
said. ``If somebody does leave it beeping, at intermission the
stage manager lets the house manager know where it is, and they go
and politely ask them to turn it off. But we don't confiscate
them.''

   The Rev. Steven Robertson of Atonement Lutheran Church in
Overland Park said he never had a phone ring in a service. He would
be concerned if such a problem started.
</P>
<P>
   ``No person is that indispensable that they need to have a phone
around them all the time,'' Robertson said. ``In some ways it is
arrogant to think that we are that indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are so focused on work, why are you at worship anyway?
You certainly are not focusing on God.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennie Smith, managing partner of Newcomer-Smith Memorial Chapel
&AMP; Crematory in Olathe, Kan., however, knows just how distracting
and inappropriate a ringing phone can be.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent grave site committal service, an attendee's phone
rang. The person answered and walked away from the tent to take the
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It immediately drew people's attention away from the message
being sent,'' he said. ``The minister did continue with the
committal, but it was disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the problem had not become an epidemic, but that it
was only a matter of time before signs or messages would be printed
asking people to be sensitive to the grieving family by turning off
communication devices.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell has joined forces with Peggy Post,
great-granddaughter-in-law of Emily Post and author of the 75th
anniversary edition of Emily Post's Etiquette, to promote wireless
etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``By combining common sense and consideration for others, and
letting the phone features help us out, there is a right time and
place for using a wireless phone,'' Post said. ``They are a
terrific thing.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cross, president of Cross Manufacturing Inc. of Overland
Park, knows just how intrusive a phone can be. So when he had to
make two calls while at lunch, he made sure that he did not talk
louder than the ambient noise of the outdoor dining area and that
his calls were brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't routinely use the phone in the restaurant,'' he said.
``Normally, I will use it in the car. This time was an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   He put the phone away after making the necessary business calls.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Martin wrote in Miss Manners' Guide to the Perfectly
Proper Use of Cellular Telephones, published by the cellular
industry association: ``Interruptions are interruptions, no matter
how much they cost to make, and it is rude to interrupt people or
activities. While it is true that emergencies override this rule,
emergencies are, by definition, so rare that they are unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``At those rare moments when fate hangs in the balance, ordinary
invitations should not be issued or accepted. For people who have
jobs where crisis is the rule, there are usually arrangements for
others to cover when one takes time for the normal business of
life.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Americans are growing increasingly frustrated with the behavior
of some wireless phone users. As more and more people get wireless
telephones, the chance for the devices to offend will increase.
Here are some etiquette tips to remember:
</P>
<P>
   When riding public transportation, avoid loud, animated
conversations by speaking in quiet or normal conversational tones.
Also, avoid extended calls.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the ringer as low as possible to avoid disturbing others.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, if ever, is it appropriate to have conversations during
lectures, concerts, plays, movies, funerals, church services or
other social gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the people you are with usually take priority over a
phone call. Having a conversation in their presence implies they
are not important.
</P>
<P>
   If you must take a call, excuse yourself to a less-disruptive
area.
</P>
<P>
   Inform the person you call that you are using a wireless phone,
so if the connection fades or drops, the person will know to wait
to see if clarity returns.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on safety first. Do not use wireless phones when they
would interrupt your ability to drive or walk.
</P>
<P>
   Use caller ID, voice mail or vibrating batteries to limit
disturbing others. Source: Peggy Post, great-granddaughter-in-law

FUROR OVER CHINESE SPYING OVERLOOKS ONE FACT: EVERYONE DOES IT 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN and RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four years ago a Chinese agent walked into an
American embassy and handed over stacks of classified documents to
the CIA, just like in a spy novel.
</P>
<P>
   But was he still working for Beijing? Some of his papers
contained bad information. Yet one document alerted U.S.
intelligence that the Chinese had plans for a sophisticated,
miniature nuclear warhead remarkably like those used atop American
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   It pointed to an extensive intelligence leak at American weapons
labs. It set off an uproar over national security. And it reignited
longstanding suspicions about China and sparked other questions
that America is still trying to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Such as: Why would a Chinese agent help American spycatchers?
``For a spy novelist,'' said author David Ignatius, ``that's just
too juicy.''
</P>
<P>
   Was Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee really a mole, one whose
success with a hard drive would dumbfound a James Bond? Maybe,
maybe not, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   And one other question, a huge one: How should the U.S. react?
</P>
<P>
   To that, experts on espionage remind us that this is not a
novel. It is the real world of international relations, where even
the coziest allies snoop on one another.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody should be shocked by charges that China, which the U.S.
has been courting by opening up trade and downplaying its
human-rights abuses, is spying on the world's military giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've known that for a long time,'' said Robert Gates, a
career intelligence officer who headed the CIA in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get ourselves out of the Cold War mindset that
you're either all our friends or all our enemies. Most countries in
the world are going to be simultaneously our friends or adversaries
in different areas.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not sit well with U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is a monstrous military dictatorship, and they hate us.
We're bending over backwards pretending they're our friends, when
we should be recognizing them as our enemies,'' said the California
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Adolf Hitler had stolen the technology to drop a nuclear
bomb, should we have shrugged our shoulders and said, `Well, spying
is spying'?''
</P>
<P>
   Many are calling for retaliation by pulling back from talks with
the Chinese on trade issues, denying them entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers argue that Americans who share Rohrabacher's
outrage are guided not only by us-against-them notions about the
spy trade, but also by fears that China will be our rival for
superpower status in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way nations today usually react to spying allegations is,
they kick out a few delegates, exchange nasty notes and then, amid
all the embarrassment, they go back to doing business,'' said
Gregory Treverton, co-author of In from the Cold, a report on the
future of U.S. intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``But something in us likes and fears the idea of superpowers'
squaring off. We're familiar with this environment. The Cold War
demonstrated that interests in Washington can benefit from this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Espionage is simply the way of the world, and it has been at
least since the Bible. Joshua used spies. So did Moses.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Tzu, the Chinese military philosopher, wrote: ``Spies are
sent into the enemy camp bearing false information, then unmasked
in order to create confusion and turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems especially appropriate when the question is raised:
What was the mysterious Chinese agent supposed to accomplish in
giving the CIA those documents in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   Some have pointed to a disinformation effort by Beijing.
Triggering a spy-hunting attitude toward Chinese scientists could
help stem a brain drain to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Chinese simply made a mistake, giving the CIA an
unexpected but important insight on the W-88 warhead while trying
to lay the groundwork to prepare a future triple agent.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe a few well-placed hard-liners in the Chinese government
believed that Beijing was getting too cozy with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the spy business, things often are not as they seem. Take
France.
</P>
<P>
   Five Americans _ four of them CIA agents _ were expelled from
Paris in 1995 after authorities there accused them of political and
economic espionage. The bungled operation forced the U.S. to
suspend nearly all of its covert operations in France.
</P>
<P>
   French intelligence, in turn, reportedly has spied on U.S.
companies by wiretapping American businessmen flying Air France
between New York and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French conduct the most aggressive espionage against us of
any country in world, but they're allies in the Balkans,'' former
CIA Director Gates said. ``That's the way it's going to be for most
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Jay Pollard, a U.S. Navy intelligence analyst, spied
for another ally, Israel, which rewarded him for supplying so many
documents that experts said they would fill a 360-square-foot box.
Steven Lalas, a U.S. Embassy employee in Athens, gave Greece the
names of CIA agents.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, undercover FBI officers arrested a former
Australian intelligence agent _ Jean-Philippe Wispelaere, 28 _
after he allegedly cut a $120,000 deal to sell them top-secret U.S.
satellite photos and classified documents. Court papers identify
the nation for which Wispelaere was thought to be working only as
``Country A.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the most sensational spy cases of recent times, until the
China scandal, have featured Americans selling out to the
once-dreaded Communists of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames and his wife, Rosario, passed on
classified information to the Soviet Union in what, until now,
officials called the most damaging case in U.S. history. Ames is
blamed for the deaths of at least nine American agents in the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Walker Jr., a retired Navy warrant officer, led a family
spy ring that for two decades sold our missile submarine
information to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Spying permeates the conduct of international commerce and
diplomacy. ``The danger you get into is moral equivalence,'' said
Vince Cannistraro, former director of clandestine services for the
CIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most modern economic espionage is about getting a bead on a
new kind of chip design, or getting an advantage on World Trade
Organization negotiations,'' said Ignatius, whose portrayal of
fictional espionage is praised in the intelligence community.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to distinguish between the things that could get you
killed and the things that won't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese spy scandal, said Ignatius, a columnist for The
Washington Post, ``has the potential to create a genuine strategic
threat that would put our lives at risk.'' &QL;

FUROR OVER CHINESE SPYING OVERLOOKS ONE FACT: EVERYONE DOES IT 
</HEADLINE>
 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By By DAVID GOLDSTEIN and RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week a report from the House committee headed by Rep.
Christopher Cox concluded that the Chinese had obtained data on
every thermonuclear warhead currently being deployed by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, they also acquired information on building
high-tech aircraft, launching their missiles and detecting our
submarines.
</P>
<P>
   But there are questions still about the guilt of the central
character of the saga, Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   It may be true that Lee, the former nuclear-weapons scientist at
Los Alamos National Laboratory, downloaded classified data, but was
it to forward these secrets to the Chinese?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Cox report's assumptions, that is not certain.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's a spy, a dupe or just a sloppy keeper of secrets,
Lee for now is a free man living out his forced retirement not far
from the New Mexico lab. While the moving of data from computer to
computer violated lab security rules, no criminal statute on
espionage covers the act.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be the first time a mole got away with it. U.S.
spycatchers have never figured out who all the agents were in an
earlier Los Alamos spy ring run by the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   And although Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for their
role in leaking atomic secrets, at least one known spy (an American
physicist living comfortably in England today) in the network was
not pursued for fear it would tip off Moscow's spymasters that some
of their codes had been broken.
</P>
<P>
   Weak security at weapons labs was not the only problem, the Cox
report notes. Lax export laws and squishy satellite-licensing
regulations were behind some leaks. Fingers are being pointed at
American businessmen who wanted to keep their expensive satellites
from blowing up atop Chinese commercial rockets or avoid losing
contracts to Europe on supercomputers or aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the secrets came from declassified articles
published in scientific journals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liken it to those Roadrunner cartoons, where the coyote runs
off a cliff and doesn't realize he's suspended in midair until he
looks down,'' said intelligence expert Treverton. ``Our
counterintelligence system just hasn't kept up with the radical
pace of technology and changes in international relations.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
While China took advantage of security lapses, several observers
said America also had trouble dealing with the way the Chinese
cloaked their clandestine operations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Russians, who operate in the ``classic espionage
manner'' _ recruiting agents and paying them for their disloyalty _
Chinese spies are said to ingratiate themselves with the people who
have the information they need, and then they play a waiting game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans find it hard to understand the way the Chinese
operate,'' said Paul Redmond, former director of
counterintelligence for the CIA. ``We're the Kmart society: instant
coffee, fast food, instant replay. Instant gratification. American
business thinks just to the end of the next quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese think in decades culturally, and they're willing
and patient and able to have somebody sitting there, gradually,
working their way in.''
</P>
<P>
   They also spread a wide canvas. Thomas Allen, who co-wrote Spy
Book: The Encyclopedia of Espionage, says China exports students as
spies. Allen wrote that on a tour of a French photographic firm,
students were seen ``dipping their ties into chemicals to acquire a
sample.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts counter that such intriguing behavior means little
in the context of some unromantic truths: China _ even with four
times as many people as the U.S. _ remains a relatively primitive
nation, both economically and technologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the U.S. that has all the weapons,'' said Robert Weil,
author of Red Cat, White Cat: China and the Contradictions of
Market Socialism. ``It's the U.S., not China, that maintains the
largest spy agencies in the world. And it's the U.S. that used
atomic bombs a few hundred miles from China's border during World
War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts note that even with some of our secrets in hand, the
Chinese have built fewer than 25 ICBMs capable of reaching any
American city. All of those weapons are less advanced than the
6,000 warheads that the United States could fire back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese would get obliterated, and they know it,'' said
Weil. ``I don't think they feel in any sense a threat to the U.S.
They think the United States does anything it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the anger seen outside the U.S. Embassy in Beijing after
the NATO bombing of China's Embassy in Belgrade was because Chinese
refused to believe that the American intelligence apparatus _ with
its huge ``black budget'' funding expensive spy submarines and
satellites _ could have contributed to such a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Weil, among others, attributed American distrust of China to ``a
strong element of racism'' similar to sentiments that spurred the
internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt Zia, a Chinese-American who serves as chief counsel for
export administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce, hinted at
this in a recent column for The New York Times: ``For reasons I
cannot fathom...Asian-Americans continue to be accused of having
dual loyalties to a degree far greater than any other immigrant
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions that remain from the Cox report, Weil thinks
the Chinese people have their own: ``Why are you setting us up as
the enemy?''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of China offer one swift answer: The issue is not the
way Americans treat the Chinese, but the way the Chinese treat the
Chinese, from Tiananmen Square to Tibet to Taiwan. The Clinton
administration's effort to engage Beijing on different levels, from
diplomacy to commerce, has been naive, they say, and the spying on
us simply proves it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I missing something here?'' said Rohrabacher. ``We're
dealing with Communist thugs.''

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By all accounts Harry Butters _ a young, rich Californian in
love with fast cars and polo _ was enjoying all the fruits of
privilege when he dedicated his life to a cause greater than
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Entrenched in the battlefields of France, the World War I
soldier wrote to his parents:
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem to you that for me this is all quite uncalled for.
(But) never will I have an opportunity to gain so much honorable
advancement for my own soul, or to do so much for the cause of the
world's progress, as I have here daily, defending the liberty that
mankind has so far gained....
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, my dear folks, we are indeed doing the world's work over
here, and I am in it to the finish....`For God, for Liberty, for
Honor.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   At 24, Butters was killed in action.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 80 years later _ as Americans prepare to
celebrate the last Memorial Day before 2000 _ the definition of
liberty has extended far beyond Butters' notion of freedom from
tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just as Kansas City's Liberty Memorial and museum are
set to undergo an $80 million reconstruction (a campaign to raise
the final $21 million begins today), the very definition of liberty
has been undergoing reconstruction from the time of its conception.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the military? Civil rights? In Butters' day, women
still could not vote and African-Americans, only 50 years out of
slavery, would face 50 more years of sanctioned segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Porn on the Internet? In his day, even socialists and union
organizers were denied rights of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Self-incrimination? The criminal Ernesto Miranda was not even
born. A half-century would pass before the U.S. Supreme Court would
rule that criminal suspects must be read their rights upon arrest.
</P>
<P>
   As for affirmative action, school prayer, same-sex marriages,
abortion, sex discrimination, the right to carry concealed weapons
and other issues, one can only guess what Butters would think. He
would know, though, that when it comes to liberty's age-old drama _
the rights of the individual vs. those of the community _ the
dialogue has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred years ago, individual liberty might have included
the right to dump trash into the stream that runs along your
property, because it's your property,'' said University of Kansas
law professor Richard E. Levy. ``But today we no longer recognize
that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberty, scholars say, invariably reflects the values of every
society that invokes it. As such, it has changed so many times that
only at its foundation _ freedom _ does liberty today resemble
notions of the past.
</P>
<P>
   To the ancient Greeks, liberty meant civic duty, moral duty and
freedom from foreign domination: the needs of the city before the
needs of the citizen.
</P>
<P>
   But in Rome, Stoic philosophers and early Christians later
propounded an idea that centuries afterward would have a profound
influence on the course of history: By nature, and under God, all
men are created equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it died,'' said Barry Shain, a political theorist at
Colgate University in New York. ``The idea that all people are
created equal comes out of Rome, but for the next 1,400 years we
have discrimination and slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of Europe for a thousand years, no one had any notion
of political or personal liberty. You had a reasonable expectation
of what the law was going to be, that the law should treat you
fairly, and you had the right to follow God. That was about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the notion of almost unfettered personal rights _ what
19th century philosopher John Stuart Mill called the right to
pursue ``our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt
to deprive others of theirs''_ is deemed elemental to Americans'
modern notion of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   It is over the bounds of such personal liberties that, in the
United States, countless court and rhetorical battles continue to
be waged:
</P>
<P>
   Rights of privacy. The right to bear arms. The right to free
speech, due process and religious expression. The right not to be
denied housing, employment or other civil rights because of race,
religion, gender, disability or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The common presumption is that these liberties naturally extend
from the Founding Fathers and the proclamation in the Declaration
of Independence that ``all men are created equal'' and have an
unalienable right to ``Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of
Happiness.'' &QL;

   But while the tie is certain, scholars insist that over time it
has been given a twist. They point out that not even the Founding
Fathers believed in absolute equality. At the time the phrase ``all
men are created equal'' was penned, it did not apply to women,
nonlandholders or a vast population of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty has come to mean much more than it did to the Founding
Fathers,'' said New York University law professor John Phillip
Reid, author of The Concept of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ``they expected liberties to be expanded as new
definitions came along,'' he said. But Reid and others believe that
even the Founding Fathers might have raised their 18th century
eyebrows at the direction in which the definition of liberty _
particularly personal liberty _ has been expanded.
</P>
<P>
   To John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Benjamin
Franklin and other early patriots, the definition of liberty was
narrow and specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Patrick Henry said, `Give me liberty or give me
death!' &UR; '' said George Carey, professor of government at Georgetown
University, ``he meant self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Carey writes in An Uncertain Legacy, Essays on the
Pursuit of Liberty: ``The essence or core of liberty during the
founding period was felt to be the absence of arbitrary and
capricious government.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the framers of the Constitution _ whose
subjugation by the British crown made them naturally wary of
authoritarian government _ defined liberty not as what every
individual has the right to do or have, but by what the government
has no right to do to its people.
</P>
<P>
   The best evidence of their thinking is the Bill of Rights. The
U.S. Constitution's first 10 amendments are, for the most part, a
list of restrictions on government:
</P>
<P>
   Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion. It cannot abridge the freedom of speech, of the press, of
the right of people to peaceably assemble or petition the
government. It shall not infringe on the right of people to keep
and bear arms. It cannot require excessive bail, impose cruel and
unusual punishment or deprive any individual of life, liberty or
property without due process of law.
</P>
<P>
   At least one political group, the National Libertarian Party,
maintains that the founders' definition of liberty _ popular
sovereignty and freedom from government interference _ is, by all
rights, the only definition under which the nation should operate.
That it does not operate that way, they believe, has debased the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our liberties have grown so large and rapidly, it has
perverted the Constitution to the point that our Founding Fathers
wouldn't recognize it,'' said the party's press secretary, George
Getz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty is the right to be left alone. And the government
really isn't leaving anybody alone today. They are attacking our
income, the right to use your property in the way you see fit, the
right to own a gun. They are telling you who to hire, forcing you
to put money into Social Security. They tell you what size toilet
bowl you have to have in your house. It's preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most prevailing shift in the American notion of
liberty is more subtle and philosophical. Where liberty once meant
popular sovereignty, self-government and freedom from government
interference, more and more Americans in the 20th century have come
to believe it means doing whatever they please. And any
infringement on that liberty is considered a violation of one's
unalienable rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today our sense of liberty, in the most contemporary sense,
means liberation,'' said C. Bradley Thompson, a professor of
political science and history at Ohio's Ashland University and
author of John Adams &AMP; the Spirit of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``And liberty today also means liberty from all authority. It
means not only having the right to do something, but that you have
the right to do something and shouldn't be criticized for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as professor Carey of Georgetown put it: ``Many of the people
who argue for individual rights, what they're often arguing for is
entitlements.''
</P>
<P>
   The right to do, say, print or broadcast what they want. The
right to a good job, a good home, a good education and a living
wage. If one does not have these things, it is not because he has
not earned them, it is because he has somehow been denied them. And
it's up to the government to make amends. Or so the thinking goes.
</P>
<P>
   And that troubles many scholars. Because if there is one
significant threat to liberty, it is those who take their liberties
too far.
</P>
<P>
   Absolute liberty has never existed. There are laws against
libel, restrictions on religion and commerce. And even though the
First Amendment prohibits the abridgement of free speech, it is
still illegal to incite a riot, urge someone to commit a crime or
yell fire in a crowded movie theater, unless there really is a
fire. The price of living in a society is that everyone gives up
some liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it is those who refuse to exercise their liberties
responsibly who put liberty most at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a perfect analogy,'' said KU's Richard Levy, ``but
as a parent, I deal with two children who are approaching the age
of being teen-agers. I am confronted with the question of how much
liberty I give them. I think most parents agree that the more
responsibly they deal with the liberties they are given, the more
you give them. The more they abuse them, the less you want to give
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think society acts that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, as some individuals push the bounds of liberties,
others inside and outside of government feel compelled to push
back. Proposed restrictions on both words and deeds appear. What
was once a liberty becomes less of one.
</P>
<P>
   And, for better or worse, the nature of liberty changes again. &QL;

ALEX KUCHEROVSKY: `GO TO RUSSIA. YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERIC ADLER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``Do right for this country,'' said Alex
Kucherovsky, ``and this country do right for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with his own definition of liberty _ ``For me, able to
support family, pay bills, raise children'' _ he has done just
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years ago, Kucherovsky emigrated from Kiev in the
former Soviet Union with $500 in his pocket. He came to Kansas City
with his wife, Anna, and two daughters, Svetlana, 7, and Maria, 5
months. His parents and sister had arrived two years earlier. A
great-uncle and aunt came in 1920 after the Bolshevik Revolution.
He had family here but little else.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the owner of Alex's Shoe Repair in Blue Springs, Mo.,
owns a fine home in Overland Park, Kan., mortgage paid. Svetlana,
26, is applying to dental school. Maria, 18, is married and having
a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, Svetlana's fiance and Anna opened Taste of
Russia, a Russian market, bakery and catering business on 79th
Street off Metcalf Avenue. The business is growing so fast that
it's about to expand for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, America has been so good to Kucherovsky that for the
last 17 years he has observed Jan. 26 _ the day his family set foot
in Kansas City _ as a family holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we celebrate,'' he said, ``because to me this was
very big step of my life. And I know I did right decision move to
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, he said, individuals have rights _ to express themselves,
to get an education, to improve their stations and to enjoy the
fruits of their labors.
</P>
<P>
   As a Jew in the former Soviet Union, Kucherovsky often felt the
sting of discrimination. In America, he said, ``I am American.
Jewish, Christian, Muslim. Doesn't matter. This freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   He has little tolerance for those who complain about the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, `Go to Russia. You will see the difference,''
Kucherovsky said. `` `Don't forget your toilet paper, soap,
everything. 'Cause you will never have.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I am sad because I know old people come to my store,
have food stamps, and complain. They say, `You know in Russia I was
this. I did something. I was main man or woman.' I say, `Who cares
who you was? You come into the United States. America give you
room, give you food, your children do very well. Why do you
complain?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kucherovsky does not complain. He came to the United States with
nothing. He was given the freedom and liberty to make a life and
educate his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are Americans. Real Americans,'' he said. ``How people
don't like this country, I don't know.''

MEMORIES OF CAMBODIAN HORROR SHARPEN FAMILY'S APPRECIATION OF
AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At 2 a.m. one Saturday, 18-year-old Sambath
Ngek switched on the lamp in her room. Her mother, Sambo Prom, was
already awake.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later, as the city slept, the two were on the
highway driving from their bungalow to a local supermarket 20 miles
away in the suburbs. Work in the bakery begins at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Sambath would never say the hours are ideal. But she knows, from
her parents' tales of Cambodia, that ``ideal'' is relative.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast High School senior was 11 months old when her
parents arrived in Kansas City in 1981 as political refugees. By
then, the Communist Khmer Rouge had already murdered a million of
its countrymen, including Sambath's uncles and aunts.
</P>
<P>
   To her, her parents' memories of abrogated rights and government
brutality at times seem incomprehensible. ``You can't imagine it,
unless it happens to you,'' she said. But she knows the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me liberty is being able to do things without the
government telling you to do this or do that,'' she said. ``A lot
of people here think it's doing whatever you want as long as you
don't get in trouble or break the law.''
</P>
<P>
   But to her it means, at the lowest level, having the opportunity
to haul yourself out to the suburbs every Saturday and Sunday to
earn $7 an hour frosting and filling doughnuts. Her mother has done
it nearly every day for five years. Her father's first job here was
cleaning the seats at what was then called Royals Stadium. Now he
works in manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to the United States,'' her mother said. ``We happy. A
lot of food. Nobody kill.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ngeks have a house. They feel safe. Sambath has saved $4,000
in this job. She ranks fourth in her high school class. She has a
car, she has gone to the prom, and in the fall she will be a
freshman at MidAmerica Nazarene University with hopes of becoming a
stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   Sambath recognizes that the American notion of liberty has its
drawbacks, especially when people define liberty to mean the
freedom to do as you please without obligation. For her, liberty is
rooted in her obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Because she is the oldest of three children and because her
parents have difficulty with English, ``I'm like the eyes and ears
of the family,'' Sambath said.
</P>
<P>
   So it is Sambath who reads the mail and pays every bill. It's
she who balances the checkbook, talks to the gas company, phone
company, dentists, doctors. By herself, she navigated through high
school and got into college.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK. A small price, she figures, for the freedom to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   `My mom tells me stories,'' she said. ``I don't take what we
have for granted.''

FOR BOSNIAN REFUGEE FAMILY, AMERICA OFFERS THE FREEDOM TO TRY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Erna Hadzibegovic knows clearly that she owns
one Calvin Klein T-shirt, has seen ``Titanic'' three times, thinks
Leonardo DiCaprio is dreamy and hopes one day to become a
translator.
</P>
<P>
   What is less clear in the mind of the North Kansas City, Mo.,
sixth-grader is the day in 1992 when a Serbian bomb fell in
Sarajevo and blasted her Bosnian family from its home.
</P>
<P>
   She was only 4 then, and her memory of the day is hazy. And
that's fine with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Jasmin and Izeta Hadzibegovic arrived in Kansas City as
political refugees just over a year ago with their daughters, Erna,
11, and Belma, 14. Before that they spent six restless years in a
refugee camp in Germany, never quite sure whether they might return
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I call home,'' Jasmin said. But the news never
changed. No food. No energy. No jobs.
</P>
<P>
   So now they are in America, where, to Jasmin and Izeta, liberty
is about having the opportunity to work hard, raise a family, earn
a living and afford their daughters a good education and a better
future.
</P>
<P>
   Because when it comes to the lack of liberty, the children need
no lessons. Every school day, the children in their
English-as-a-second-language class offer living reminders. There's
13-year-old Neghar Mamaamin of Kurdistan, who shyly shows the
bullet scar in her left elbow, a remnant from when Iraqi soldiers
stormed her home. Classmate Jasmina Tahirovic of Bosnia tells how a
bomb exploded outside her home and forced her family to flee into
the woods.
</P>
<P>
   So if Erna doesn't quite remember that April afternoon when the
bomb burst, that's all the better.
</P>
<P>
   Izeta, who had bought into a clothing design business before
fleeing Sarajevo, works six days a week cleaning rooms and making
beds at the downtown Doubletree Hotel. Jasmin, who did home repair,
has a night job at a company that stitches logos onto baseball
caps.
</P>
<P>
   As Izeta works, Jasmin sleeps. When he is at work, the family is
in bed. They see one another only hours a day. But it doesn't
matter.
</P>
<P>
   They have a car and an apartment, and they are saving for a home
``with a flower garden,'' Izeta said. ``Good for the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, too, Belma graduates from eighth grade. To Jasmin and
Izeta, that is something to celebrate and what liberty is about _
the freedom to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work hard and do our best,'' Belma said.
</P>
<P>
   Erna said, ``I like it how here I could be what I want to be.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ You ask about freedom? Human liberty?
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two-year-old Prince-Will Neebani of Nigeria yanked off
his sneakers and pulled his jacket off his naked shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning I get 50 strikes with cable,'' he said, pointing
to the scars on his feet, shoulders, back and chest.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months he was imprisoned with no trial, chained at the
wrists and feet for being a youth organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Prince-Will's mother, Salome, is 47. Her mood is heavy, her face
tired. The Nigerian government tortured her in prison. They killed
thousands, she said, including her husband, shot as a protester.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, for that, for speaking out and demanding compensation from
the Nigerian government for the environmental destruction of the
Ogoni people's once-fertile tribal land.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when Ogoniland, along Nigeria's coast, was a rich place
for fishing and growing yams. Then, 40 years ago, oil and natural
gas were found. Leaking oil and gas lines poisoned the land.
Government officials grew rich while the people stayed poor.
</P>
<P>
   So the people of Ogoniland spoke out.
</P>
<P>
   Told to stop protesting or die, Prince-Will and Salome _
pregnant with her seventh child _ escaped to a refugee camp in the
republic of Benin along with two of her children, Rosebella and
Kenneth. Her three adult daughters remained in Nigeria. She does
not know whether they are alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were eight. We are five here now,'' said Salome, who in the
refugee camp gave birth to a boy, Precious, his name reflecting
their freedom and his survival.
</P>
<P>
   The Don Bosco Center relocated the Neebanis to Kansas City nine
months ago. Since then they have seen President Clinton sued,
impeached and his sex life dissected. They think it is wondrous _
not out of enmity, but because it speaks of a country whose
government and leaders are accountable to its people and laws.
</P>
<P>
   Prince-Will, who worked stocking food at a restaurant, is about
to begin a $9-an-hour job in Lenexa. Salome, a former nurse's aide,
is looking for work as she cares for Precious, now 3. Kenneth, 15,
attends Westport High School and stocks groceries at an Apple
Market. Rosebella, 14, is in the seventh grade at Northeast Middle
School.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years she spent at the refugee camp in Benin,
Rosebella dreamed of something better.
</P>
<P>
   When the family fled Nigeria, Rosebella took one item with her:
a book, a thin paperback novel that she has read more than 30
times.
</P>
<P>
   The book, its pages yellow, its cover falling off, is now with
her in America _ a small reminder that something better is at hand.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ The seven stakes races composing
tomorrow's inaugural Lone Star Million Day took shape with
yesterday's post-position draws.
</P>
<P>
   Littlebitlively got the No. 1 post in the $300,000 Lone Star
Park Handicap, the most lucrative of the big events. The two-time
Texas Mile winner returned Friday on a full flight from Kentucky
and is the early 2-1 favorite in the 11/16-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   Also entered are Allen's Oop (3-1), Truluck (7-2), Mocha Express
(9-2), Burbank (6-1), Nite Dreamer (8-1) and Houston Slue (15-1).
</P>
<P>
   Mocha Express was last year's horse of the meeting at Lone Star
Park, and Burbank is a former grass champion at the local track.
Allen's Oop will be ridden by Maryland-based Edgar Prado, the
leading U.S. rider in races won this year.
</P>
<P>
   Littlebitlively has won $766,040 in his career, but the leading
money-winner tomorrow is Stop Traffic, a $788,018 earner and the
5-2 favorite in the $100,000 Wild Flower Stakes at six furlongs for
fillies and mares.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three grass races _ the $250,000 USA Stakes,
$150,000 Prestonwood Distaff and $100,000 Lone Star Park Turf
Sprint _ has a capacity 12-horse field with a mix of popular local
runners and talented invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The seven races total $1 million in purses, and attracted horses
that arrived on flights from Kentucky, California and New York.
Lone Star Park is offering a Pick-7 wager (minimum bet $1) on the
Million Day features, which will be carded as races four through 10
on the 11-race program. \Nsubheds:Microsoft party Lone Star Park
took group sales to new heights Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The racetrack was host to the annual Microsoft Corp. convention,
with 7,000 employees arriving from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Guests at the private party _ which occupied the west end of the
track property, including the Post Time Pavilion _ were entertained
by more than just horse races. Performing live at the function were
country-music stars Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft founder Bill Gates was not in attendance.

LUYENDYK: EXIT OF A HUMBLE CHAMPION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ His sobriquet is ``The Flying Dutchman,'' a neat
fit for the man who owns the most coveted speed entries in the
Indianapolis 500 record book.
</P>
<P>
   Arie Luyendyk's 15-year tour around the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway has taken him from rookie of the year to two-time champion
to three-time pole-winner to elder statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Luyendyk races into retirement, fittingly enough, from
the pole position of the 83rd Indianapolis 500. ``Arie's Final
500'' could end with one last left turn into Victory Lane. Whether
or not it does, Luyendyk plans to exit the Speedway with the same
humility he first brought to the corners of 16th Street and
Georgetown Road 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here the first time as a spectator, it almost
scared me what I saw,'' said Luyendyk, a long-haired road racer
from Holland in search of an Indy-car ride in 1984. ``I saw the
cars going into Turn 1, flat-out, and I'm thinking, `Man, I've got
to do this next year?' I felt so little and so small when I walked
into this place, and to become a part of Indianapolis history is
pretty neat for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In qualifying or during the race, no driver in Indy 500 history
has hustled a car around The Brickyard any faster than Arie. At 45,
Luyendyk's name stands next to these IMS track records:
</P>
<P>
   One-lap qualifying mark, 237.498 mph, set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Four-lap qualifying mark, 236.986 mph, also set in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   500-mile average speed mark, 185.981 mph, set in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   All-time prize-money mark, $5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arie has a natural talent for speed,'' said Eddie Cheever Jr.,
defending champion of the Indy 500 but a rookie here when Luyendyk
won for the first time in 1990. ``Sometimes when you look at a
driver, you can see the speed on their face. With Arie, you look at
him, and he's just smiling away. He's so comfortable. Almost
laughing at us all. He is very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk outran 1986 Indy 500 champion Bobby Rahal to the
checkered flag in 1990, the capper to a workmanlike month of May.
Sort of like this month of May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being successful here has made my name in American racing,
especially when I won it the first time,'' said Luyendyk, who had
made his Indy-car debut in a Championship Auto Racing Teams event
at Elkhart Lake, Wis., in August 1984. ``And then I had to come
back here and prove that wasn't just a one-time \Rdeal\S. I think
we've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing under the banner of the Pep Boys Indy Racing League in
1997, Luyendyk won at IMS again over Treadway Racing teammate Scott
Goodyear by 0.57 seconds. Luyendyk became only the second foreign
driver to win two Indy 500s, and established himself as the
fledgling IRL's marquee personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is one of the true celebrities here. A Hollywood
celebrity,'' Goodyear said. ``Competing here, he's brought a lot of
fan interest. I think he's one of the reasons I understand the
Speedway.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Lazier, the 1996 Indy 500 champion, said Luyendyk always
has shared his time and knowledge with rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very humble fellow,'' Lazier said, ``but he has a
tremendous temper on the racetrack. I remember when he flipped-off
a driver, knocked his headrest off and the whole field went yellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll miss him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Reigning IRL champion Kenny Brack said Luyendyk qualifies as an
Indy 500 legend _ a tag Arie said ``is really not necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's an honor when people bring up great achievements
at the Speedway, that my name is in that list,'' said Luyendyk, who
qualified his No. 5 Sprint PCS/Meijer G Force-Aurora at 225.179
mph. That is, fittingly enough, the four-lap track record for
normally aspirated IRL V-8 engines.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk announced last November that, for a variety of reasons,
this would be his final Indy 500. And his final Indy-car race. The
decision came with the blessing of his wife, Mieke, who after today
will only have to concern herself with the racing career of the
couple's 17-year-old son, Arie Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I can't wait until the end of the month,'' Mieke
Luyendyk said. ``I always liked the racing scene. I just didn't
like to worry. And I don't want to worry anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk has been involved in four crashes over the past two
years in the all-oval IRL series. But his decision to step away
actually was accelerated in May 1996, when friend Scott Brayton was
killed in a crash while practicing for the race. Brayton, who had
qualified on the pole, was working on a setup for a race-day he
never saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know racing is a dangerous sport. But Scott's crash
really hit us hard,'' Luyendyk said. ``To me, the risks now vs. the
rewards don't pay off at this stage of my career. I'm still
competitive when I get in the car and I'll probably be competitive
in the next couple of years. But I don't want to wait for the signs
_ your timing is off, your reflexes are off _ I don't want to
discover that while I'm in the race car. And I also don't want to
wake up in the hospital anymore, wondering where the hell I am.''
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Scottsdale, Ariz., Luyendyk is planning to spend
more time with Mieke and their four children _ ideally on their
boat. While this will be his final open-wheel race, Luyendyk plans
to compete in the classic 24-Hour endurance sports car events at
Daytona Beach, Fla., and LeMans, France. He is booked to attend IRL
races as a consultant to team owner Fred Treadway and his
replacement driver, Sam Schmidt. Luyendyk has a personal services
contract as spokesman for Sprint PCS, and a TV career beckons as
analyst for IRL telecasts on the Fox Sports Network.
</P>
<P>
   He will exit with all those Indy 500 records, and a total of 167
Indy-car starts _ including 131 in the CART FedEx Championship
Series, 11 in the U.S. Auto Club and 25 in Tony George's IRL.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk's seven career victories include a memorable night, and
morning-after, at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth. Moments after
Billy Boat won the inaugural and scoring problem-plagued True Value
500K night race in June 1997, Luyendyk headed for Victory Lane to
question the lap-counting and his result. A.J. Foyt _ Boat's car
owner, Indy-car icon and full-blooded Texan _ promptly slapped the
intruding Luyendyk and shoved him to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler heads prevailed, and after Treadway filed an official
protest, an overnight audit by red-faced USAC officials discovered
that Luyendyk incorrectly had been docked two laps. Luyendyk was
declared the race-winner, wherever he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``That incident made me more famous than winning the Indy 500,''
said Luyendyk, who patched it up with Foyt last year. ``It's funny,
he still doesn't know how to say my first name properly. He has
such a heavy accent I have a hard time communicating with him. I
almost need a translator _ and I'm the foreigner here.''
</P>
<P>
   But not at Indy. For ``The Flying Dutchman,'' the Speedway is a
neat fit.

 &HT;    CIVIL WAR LETTERS HONOR A SOLDIER ON MEMORIAL DAY
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By William G. Schmidt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I hasten to pen you a few lines to inform you that I am well
or as well as might be expected. . . . I will go back and tell you
some of the trip down to this place. We went rapidly down to
Cincinnati, arrived at Cincinnati between 8 and 10 o'clock, marched
to the river and went over to Covington. Slept in the freight
car.'' David F. Rohrer, Aug. 25, 1862.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Fogle of New Lebanon held the old cigar box that had been
in the attic of her husband's mother, Lulu Shollenberger, for many
years. When she died in 1981, her belongings were divided among the
family.
</P>
<P>
   Fogle's husband, Richard, eyed the wooden box at the time.
``What a neat cigar box,'' Joyce remembers him saying. But she
wanted what was inside. She remembered her mother-in-law once
saying the family had old letters, still affixed with sealing wax.
</P>
<P>
   When Joyce pulled out the bundles of letters, some from as early
as 1840, the life of her husband's early relative, Simon Rohrer,
poured out onto her lap.
</P>
<P>
   She pulled out the brittle paper, and the lifetime of family
unfolded. They were mostly mundane, letters from relatives still
living in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she found David's letters.
</P>
<P>
   On July 21, 1862, David, the son of Simon Rohrer, went to
Dayton, along with many other local youths, and joined Co. I of the
93rd Ohio Volunteers to do his part for the Civil War. On Aug. 20,
he left the family farm, the brick house, which still stands on
U.S. 35 just west of New Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   He would not return.
</P>
<P>
   Using the cigar box of letters, Joyce began a several-years-long
quest for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were aroused out of our sleep by the report of firearms.
The regiment was called into ranks and some of the men loaded their
guns and everything looked like a fight but in a short time we were
commanded to lie down again.'' DFR Aug. 25, 1862.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce had already followed her own family history. With the
discovery of the letters, she had a chance of uncovering some of
her husband's family history.
</P>
<P>
   Richard was a New Lebanon boy, actually from west of New
Lebanon, along U.S. 35, in Johnsville. It was there, too, that
David lived with his father, Simon, mother, Harriet, a brother,
Joseph, and two sisters. Another brother, Frederick, came later.
</P>
<P>
   The cigar box yielded property taxes from Jackson Twp. in the
1840s, each hand-written and signed. But more importantly there was
an envelope marked simply, ``David F. Rohrer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know you had an uncle in the Civil War?'' Richard was
often asked. He wasn't interested. ``Why do you want to dig this
up?'' he asked Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your history,'' she told him. ``Stood in the streets
about half an hour and marched about two miles. Laid in the wet
grass. Monday morning came finding us about half dead . . . and lay
down a short distance from our camp. I fell out and laid down, the
sun was so hot that I could scarcely bear it. My lips are sore. My
nose too.'' DFR Sep. 6, 1862 . ``He thinks I'm strange going to
cemeteries,'' Joyce said.
</P>
<P>
   At Farmersville's old United Brethren Church cemetery, she
quickly found David's grave. The old weathered tombstone is near
Center Street, but a few steps from the road. It is tall and
stately and the letters have begun to fade.
</P>
<P>
   The stone is rough to the touch. The years, it seems, were no
more rough than the life of these Rohrer boys. Joseph, when he was
young, fell out of tree and caught his leg. He was lame for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``State of Ohio, Montgomery County, Jackson Township
</P>
<P>
   Be it remembered that we the undersigned this day exempt Joseph
J. Rohrer from the performance of military duty under the militia
law passed April 14, 1863. His complaint being laziness of the left
leg. J.F. Thompson John Fuls Trustees Jackson Township July 11,
1863'' . When Joyce opened the packet of seven letters, almost a
century and a half later, David again had a voice. She had found
the grave, but more importantly she had found the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am getting very impatient because I don't hear from you. We
have not heard from home since we left Dayton. There's no place
like home. We have been rushed through so fast that we are half
sick. I feel so indisposed, so mean that I cannot bring my thoughts
upon any subject.'' DFR Sep. 10, 1862.
</P>
<P>
   David's letters are sprinkled with references to friends, even a
neighbor boy, David Toby, who was with David in the 93rd O.V.I.
</P>
<P>
   He asks how the garden is growing, about a send-off party for
other boys, and complains about his food. He talks about eating a
breakfast of coffee, hard crackers, boiled salted pork. He tells of
guard duty, of marches, of rebel assaults.
</P>
<P>
   When his camp is burned by rebels, he asks that the young girl
living next door be told that ``the nice notion book was burned
with the pocket handkerchief that mother gave me.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion book was a going-away gift.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a final letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun is just rising and I want to write a few lines to let
you know that I am well . . . the air is chilly. I received the
package of medicine on the 18th. The express wagon brought it to
camp. . . I will have to stop writing and see to things.'' DFR Sep.
20, 1862.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining about ``the flux,'' he asked for two types of
medicines. Joyce wondered what happened. The tombstone records his
date of death as Nov. 21, 1862, adding simply, ``died in hospital
in Nashville, TN.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce has binders full of notes, collected over the years. One
reads, ``died of wounds.'' It came from a grave registration card
at the Montgomery County Administration Building. But the roster of
Ohio Soldiers, compiled in the late 1800s, says only that David
``died Nov. 21, 1862, at Nashville, Tenn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rohrer family letters added another tantalizing question. On
Dec. 6, 1862, Simon Rohrer writing from Bowling Green, Ky. to his
wife, reports, ``I have seen a good deal of the effects of the war,
not as much though as I had expected.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, he adds, ``I don't know where I will find our Dave.
They have been shifting some of the Nashville sick. It may be Dave
is one of them. I will find out tomorrow or Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   The heartbreak, looking upon this story pulled from the cigar
box, is that David has been dead fifteen days. The cigar box also
contains camp passes given to Simon on his journey.
</P>
<P>
   It is thought that Simon brought the body home. At the time, the
Rohrer's next door neighbor was Henry Toby, father of campmate
David, and pastor of the same church where David was buried. David
Toby is listed on the 1880 census, having returned safely from the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The cigar box yielded another piece of paper, dated July 27,
1863, and boldly written in pen. ``Received of Simon Rohrer
thirty-five dollars amt. in full for a set of gravestones for
son.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this sandy white stone that marks David's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the National Archives finally filled in the
missing pieces of David's last days for Joyce. Copies of the old
documents arrived, bearing official military scroll. A Lt. Kline
notes the cause of death: celebritis. Inflammation of the brain.
Yet other papers say ``disease'' and one states, ``left sick in
Nashville, Nov. 14, 1862.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is a Record of Death and Interment. It says, ``brought
to hospital insane. Nothing more could be learned.''
</P>
<P>
   It lists a plot at the Nashville City Cemetery where the body
was buried. Records at the Tennessee State Archives agree but also
show hospital reports of David noting he was ``sent home.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon Rohrer returned to the farm with his son's body and spent
the rest of his life in Johnsville.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Joyce has the Rohrer's family clock in her living room.
The dark wood case, with a class door painted with pink roses,
still works. But Joyce has lost the key.
</P>
<P>
   David must have stood before it and watched it tick. He must
have watched time fall away, a tick at a time before he went off to
battle.
</P>
<P>
   After the Civil War ended, the final Rohrer son was born just as
troops returned along the dirt road. A family story says that
David's sister, Elizabeth, was sent across the road to get her
grandmother for the impending birth.
</P>
<P>
   But the convoy was long and she could not get across the road.
``It came for hours,'' said Joyce. ``I can just see mules and
wagons coming down the road while Frederick is being born.''
</P>
<P>
   Frederick was the final brother, the final member of the family
to die. He never married, and lived in the ``Rohrer House'' until
his death in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce looks upon Memorial Day as a time to honor David Rohrer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (the Civil War) was even more horrible because we were
fighting against ourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She is left with a poem on the outside of one of David's
letters:
</P>
<P>
   The Soldier's Dream of Home At the dead of night, a sweet vision
I saw, And thrice e'er the morning I dreamt it again But sorrow
returned with the dawning of morning And the voice in my dreaming
'ear melted away ``Write soon and tell me everything that happens
about Johnsville.'' DFR Sep. 18, 1862

NO HALT TO KASHMIR STRIKES, EVEN FOR TALKS, INDIA LEADER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING for all needing; story is only one take)  (kd) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said
Saturday that India would continue air strikes against what he
described as Pakistani-backed infiltrators dug into Indian
territory, and would only be willing to hold talks with Pakistan
about the conflict if they were not conditional on a halt to the
air raids.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's remarks came in response to a telephone call on
Friday from Pakistan's prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who offered to
send Pakistan's foreign minister to New Delhi to meet with his
Indian counterpart. Sharif said India and Pakistan, as the world's
newest nuclear powers, should try to resolve their dispute over
Kashmir, where India is now battling the infiltrators, through
diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, however, whether Sharif had made such talks
conditional on the suspension of air strikes. Pakistan's minister
of information, Mushahid Hussain, said Saturday in Islamabad that
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz would be going to New Delhi next week
for talks.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in Karachi on Friday, Sharif said he had warned
Vajpayee that if any more Indian fighter jets ventured into
Pakistan-held Kashmir, they would be shot down, just like two
Indian jets that Pakistan says t downed on Thursday. Sharif said
he had told Vajpayee, ``Come and sit around the table to resolve
the Kashmir issue.''
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have been squabbling over Kashmir since they
were carved from British India in 1947. India claims Kashmir as one
of its states, while Pakistan maintains that the Kashmiris should
be allowed to choose whether to join India or Pakistan through a
plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest permutation of an old feud, India has asserted
that in early May, Pakistan sent almost 700 infiltrators, including
Pakistani soldiers and Afghan mercenaries, across the boundary that
separates Indian- and Pakistan-held portions of Kashmir to seize
control of a swath of Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee spelled out India's position during a meeting Saturday
morning with leaders of the major political parties. Afterward, the
government's parliamentary affairs minister, P.R. Kumaramangalam,
told reporters that the prime minister had explained to Sharif that
the air raids would continue until the guerrillas were driven out
of India.
</P>
<P>
   India cannot be expected to stop air raids on intruders in its
own country, Indian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth day Saturday, India pounded the icy hideouts of
the guerrillas with air strikes in an attempt to drive them back
into Pakistan, kill them or force them to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. J.J. Singh, an Indian Army spokesman, said India had
found incontrovertible proof that Pakistani soldiers were among the
``intruders'' trying to hold a chunk of Indian territory.
Originally the disputed area was about 90 miles long and 4 to 5
miles wide, but it has shrunk considerably under the Indian air and
ground assault.
</P>
<P>
   He said the proof, found by Indian troops on Friday, is a
Pakistan army identity card for Sepoy Abdul Ayub, a soldier in the
4th Northern Light Infantry, that was tucked into a rucksack
abandoned at a site of fighting in Indian-held Kashmir. The army
will soon display this document for the press, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials could not be reached for comment Saturday,
but they have denied involvement with the guerrillas, whom they
describe as indigenous Kashmiri freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
   The tally of Indian dead rose to 29 Saturday. On Friday Pakistan
returned the body of a pilot who died after ejecting from his jet
in Pakistan-held Kashmir. Indian officials said Saturday that it
appeared the pilot had bullet wounds and might have been killed
after he parachuted to the ground. A full autopsy will be
performed.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials said that one of their pilots inadvertently
strayed over the cease-fire line Thursday after he developed engine
trouble, and that a second jet was shot down when its pilot tried
to see where his compatriot had landed. Pakistan has said it shot
the jets down in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   General Singh also said that Pakistan had increased its troop
and arms strength all along the cease-fire line with India. ``These
are probably precautionary, defensive measures,'' he said.

BOSTON GANG LEADER CONVICTED IN SLAYING OF PROSECUTOR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Gang leader Jeffrey L. Bly Saturday was convicted of
first-degree murder for the 1995 killing of Assistant Attorney
General Paul R. McLaughlin, who made bitter legal history when he
became the first state prosecutor murdered while doing his job.
</P>
<P>
   A racially mixed jury delivered its verdict in a Suffolk
Superior courtroom crowded with McLaughlin's father, siblings,
fellow prosecutors, Special Assistant Suffolk District Attorney
Thomas Brennan, and a team of Boston and State police officers who
pieced together the case against Bly.
</P>
<P>
   Suppressed cheers echoed softly through the chandeliered
courtroom as the verdict was announced. Tears of relief ran down
the faces of many of McLaughlin's friends as nearly four years of
waiting for justice for a friend finally ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won his last case,'' McLaughlin's older brother, Rick, said
after the verdict. ``He died doing it, but he won it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk Superior Court Judge James D. McDaniel Jr. sentenced Bly
to the mandatory life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   Bly tried to leave as McLaughlin's father, Edward F. McLaughlin
Jr., prepared to give a victim impact statement, but was ordered to
stay by Judge McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hurt and damned angry. My natural instinct is to lash
out,'' Edward McLaughlin said as Bly fidgeted in his seat, hands
cuffed behind his back. ``But I won't do anything to denigrate
Paul's memory. I can only hope and pray that he has now found peace
with God, to whom I think his dedicated work . . . has so richly
entitled him.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict ended an extraordinary chapter in state law
enforcement history in which the pursuer became the prey, the
dogged prosecutor targeted for assassination by the ruthless gang
member who broke the unwritten rules of law enforcement officers
and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   While police routinely face the possibility of dying on the job,
prosecutors were considered insulated from the fury of the street
by the passion-draining rituals of the courtroom, where personal
contact between prosecutor and defendant rarely occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that happens in Mexico or Colombia,'' said
Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II, for whom McLaughlin
was working gang cases when he was killed. ``Not in America, much
less Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was one of McLaughlin's many friends who had been drawn
to the 42-year-old by his passion for politics, his desire to help
tougher Boston neighborhoods rid themselves of crime, and by a
sense of decency that often saw McLaughlin search out an
alternative to prison for defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The elder McLaughlin noted that a scholarship has been set up at
Suffolk University Law School in his son's name, and that an
addition to the Daniel Marr Boys and Girls Club in Dorchester has
been named for him. A tree has been planted outside the West
Roxbury Library in his son's memory as well.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said he last saw his son in August 1995, about a
month before the murder. He gently urged McLaughlin to consider
getting a more lucrative job in private practice. ``Not yet, Dad,''
the father quoted the son as saying. ``I still think I can make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly, a friend and co-worker of
Paul McLaughlin's for 15 years, was asked after the verdict if he
wished the death penalty was available for Bly. He waved away the
question and said only, ``I want Paul back.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan C. Stanley, Bly's lead attorney, said in court that the
murder was a ``terrible tragedy'' for both the McLaughlin and Bly
families. Bly's mother, whom Bly appeared to ignore even though she
faithfully attended each day of the monthlong trial, left after the
verdict was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant attorney general and Dartmouth College graduate
was shot about 7 p.m. on Sept. 25, 1995 _ the night before he was
to prosecute Bly a third time, a pursuit that his superiors later
thought was a mistake because two earlier trials had ended in
acquittals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not my DA no more,'' a prosecution witness quoted Bly as
saying the night McLaughlin was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, Bly plotted and carried out the
audacious killing with the same cold-eyed ferocity he displayed as
he rose to the top of the Theodore Street Posse, a loosely
organized drug-dealing street gang whose home turf was a few
hundred yards from the Morton Street police station in Mattapan.
</P>
<P>
   One week before Bly's third trial _ for armed robbery and
carjacking _ he was searching for a way to get at Dana Alston, a
carjacking victim who had already survived a murder attempt by a
Bly associate.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, Bly could not find Alston and decided
that killing McLaughlin would buy him more time to take care of
Alston.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before the murder, Bly sent 16-year-old fellow gang
member Anthony Houston to tail McLaughlin as he left the Suffolk
district attorney's office in downtown Boston for his home in West
Roxbury. With $5 in train fare, a notebook, and a pen, Houston
shadowed McLaughlin as he rode the commuter rail to the Highland
station in West Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, Houston followed McLaughlin to the parking lot,
where he saw him get into his rust-colored 1982 Toyota. They
exchanged nods, Houston recorded the prosecutor's license plate,
and reported back to Bly.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the murder, Bly and his associates, including
Ricardo Gittens, gathered at a second-floor apartment on Theodore
Street. Bly, according to prosecution witness Sandra Brown, told
his allies that McLaughlin had to die that night.
</P>
<P>
   Bly was driven to West Roxbury by Gittens, accompanied by a
younger gang member who was later told by Bly to leave. They
stopped in a bowling alley parking lot across from the station and
spotted McLaughlin's car parked on Railroad Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Gittens and Bly mapped out an escape route and drove over to
Clement Avenue, which parallels the railroad tracks. Gittens parked
at a bend of the street, while Bly returned to Railroad Avenue, hid
in the bushes, and was ready when McLaughlin got off the train
shortly before 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed as a combination Wild West outlaw/modern urban assassin,
with a bandana covering the lower half of his face, a knit wool cap
on his head, brown cotton gloves on his hands, and an oversized
black hooded sweatshirt drawn over his face, Bly called out to
McLaughlin as he got into his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted Paul McLaughlin to know who shot him,'' Brennan told
the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Bly then pounced on the prosecutor, pinned him against the car
door, and fired one .38 caliber bullet into the prosecutor's left
temple. McLaughlin, his left eye shattered by the bullet, collapsed
into his car. Bly leaned in and fired again.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the noise, another commuter shouted and Bly ran down
the tracks. About 150 yards from the station, he shed the clothing
that he believed would conceal his identity, but which actually
ended up tagging him as the murderer.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin's blood was found on the outside of the discarded
clothing and a tiny piece of human tissue inside the ring finger of
the left glove was linked to Bly through DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   After the murder, Bly raced into a nearby backyard, tossed the
gun under a camping trailer, and rode off in Gittens' car.
</P>
<P>
   The massive investigation that began that night spent a year
focusing on a Jamaica Plain gang member, Jesus Carrasquillo, before
DNA testing excluded him but not Bly.
</P>
<P>
   With relentless pressure from the Boston and State police
detectives on the McLaughlin ``team,'' Bly's onetime allies began
to implicate him in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   And Bly himself aided detectives when Murray and Sergeant
Detective William Mahoney visited him in prison in 1996. They let
him smoke cigarettes, which were used to confirm DNA tests.
</P>
<P>
   Bly was finally indicted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He had been imprisoned since late 1995, after a colleague of
McLaughlin's, Michael Pomarole, took over the carjacking case
following his murder and won a conviction with the help of Alston's
testimony. Bly was sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Judge McDaniel ordered Bly's life sentence to begin
only after he has completed his current term. The Supreme Judicial
Court will automatically review the case.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Police Lieutenant Detective Stephen Murphy, one of the
investigators, said there was special significance that the verdict
came on the weekend when Americans honor fallen servicemen and
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a war,'' Murphy said of McLaughlin. ``He was in a
war on drugs. He was in a war against crime. And he paid for his
service with his life.''

LAKERS NEED TO WORK ON ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Remember how seamlessly the great Lakers teams of
the '80s seemed to know and relish their roles?
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson ran the offense. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the No. 1
scoring option. James Worthy ran the break. Michael Cooper played
defense. None of these guys were exactly saints, but they knew how
to play as a team.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the Lakers have imploded precisely because no
one seems to understand what their role is. Actually, the problem
is that today's Lakers all believe they have the same role.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal thinks it is his team.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant thinks it is his team.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, for some reason, thinks it should be his team.
</P>
<P>
   And they all believe it without offering one iota of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   These stars might be able to operate in the same biosphere if
they had a forceful, experienced leader to meld the egos. Instead,
Kurt Rambis tried to juggle all of these personalities while still
learning how to be a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, and it's another dreadful postseason exit for the
Lakers, with little reason to believe that next season will be much
different.
</P>
<P>
   The O'Neal-Bryant feud seems to be simmering during the best
times, and boiling when things go bad. They're both terrific
players, but too stubborn to figure out a way to get the Lakers to
the finals. O'Neal continues to be viewed as a joke because of his
atrocious free-throw shooting, while Bryant turns into a black hole
in the playoffs, incapable of passing the ball, especially to
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   And if that weren't enough, there's Rice, who seems happier
being a mad-gunner for mediocre teams rather than sacrifice a few
points in the name of a championship.
</P>
<P>
   If Rice returns next season, he'll probably be complaining on a
daily basis about not being featured enough in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Jerry Buss' meddling and Jerry West's commitment
issues, and the Lakers have little leadership on any level.
</P>
<P>
   Where does this leave them with Rambis?
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's just a taller version of Del Harris, with a lot
more to learn in the X's and O's department. He didn't understand
the rules when you foul in the final two minutes away from the
basket during an embarrassing loss to Golden State at the Forum in
April, and didn't use a foul the Lakers had to give in Game 2
against the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   More troublesome, there were rumors he had a falling out with
Derek Harper, one of the few Lakers willing to offer some
leadership skills.
</P>
<P>
   The only real answer to what the team misses is Johnson, who
could fill the void at point guard, and knock some heads in the
locker room. But his playing days are over.
</P>
<P>
   Magic still might be the answer if he became the Lakers head
coach. But his ill-fated attempts to coach in 1994 and play in 1996
demonstrated that he's no Larry Bird when it comes to relating to
``today's players.'' Both times, Johnson got out because he
couldn't understand the selfish attitude so pervasive in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The options are limited, leaving the Lakers destined to flail
for another season unless some massive personality adjustments take
place.
</P>
<P>
   Reality Checketts: Knicks president Dave Checketts is such a
devout Mormon that he did not attend last Sunday's Game 3 between
New York and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop him from lying on such an important day.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts said around tipoff Sunday that he had never contacted
Phil Jackson about the Knicks coaching job. An hour later,
Checketts admitted he had ``reached out through an intermediary''
to Jackson. A couple hours after that, Checketts admitted he had
actually met with Jackson for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Then he said he had also talked to reps for Doc Rivers and Dave
Cowens about the job.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, last we checked, Jeff Van Gundy is still the Knicks
coach, at least through the end of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Here they come: The Clippers wasted no time scouting players for
their first-round pick, which is fourth overall.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Trajan Langdon and William Avery worked out at the Sports
Arena this week. UCLA point guard Baron Davis and Arizona's Jason
Terry are expected to work out for the Clippers this week.
</P>
<P>
   Around the league: With Orlando needing a coach, the early
favorites to replace Chuck Daly are Phoenix assistant Scott Skiles,
a former Magic player, and Doc Rivers, currently a TV analyst. Also
getting some interest is former Charlotte coach Dave Cowens.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, which finished fifth in the draft lottery, is actively
listening to trade offers for two reasons. The draft is weaker than
usual this year and the Raptors have the option to claim
Minnesota's pick at No. 14 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Minnesota, which has the sixth pick, is trying to
figure out how to move up and grab either Davis or Maryland's Steve
Francis. If they can grab one of the rookies, they will sign and
trade veteran point guard Terrell Brandon. &QL;

 &HT;    Atlanta Olympics Chief Billy Payne profited from land deals near
horse park
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Billy Payne's career path diverged dramatically one
Monday morning in February 1987, about the time Alton Housworth
drove into the city from nearby Conyers for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Housworth apologized for missing the dedication of the sanctuary
at St. Luke's Presbyterian Church in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb,
the day before. The ceremony was gratifying and inspirational for
Payne, a real estate lawyer who had been the moving force behind
fund-raising for the new building.
</P>
<P>
   Housworth, a real estate broker, came to chat about the land
deals he was putting together for Payne near Atlanta in Rockdale
County.
</P>
<P>
   But Payne wanted to talk about his epiphany. The dedication
ceremony was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to him.
``Alton, I've got to find another challenge,'' he told his friend.
``I stayed awake all night trying to come up with something that
would benefit the community and the state. I've got an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, was bringing the 1996 Summer Olympics to
Atlanta. Payne asked Housworth what he thought. ``Hey, I don't know
nothing about the Olympics,'' he responded. But he figured if
anybody could take such a fanciful scheme and convert it into
reality, his friend Billy could.
</P>
<P>
   Payne saw possibilities where others didn't, whether they were
in delivering the Olympics to his hometown or in risky land
speculation in rural Rockdale, where he and his partners had just
purchased hundreds of acres of undeveloped farmland and forest.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone knows the legend of Payne, the intrepid volunteer
who gave up everything to win the Games for his city. Few are aware
that Payne never really gave up his real estate pursuits _ even
borrowing money against his land while chasing his Olympic dream,
patiently waiting for the day it would be worth something big.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer still are aware that his two pursuits collided in 1991,
when the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games decided to move
its equestrian venue from Stone Mountain Park to a 1,100-acre site
in sleepy Conyers, the county seat of Rockdale _ minutes from the
tracts of property Payne held an interest in _ despite formidable
competition from other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of visitors ventured to Conyers for the Games.
Commercial development fired up. And now, while the city negotiates
to unload its Olympic landmark, the czar of Atlanta's Games is
cashing out of the area, his land deals bringing him and his
partnership more than a $1 million profit.
</P>
<P>
   In both dreams, the possibilities played out just as Payne
predicted. But did his private interests in Rockdale bump up
against the state's interests in putting on the best Olympics
possible?
</P>
<P>
   Payne would not comment for this article. His chief lieutenant,
A.D. Frazier Jr., says he was aware of Payne's property holdings
and he, not Payne, selected the equestrian venue.
</P>
<P>
   But others believe that had Payne been an elected official, more
scrutiny would have been applied. ``I think, rightly or wrongly,
ACOG officials _ and, in this case, Billy _ were given the benefit
of the doubt, which was characteristic of the time,'' says Michael
Lomax, former Fulton County Commission chairman and member of the
Metropolitan Atlanta Olympic Games Authority, the state oversight
authority set up to protect taxpayers' interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not get the level of consideration that it would have
had it been an elected official owning property near a site that
was about to be significantly increased in value as a result of a
decision he would make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockdale deals
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale, about 25 miles due east of downtown Atlanta, is the
second-smallest county in the state. It had yet to be swallowed up
by the suburban development wave when Billy Payne discovered its
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, who specialized in risky land speculation, had done quite
well in Gwinnett County, when the new Gwinnett Place mall turned
rural pastures into small fortunes for speculators who had bought
the acreage years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1986, Payne was looking for the next diamond in
the rough. He responded to a classified ad placed by Alton
Housworth in the Atlanta newspapers. Housworth was selling some
property on Big Haynes Creek in north Rockdale. Payne was looking
for some land where he and his son could fish and shoot skeet.
After riding the property, Payne told Housworth it wasn't quite
right.
</P>
<P>
   But Housworth, who knew the county and its biggest landowners
like the back of his hand, had turned Payne on to Rockdale's
upside. For one thing, talk had swirled for a few years about the
Turner Hill Mall going up a couple of exits toward Atlanta on I-20.
It could be another Gwinnett Place explosion in the making.
</P>
<P>
   That very afternoon, Housworth showed Payne a 56-acre tract at
the northeast corner of the interchange at I-20 and Ga. 138.
Fronting on the expressway, it would be a good location for one of
the so-called ``power centers'' eating up the suburbs once the
development boom hit Rockdale. Payne put a contract on it for $1.5
million. Then he turned to a longtime client, Ellis Godshall, who
had grown wealthy in the convenience store business, to become his
limited partner and put up all the necessary cash.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale ``had become pretty stagnant as far as people making
investments,'' Housworth recalls. ``Billy was willing to step up to
the plate and make a commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months, Payne put contracts on two more tracts, with a
combined 123 acres, adjacent to his property. Mostly forest and
wetlands, they, too, fronted on the interstate. As before, he
needed partners with ready cash to support his vision.
</P>
<P>
   So, Housworth introduced him to A.R. ``Gus'' Barksdale, whose
family name is synonymous with Rockdale. Local legend has it that
he owned half the county and ran the other half. The Barksdales and
Vaughns, Rockdale's two most prominent families and related by
marriage, ran an important law firm, held seats in city and county
government and typically bought up most of the investment property
in what was essentially their county.
</P>
<P>
   Until Payne showed up. ``When Billy came on the scene and began
putting all the pieces of property under contract they had an eye
on for years, it was exciting for me,'' Housworth says. ``When
someone comes in from out of town and starts gobbling up the
county, it stirs things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne persuaded Barksdale to put up the $2.1 million required to
buy the two additional tracts and agree to cut Payne in for 35
percent of the profits when they sold. Payne told him that with his
real estate contacts, he could find a developer and they would make
a killing.
</P>
<P>
   Payne kept gobbling up land. He found an additional 116 acres of
scrub and pine forest along Gees Mill Road on the backside of the
big tract and put it under contract for about $1 million. Barksdale
declined to ante up all the money this time, so he assembled a team
of investors and gave Payne a 20 percent interest. Since the land
was not on the interstate, they decided to develop the tract into a
business park.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale apparently wasn't interested in the 50 acres across
the street picked up by Payne. So Payne sold the contract for a
profit to an Atlanta group headed by software entrepreneur Robert
Cramer.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Barksdale died. His widow and children
became Payne's partners.
</P>
<P>
   With an interest in 300 acres of Rockdale County's best real
estate, Payne decided to sit tight and wait for the expected
commercial boom. Then the land could be worth millions.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after filing the deeds on the Gees Mill property,
Payne told Housworth of his newest interest. They had one last
piece of Rockdale land to close on. Payne told Housworth to deal
with it; he was moving on to other opportunities. ``I'm going to
make some phone calls,'' he told Housworth, ``and see if I can't
get something started on the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The venue switch
</P>
<P>
   Not a month after Atlanta was awarded the Games in September
1990, Roland Vaughn, Conyers' young city manager and chief of
police, was plotting to attract an Olympic venue to his town of
8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The city planned to purchase a 1,139-acre farm bordering the
Yellow River to dispose of treated waste water. He hoped to find a
recreational use for the rolling, woodsy landscape and had hired a
consultant to come up with options. Michael Plummer recommended a
horse park modeled after the successful Kentucky Horse Park.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Mountain Park, which the Atlanta Olympic bid team had
originally designated as the site for the equestrian venue, wasn't
interested in a permanent facility. Plummer had shared a plane ride
with Payne, who told him during the flight that a key consideration
for any potential Olympic site was the legacy _ what would remain
for the public after the Games ended.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1991, Conyers and Rockdale leaders had formed a task
force to go after the Olympics. Payne's real estate partner _ the
late Gus Barksdale's son, Wales _ was a member of the steering
committee. ``I had known Billy, but not as well as Wales,'' recalls
Vaughn, like Payne a former football player at the University of
Georgia. ``He was a senior when I was freshman. He was an idol. I
sat on the bench'' when he was an all-star.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Atlanta Olympic committee announced that it was
reconsidering having Stone Mountain Park as equestrian host. The
sport's international officials feared that the bright granite
mountain would attract too much heat for the horses' comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals poured in from a dozen municipalities and private
interests. Although Olympic officials never identified any bids but
the four finalists, records housed in the nine boxes of documents
released at the Atlanta History Center indicated other serious
contenders, including Callaway Gardens; Hall County's Chicopee
Woods Area Park, which had recently built a new equestrian center
with an arena and stables; and Rabun Gap, where the Atlanta
Steeplechase is now held.
</P>
<P>
   Many were quickly eliminated because the site, financing or
planned use after the Games was inadequate, Frazier says. The
Rockdale location made the final cut, along with:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bouckhaert Farm in Murray County, an up-and-running
international equestrian competition site preparing to host part of
that year's Pan American Games, as well as trials for U.S. riding
teams headed to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Berry College in Rome, which hoped to use the Games to expand
its equestrian education program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cochran Mill Park in rural south Fulton County, an 800-acre
county-owned nature preserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Conyers/Rockdale Equestrian Task Force put forth a
persuasive communitywide bid. Townsfolk wore ``We share the dream''
buttons. Schoolchildren wrote letters to Payne. A 1984 gold medal
rider helped make the pitch. The city and county offered to throw
in $3.5 million toward capital costs.
</P>
<P>
   During the official site visit, Atlanta Olympic and equestrian
officials had lunch and mint juleps at Wales Barksdale's family
farm at the horse park's back entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn says Payne's status as a big landholder in Rockdale was
irrelevant to the bid. ``It wasn't a factor in any way in us
considering it as leverage,'' he says. ``In fact, we thought it
might work against us because of Billy's absolute desire to make
sure everything was perceived to be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, Payne's chief operating officer and now president of
the management firm Invesco Inc., says, ``We had a group of people
(in Rockdale) who desperately wanted this thing and were willing to
put up infrastructure to do it. It was public property and a public
benefit. It was an easy choice to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many were stunned, none more so than Carl Bouckhaert, a
wealthy carpet company owner and horse enthusiast. He pointed out
that ACOG's cost at Bouckhaert Farm would have been $8.9 million,
about one-third of its $24 million tab in Conyers. ``It was the
most unbelievable thing,'' Bouckhaert says.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier contends that Olympic officials were reluctant to spend
any amount to improve private property such as Bouckhaert's. ``The
capital savings is far outweighed by the legacy,'' Frazier asserted
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bouckhaert also made a personal offer to Payne _ less than two
weeks before the winning bid was announced _ to stage the three-day
endurance event at his farm at no cost to ACOG if the venue went
elsewhere. Bouckhaert estimated his offer would save ACOG up to $8
million by eliminating the need to build a cross-country course
that would be used only once. His offer was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lomax, now the president of Dillard University in New
Orleans, supported Cochran Mill Park but considered Bouckhaert Farm
the most serious competition. He had regarded Rockdale as ``an
improbable choice. They never had any equestrian venues. It was not
what you called horse country. It just seemed peculiar they moved
to the top of the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Lomax was so surprised at the selection of the
Rockdale site that he raised the issue of Payne's property
holdings. Nobody, including the news media, paid much attention.
``Public officials who raised legitimate issues were treated as
pariahs,'' Lomax recalls. ``There was this sense of extraordinary
gratitude to Billy for bringing the Games to Atlanta and also a
view that they (Payne's team) were really above public review and
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Payne said in 1994, when he was first questioned
by the media, that he disclosed his Rockdale property holdings to
Frazier and ACOG's board of ethics and that the board saw no
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Echols, a spokesman for Payne, says Payne did not wish to be
interviewed for this article. ``He isn't talking about anything
Olympics these days,'' Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the ethics board's chairman, former Emory University
President James T. Laney, nor board member Johnnetta B. Cole,
former president of Spelman College, said they recall the matter
coming before the board.
</P>
<P>
   The board was appointed in April 1991. ``Our principal concern
was to establish the guidelines for conflict of interest and how to
ensure there would be objectivity and no favoritism involved,''
says Laney, who became the U.S. ambassador to South Korea upon
leaving Emory in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The third board member, G. Conley Ingram, was out of the country
and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sinkfield, attorney for the ethics board, said the
matter was discussed at an Oct. 16 meeting, one week before the
move to Rockdale was announced. According to the minutes provided
by Sinkfield, Laney was not present. Minutes that Sinkfield faxed
to this newspaper indicated that Payne provided an affidavit
disclosing ownership of land in the Rockdale area and the board
concluded that because Payne's property was not to be acquired for
the venue, it saw no conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm surprised he even bothered to bring the matter
before us,'' Sinkfield said. The board's ruling was not disclosed
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if other Atlanta Olympic records could shed more
light on the matter. Payne's private foundation, the Georgia
Amateur Athletics Foundation, claims it owns the records and is
fighting in court to keep some of them from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier says Payne told him about his interests in Rockdale. The
former banker started work at ACOG in April 1991 after the
committee had already begun seeking a new home for the venue. Known
as a straight-shooter, Frazier acknowledges he was concerned about
the appearance of a conflict and says the choice of
Conyers/Rockdale was ultimately his, not Payne's.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier says of Payne's Rockdale property, ``He certainly
disclosed it to me and stayed out of the decision. And, frankly, it
was a no-brainer choice anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Lomax contends the final call may have been Frazier's but
speculates that Payne surely had some influence. ``I don't believe
any of the decisions that were made by ACOG were made without his
knowledge or involvement,'' Lomax says. ``Billy ran that place with
an iron hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Venue changes had to be approved by MAOGA, the state oversight
panel, which included Lomax. Its chairman, George Berry, a
respected and longtime municipal administrator and now senior
executive at Cousins Properties, recalls reviewing two bids _
Conyers/Rockdale and Bouckhaert Farm. ACOG recommended the former;
MAOGA approved it.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, MAOGA sharply criticized Olympic officials after
they announced that public officials who owned businesses could
have Olympic contracts, an ill-conceived policy that was rescinded
later. Authority members argued that in an endeavor as
image-sensitive as the Games, appearances were crucial.
</P>
<P>
   But the state panel had nothing to say about Payne's real estate
interests. ``My recollection is that was handled by ACOG's ethics
board,'' Berry says. ``We were told there were no ethical
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good deal for Conyers and Rockdale County,'' Roland
Vaughn crowed when the venue contract was awarded. ``And it could
be a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the horse park a ``growth engine for our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will leave a huge legacy behind that we hope is going to
develop into a large tourist attraction,'' said Ed Thomas, then
chairman of the Conyers-Rockdale Chamber of Commerce. The horse
park would pump $90 million a year into the county and generate
2,514 jobs, consultants estimated.
</P>
<P>
   But it never lived up to expectations, and now the city is
hoping to sell the park rather than risking debt to support it.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Wales Barksdale negotiated the final draft of the
venue contract with ACOG, the engine began to sputter.
</P>
<P>
   When real cost estimates came in, Randy Poynter, chairman of the
Rockdale County Board of Commissioners, choked. Fearing the county
would go into debt to build the park, he pulled Rockdale out. It
turned out to be a fortuitous move.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers wanted the park so badly that Vaughn called Mayor
Charles Walker, who was vacationing in Europe. Could the city go it
alone? The mayor was game. But proposed soccer fields, softball
fields and a swimming pool would have to be scratched from the
master plan. And the Atlanta Olympic committee would have to kick
in the money the county was going to put up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hell of a good deal when we made it,'' Frazier says.
``It turned out to be less of a good deal and we had to live with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It became less of a good deal for Conyers, too. The horse park
cost the city substantially more than expected _ more than $20
million in all.
</P>
<P>
   When the Games closed, there was no clear marketing strategy
designed to bring in the profits to pay off the bank debt and the
bond issues needed to fund construction. After building a golf club
and apartment complex, the city had no money to develop the
remaining 900 acres. Efforts to attract world-class equine
competitions never panned out.
</P>
<P>
   Saddled with debt, the city sold its water and sewer system to
the county for $12 million _ less than half the original asking
price _ to pay off a horse park construction loan. After the sale
in 1997, Conyers residents were stuck with a 28 percent rate
increase in their water bills.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor retired last year, and Vaughn quit city government to
go to work for big Olympics contractor Beers Construction as
marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   But Billy Payne has done just fine in Conyers. Prior to the
Games, he and his partner pulled in an estimated $500,000 or more
in profit on deals on three sites, including the 56 acres at Ga.
138 and I-20 _ which would later become the primary access
interchange to the horse park.
</P>
<P>
   Payne did not receive his payoff on the site until 1994. Two
years later, the property was developed into Conyers Plaza, with a
Home Depot, Wal-Mart and Rhodes Furniture _ just as he had
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   That development and the widening of Ga. 138 _ in preparation
for Olympic traffic to the horse park _ enhanced the value of the
123-acre site along I-20 he still held with the Barksdales,
according to an independent appraisal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 alone, 15 new hotels, restaurants and retail stores
opened in Rockdale _ primarily clustered around the Ga. 138/I-20
interchange _ fueled by the horse park and about 2,000 new
residents a year.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Payne was ready to cash in. In August, he sued his
partners, who he believed had sold some of their land at
below-market value without his consent. They agreed to settle.
Payne, who had never invested his own money, received $696,000,
according to documents filed recently at the Rockdale County
Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   That figure represents his return for assembling some tracts of
forest and wetlands nobody else wanted more than a decade ago.
During his six-year tenure, he also made $4 million in salary from
the Atlanta Olympic committee and, after the Olympics, cash from
the sale of his personal memorabilia to his private foundation.

 &HT;    Atlanta Olympics Chief Billy Payne profited from land deals near
horse park
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Billy Payne's career path diverged dramatically one
Monday morning in February 1987, about the time Alton Housworth
drove into the city from nearby Conyers for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Housworth apologized for missing the dedication of the sanctuary
at St. Luke's Presbyterian Church in Dunwoody, an Atlanta suburb,
the day before. The ceremony was gratifying and inspirational for
Payne, a real estate lawyer who had been the moving force behind
fund-raising for the new building.
</P>
<P>
   Housworth, a real estate broker, came to chat about the land
deals he was putting together for Payne near Atlanta in Rockdale
County.
</P>
<P>
   But Payne wanted to talk about his epiphany. The dedication
ceremony was the most exciting thing that had ever happened to him.
``Alton, I've got to find another challenge,'' he told his friend.
``I stayed awake all night trying to come up with something that
would benefit the community and the state. I've got an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, was bringing the 1996 Summer Olympics to
Atlanta. Payne asked Housworth what he thought. ``Hey, I don't know
nothing about the Olympics,'' he responded. But he figured if
anybody could take such a fanciful scheme and convert it into
reality, his friend Billy could.
</P>
<P>
   Payne saw possibilities where others didn't, whether they were
in delivering the Olympics to his hometown or in risky land
speculation in rural Rockdale, where he and his partners had just
purchased hundreds of acres of undeveloped farmland and forest.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone knows the legend of Payne, the intrepid volunteer
who gave up everything to win the Games for his city. Few are aware
that Payne never really gave up his real estate pursuits _ even
borrowing money against his land while chasing his Olympic dream,
patiently waiting for the day it would be worth something big.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer still are aware that his two pursuits collided in 1991,
when the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games decided to move
its equestrian venue from Stone Mountain Park to a 1,100-acre site
in sleepy Conyers, the county seat of Rockdale _ minutes from the
tracts of property Payne held an interest in _ despite formidable
competition from other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of visitors ventured to Conyers for the Games.
Commercial development fired up. And now, while the city negotiates
to unload its Olympic landmark, the czar of Atlanta's Games is
cashing out of the area, his land deals bringing him and his
partnership more than a $1 million profit.
</P>
<P>
   In both dreams, the possibilities played out just as Payne
predicted. But did his private interests in Rockdale bump up
against the state's interests in putting on the best Olympics
possible?
</P>
<P>
   Payne would not comment for this article. His chief lieutenant,
A.D. Frazier Jr., says he was aware of Payne's property holdings
and he, not Payne, selected the equestrian venue.
</P>
<P>
   But others believe that had Payne been an elected official, more
scrutiny would have been applied. ``I think, rightly or wrongly,
ACOG officials _ and, in this case, Billy _ were given the benefit
of the doubt, which was characteristic of the time,'' says Michael
Lomax, former Fulton County Commission chairman and member of the
Metropolitan Atlanta Olympic Games Authority, the state oversight
authority set up to protect taxpayers' interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not get the level of consideration that it would have
had it been an elected official owning property near a site that
was about to be significantly increased in value as a result of a
decision he would make.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockdale deals
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale, about 25 miles due east of downtown Atlanta, is the
second-smallest county in the state. It had yet to be swallowed up
by the suburban development wave when Billy Payne discovered its
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, who specialized in risky land speculation, had done quite
well in Gwinnett County, when the new Gwinnett Place mall turned
rural pastures into small fortunes for speculators who had bought
the acreage years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1986, Payne was looking for the next diamond in
the rough. He responded to a classified ad placed by Alton
Housworth in the Atlanta newspapers. Housworth was selling some
property on Big Haynes Creek in north Rockdale. Payne was looking
for some land where he and his son could fish and shoot skeet.
After riding the property, Payne told Housworth it wasn't quite
right.
</P>
<P>
   But Housworth, who knew the county and its biggest landowners
like the back of his hand, had turned Payne on to Rockdale's
upside. For one thing, talk had swirled for a few years about the
Turner Hill Mall going up a couple of exits toward Atlanta on I-20.
It could be another Gwinnett Place explosion in the making.
</P>
<P>
   That very afternoon, Housworth showed Payne a 56-acre tract at
the northeast corner of the interchange at I-20 and Ga. 138.
Fronting on the expressway, it would be a good location for one of
the so-called ``power centers'' eating up the suburbs once the
development boom hit Rockdale. Payne put a contract on it for $1.5
million. Then he turned to a longtime client, Ellis Godshall, who
had grown wealthy in the convenience store business, to become his
limited partner and put up all the necessary cash.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale ``had become pretty stagnant as far as people making
investments,'' Housworth recalls. ``Billy was willing to step up to
the plate and make a commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Within months, Payne put contracts on two more tracts, with a
combined 123 acres, adjacent to his property. Mostly forest and
wetlands, they, too, fronted on the interstate. As before, he
needed partners with ready cash to support his vision.
</P>
<P>
   So, Housworth introduced him to A.R. ``Gus'' Barksdale, whose
family name is synonymous with Rockdale. Local legend has it that
he owned half the county and ran the other half. The Barksdales and
Vaughns, Rockdale's two most prominent families and related by
marriage, ran an important law firm, held seats in city and county
government and typically bought up most of the investment property
in what was essentially their county.
</P>
<P>
   Until Payne showed up. ``When Billy came on the scene and began
putting all the pieces of property under contract they had an eye
on for years, it was exciting for me,'' Housworth says. ``When
someone comes in from out of town and starts gobbling up the
county, it stirs things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne persuaded Barksdale to put up the $2.1 million required to
buy the two additional tracts and agree to cut Payne in for 35
percent of the profits when they sold. Payne told him that with his
real estate contacts, he could find a developer and they would make
a killing.
</P>
<P>
   Payne kept gobbling up land. He found an additional 116 acres of
scrub and pine forest along Gees Mill Road on the backside of the
big tract and put it under contract for about $1 million. Barksdale
declined to ante up all the money this time, so he assembled a team
of investors and gave Payne a 20 percent interest. Since the land
was not on the interstate, they decided to develop the tract into a
business park.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale apparently wasn't interested in the 50 acres across
the street picked up by Payne. So Payne sold the contract for a
profit to an Atlanta group headed by software entrepreneur Robert
Cramer.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, Barksdale died. His widow and children
became Payne's partners.
</P>
<P>
   With an interest in 300 acres of Rockdale County's best real
estate, Payne decided to sit tight and wait for the expected
commercial boom. Then the land could be worth millions.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after filing the deeds on the Gees Mill property,
Payne told Housworth of his newest interest. They had one last
piece of Rockdale land to close on. Payne told Housworth to deal
with it; he was moving on to other opportunities. ``I'm going to
make some phone calls,'' he told Housworth, ``and see if I can't
get something started on the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   The venue switch
</P>
<P>
   Not a month after Atlanta was awarded the Games in September
1990, Roland Vaughn, Conyers' young city manager and chief of
police, was plotting to attract an Olympic venue to his town of
8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The city planned to purchase a 1,139-acre farm bordering the
Yellow River to dispose of treated waste water. He hoped to find a
recreational use for the rolling, woodsy landscape and had hired a
consultant to come up with options. Michael Plummer recommended a
horse park modeled after the successful Kentucky Horse Park.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Mountain Park, which the Atlanta Olympic bid team had
originally designated as the site for the equestrian venue, wasn't
interested in a permanent facility. Plummer had shared a plane ride
with Payne, who told him during the flight that a key consideration
for any potential Olympic site was the legacy _ what would remain
for the public after the Games ended.
</P>
<P>
   By January 1991, Conyers and Rockdale leaders had formed a task
force to go after the Olympics. Payne's real estate partner _ the
late Gus Barksdale's son, Wales _ was a member of the steering
committee. ``I had known Billy, but not as well as Wales,'' recalls
Vaughn, like Payne a former football player at the University of
Georgia. ``He was a senior when I was freshman. He was an idol. I
sat on the bench'' when he was an all-star.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Atlanta Olympic committee announced that it was
reconsidering having Stone Mountain Park as equestrian host. The
sport's international officials feared that the bright granite
mountain would attract too much heat for the horses' comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals poured in from a dozen municipalities and private
interests. Although Olympic officials never identified any bids but
the four finalists, records housed in the nine boxes of documents
released at the Atlanta History Center indicated other serious
contenders, including Callaway Gardens; Hall County's Chicopee
Woods Area Park, which had recently built a new equestrian center
with an arena and stables; and Rabun Gap, where the Atlanta
Steeplechase is now held.
</P>
<P>
   Many were quickly eliminated because the site, financing or
planned use after the Games was inadequate, Frazier says. The
Rockdale location made the final cut, along with:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bouckhaert Farm in Murray County, an up-and-running
international equestrian competition site preparing to host part of
that year's Pan American Games, as well as trials for U.S. riding
teams headed to the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Berry College in Rome, which hoped to use the Games to expand
its equestrian education program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cochran Mill Park in rural south Fulton County, an 800-acre
county-owned nature preserve.
</P>
<P>
   The Conyers/Rockdale Equestrian Task Force put forth a
persuasive communitywide bid. Townsfolk wore ``We share the dream''
buttons. Schoolchildren wrote letters to Payne. A 1984 gold medal
rider helped make the pitch. The city and county offered to throw
in $3.5 million toward capital costs.
</P>
<P>
   During the official site visit, Atlanta Olympic and equestrian
officials had lunch and mint juleps at Wales Barksdale's family
farm at the horse park's back entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn says Payne's status as a big landholder in Rockdale was
irrelevant to the bid. ``It wasn't a factor in any way in us
considering it as leverage,'' he says. ``In fact, we thought it
might work against us because of Billy's absolute desire to make
sure everything was perceived to be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, Payne's chief operating officer and now president of
the management firm Invesco Inc., says, ``We had a group of people
(in Rockdale) who desperately wanted this thing and were willing to
put up infrastructure to do it. It was public property and a public
benefit. It was an easy choice to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many were stunned, none more so than Carl Bouckhaert, a
wealthy carpet company owner and horse enthusiast. He pointed out
that ACOG's cost at Bouckhaert Farm would have been $8.9 million,
about one-third of its $24 million tab in Conyers. ``It was the
most unbelievable thing,'' Bouckhaert says.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier contends that Olympic officials were reluctant to spend
any amount to improve private property such as Bouckhaert's. ``The
capital savings is far outweighed by the legacy,'' Frazier asserted
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bouckhaert also made a personal offer to Payne _ less than two
weeks before the winning bid was announced _ to stage the three-day
endurance event at his farm at no cost to ACOG if the venue went
elsewhere. Bouckhaert estimated his offer would save ACOG up to $8
million by eliminating the need to build a cross-country course
that would be used only once. His offer was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lomax, now the president of Dillard University in New
Orleans, supported Cochran Mill Park but considered Bouckhaert Farm
the most serious competition. He had regarded Rockdale as ``an
improbable choice. They never had any equestrian venues. It was not
what you called horse country. It just seemed peculiar they moved
to the top of the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Lomax was so surprised at the selection of the
Rockdale site that he raised the issue of Payne's property
holdings. Nobody, including the news media, paid much attention.
``Public officials who raised legitimate issues were treated as
pariahs,'' Lomax recalls. ``There was this sense of extraordinary
gratitude to Billy for bringing the Games to Atlanta and also a
view that they (Payne's team) were really above public review and
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Payne said in 1994, when he was first questioned
by the media, that he disclosed his Rockdale property holdings to
Frazier and ACOG's board of ethics and that the board saw no
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Echols, a spokesman for Payne, says Payne did not wish to be
interviewed for this article. ``He isn't talking about anything
Olympics these days,'' Echols said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the ethics board's chairman, former Emory University
President James T. Laney, nor board member Johnnetta B. Cole,
former president of Spelman College, said they recall the matter
coming before the board.
</P>
<P>
   The board was appointed in April 1991. ``Our principal concern
was to establish the guidelines for conflict of interest and how to
ensure there would be objectivity and no favoritism involved,''
says Laney, who became the U.S. ambassador to South Korea upon
leaving Emory in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The third board member, G. Conley Ingram, was out of the country
and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sinkfield, attorney for the ethics board, said the
matter was discussed at an Oct. 16 meeting, one week before the
move to Rockdale was announced. According to the minutes provided
by Sinkfield, Laney was not present. Minutes that Sinkfield faxed
to this newspaper indicated that Payne provided an affidavit
disclosing ownership of land in the Rockdale area and the board
concluded that because Payne's property was not to be acquired for
the venue, it saw no conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm surprised he even bothered to bring the matter
before us,'' Sinkfield said. The board's ruling was not disclosed
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if other Atlanta Olympic records could shed more
light on the matter. Payne's private foundation, the Georgia
Amateur Athletics Foundation, claims it owns the records and is
fighting in court to keep some of them from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier says Payne told him about his interests in Rockdale. The
former banker started work at ACOG in April 1991 after the
committee had already begun seeking a new home for the venue. Known
as a straight-shooter, Frazier acknowledges he was concerned about
the appearance of a conflict and says the choice of
Conyers/Rockdale was ultimately his, not Payne's.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier says of Payne's Rockdale property, ``He certainly
disclosed it to me and stayed out of the decision. And, frankly, it
was a no-brainer choice anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Lomax contends the final call may have been Frazier's but
speculates that Payne surely had some influence. ``I don't believe
any of the decisions that were made by ACOG were made without his
knowledge or involvement,'' Lomax says. ``Billy ran that place with
an iron hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Venue changes had to be approved by MAOGA, the state oversight
panel, which included Lomax. Its chairman, George Berry, a
respected and longtime municipal administrator and now senior
executive at Cousins Properties, recalls reviewing two bids _
Conyers/Rockdale and Bouckhaert Farm. ACOG recommended the former;

in profit on deals on three sites, including the 56 acres at Ga.

Payne, who had never invested his own money, received $696,000,
according to documents filed recently at the Rockdale County
Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   That figure represents his return for assembling some tracts of
forest and wetlands nobody else wanted more than a decade ago.
During his six-year tenure, he also made $4 million in salary from
the Atlanta Olympic committee and, after the Olympics, cash from
the sale of his personal memorabilia to his private foundation.

IN SPORTS, THE SIZE OF THE HEART DETERMINES THE STATURE
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Locally, it's a big holiday weekend for the little guys of the
sports world.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, how tall is tall?
</P>
<P>
   Like that Game 5 this afternoon at Reunion Arena. Ever seen
Eddie Belfour in street clothes? Almost jockey size.
</P>
<P>
   But standing between the pipes during these Stanley Cup
playoffs, The Eagle has been one large man.
</P>
<P>
   Ever seen Marlon St. Julien in street clothes? He's a little
fellow, which makes Marlon just the right size for his chosen
profession.
</P>
<P>
   But dress him up in silks, and place St. Julien atop 1,200
pounds of thoroughbred muscle and fury. There is suddenly nothing
small about the skill, the courage and the talent that's required.
</P>
<P>
   You wanna see something tall for the Memorial Day weekend?
</P>
<P>
   See Eddie today at Reunion. Then see Marlon and an army of other
race riders tomorrow in Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   A million dollars in purse money goes on the line tomorrow at
Lone Star Park. It's easily the biggest day for thoroughbred racing
ever in the state. Seven stake events totaling a cool million in
purses reaffirms the continuing success Lone Star Park has quickly
carved out in our very crowded sports market.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we all know, the competition for the sports dollar in North
Texas is fierce,'' said Lone Star general manager Corey Johnsen.
``But as a newcomer, it gives us a challenge. We'd better be good,
and we'd better keep coming up with major events that provide
exposure for our product and our sport in general. That's what this
million-dollar day is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a strange, yet interesting year for thoroughbred
racing on the national scene. A former claimer, Charismatic, is
going for the Triple Crown next week, which is the equivalent of
the Fort Worth Fire playing for the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Charismatic's rider, Chris Antley, who in
January considered himself washed up in the profession.
``Charismatic is knocked for being a claiming horse, but I was
lower than him _ I had been turned out,'' laughed Antley during a
visit to Lone Star Park last week.
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien, in a different way, knows the feeling. When Lone
Star opened two summers ago, he was a struggling regional rider.
``I thank God for this place _ it's where it all began to happen
for me,'' said St. Julien, who had a strong 1997 season in Grand
Prairie, then won the Lone Star riding title in '98, and this year
is cemented as one of middle America's top jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Denise, has been here every step of the way, helping
supplement the family income as a mutuels teller at Lone Star in
'97. But with 4-month-old Jasmin being a new addition to the St.
Julien family, Denise is now strictly a mother and Marlon's No. 1
fan. Watch the winner's circle at Lone Star. When Marlon is posing
for a picture, Denise and daughter Jasmin are always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful for the success I've had, but on a day like
Monday, when all that money will be on the line, I darn sure won't
be forgetting my days at Delta Downs \Ra small south Louisiana
track\S,'' said St. Julien. ``I was riding for nothing. I never had
to watch my weight _ there wasn't any money to buy food anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   From the $300,000 Lone Star Park Handicap, to the $250,000 USA
Stakes, to the $150,000 Prestonwood Distaff, and right on down the
line, St. Julien has mounts tomorrow in all seven stake races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that long ago when money was tight for Denise and
me, and I needed to win these kind of pots to make ends meet,'' he
said. ``Don't think that doesn't put you in a different state of
mind. It will mess with your attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``But since being blessed with some success, I can approach the
big races without that kind of thing pulling at me. Be it a
five-thousand-dollar claiming race, or one of these stakes, your
mind is clear. While you are nervous, it's a good nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   On the backside in Grand Prairie, or the Fairgrounds in New
Orleans, or wherever, St. Julien is also well-known as one of the
good guys in the business. Always upbeat and friendly, St. Julien
was a winner in personality and attitude even before he became a
leading rider. Better yet, nothing changed with success.
</P>
<P>
   On a holiday weekend that features some little big men competing
for high stakes, one size fits all _ the size of the heart is the
only measurement that matters.

INDY IS KING TODAY, BUT DAYTONA RULES RACING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ The question is a foolish one, because there's
no doubt what the answer will be.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's being asked deep in the heart of stock-car
racing country, where the only sport that matters is sponsored by
cigarette and beer companies.
</P>
<P>
   And it's being asked of Dale Jarrett, who was born and bred in
Hickory, N.C., and nursed on Unocal 76 racing fuel, and as points
leader on the Winston Cup circuit clearly has an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's asked anyway: Dale, which is the bigger race
today, the Indianapolis 500 or the Coca-Cola 600?
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot that there was a race going on in Indy,'' Jarrett
says.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of the answer is expected. NASCAR's longest race, a
prime-time event at a Southern track with roots that extend to the
beginning of the sport, is more important to a driver who shares
those roots than a race at a Midwest track with those funny,
open-wheel cars.
</P>
<P>
   But it's surprising in its audacity. Five years ago, no one
would dare jest about forgetting the storied, historic, traditional
Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, five years ago no one would dare pose the question.
</P>
<P>
   In those five years much has changed in the world of
motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's popularity has soared, taking it from a regional, niche
sport for good ol' boys to a national success story.
</P>
<P>
   Indy-car racing's popularity has plummeted, starting when
Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony George formed a racing
league and restricted the guest list to the race at his track.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there was one open-wheel series, Indy played a
bigger role,'' said Michael Kranefuss, who was involved in
open-wheel racing as head of Ford's worldwide racing division but
now is a stock-car guy as owner of the No. 12 Ford driven by Jeremy
Mayfield. ``You had all the big names there. You had the Unsers,
the Andrettis. Today you've got a series with a bunch of people
that America cannot relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   The recognition issue is indeed a problem for the IRL, which has
too many guys named Sam Schmidt, Tyce Carlson, Jeff Ward, Steve
Knapp and Jimmy Kite. The drivers with the most star quality in the
IRL today are Arie Luyendyk, who's retiring after the race, and
Tony Stewart, whose real job is racing a stock car.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the recognition deal is also a problem for the other
open-wheel series. The top driver on the CART circuit is Juan
Montoya. Or is he the guy who beat Pete Sampras at the U.S. Open?
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR has no such problems. Its poster boy, Jeff Gordon,
appears in TV commercials and on billboards with a milk mustache.
Its stars, including Dale Earnhardt, Rusty Wallace, Mark Martin,
Terry and Bobby Labonte and Jarrett, are known to even casual fans.
</P>
<P>
   But does that make the NASCAR race the biggest of the day?
Doesn't tradition count for something?
</P>
<P>
   According to Texas Motor Speedway president Eddie Gossage _
whose track promotes NASCAR and IRL events _ it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stars don't make Indy,'' he said. ``Indy makes the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Gossage is right. The drivers don't make Indy. Indy
makes the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The race is big for the same reason the Kentucky Derby is big.
</P>
<P>
   The horses change every year, but we watch the Derby every year
because it's an ``event.'' It's the tradition, the history.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for the Indy 500. It has tradition _ the winner
drinks milk _ and history. It has a dignified trophy that means
something, unlike the cheesy thing with the plastic soft drink
bottle on it that they'll give the winner of the stock-car race.
</P>
<P>
   It's an event, much more likely to draw the casual fan who
doesn't care about things such as whether the No. 54 American-made
car is loose or tight.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy 500 is a spectacle. The Coca-Cola 600 is one of 34
races on the Winston Cup schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy 500 is the bigger race today.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Indy 500 no longer is the biggest race of the year.
That distinction belongs to NASCAR's Daytona 500.

WORLD WAR II FOCUSED ATHLETES ON A FAR MORE IMPORTANT CONFLICT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Roland ``Stormy'' Goss stood on the edge of the Rhine
River on a frigid night in 1945, preparing to help move General
George Patton's army deeper into Germany, when a scratchy voice
came over his walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stormy, I'm worried about this one,'' said Vince Avalone, one
of his closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong? We've been through this before and it will be
OK,'' Goss replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's been bothering me,'' the Bronx native said.
``Eight years ago today my dad died, and it's been on my mind all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, German soldiers began shelling. Goss and another
soldier jumped into a foxhole, as did Avalone. Too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out and there were my buddy's \RAvalone\S two legs
sticking out in the air,'' Goss said. ``A shell had killed him
instantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss' voice cracks at the memory of a war that took him from
SMU's football fields and put him on Europe's battlefields. Many,
such as Avalone, never returned. Others, such as Goss, had their
lives changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   From 1942-45, college football continued despite the absence of
thousands of athletes forced to abandon their dreams to serve in
the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   There were adjustments. On Jan. 1, 1942, for instance, the Rose
Bowl was played in Durham, N.C., for fear the Japanese would bomb
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, after thousands joined the service, colleges
nationwide stopped fielding teams. In 1942, there were 525
four-year colleges that played football. One season later, there
were 146.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys played who were under the draft age or who had physical
problems that prevented them from being drafted, but they could
play football,'' said Pat Harmon, a retired sportswriter and a
historian for the College Football Hall of Fame. ``The quality of
play was down.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1943-44, Baylor was the lone Southwest Conference school to
cease play. Its administration felt it didn't have enough athletes,
and it wanted to support the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   With enlistment at a record high, service-academy teams thrived
with athletes who played in their spare time while training. In
1944, half of the programs ranked in the Top 20 were
service-academy teams.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 6, 1941, Goss, a senior lineman, played in all but one
minute of the Mustangs' 6-0 loss to Rice at Ownby Stadium. It would
be the last game of his football career.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1944, Goss had three boats under his command
stationed off Omaha Beach, where the highest casualty rates of the
Normandy invasion occurred on D-Day. They supplied engineers with
explosives to clear mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the Germans were fortified, and they were waiting for
us,'' Goss said. ``I saw boats hit mines and explode. ... It was a
horrible experience. I said a few prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, 18-year-old Frank Denius, a former punter at the
Citadel and current Austin resident, landed on Omaha Beach. As a
field observer, he was in charge of locating enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hit the ground running and you kept your eyes open and you
prayed, but not necessarily in that order,'' Denius said. ``We were
too scared to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, both men returned to Texas. Goss went into
business and became a SWC football official for 27 years. Denius
practiced law in Austin for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Denius has returned to several of the places where so much of
the fighting occurred _ and where so many of his friends died.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are parts there I still know like back of my hand,''
Denius said. ``Going to the cemetery in Normandy or looking at
those beaches is very emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Goss keeps in touch with the eight living members of the
original 15 men under his command and plans to attend a reunion in
June.
</P>
<P>
   He also kept a tie to the ones who didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I named my oldest son after Vincent Avalone.''

HOGAN, NELSON HELPED FORT WORTH COME ALIVE AS A SPORTS TOWN IN
1940s 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sobering updates of Nazi invasions, battle
casualties and global rebuilding efforts dominated front-page
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But for residents of Fort Worth, a city rapidly building a
reputation as Golftown, USA, a welcome respite from real-world
horrors stood only a sports section away throughout the 1940s.
Southwest Conference football players dominated All-America lists.
The Fort Worth Cats returned to prominence after the war.
</P>
<P>
   And a couple of former caddies from Glen Garden Country Club
held the professional golf world by the scruff of the neck.
</P>
<P>
   Through the exploits of PGA Tour standouts Byron Nelson and Ben
Hogan, a teen-ager from south Fort Worth developed a heady opinion
of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I lived in the sports capital of the world,'' said
Dan Jenkins, 69, who would go on to a career as an award-winning
sportswriter and author. ``Byron and Ben were just the latest in a
long line of athletes that made Fort Worth a great sports town. But
they were the ones who became larger-than-life figures. As much so,
if not moreso, than Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus ever were.''
</P>
<P>
   John Payne, a longtime Colonial Country Club member who spent
World War II commanding a Navy freighter, recalled arriving at port
throughout 1945 with two objectives. First, he wanted to contact
his wife. Second, he wanted an update on Nelson's winning streak,
which would grow to a tour-record 11 consecutive triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any city that has had two players like those
boys,'' said Payne, 84. ``They made you proud to be from Fort
Worth, especially if you played golf. I think they had an influence
on the city as a whole. They put us on the map. A lot of people
learned about Fort Worth for the first time because of those two.
Being a fan of Hogan and Nelson made you feel like you belonged to
something worthwhile.'' DOMINATING DUO At the height of their
careers, Nelson and Hogan combined to win 67 PGA Tour events from
1944-48 (33 by Nelson, 34 by Hogan). Included were four major
championships _ three by Hogan, one by Nelson _ as well as four of
the six winningest seasons in tour history.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of either man could stop traffic in downtown Fort
Worth. Their triumphs were chronicled in banner headlines. Their
failures, in some ways, were even more newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point we were surprised when they lost,'' said
Jerre Todd, 67, who retired in January after 30 years as public
relations director for the Colonial tournament. ``That was more of
a shocker than having them pick up another trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson concluded his career with 52 victories and five major
championships. Hogan won 63 times, including nine majors. On the
tour's career-victory list, Hogan trails Sam Snead (81) and Jack
Nicklaus (70). Nelson is fifth, behind Arnold Palmer (60).
</P>
<P>
   Their names still dot the PGA Tour record book, with most of the
glory years in the 1940s. Nelson's record streak was in 1945, when
he finished with a single-season scoring average (68.33) that has
yet to be duplicated. He ended the year with 18 titles, a mark
likely to stand forever.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan responded in 1946 with 13 victories, the second-highest
total in tour history. With 10 triumphs in 1948, Hogan holds the
No. 4 spot on the season-victories list.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a pretty good mark for a couple of old caddies from
Glen Garden,'' said Nelson, 87, a Roanoke resident. ``It's
something I'm proud of, for both of us. The game came fairly easy
to me. But Ben worked harder than anybody I ever saw to become a
good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan died in 1997, 70 years after he lost to Nelson by one
stroke in the finals of the 1927 Glen Garden caddies' championship.
Neither knew it at the time, but the decade of the '40s would
provide the defining moments in both men's careers.
</P>
<P>
   For Hogan, it was a near-fatal car wreck on Feb. 2, 1949.
Doctors predicted he would not walk again after sustaining a
crushed pelvis, fractured left leg, crushed shoulder and broken
ankle, as well as severe internal bleeding. Yet Hogan walked out of
Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pa. as the 1950 U.S. Open champion
after defeating George Fazio and Lloyd Mangrum in an 18-hole
playoff. Hogan's stirring comeback made him a national hero. A
STREAK TO REMEMBER Jenkins recalled the moment he fully understood
the depth of Hogan's single-minded pursuit of perfection, the trait
that drove him to win six of his nine majors after the 1949 crash.
The two had just completed a round at Colonial, with Hogan firing a
bogey-free 66. Jenkins attempted to offer a compliment. Hogan cut
him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `I didn't hit one shot that turned out the way I
wanted it to. If you can play a round of golf and hit three shots
that turn out the way you want, you've had a good round of golf,'
'' Jenkins remembered Hogan saying.
</P>
<P>
   For Nelson, his record-setting 1945 season made him a poster boy
for Wheaties, the self-proclaimed ``Breakfast of Champions.''
Although he understands why others fawn over his 11 consecutive
victories, Nelson said he does not consider that his crowning
achievement as a professional golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'm most proud of about my career is winning money
in 113 consecutive tournaments,'' said Nelson, who retired in 1946
with his tour-record mark for consecutive cuts survived, which
still stands. ``Most of those years, they only paid the top 20
places. Everybody wants to talk about 1945, but that 113 gets lost.
And it meant more to me. It meant my swing was repetitive. If I had
a bad day, I didn't let it upset me. I could tough it out and still
be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, Nelson and Hogan proved tough enough to dominate the
local golf landscape in a decade when the city boasted its share of
top amateur players.
</P>
<P>
   Aniela Goldthwaite, four-time winner of the Texas Women's Open,
reached the semifinals of the U.S. Women's Amateur in 1941 and won
the 1940 Southern Golf Association Championship at her home course,
River Crest Country Club. In 1986, she was inducted into the Texas
Golf Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Polly Riley, a six-time Curtis Cup participant, was runner-up in
the 1947 U.S. Women's Open. In 1948, River Crest was the site of
her most historic triumph: Riley defeated Babe Didrikson Zaharias,
10 and 9, in the 36-hole finals of the Texas Women's Open, the most
lopsided defeat of Zaharias' legendary career. Riley was a 1980
inductee into the Texas Golf Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Polly and I played in a big tournament, the Star-Telegram
usually would send someone to go along with us. So people knew who
we were,'' said Goldthwaite, 87, who sailed on the maiden voyage of
the Queen Mary after one of her Curtis Cup appearances in the
1930s. ``But it was nothing like Byron and Ben. They were
celebrities. They made things exciting.'' \Nsubheds:Finished where
he started Arguably, the excitement reached its apex when Nelson
won 11 in a row, shattering the previous tour record of four.
Appropriately enough, the greatest season in professional golf
history ended where it began _ at Glen Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson won his 18th event at the 1945 Fort Worth Open, held at
the course where he once caddied. His winner's check of $2,000
boosted Nelson's season earnings to $13,085, with another $48,689
in war bonds (worth 75 percent of face value).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Nelson collected 14.5 percent of the total purses
offered at PGA Tour events in 1945. If a player won 14.5 percent of
the purses available in 1999, he would collect $19,096,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made me real happy to wind things up on the course where
I started, where they made me a junior member,'' Nelson said. ``I
really got a big kick out of that. Not many players have ever won a
championship on a course where they worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many cities have ever produced the likes of Hogan and
Nelson, either. Their legacy is such that each has a bridge at
Augusta National Golf Club named in his honor. In Fort Worth,
during the 1940s, they cast considerable shadows as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you weren't a golf fan, you know who they were,'' Todd
said. ``Just like, if you live in Fort Worth, you know who Van
Cliburn is even if you don't know who Beethoven is.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-century later, golfers and golf fans still revere the
names. Ben Crenshaw, the U.S. Ryder Cup captain and a two-time
Masters champion, said they will always hold a special place in his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Texas, those two were always at the top of the
list. They had an ultra-respect,'' said Crenshaw, an Austin
resident. ``Because of what they accomplished, Fort Worth holds a
special place in the game that people still recognize today.'' nn

Billy Payne, the intrepid volunteer who gave up everything to win
the Games for his city. Few are aware that Payne never really gave
up his real estate pursuits _ even borrowing money against his land

pursuits collided in 1991, when the Atlanta Committee for the

candidates. (Turner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.

OLD TRIESTE LOOKS UNSTOPPABLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Other than injury, nothing has stopped Old Trieste
lately.
</P>
<P>
   And after the 4-year-old colt's display Saturday, in which he
returned from a nearly nine-month layoff to win the $300,000
Californian by seven lengths, the question is whether anything but
injury can stop Old Trieste from winning the June 27 Hollywood Gold
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   While Old Trieste and jockey Chris McCarron led the entire 1[
miles at Hollywood Park, Californian favorite Puerto Madero ran his
second dull race in a row to finish third behind Budroyale.
</P>
<P>
   And 2{ hours earlier, a continent away at Suffolk Downs, another
presumed Gold Cup contender failed to impress as Real Quiet faded
to third in the $600,000 Massachusetts Handicap while Behrens and
jockey Jorge Chavez wore down 8-1 Running Stag to win.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park hopes Behrens, the East Coast's leading older
horse, will travel to the $1 million Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, can't
be ruled out although jockey Gary Stevens offered ``no excuses''
for Saturday's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   And Puerto Madero is still aiming for the Gold Cup, according to
trainer Richard Mandella, who also plans to have Malek in the
1\-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   But they'll all have to catch Old Trieste, a son of A.P. Indy
who hasn't trailed in his past four races, winning by a combined
28{ lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Since leading but finishing 10th in the '98 Derby, Old Trieste
had won the 1 1/16-mile Affirmed Handicap and the 1[-mile Swaps
Stakes at Hollywood Park, and the 1-mile Del Mar Handicap at Del
Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Old Trieste's 11-race, six-victory career has been interrupted
three times by layoffs of three months or more, the latest because
of foot problems and a virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be questions about whether he can go 1\ miles,''
said owner Gary Biszantz of Rancho Santa Fe. ``But I think what you
see now is a mature horse who has learned to rate (harness his
speed) a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Biszantz said he'll take nothing for granted in the Gold Cup,
even though the race is weakened with Free House and Victory Gallop
sidelined and Silver Charm apparently committed to a race at
Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've lost some good horses,'' Biszantz said. ``But Behrens'
race today was very, very good. Real Quiet will come back, I'm
sure, with Bob (Baffert) training. And Puerto Madero _ maybe he'll
move forward off this race today.''
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's other major race, the $500,000 Metropolitan
Handicap at Belmont Park, Behrens' Florida rival Sir Bear and
jockey John Velazquez rallied on the outside to beat Crafty Friend
and Liberty Gold as favored Affirmed Success finished fourth and
Cat Thief sixth.

DODGERS CAN'T GROW 'EM DOWN ON FARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In big-league cities across the country, Wednesday
is a big, big day. The annual draft of amateur players breathes
life into troubled franchises and lets fans dream about the future
in places that don't really have one.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Baseball Weekly went so far as to put Texas high
school right-hander Josh Beckett, the expected top pick of the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, on its cover with the headline, ``The Next
Nolan Ryan?''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, it's not that way around here anymore. There were small
pockets of interest when local high school guys like Mike
Lieberthal, Roger Salkeld and Jon Garland were drafted early in the
first round, but they always went to some team far away.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers aren't players in the draft and farm-system arena.
Once they fielded the teams of the 1970s from the 1968 draft, but
only six members of this year's 25-man squad were drafted by the
club. And Eric Young returned only after building his career in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros and Todd Hollandsworth did go on to win Rookie of
the Year awards and Darren Dreifort was the No.2 overall pick in
1993. And the Dodgers have six more players signed from Latin
America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But in the era of big money, expectations are high and the need
for results is quick. It's unlikely you will ever see the Dodgers
built by the draft again.
</P>
<P>
   They don't pick this year until No.37 due to having to
compensate for the free-agent signings of Kevin Brown and Devon
White. That sounds like a decent trade-off. And they only are
drafting that high because the St. Louis Cardinals signed Scott
Radinsky.
</P>
<P>
   You could say the draft hasn't helped the Angels become a winner
or particularly popular even though eight of the 10 expected
opening-day starters, including the DH, were products of their
draft.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a current running through yet another season of
Dodgers underachievement that belies the
``we'll-be-fine-once-we-get-to-know-each-other'' attitude and begs
for a few guys who knew each other back in Great Falls.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like just another round of baseball's lost
innocence, but it is more than just romantic babble. It's good
business. The theory of building through the farm system, then
supplementing with a trade or free agent is as true now as it was
when the Dodgers got Dusty Baker and Pedro Guerrero by trades in
the '70s and signed Kirk Gibson in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers not only are a team filled with holes, they
are shackled with huge contracts that have many years to run.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question the Dodgers would love to have some
prospects in their minor-league system, but it's not what you
think. Players like Paul Konerko and Wilton Guerrero were prospects
_ but more importantly, they were the currency for future deals.
</P>
<P>
   It's less important that Albuquerque win the Pacific Coast
League than it used to be. The more young players you stockpile,
the more you have to offer for Curt Schilling or Kevin Appier at
the July 31 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers got Carlos Perez and Mark Grudzielanek from
Montreal last July, they gave up Guerrero, left-hander Ted Lilly,
Chatsworth's Jonathan Tucker and top outfield prospect Peter
Bergeron. New GM Kevin Malone certainly wouldn't mind having those
players back, if only to make more deals.
</P>
<P>
   Small-market teams want your prospects and the big guys are
willing to give them up to put them over the top. In the new
system, the sad thing isn't that Konerko didn't pan out, but that
the team didn't trade him to Florida for Brown in the winter of '97
when they had the chance. &QL;

ANTLEY POUNDS HOME THIS WEIGHTY ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ When Chris Antley, the once and future Kentucky
Derby winner, returned to the races at Santa Anita in February, his
year-long battle with the jockeys-room scale wasn't over.
</P>
<P>
   Though Antley had shed most of the 30 pounds of fat he bore at
the depth of his despair, he still had to strain to get down to 118
on his first day back. On a few afternoons as late as April he
weighed out at 121, forcing his horses to carry as much as seven
pounds over their assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Big problem, right? You'd expect so, especially if you bought
all of those old-school notions about the effect a couple of pounds
of spare baggage have on a racehorse.
</P>
<P>
   But not really. The talented Antley was hired by reputable
trainers who didn't seem to mind the unofficial handicap, and
what's more, he won his share.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still had faith in me,'' said a magnanimous Antley, who
will ride Charismatic in pursuit of the Triple Crown in the Belmont
Stakes on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the weight) didn't matter, because Chris was just riding
unconscious,'' said his friend and rival Gary Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another explanation for Antley's success on the track in
the face of his struggle at the scales last winter: An extra pound
here and there makes little difference to a 1,000-pound horse.
</P>
<P>
   At least, nowhere near the painful difference the same pound can
make to a jockey trying to lose it.
</P>
<P>
   If the lords of thoroughbred racing want to recognize Antley's
1998 ordeal and his amazing '99 comeback, they'll use it as a cue
to relax their death grip on tradition and allow riders to weigh
more.
</P>
<P>
   The human race is getting bigger by the decade. Why not let
jockeys join the party?
</P>
<P>
   The weight a horse carries is assigned in a variety of ways:
according to a chart (the ``scale of weights'') that takes into
account its age and gender and the race's distance and time of
year; according to race conditions made up specially by track
executives; or, in the case of ``handicap'' races, by a track exec
attempting to even up the competition.
</P>
<P>
   If a jockey weighs less than the assignment, lead is added to
the horse's saddle.
</P>
<P>
   A champion handicap horse might have to carry 130 pounds. The
male 3-year-olds in the Triple Crown races all carry 126; fillies
carry 121. The highest any horse was assigned at Hollywood Park on
Saturday was 122. The lowest was 108; because that gelding's
jockey, Alex Solis, weighs 115, the horse had to carry seven pounds
of ``overweight.''
</P>
<P>
   It's in the middle area _ where jockeys must continually slim
down to 114 or so _ that the problems occur.
</P>
<P>
   Antley, who has had his own brushes with drugs, has seen rivals
abuse diet pills in order to ``make weight.'' He has seen them try
dangerous diets that damage their bodies. He has seen old jockeys
whose teeth have rotted away after years of self-induced vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Antley has known the feeling of getting out of a steam box,
riding a race, and not being able to stop the sweating because his
body is in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game's not supposed to be that cruel,'' Antley said this
week at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   On a less human level, American racing suffers when gifted young
athletes must pass up careers as jockeys because they can't
maintain riding weights, and when veteran stars leave to ride in
Europe under more lenient rules.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, a Southern California leader for 15 years, begins
riding in his wife's native England next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (weight) is definitely a big factor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who has been riding at 116 here, has told English
horsemen he'll never be less than 118 there, and will usually be
124 or 125.
</P>
<P>
   When Stevens rode in Hong Kong for three months in 1995, he rode
at 122. ``I felt 100 percent better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some stick-in-the-mud horsemen worry that an additional burden
will contribute to injuries for their animals. But there's no proof
that's true.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what about the benefits of having a healthy,
clear-thinking jockey aboard?
</P>
<P>
   ``One pound for a human being feels like one ounce to a horse,''
Antley said.
</P>
<P>
   About the weight of a bag of candy, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I carried a pack of M&AMP;Ms and went out and ran a mile and a
quarter, I think I'd make it back in about the same time (as
without the extra ounce),'' Antley said. ``Unless I stopped to eat
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, they haven't raised the scale of weights since
1920. In California, there are signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita raised the scale by a few pounds for its recent
winter season, so that in 90 percent of the races, the lowest
weight jockeys would have to make was 118. Del Mar also has
loosened the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's an awakening to what the jockeys have to go
through,'' Santa Anita and Del Mar racing secretary Tom Knust said
of the attitudes among owners and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the scale won't solve the problem. You could let jockeys
carry 150, and the natural 155-pounders would be in the sweatbox,
torturing their bodies for the sake of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   But a little bit would help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the whole scale goes up, nobody's losing and gaining,''
Antley said, ``except maybe in the length of a rider's life.'' &QL;

TEXAS TAX RELIEF PLAN: SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE, BUT JUST A LITTLE
FOR MOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN W. GONZALEZ &QL; 
and POLLY ROSS HUGHES &QL; 
Houston Chronicle Austin Bureau
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A plan unveiled Saturday that grants $506
million in tax relief to consumers and businesses has something in
it for almost everyone, though the bottom line may be merely pocket
change for typical Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Spread among the state's 19 million residents, the relief would
average about $26 per person if the breaks were available to
everyone. Only the proposed sales tax exemptions for Internet
access and over-the-counter medicines and a brief sales tax holiday
on clothing and footwear would keep money in the pockets of average
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, supporters of the compromise said the pact would help
all Texans by easing the tax burden on businesses. Plans call for
granting tax credits to businesses that create jobs, conduct
research and development, process agricultural products or invest
in businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about this piece of legislation. It's
really good for Texas and it sets us up for the next decade,'' said
House Ways and Means Chairman Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate negotiator said the bill should be a boon to small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased about the small business franchise tax
cuts,'' said Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay. ``That one creates
a lot of jobs for the small mom-and-pop businesses. That is the
growth engine for our state.''
</P>
<P>
   The compromises embodied in Senate Bill 441 by Sen. Rodney
Ellis, D-Houston, face final votes in the House and Senate today.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the agreement _ at least in terms of dollars _
fairly divides the projected tax-break benefits between businesses
and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers could see $277 million worth of tax cuts while
businesses would gain about $229 million. Here are key features of
the tax-relief plan:
</P>
<P>
   Beginning April 1, 2000, over-the-counter medicine would be
permanently exempted from sales taxes. State fiscal experts
estimate the provision would reduce state sales tax collections by
$161.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also after April 1, a total of three sales tax ``holidays''
would be authorized per year on items priced below $100. This tax
break started out as an attempt to lower costs for back-to-school
shopping; instead, lawmakers left it open to all shoppers, for a
potential consumer savings of $69.3 million in sales tax. The dates
for the holidays have not been set.
</P>
<P>
   The first $25 per month spent on Internet access would be exempt
from sales taxes, a $46.3 million savings.
</P>
<P>
   For businesses, the biggest break _ worth $85.4 million _ would
go to small-income operations. Franchise tax exemptions would be
extended to corporations with gross receipts of less than $150,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   A tax credit for research and development was worth $64.7
million, with special enhancements for ``strategic investment
areas,'' including the Mexico border. Also, credits for investment
and job creation would add another $68 million to the tally.
</P>
<P>
   A tax credit for businesses that provide day care for employees'
children was valued at $3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate adjourned until 2 p.m. today, with
both chambers facing midnight deadlines to approve negotiated
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Any bill taken up in the final hours could easily be killed by
extended debate, along with any other bills waiting for
concurrence. The session ends at midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the measures still alive Saturday, House Bill 3325 by
Democratic Rep. Pete Gallego of Alpine, would set 80 mph as the
speed limit on rural stretches of certain east-west interstates.
</P>
<P>
   It would also let speed limits rise to 75 mph on many other
Texas highways, ranch roads and farm-to-market roads. The bill
awaited finishing touches by conferees.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Madla, D-San Antonio, said the bill hit a speed bump
because of a related dispute over House Bill 676, which was sent to
Gov. George W. Bush on Saturday for his signature or veto. The
measure would allow semi-trailer trucks to drive as fast as cars,
currently 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some concern about allowing big 18-wheelers to go
80,'' Madla said.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Saturday, lawmakers approved a bill making an extra $100
million available to state university students with the greatest
financial need.
</P>
<P>
   A provision was added to allow U.S. Army Spc. Steven Gonzales to
qualify for a grant as a former prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, a former student at Texas A&AMP;M University, is the
Huntsville man who was held captive by Serbs for more than a month.
On a final vote of 142-2, House Bill 713 by Rep. Henry Cuellar, was
sent to the governor for his signature.

BILL REFORMING HOW TEXAS CITIES EXPAND EXPECTED TO PASS 
 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Residents in Kingwood and Clear Lake won't get a
vote on disannexing from Houston after all, but House and Senate
lawmakers said Saturday they hope city officials got the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the entire bill sends a lesson to the city,'' said
Sen. Jon Lindsay, R-Houston. ``I think it's a very good bill and I
think we need these provisions, such as requiring a long-range
plan, and I think it will eliminate some of these arguments we
have, in Houston especially.''
</P>
<P>
   A final version of Senate Bill 89, a comprehensive rewrite of
cities' annexation powers and responsibilities, is expected to win
passage from lawmakers by the close of the 76th Legislature on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate conference committee members worked out the
final version of the bill Saturday, and stripped an amendment added
last week in the House authorizing voters in Kingwood, Clear Lake
and other areas to disannex from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Although not unexpected, even lawmakers who supported the
amendment said they were surprised it progressed as far as it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you just have to make a statement,'' said Rep.
Jessica Farrar, D-Houston, and chair of the local delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Farrar was among 30 House lawmakers who supported the
disannexation amendment. Unlike the Republican bloc that
consistently opposes the city's annexation policies, the 30 votes
on the amendment included those from both parties representing
areas throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Orlando Sanchez, who chairs the city's
Legislative Affairs Committee, said he supports the final bill and
the reforms it embraces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this session has been used as a sort of
message-sending venue, and that is that the areas outside the city
are not happy with annexation,'' Sanchez said. ``We've gotten the
message, and I think with this bill there will be some relief for
the people out in the rural communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the bill seeks to correct inherent imbalances that
favor cities in the annexation process, in part by empowering
residents to negotiate aspects of annexation through arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill imposes numerous new requirements on cities'
procedural handling of annexation, it would not restrict their
ability to annex.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Bosse, D-Houston, sponsor of the bill in the House and
a member of the conference committee that resolved the final
version, said he is satisfied with the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of compromises made, and I don't think
anybody got everything they wanted out of the bill,'' Bosse said.
``But I think we've got a very progressive piece of annexation
legislation, and set the road map for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes a series of new checks and balances in
annexation procedures aimed at protecting the interests of
residents while still allowing cities to expand their boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, cities would be required to publicly maintain
long-term annexation plans. Specifically, outlining three years in
advance its plans for annexing territory.
</P>
<P>
   Cities would have 2{ years to begin providing full municipal
services to an annexed area, instead of the current 4{ years. More
time could be granted by mutual agreement of the city and targeted
area.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous safeguards are included to protect residents' services
after annexation, including a preannexation inventory to determine
the extent and quality of services in their community.
</P>
<P>
   A provision of the bill specific to Houston would require the
city to provide services in an annexed area comparable to what was
in place prior to annexation. Following the city's annexation of
Kingwood in 1996, many residents complained the quality of their
services declined.
</P>
<P>
   The city also would be prohibited from imposing any fees in an
annexed area that are also not imposed on city residents.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would allow strategic partnership agreements in
lieu of annexation, but stipulates such an agreement would have to
provide equitable benefits to both sides _ rather than just a
mechanism to avoid annexation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also provides many more requirements for public notice
and public hearing, including supplying notice to a home buyer of
the potential for annexation and posting of the three-year
annexation plan on a city's Internet Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Although the inclusion of arbitration in the bill is aimed at
giving residents in targeted areas more voice in ensuring their
future quality of life, some concern still exists that arbitration
could be abused by opponents to intentionally slow the process.
</P>
<P>
   Still, backers said there are sufficient protections to provide
that future annexations do not replicate situations like
Bordersville, an area near Humble and the Bush Intercontinental
Airport that lacked adequate services years after it was annexed by
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the bill contend it does not go far enough, and short
of allowing residents in targeted areas to vote, the bill still
gives the major advantage to cities in the annexation process.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kyle Janek, R-Houston, was among those who voted to allow
Kingwood and Clear Lake to disannex by referendum. Janek said he
has been frustrated by the city's ``heavy-handed'' tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Janek said city officials should not be able to annex an area
just for the revenue benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my feeling they shouldn't cherry-pick, they should go for
large areas and take the good with the bad,'' Janek said.
</P>
<P>
   Farrar echoed his concern, saying Houston's future annexation
efforts should target areas that need services, rather than areas
such as Kingwood that offer additional tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Farrar and others also cited concern about successive
annexations of affluent, Anglo communities by the city of Houston
and the effect it could have on minority voting strength.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, Senate Bill 89 will be the most complete overhaul
of statewide annexation policy in 36 years.

SABRES' SUDDEN SURGE LEAVES LEAFS ON THE BRINK  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Pat Quinn, coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs,
worried before the Eastern Conference finals about how his team
would respond to its lofty status. After failing to make the
playoffs for two consecutive seasons, the Leafs had reached the
third round and felt good about themselves. But they had to face
the Buffalo Sabres, who lost last year in this round and vowed that
they had learned from their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Those foreshadowings seemed to be borne out Saturday night as
the Sabres took control of the series with a 5-2 victory at Marine
Midland Arena. Buffalo leads this series by three games to one, and
another victory will put the Sabres in the Stanley Cup finals for
the first time since 1975, when they lost to the Philadelphia
Flyers. Game 5 of the four-of-seven-game series will be Monday
night in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will meet either the Colorado Avalanche or the Dallas
Stars for the championship. Their Western Conference series, tied
at two victories each, will resume Sunday afternoon in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres got two goals from Geoff Sanderson and one each from
Dixon Ward, Brian Holzinger and Rob Ray. Dominik Hasek, Buffalo's
healthy-again goalie, stopped 31 of 33 shots, losing his shutout
early in the third period when Mats Sundin scored on a penalty
shot. Sundin also scored on a power play with 1 minute 57 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But the Leafs, who played respectably in the first three games,
performed terribly Saturday night, embarrassing themselves with
unforced errors and unprovoked penalties. Toronto goalie Curtis
Joseph was replaced by Glenn Healy after two periods with Buffalo
leading by 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's game was played in a raucous atmosphere, with
about a quarter of the fans cheering for the visiting Maple Leafs.
On a warm evening on a holiday weekend, spectators began arriving
several hours before the opening face-off, roaming the downtown
streets dressed in the sweaters of both teams and holding parties
in the parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   The cities are about two hours apart by car, and some Toronto
fans brought their national flag, waving it and singing their
national anthem on the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Although they share a peaceful border, Canada and the United
States are two nations separated by a common language, the odd
referendum in Quebec notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek was back in Buffalo's goal for the second consecutive game
after missing the first two games of the series with a groin
injury. He did not have much to do early as the Sabres took the
first eight shots and the Leafs did little right.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Tie Domi took an unprovoked obstruction penalty for a
run at Ray, Buffalo's veteran ruffian, and another Toronto penalty,
to Kevyn Adams, overlapped it by 19 seconds when he interfered with
Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hasek did a similar thing to Mike Johnson and got
penalized, it did not matter. During the Toronto power play, Hasek
got one of the assists when Ward put the Sabres up by 1-0 on a
short-handed goal. Ward chased down a loose puck at the Toronto
blue line and blasted a slap shot from the right-wing circle past
Joseph on the glove side.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs continued to damage themselves, next with a roughing
penalty to Steve Thomas with 68 seconds left in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the period, when Garry Valk of the Leafs had his
stick on the puck, all alone in the Buffalo zone after a Sabres
turnover, he fell down, for no apparent reason. The Leafs were
lucky to be trailing by only 1-0 at the first intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto was ready to leave via Queen Elizabeth Way when it gave
up three goals in the first six minutes of the second period,
leaving the Sabres with a 4-0 lead and a 20-8 edge in shots.
</P>
<P>
   A Leafs turnover helped set up Holzinger's unassisted goal at
2:51. Ray, whose previous playoff goal came five years ago, made it
3-0 at 5:04 by turning in a shot while parked in front of the net
alongside the stationary Aleksandr Karpovtsev. Sanderson made it
4-0 just 22 seconds later, off the rush. Sanderson got his second
goal of the game at 14:10 during a Toronto turnover festival.
</P>
<P>
   With the red light flashing behind Joseph, Leafs defenseman
Bryan Berard rose from his knees, skated to the net and swung his
stick over the crossbar, breaking the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 seconds left in the period, Toronto's Thomas tried to
knock Rhett Warrener into the boards in front of the Buffalo bench.
He missed and rammed his own head into the wall, lying there dazed
until a trainer went to treat him. The period ended with Domi
trying to start a fight with Ray, and Ray ignoring him. &QL;

WAKE UP AND SMELL THE VERDICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Huh? Whaa? Oh, sorry, I musta nodded
off. I was having a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   I dreamed I was in a room at the Maricopa County courthouse
while a guy who stabbed his wife 44 times, dumped her body in the
family pool, then hid the evidence tried to convince a jury to let
him off because he was sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   In my dream the defendant, Scott Falater, hires a high-priced
mouthpiece to pitch this Wes Craven fairy tale to 15 helpless souls
in the jury box, hoping they'll release him.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Michael Kimerer, tells jurors that Scott is a loving
husband and good father who'd never do such a horrible thing on
purpose, and therefore the only possible explanation is that
Falater dispatched his wife while he was catching 40 winks.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in this case, 44.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that Yarmila Falater may have interrupted her
husband while he was in a somnambulistic trance and, his lawyer
said, ``He immediately went into a rage, a total frenzy, and
stabbed her 44 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Without waking up.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while continuing his visit to the land of nod, Falater
managed to locate a pair of gloves, put them on, drag his wife's
body over to the family pool, roll her in and hold her head under
water.
</P>
<P>
   And even that didn't interrupt his homicidal siesta.
</P>
<P>
   He then packed the knife, bloody clothes and more into a plastic
container, carefully wrapped it in a garbage bag and hid it in the
wheel well of his Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor then saw him walking around the house, and watched
him wash his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The defense attorney says Falater was under stress at work, and
was bothered as well because his pool pump was broken. He says his
client walked in his sleep to the pump, picked up the knife and
probably was startled by Yarmila. &QL; 
EXPERTS CAN EXPLAIN IT
</P>
<P>
   He's planning to bring in experts who'll testify that this
actually could have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this doesn't explain why his client didn't wake up as
his wife screamed for 30 minutes. The neighbors heard her. She had
self-defense wounds on her hands.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over and Falater supposedly learned what had
happened, his lawyer says he was ``devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes it difficult to explain why he showed so little
emotion during his taped police interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't asleep then, after all.
</P>
<P>
   An average guy waking up to find out that his beloved wife had
been brutally murdered might shed a tear or two.
</P>
<P>
   He might wail.
</P>
<P>
   He might collapse in sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Falater did none of this. &QL; 
TOSSED A SISTER
</P>
<P>
   Still, his lawyer says, he was sleepwalking. Supposedly, a
sister will testify that Falater tossed her across a room during a
sleepwalking episode 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What about recently?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if Falater had gotten into an altercation with a record
store clerk who didn't believe he was sleepwalking when he
purchased a John Tesh album, his story might be easier to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, why would a sleeping man hide evidence? Unless he did
so after he woke up, and panicked.
</P>
<P>
   But then, why would an innocent man hide evidence?
</P>
<P>
   Falater's own children, ages 15 and 17, didn't know about their
father's supposed problem until after their mother's death, until
he needed an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   The ``sleepwalking'' defense will get you on the front page of
the paper, on all the TV news shows and maybe even into the
monologue of some late night talk show. It's impossible to hold off
on the jokes, at least at first, at least until you peel away the
wackiness and find beneath it the remains of Yarmila Falater.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's not funny anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Then you imagine yourself as a juror being asked to let a man
walk away from the body of a woman with 44 knife wounds.
</P>
<P>
   And you hear yourself saying, ``In your dreams.'' &QL;

NO REAL DEALS IN EDUCATION SCHOOL BILL TALKS  
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While the two key negotiators on the $3.8
billion plan for funding public schools said they made ``good
progress on all fronts'' toward reaching an accord, no deal had
been struck by late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some concepts,'' said Republican Sen. Teel Bivins of
Amarillo. But he would not specify what concepts he and state Rep.
Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, finally agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether both sides had given a little bit, Bivins replied:
``Well, one side gave a helluva lot.''
</P>
<P>
   If House conferees were willing, Bivins planned to schedule the
first public meeting of the conference committee early today.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, House Democrats drew a line in the sand on
school finance, refusing to give up even $1 for education programs
for the sake of more tax breaks and threatening to block passage of
any plan that does.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators remained deadlocked over how to
settle major differences between the two chambers' proposed funding
of public schools contained in Senate Bill 4, despite phone calls
from and meetings with Gov. George W. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bivins &UR;  &LR; has refused to call a public meeting of the
conference committee, opting instead to carry on in secret all
negotiations about how to re-allocate the largest school funding
bill in history.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins and most Senate conferees have refused to specify even
what options are being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally opposed to taking money away from education
programs in order to fund additional tax cuts,'' said Rep. Kevin
Bailey, D-Houston. ``We have passed already in this session
significant tax cuts. The benefit to most Texans of those tax cuts
is very minuscule. However, the benefit to children with these
education programs is very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey is chairman of the liberal Legislative Study Group, one
of three House caucuses that said Friday they would not budge on
their educational spending plan. That $3.8 billion proposal would
give all teachers a $3,000 across-the-board raise, increase the
state's per-pupil funding and provide the basis for about $1
billion in local property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins, the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, had
proposed carving $250 million out of a $300 million plan the House
developed to create full-day kindergarten, pre-kindergarten, Head
Start and ninth-grade dropout prevention programs. The Senate
proposed using that $250 million to increase the overall tax cuts
granted this session to close to the $2.6 billion mark that Bush
set last year during his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said Education Commissioner Mike Moses had told senators
that the entire $300 million could not be spent on the new programs
in the next two-year budget period anyway because they are new and
could not be operating by Sept. 1, when the fiscal year starts.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville and head of the
House Mexican American Caucus, to respond: ``I've never met a
school district that couldn't spend all the money it was given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to take $1 away,'' said Rep. Sylvester
Turner, D-Houston. ``So from our vantage point this is a silly
discussion to be having at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in Texas. We're not in Iowa, we're right here in
Austin. We're going back to Houston, to the valley. We're going
back to San Antonio. We're going back to Beaumont. We're not going
to New Hampshire And the kids that we're fighting for are right
here in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   His comment was a jab at Bush, who is scheduled to head to Iowa
and New Hampshire, the first states to hold presidential nominating
contests, in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor says that, well, if we don't finish up our
business, he may call a special session,'' Turner added. ``Well,
governor, bring it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the choice is between fighting for our kids and their
education, and fighting for the tax breaks to business, that's a
fight well-taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, chairman of the House Public Education Committee, had
said earlier Friday that he countered Bivins' suggestion with one
shifting money between two different funding formulas, but he was
vague about the exact proposal. Negotiators spent a good part of
the day reviewing analyses of how that would affect districts.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said the Senate is committed to maintaining the balance it
believes it achieved in its finance proposal and wants to make
certain that any compromise treats all areas of the state and all
types of school districts the same.
</P>
<P>
   He chafed at the suggestion that the Senate was taking money
away from schoolchildren. Public education, Perry said, got 75
percent of the new money in the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a rather substantial commitment to the children in the
state of Texas,'' he said. ``Any hard number that `We've got to
have this amount of tax cut' is secondary to having those public
schools and those children's issues addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins had said earlier this week that if the Legislature could
not complete its work by noon Friday there would not be time to do
so before session's end on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in both chambers acknowledged Friday that while they
still hoped to reach a compromise, time was getting short.

SPURS OUTLAST TRAIL BLAZERS

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The last time these locals breathed such a sigh of
relief, Santa Anna had just pulled out of town and begun marching
toward Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting off several charges by the Portland Trail Blazers
yesterday at the Alamodome, the San Antonio Spurs finally escaped
with an 80-76 win in Game 1 of the Western Conference finals when
Rasheed Wallace's game-tying jumper bounced off the rim with about
five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to see a guy that's rolling like that get a shot like
that,'' Spurs center David Robinson said. ``We kind of held our
breath and were a little bit lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   In a predictably ugly game between two of the league's best
defenses, Wallace kept Portland close with a game-high 28 points,
most coming on low-post moves over first-team all-defensive forward
Tim Duncan. But with his team trailing 78-76 and Robinson onto him
for the first time all game, Wallace settled for a 20-foot,
left-wing jumper off a pick-and-pop with guard Greg Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was good,'' said Wallace, whose Blazers will try
to avoid falling into an 0-2 hole an Game 2 at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow.
``But what can I say, it came up short.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy: ``That's a high-percentage
shot for Rasheed. I'd put money on that every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the NBA's irregular season and rugged series, the
game was a walk-it-up eyesore that had the crowd of 35,165 yawning
at times. Time and again the Spurs would push the lead to seven or
nine points, only to have Wallace knock down consecutive baskets.
</P>
<P>
   He so abused Duncan that, on the game's key possession, Spurs
coach Gregg Popovich gambled and switched Robinson onto him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to give him a different look, maybe a little
more length to shoot over,'' Popovich said. ``Of course if that
shot goes in, I look like an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   Down by two, the Blazers actually had two chances to tie or take
the lead in the final minute. But Anthony, a late-game replacement
for Damon Stoudamire because of his experience, dribbled into a
24-second shot clock violation before audibling into the
pick-and-roll with Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Though Wallace had most of his success posting up, Anthony
sensed Robinson overplaying the post and called for his teammate to
set a pick on Spurs guard Avery Johnson. When Robinson briefly left
Wallace to help stop his baseline drive, Anthony whipped a
behind-the-back pass to an open Wallace. After the miss, Mario Elie
sealed San Antonio's eighth playoff win in nine games by sinking
two free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tit for tat the whole way,'' said Popovich, whose team
committed seven turnovers. ``Neither team did anything amazing to
the other. We just played our butts off and hung in there.''
</P>
<P>
   With fans toting corny homemade signs and the rested Spurs
taking advantage of Portland's hangover from a topless mosh-pit
celebration 48 hours earlier against Utah, San Antonio threatened
to blow the game open by jumping to a 15-4 lead. The volatile
Blazers almost imploded when center Arvydas Sabonis, unable to
guard Robinson, began yelling at teammates, and Wallace picked up a
technical arguing a correct goaltending call.
</P>
<P>
   But, steadied by Wallace and the Spurs' pathetic shooting,
Portland regrouped and produced a dramatic, if not thrilling
climax.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be any blowouts in this series,'' Robinson said.
``Both teams are just too good and too deep to let that happen.
It's going to be like this every game.''

JOHNSON'S PLANS TAKE A LEFT-HAND TURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson talked in spring
training about breaking up the right-handed bats in the lineup by
splicing in left-handers, but injuries and a lack of production
have severely hampered the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Todd Hollandsworth spent three weeks on the disabled list
and now has a strained rib cage, and switch-hitting Jose Vizcaino
is on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The only reliable left-handed bat belongs to pinch-hitter Dave
Hansen, and his role is too valuable to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is hoping the situation will right itself with the
current group of Dodgers. But if it doesn't, it could be time for
the Dodgers to shop for a left-handed bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things need to be tweaked,'' Johnson said of his current
crop of players before Saturday's game against Atlanta.
``Offensively, we've not jelled like I would have liked to.
Situationally, we need to be better. I'd still like to get a little
more balance in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we don't need more balance in the lineup, but I don't
know of any team in the past that was all right-handers and won (a
championship).''
</P>
<P>
   Switch-hitting Devon White leads off, followed by righties Eric
Young, Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi. When switch-hitting Todd
Hundley catches, he usually bats fifth _ followed by another string
of three righties and the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers lefties are hitting .286 with 10 homers, but without
Hansen's 9-for-18 pinch-hitting expertise figured in, they're
hitting .275.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are White and Hundley, who are hitting .257 and
.254, respectively, from the left side. Hundley was supposed to be
the main source of power but has just five homers and 14 RBI. His
numbers are hampered by not playing much in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dodgers are 25-23 and trail Arizona by three games in
the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   But when Johnson was asked whether the Dodgers had enough talent
to reach the championship level management talked about early in
the season, he said: ``I hope so. For (the players') sake and a lot
of other good people's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the consensus is the Dodgers panicked and fired
pitching coach Charlie Hough after starting the season below
expectations, Johnson said he remains calm and patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not panicked about this team and I'm not discouraged about
this team,'' he said. ``A few injuries have made it tougher. I
haven't gotten the number of quality starts I thought we'd have,
but I think they will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino return delayed: One thing Johnson misses is the
versatility offered by Vizcaino, who's been on the disabled list
since May 19 (retroactive to May 17) with a hamstring strain.
Vizcaino was hoping to join the Dodgers in Pittsburgh and be
activated Tuesday, but Johnson said that is no longer the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Vizcaino is still having trouble swinging from the
right side and is only jogging.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't make the trip to Pittsburgh,'' Johnson said. ``It's
looking more like Friday (against the Angels). He has to have
better days running.''
</P>
<P>
   Home cookin': The Dodgers' trip to Atlanta allows pitcher Kevin
Brown to stay at his Macon, Ga., home _ about 70 minutes from
Turner Field _ and spend time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a chance to see my son's graduation (Friday),'' Brown
said of 8-year-old Ridge's ceremony upon finishing second grade.
``It's nice. It's great to be there for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown planned to attend his son's baseball game Saturday before
his family joined him at Turner Field for the Dodgers-Braves game.
Brown faces Braves right-hander Greg Maddux in the finale of a
three-game series today.

STARS CAN ERASE GHOSTS OF FRUSTRATIONS PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Mavericks' last honest boogie in the NBA playoffs
came 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rangers' most recent postseason showing in Arlington,
they neglected to score a run.
</P>
<P>
   Think back. How long has it been since a truly meaningful and
memorable postseason game _ not involving Nate Newton _ has been
played in our metropolitan area?
</P>
<P>
   Too long.
</P>
<P>
   But today on a frozen slab of ice, where Derek Harper once
misread the scoreboard and let the clock run out against the
Lakers, the Stars will try to wake up the Reunion Arena echoes and
make some memories.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 of their NHL Western Conference finals series with the
Colorado Avalanche is fraught with intrigue and possibilities. Win,
and Fort Worth-Dallas fans are on the threshold of their first
Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Lose, and it's Harper running out the clock all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Cowboys, perennial NFL postseason performers that they
once were, have played only two Super Bowl-or-bust football games
at Texas Stadium since 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Think back. The Mavericks were the hottest thing going in town
in the mid-1980s. But on May 6, 1984, with a chance to knot the
Mavs' conference semifinal series at two apiece, the rookie Harper
thought the game was over and that the home team had won by one.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks ended up losing in overtime, 122-115, and the
Lakers whisked them from the playoffs two nights later in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think the ghosts haven't left the premises since.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, lest we forget, have never won a postseason game in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Memorial Day weekend. The local hockey team's Stanley
Cup chances have never shined brighter. The stage is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be a day to remember, or just another one to forget?
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom would tell you that the Stars have the upper
hand by being able to host two of the would-be final three games of
this series. But home ice has been anything but sacred to both the
Stars and the Avs.
</P>
<P>
   In front of a well-behaved and only sporadically boisterous
crowd in Denver's McNichols Sports Arena, the Stars never appeared
uncomfortable, even goaltender Ed Belfour when Avs faithful were
chanting his name.
</P>
<P>
   But recent history suggests that when the Avs pack a suitcase,
they bring along no fears.
</P>
<P>
   Think back. The last time that the NBA Mavericks won a playoff
game at home was June 2, 1988. The Cowboys last won one 2 1/2 years
ago. The Rangers have never won one.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. In the summer of 1987 at Reunion, the Dallas Sidekicks won
a memorable Game 6 to force a seventh and deciding game in the
Major Indoor Soccer League finals.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Preki and Steve Zungul? I didn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, it's been a long, dry decade, as far as
home-court, home-ice, home-field playoff memories are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars thought they were going to have one almost exactly one
year ago _ a Game 5, Western Conference finals, at Reunion Arena.
They won, even. But they had already effectively dug their graves
in the previous two games at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5, as it turned out, was fun, but quickly forgotten in the
din of Joe Louis Arena.
</P>
<P>
   It would likely be accurate, if unfair, to suggest that the
Stars have never played a home game with such consequence _ and I'm
talking about the Stanley Cup possibilities. It's important,
because the Stars need to feed the bandwagon. It's growing . . . in
some ways, still learning . . . and the Stars are on the verge of
finally marking their territory, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   They have the front page to themselves. The whole holiday picnic
table. In the throes of a playoff fever like this, a lifetime fan
can be made.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, you wonder. Have the Mavericks put an eternal spell on the
place? On Memorial Day weekend, will the Stars go crashing into the
wall?
</P>
<P>
   They shouldn't. The Stars' defensive persistence, coupled with
Ed Belfour's magic touch, make them still the favorites to survive
today and, in time, this series.
</P>
<P>
   But think back. How many memorable home playoff ticket stubs do
you have in your collection?
</P>
<P>
   I thought so. Shoot, Derek Harper, shoot.

GUN SHOW NEXT TO GRADUATION EXERCISES DRAWS COMPLAINTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK DOUGLAS JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ It was an unusual mix Saturday at the Fort
Worth Convention Center: graduating high school seniors in the west
wing, gun dealers in the east wing.
</P>
<P>
   As crowds streamed in, some carried caps and gowns into the
commencement hall and others toted unloaded pistols, rifles and
assault weapons into the gun show nearby.
</P>
<P>
   And in the wake of the shooting massacre at Columbine High
School in Colorado, not everyone was pleased that the city of Fort
Worth had booked a gun show next to graduation ceremonies for
Boswell High School during the day and Granbury High School in the
early evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's weird that, after all the shootings (at schools),
there's a gun show going on right next door to where we're
graduating,'' said Granbury senior Dedra Benitez, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall at the gun show, vendor Dave Lee said the students
and their ``soccer moms'' should not be upset. ``I have my rights,
too, and I don't think I've done anything wrong,'' Lee said as he
sat behind a table full of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth Mayor Kenneth Barr said Saturday night that he did
not know that a gun show had been booked into the same building as
school graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, ``I raised the issue several weeks ago that I
was not totally comfortable with leasing our facilities for gun
shows, and I continue to have my reservations about that.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 20, two students killed 12 schoolmates, a teacher, and
then themselves at Columbine High School in a Denver suburb. At
least some of the guns used in the rampage had been purchased at a
gun show in Denver, sparking a national debate on whether easy
access to weapons at such shows is partly to blame for a spate of
deadly school shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the attack at Columbine, the Senate passed a bill
requiring background checks on everyone who buys a firearm at a gun
show. The House is scheduled to take up a similar bill in June.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth school district officials have stepped up security
and used metal detectors at this year's commencement ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention center Saturday, Kay Hague of Granbury said
she walked through a door expecting to find directions on how to
get to her son's graduation. Instead, Hague said, she saw a burly
policeman standing next to a large sign that read: GUN SHOW.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of shocking. I was taken aback,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Mekalip of Tyler said she was not happy that assault
weapons were being sold close to where her niece, a Granbury
senior, was about to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of unsettling to know that someone can get a gun
over there and come over here. They shouldn't be side by side. It's
inappropriate timing,'' Mekalip said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a table covered with black-steel Glock pistols,
dealer T.R. Graham said concerns about the gun show were ``very
much unfounded'' and caused by ``ignorance brought about by media
hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Norman, coordinator of the gun show, said that, for the past
five years, he has held such events at the convention center
alongside high school commencement ceremonies. Until Saturday,
Norman said, nobody complained.
</P>
<P>
   He said he cannot help it ``if people are making something out
of this because of Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said he also moved his show a little farther from the
main entrance to the graduation ceremonies ``so those kids could
not look through the glass doors and see the guns.''

USC DEFEATS PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They turned people away from Dedeaux Field before
the most important USC baseball home game in eight years Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the intrepid souls weren't denied when the stadium
reached capacity; they went atop a three-story parking garage
beyond the right field fence to watch the Trojans beat Pepperdine
5-3 in a thriller. Those fans got high marks for their creativity,
but it was the 2,384 in the grandstand who get partial credit for
USC's win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the biggest crowd all year and definitely the
most intense,'' said Justin Gemoll, USC's first baseman who drew a
bases-loaded walk in the eighth inning with USC fans standing and
cheering. ``Especially in that at-bat, (the crowd) gets inside the
pitcher's head a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   USC, the defending national champion, needs to win only one of
two games played today in the double-elimination tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The standing-room-only crowd, USC's largest since the Trojans
played Pepperdine in the 1991 regional, was energetic throughout
the game, but especially in the crucial eighth. That's when the
Trojans (35-23) took a 4-3 lead on Gemoll's walk from Pepperdine
reliever Richard Sundstrom.
</P>
<P>
   Sundstrom also walked the next batter, Greg Hanoian, and the
Trojans fans cheered every pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge help to have a crowd behind you like that,'' USC
catcher Eric Munson said. ``I'm definitely grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   So was USC left-hander Barry Zito, the Pac-10 pitcher of the
year who gave up two runs and five hits in the first two innings.
Zito (12-2) settled down in the middle innings and was given a
standing ovation after retiring the side in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our crowd really helped me,'' said Zito, who has won 11
consecutive games. ``(The fans) really got behind me. They were a
huge advantage for our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito tried to stay loose in the bottom of the eighth when USC's
rally reached the 30-minute mark. The Waves used three pitchers in
the inning, and they issued four walks.
</P>
<P>
   Zito walked Austin Evans with one out in the ninth and was
replaced by Steve Smyth, who got Woody Cliffords to hit into a
game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine coach Frank Sanchez didn't use All-American closer
Jay Gehrke in the eighth. Gehrke, who has 18 saves and a 0.62 ERA,
stood in the bullpen as the rowdy crowd rattled Dave Reed, who
walked one and gave up a hit, and Sundstrom, who didn't get an out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to get outs,'' Sanchez said. ``Unfortunately, a
couple of our guys, who have been clutch all year, at that point
struggled. We were just trying to put out the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Waves (44-15) played their second consecutive game without
starting shortstop Tony Garcia, who pulled a hamstring in practice
Thursday. Garcia is hitting .320 with 10 home runs.

WALLACE HAD A LOOK, BUT SPURS SEE A 1-0 LEAD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ There were seven seconds left in the opening game
of the Western Conference final Saturday night, and the San Antonio
Spurs were ahead by 2 points. But David Robinson, the Spurs'
center, was afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, having slid away from his man to help out a teammate,
was near the baseline, and Portland's Rasheed Wallace, the hottest
player in the Alamodome, was alone inside the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had torched the Spurs and their formidable frontcourt
all night, scoring 28 points on jumpers, hook shots and wicked,
jaw-dropping dunks. Now he was 20 feet away from the basket,
releasing a jump shot with picture-perfect form.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson knew the chances of Wallace hitting it were great.
``Boy, when a guy is rolling like that you hate to see him get a
look at the basket like he did,'' Robinson said. ``But we were
lucky that it went off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, who capped their 80-76 victory over the Trail Blazers
with two free throws by Mario Elie, might have been lucky near the
end, but their victory was not a result of chance. It was the
fourth time in five meetings this season that the Spurs outlasted
Portland in the final moments. This one gave them Game 1 in the
four-of-seven-game series. Game 2 is Monday afternoon. ``As one
might expect, it was a war,'' Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich said.
``Neither team dominated the other. We just went after each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wallace, Robinson and Tim Duncan, the Spurs' candidate for
the most valuable player award, scoring more than anyone else, the
best battles were waged near the basket. Duncan, who entered the
game having outdone Shaquille O'Neal in San Antonio's four-game
sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, quickly took a back seat to
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-11-inch Wallace, who came off the bench for most of
the season before becoming a starter in the playoffs, scored 8
points in each of the first three quarters, then hit two 9-footers
in the final three minutes to chop 4-point deficits in half.
Duncan, a first-team all-league defender, had no answer for
Wallace. ``He's a monster,'' Popovich said of Wallace. ``With that
size, strength, quickness and touch, he's a handful. He's a great,
great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, it looked as if Wallace's notable temper would spare
the Spurs. Three minutes into the game, he was whistled for a
technical foul after arguing a call. The Blazers were playing
terribly, having already committed two turnovers. But Wallace's
outburst lifted his teammates, and soon thereafter Portland went on
a 13-3 run to cut an 11-point deficit to 1, 18-17.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs were never separated by as much as 10 points the rest
of the way. Duncan, bridled by the physical defense of Brian Grant,
who got plenty of help from his teammates, started slowly. He had
just 7 points and four rebounds at halftime, but with Robinson and
Sean Elliott scoring 10 points apiece, the Spurs took a 39-38 lead
into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Portland's quick traps and athleticism had bothered Duncan in
previous meetings _ they held him to 13 points in the team's last
regular-season game _ but he solved their defense in the second
half to match Robinson with 21 points. He also grabbed a game-high
13 rebounds and blocked 5 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive layups by Duncan followed by a 15-footer by point
guard Avery Johnson put San Antonio ahead by 69-60 midway through
the final quarter. But the Blazers rallied again. Two backups, Greg
Anthony and Walt Williams, were the catalysts, combining for 10
points, including 6 on 3-pointers, to move the Blazers to within 3
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs increased the lead to 4 points twice, but each time
Wallace answered with short jumpers, the last of which cut San
Antonio's lead to 78-76 with 1 minute 40 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After both teams committed turnovers, Portland ended up with the
ball and a chance to tie or go ahead with 20 seconds remaining.
Mike Dunleavy, the Blazers' coach, made the easy decision to run a
two-man game between Wallace and Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   When Anthony drove to the baseline, drawing Robinson away from
Wallace, the Blazers got the shot they wanted. ``I thought it was
good,'' Wallace said. ``The minute it left my hand, I thought it
was good. Unfortunately, it came up short.''

JEROME L. GREENE, 93, WIDE-RANGING PHILANTHROPIST  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jerome L. Greene, a lawyer, real estate investor and
benefactor of Columbia Law School, Montefiore Medical Center and
the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, died on Thursday at his
residence in the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who was a founding member of the Manhattan law firm
Marshall, Bratter, Greene, Allison &AMP; Tucker, was a noted benefactor
of Columbia Law School, from which he graduated in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   A gift of more than $5 million from Greene this year enabled the
law school to complete renovations to its main building at West
116th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, as part of a $50 million
construction campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The building, Greene Hall, was named for Greene. The
renovations, scheduled for completion on Aug. 1, include the
creation of new faculty and administrative offices and a new
faculty library, lounge and conference rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was chairman of the board of the Hirshhorn Museum at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington and was a supporter of many
of New York's medical and cultural institutions. His gifts to
Montefiore Medical Center helped pay for the construction of the
Jerome L. and Dawn Greene Medical Arts Pavilion and the Children's
Hospital of Montefiore Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-story Medical Arts Pavilion in the Norwood section of
the Bronx is the centerpiece of Montefiore's ambulatory care
network. ``This is a hospital with a social conscience, caring for
the poor and the underprivileged,'' Greene said at dedication
ceremonies on Oct. 3, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His many philanthropic interests embraced the arts and included
the Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, Channel 13 and the
Juilliard School.
</P>
<P>
   ``His favorite composer was Mozart, so he underwrote the Mostly
Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center,'' his wife, Dawn Greene, said.
``He loved those concerts.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene was a a longtime resident of the Carlyle Hotel and a
principal owner. He and his wife also had homes in Greenwich,
Conn., and Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was a recipient of the Judge Learned G. Hand Human
Relations Award and a Doctor of Laws degree from Columbia Law
School and a Doctor of Humanities degree from the Juilliard School.
He also received the Citizens Committee's Oscar S. Straus Award for
Philanthropy on Behalf of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Patricia
Humphrey, of Concord, N.H.; a stepdaughter, Christina McInerney, of
Manhattan; and two grandchildren. Greene had another daughter,
Cynthia-Sue Greene, who is deceased.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held at Temple Emanu-El, on Fifth
Avenue at 65th Street, on June 15 at 4 p.m.

JOHN ADAMS, 85, EXPERT ON BRAIN DISORDERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Edwin Adams, a California neurosurgeon and pioneer in the
use of radioisotopes to study brain functions and their disorders,
died on May 18 at the medical center of the University of
California at San Francisco. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was the former Guggenheim Professor of Neurological
Surgery at the university. He gained an international reputation as
an expert on Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   He assembled an interdisciplinary team at the medical center to
treat such diseases, as well as intractable pain, with stereotactic
surgery, which focuses on specific groups of cells in deep-seated
brain structures that control specific functions.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, a descendant of the presidential Adams family, was born
in Berkeley, Calif., and graduated from the University of
California there in 1935. He received a master's degree at Harvard
University in 1939 and was training at Brigham and Children's
Hospital in Boston when war broke out.
</P>
<P>
   He served with the Marines in the Pacific as a battalion
surgeon. He was at Guadalcanal and aboard the first American ship
to enter Tokyo Harbor after the Japanese surrender.
</P>
<P>
   He resumed his training at the University of California at San
Francisco, joined the staff of the department of neurological
surgery in 1948 and rose to chairman in 1970. He retired from
teaching in 1984 but remained active as a researcher.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sally Patterson Adams, died in 1995 after 60 years of
marriage. He is survived by two daughters, Abigail A. Campbell, of
Woodside, Calif., and Susan A. Engs, of Reno; a son, Henry P., of
Camarillo, Calif.; a sister, Cornelia A. Lonnberg, of Noce, France;
8 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and

criticism from publishing houses.)

MOST TEXANS IN CONGRESS SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE ON GUN ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When talk in Congress turns to guns, most Texans
don't just shoot from the lip. They come to the debate armed with
plenty of hands-on experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a bunch of guns,'' said Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Rockwall,
whose well-stocked gun cabinet is fairly typical of the 30-member
House delegation from Texas. ``If I laid them all out, I could have
held off one corner of the Alamo.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``Star-Telegram'' survey of Texans in Congress found that at
least 21 of the 30 House members and both Texas senators own
firearms. Some own many.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan fondness for firepower highlights the
complexities of the gun control debate as the House prepares to
take up Senate-passed restrictions requiring safety locks on
weapons and background checks for all gun show sales. The House is
expected to vote on a gun control package in late June as part of a
bill aimed at curbing juvenile violence.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democratic Party leaders like to characterize the
debate as a fight against Republicans and the National Rifle
Association, the battle lines are not so clear-cut in congressional
districts where the most common form of gun control is a steady
hand and a sharp eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my area of East Texas, just about everybody owns some kind
of gun. It's just part of the culture, part of life,'' said Rep.
Jim Turner of Crockett, one of five Texas Democrats who received
NRA contributions in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition isn't restricted to rural areas. Three of the four
House members whose districts include portions of Tarrant County
own weapons
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in Texas has one, don't they?'' said Rep.
Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth, who keeps a pistol for self-protection
but does not accept NRA contributions.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving acknowledged that he
stretches the facts a bit when he tells audiences that if he ever
imitated President Clinton's personal behavior, he would find
himself looking up at his wife from a pool of blood while she
asked, ``How do I reload this thing?''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Armey said, his wife knows how to use her 20-gauge
shotgun, part of a family collection that includes a 12-gauge
shotgun, two rifles and a .45-caliber pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Ennis, whose district includes Arlington and
Northeast Tarrant County, owns a shotgun and a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know lots of people that keep loaded pistols and
semiautomatic weapons underneath their beds,'' Barton said. ``If
everybody kept a loaded gun in their house and knew how to use it,
we wouldn't be as violent a society.''
</P>
<P>
   The exception to the rule is Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas. But
Frost said he still has the medals he earned as an NRA marksman at
summer camp when he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of gun ownership among Texas lawmakers is even higher
than the rate among the voters they represent. A recent Texas poll
found that 53 percent of Texans have a gun in the house. Nearly a
third have more than one. The gun-owning tradition cuts across
racial, ethnic and gender lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up around pistols and rifles,'' said Rep. Charles
Gonzalez, D-San Antonio, whose father, former Rep. Henry B.
Gonzalez, had a habit of giving his sons .22-caliber rifles for
their 12th birthday. ``It's part of the Texas culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, said she sometimes joined
her father on his hunting trips as a girl, although she never
developed a fondness for guns.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who owns ``several shotguns and a
couple of handguns,'' has hunted doves with the state's senior
senator, Phil Gramm. ``I learned to shoot in summer camp. I was a
great shot,'' she said. ``I'm not as good now. Phil is a great
shot. I would be good if I did it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Houston, nephew of former Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, had some of his first experiences with guns at his
grandfather's South Texas ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather had probably five guns in his car because a
deer might come up or you might need to a shoot a snake or
something like that,'' he said. ``I grew up around guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Max Sandlin, D-Marshall, who estimated that he has 15
firearms, has started teaching his 4-year-old son how to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers' gun-related memories are not so pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-San Antonio, said he bought a .357-caliber
Magnum several years ago when his wife, a San Antonio TV
anchorwoman, was the target of threats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, took the same step when his
father, William Sessions, a former federal judge who later became
FBI director, was placed under 24-hour protection in the aftermath
of the 1979 assassination of U.S. District Judge John Wood of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my right, and I'm not going to tell you what I've
got,'' the Dallas congressman said. ``I am a gun owner and I do
carry.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sessions sometimes carries a gun for protection in his
Capitol Hill neighborhood, he said he never brings a weapon into
the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Barton saw the downside of the state's gun culture in one of his
previous jobs as manager of a printing plant in Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   His duties included dealing with a disgruntled, gun-wielding
employee; a jealous husband who came to the plant intending to
shoot his wife's boyfriend; and a woman who shot out the window of
her boyfriend's car _ with him inside _ in the plant parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Two Texas Democrats, Silvestre Reyes of El Paso and Solomon
Ortiz of Corpus Christi, wore guns daily in their previous careers
in law enforcement. Reyes was a Border Patrol agent. Ortiz was a
sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I packed a gun for many years. You get used to it,'' Ortiz
said. ``Without it, you feel naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ciro Rodriguez, D-San Antonio, said he bought a shotgun
years ago after his home was burglarized twice. On the third time,
the burglar stole the shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, two of the most ardent defenders of the right to
bear arms do not own any guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once my right to own a gun is threatened, I'll buy one. That's
when it will be necessary,'' said Rep. Ron Paul, R-Surfside.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Houston, is also unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally am very afraid of guns,'' Archer said. ``I don't
trust myself with a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, whose district is in East Texas, is at the other extreme.
He has so many guns he has lost count. His collection includes a
double-barreled, pistol-grip shotgun that was once owned by outlaw
Cole Younger, an ally of Jesse James.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got guns all over. I'm sure I haven't told you about all
of them,'' Hall said, after ticking off a list of more than a dozen
shotguns, rifles and pistols. ``I've got three sons. It would
probably take me two weeks to collect all my guns from them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hall said he is troubled by the spread of handguns,
especially when they are used against children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit that handguns give me some concern,'' he said.
``There's really no good answer for a mother who's lost a son to a
gun. That's a tragedy that never ends.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite their strong support for gun ownership, most Texas
lawmakers say they are willing to consider new restrictions in the
aftermath of the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, voters in Southeast Texas tossed veteran Rep.
Jack Brooks out of office for support of the ban on assault
weapons. Despite that history, gun-owning Rep. Nick Lampson,
D-Beaumont, said he may support the Senate package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seriously concerned about what I see happening today that
didn't happen when I was young,'' Lampson said, referring to the
wave of school shootings. ``I think perhaps the whole country has
become more accepting of gun control.''
