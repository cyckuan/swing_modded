<HEADLINE> Palestinians: No Deal on Settlements  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A senior Palestinian negotiator has backtracked
on a major concession made during the U.S.-brokered Camp David
talks, and says his side is no longer willing to discuss ceding
some West Bank territory to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council,
rejected Israel's demand that most Jewish settlers be allowed to
remain in the West Bank, under Israeli sovereignty, concentrated in
large blocs of settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''These blocs would mean continuation of the Israeli occupation
of Palestinian land,'' he said in remarks broadcast on Palestinian
radio Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia also rejected Israel's insistence on retaining a strip of
land in the Jordan Valley for up to 20 years, for reasons of
security.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat insisted Sunday that Israel
must transfer control of all land it captured in 1967 -- including
the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem -- to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to give any inch or any grain of the sand of
our homeland and we are not going to give up our right to holy
Jerusalem,'' Arafat said in a statement released by the Palestinian
news service WAFA.
</P>
<P>
   At the Camp David talks in July, the Palestinians became the
first Arab negotiators to discuss ceding territory. Palestinian
negotiators said they were ready to give up the land in exchange
for land in Israel proper. Israelis confirmed that, but said the
amount of Israeli land would be only ''symbolic.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has also appeared to backtrack on some of its
breakthrough concessions at Camp David, including acknowledging the
refugee crisis created by its creation in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat insisted Sunday that Palestinian refugees will not accept
financial compensation but must be allowed to return to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who thinks that the matter of the Palestinian refugees
is the matter of some dollars, he is not thinking rationally,''
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians also say Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has
failed to implement long-standing interim agreements to release
prisoners and hand over more territory.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides remained divided on the future of Jerusalem, where
the Palestinians wish to establish their capital alongside that of
Israel. It was over Jerusalem that the Camp David summit broke
down.
</P>
<P>
   Qureia said Israel must recognize full Palestinian sovereignty
over all of east Jerusalem. ''After that Israeli interests can be
discussed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive issue is who will control the Al-Aqsa mosque
compound. It is the third holiest place in the Islamic world but is
also sacred to Jews because it is the site of the first and second
Jewish temples.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Sunday that Israel
will never give up sovereignty over the site. ''The principle which
guides Israel is that we came to the site of the temple never to be
separated from it, and never to give up sovereignty there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami was also suggesting Israel would not allow the return of
Palestinian refugees back to their homes in what is now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel does not and will not assume moral, legal or political
responsibility for any solution to the refugee problem,'' read a
speech Ben-Ami is to deliver this week to the U.N. General
Assembly, released by Israel's U.N. mission Sunday. ''It is a
ridiculous concept to think that it is possible to establish a
state in order to return the refugees to another neighboring
state.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Arafat, Nabil Abourdeneh, accused Israel on Sunday of
''going back to the game of wasting time'' in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American administration is unable to push things toward a
fair solution,'' Abourdeneh said.
</P>
<P>
   Talks have resumed, albeit at a low level. One round was held in
New York during the Millennium Summit, and another was launched
somewhere in the region Sunday evening, Palestinian officials said.
The talks will continue Monday and Ben-Ami will join them later in
the week, the Palestinian officials said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reflection of the deadlock, about 50 Palestinian
schoolchildren aged 10-13 pelted Israeli troops and police with
stones and empty bottles Sunday at the Netzarim junction in the
Gaza Strip. Police responded with tear gas and rubber-coated
bullets. Five children and one Israeli border policeman were
injured.

<HEADLINE> Cuba 13, Italy 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Orestes Kindelan drove in four runs and
Oscar Macias homered and stole home as undefeated Cuba overcame a
sluggish start and beat Italy 13-5.
</P>
<P>
   Italy (0-2) stunned the Cubans by scoring five runs in the top
of the third inning Monday (Sunday night EDT) for a 5-3 lead. But
Cuba (2-0) then pulled away by piling up homers on a wind-blown
field.
</P>
<P>
   Kindelan, one of Cuba's most accomplished players, started the
comeback with a run-scoring double and Macias singled home a run
that tied it at 5 in the bottom of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Yobal Duenas' two-run homer put Cuba ahead in the fourth, and
Kindelan's leadoff homer over the fence in center -- 400 feet away --
started a decisive six-run rally an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   Macias also had a solo homer to left during the rally, flipping
his bat high in the air as he headed out of the batter's box.
German Mesa added a two-run double, Luis Ulacia doubled home
another run and Duenas completed the rally with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Kindelan started Cuba's scoring with a two-run single in the
first inning. Macias took home on the back end of a double steal in
the second for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A day after three of their pitchers combined on a 16-0 no-hitter
over South Africa, the Cubans held Italy to six hits -- all singles,
all in the five-run third inning. Reliever Jose Ibar also threw a
wild pitch that let in a run, but got the win by going 5 2-3
innings.

Tropical Storm Drenches Florida
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CEDAR KEY, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Gordon plowed into Florida's Gulf
Coast on Sunday with winds just below hurricane strength, drenching rain and a
storm surge with waves over 6 feet high. Michael Loehr, operations chief for the
State Emergency Operations Center said there was some flooding in southwest
Florida, but no serious injuries had been reported. Wind gusts of 60 mph were
reported in this rustic fishing town about 100 miles north of Tampa as the storm
approached. Gordon's top sustained winds fell from 75 mph early Sunday to about
70 mph, just below the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton threw a lavish official dinner today for
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and as glasses clinked, the leaders
praised each other for forging a new friendship to replace the rocky
relationship between the two nations in recent years. In contrast to the cold
shoulder given last week to the military ruler of India's nuclear rival,
Pakistan, Clinton invited Vajpayee to a South Lawn Pavilion tent filled with
fall fruits and tables adorned with gold-base plates, cream china and gold

   IMJINGAK, South Korea (AP) -- In the latest sign of improving relations
between North and South Korea, workers began rebuilding a railway line across
the world's most heavily armed border on Monday to connect the two Korean

Dae-jung, presided over the groundbreaking ceremony in Imjingak, a village just
south of the Demilitarized Zone that has separated the two Koreas since the 1945
division of the peninsula and the 1950-53 Korean War. When completed by next
fall, the railway and a new four-lane highway running alongside it will link the

Army: Honorable Discharge for Gay Lawmaker
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. (AP) -- Army officials today recommended an honorable
discharge for Reserve Lt. Steve May, an openly gay Arizona lawmaker who the Army
said violated its ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy by acknowledging his
sexuality during a legislative debate. Officials wouldn't disclose why a panel
of three Army colonels recommended an honorable discharge after the Army had
pursued an other-than-honorable, general discharge. Honorable discharges are
typical for soldiers forced to leave the military because of sexual orientation.
May said he still considers himself a member of the reserves.

Central Sudan Riots Kill Two

   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Students and the unemployed rioted Sunday in a
central Sudanese city, burning government buildings and banks during hours of
clashes with security forces that left at least two dead and several injured,
the governor of White Nile state said. The riots started in the city of Kosti,
175 miles south of Khartoum, when students demonstrated against mandatory
military service, Gov. Badawi el-Kheir Idriss told state run television. Then,
he said, scores of the unemployed joined them and began burning government cars,
the local government-run radio station, the provincial office building, banks
and police stations.

Gunmen Kidnap 30 Colombians
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen kidnapped about 30 people from two restaurants
and a farm outside Colombia's third-largest city on Sunday, and police were
scrambling to try to identify the group responsible. Suspicion immediately fell
on the National Liberation Army, or ELN, a leftist rebel group that has
kidnapped people here before, including dozens of people last year during a
Catholic Mass. But their responsibility could not immediately be confirmed.
Colombia has one of the world's highest kidnapping rates. From the beginning of
the year until July, 1,754 people were abducted in this South American country.

<HEADLINE> Little Havana Mulls Elian Movie  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN FARRINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Dozens of Cuban-Americans getting their first
glimpse Sunday of a made-for-TV movie of the rescue and
international custody battle over Elian Gonzalez cried during some
scenes but criticized the show as an inaccurate portrayal of the
Cuban boy's seven months in America.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening scenes of ''The Elian Gonzalez Story,'' the
6-year-old's mother straps him to an inner tube and then sinks
beneath the waves after their small boat bound for Florida
capsized.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's shocking to watch that because the boy went through
that,'' Roxana Rodriguez said, wiping away tears. ''The rest of the
movie is not real.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the 60 people watching the Fox Family Channel movie
at the Latin American Restaurant, she said the movie did not
accurately depict the custody battle between Elian's father in Cuba
and the relatives he lived with in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Those watching condemned scenes they felt made Cuba and its
president Fidel Castro look good, but all eyes were glued to the
three TV screens. All stopped talking when the movie began. Halfway
through, people were letting their food go cold as they watched.
</P>
<P>
   When Castro's character met with Elian's father, the crowd
booed. They repeated the jeers when Attorney General Janet Reno's
character appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a propaganda to brainwash people,'' said Bettina
Rodriguez. ''The only thing that I like so far is that Elian's
mother said that she wants Elian to have choices and to live in a
free country.''
</P>
<P>
   After the movie showed agents taking Elian at gunpoint from his
Miami relatives' home, many at the restaurant got up and walked
out, yelling in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Saul Sanchez, head of the anti-Castro group Democracy
Movement, closed his eyes and put his head on his table, covering
it with his hands as his character spoke with Elian's great uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez and family spokesman Armando Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not introduce the attorney to Lazaro. I did not
manipulate Lazaro's decisions,'' Sanchez said. ''The movie is full
of inaccuracies and malicious misinterpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   He left the restaurant, not waiting to see the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Donato Dalrymple, whose frightened face made front pages around
the world when a federal agent pointed a gun at him and demanded he
hand over Elian, described the movie as mostly fiction, especially
the raid scene that put his photo in millions of newspapers. But he
watched the movie with interest, sometimes scoffing, sometimes
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ''There I go!'' he said while watching his character introduce
himself to Elian's great uncle at the hospital where Elian was
treated. In the movie, Dalrymple runs up and says: ''Mr. Gonzalez,
I'm Donato Dalrymple. I rescued the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple and his cousin helped rescue Elian on Thanksgiving Day
after the boy's mother and 10 others died at sea. A extended court
battle began after the Immigration and Naturalization Service
determined he should be returned to his father in Cuba. Elian and
his father flew back to Cuba on June 28 after the U.S. Supreme
Court declined to intervene.

<HEADLINE> Three Beheaded in Saudi Arabia  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Two Egyptians and a Saudi convicted
of murder were beheaded Sunday in Saudi Arabia, the Interior
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Saeed Mahmood Naqreesh and Hassan Ibrahim Mohammed, both
Egyptians, were executed in the western city of Medina for fatally
stabbing a man in his car following an argument, said the
statement. It did not provide further details.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern city of Jazan, Ali Mohammed Mishrem, a Saudi,
was executed for fatally stabbing a man after a land dispute, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's executions bring to at least 101 the number of people
beheaded this year. At least 99 people were executed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Executions are carried out with a sword in a public square.
Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islamic law, which
prescribes death sentences for murder, rape, drug trafficking and
armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The executions have been criticized by human rights
organizations, which say Saudi Arabia often fails to give the
accused fair trials and point out that Islam calls for limiting the
use of execution as punishment.

<HEADLINE> UN Staffer Dead in Guinea Raid  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- A U.N. refugee worker was killed and a second was
kidnapped in a raid Sunday in West Africa, officials said. The
motive for the attack was not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   Mensah Kpognon, 50, of Togo, was slain at his home by unknown
gunmen in the southeastern Guinea town of Macenta, near the border
with Liberia, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR said it had heard that the attackers abducted another of
its staff members, Sapeu Laurence Djeya of the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was a new blow to the UNHCR two weeks after the slaying
of three U.N. staff members in Indonesian-controlled West Timor.
Kpognon's killing came in a region rife with tensions over refugees
from Liberia and Sierra Leone and cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet another humanitarian has been savagely killed trying to
help refugees,'' said Frederick Barton, deputy high commissioner,
at the agency's Geneva headquarters. ''We haven't even buried our
three other colleagues murdered in West Timor 10 days ago, and now
we have lost another friend and co-worker.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement by UNHCR headquarters said Kpognon had contacted the
agency's offices in the Guinean capital, Conakry, at 6:30 a.m.
Sunday to report unrest in the Macenta and to say that attackers
had burned the town's military garrison two hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR officials in Macenta were sent to check on Kpognon after
he lost contact with Conakry, and found his body at his house, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had apparently been shot by the retreating gunmen,'' the
statement said. ''His house had been burned, as well as a UNHCR
vehicle parked outside.'' It said several bodies were seen in the
streets of the town.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it had issued an urgent appeal to governments in
the region to join in the effort to obtain the release of Djeya,
the female staffer.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what led to the attack that killed Kpognon, who
studied at the University of Iowa in 1984-85.
</P>
<P>
   Guinea hosts more than 460,000 refugees, one of the largest
refugee populations in Africa. Some 330,000 are from Sierra Leone
and 126,000 from Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the refugees in the Macenta area are Liberian, but some
Sierra Leonean refugees have fled into the area recently following
attacks by Sierra Leonean rebels.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several cross-border raids into Guinea recently.
UNHCR noted that the government has said at least 80 people were
killed by anti-Guinean dissidents in attacks on several Guinean
villages near the borders of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   It said some 50 people were killed Sept. 1 in an attack on
Massadou village, about 15 miles from Macenta. The Guinean
government blamed the attack on gunmen from Liberia. Liberia has
accused Guinea of harboring rebels who crossed into northern
Liberia in July and have been fighting government forces there ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been high toward refugees in Guinea recently.
There have been a number of attacks on refugees in Conakry and
elsewhere in the past week since President Lansana Conte accused
them in a television broadcast of harboring anti-Guinean
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions mounted Sunday amid allegations that Guinea's military
launched artillery attacks on Sierra Leone border villages.
</P>
<P>
   A top Sierra Leonean official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, accused Guinea of firing mortars in recent days on three
villages in northwestern Sierra Leone. The official said Guinea was
trying to create a ''buffer zone'' against Sierra Leonean and
Guinean rebel groups based across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Coker, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in
Sierra Leone confirmed an upsurge of fighting in the region, which
is dominated by Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front rebels.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Rev. Ellwood ''Bud'' Kieser, an
Emmy-winning Roman Catholic priest who produced movies and
television shows with religious themes and created Hollywood's
coveted Humanitas Prize, died Saturday night, a spokeswoman said.
He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The priest recently underwent surgery for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kieser's work included the Raul Julia movie ''Romero,'' about
the assassination of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, and
''Insight,'' a daytime serial-with-a-moral that ran for 23 years
and won six Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   He created the Humanitas Prize to reward those programs that
best exemplify ''human values.'' Recent recipients of prizes
ranging from $10,000 to $25,000 include the screenwriters of the
movie ''The Insider'' and the TV adaptation of the book ''Tuesdays
with Morrie.''
</P>
<P>
   Kieser also served as an active priest at St. Paul the Apostle
Catholic Church in west Los Angeles, led prominent Catholic laymen
on visits to famine-stricken areas of Africa and testified before
the House subcommittee on Africa.
Valeriu Stelian
</P>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Valeriu Stelian, a folk singer who
inspired anti-communist protesters a decade ago, died of cancer
Saturday, a family friend said. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the 1989 anti-communist uprising, Stelian began
singing at University Square in downtown Bucharest for students who
protesting the presence of former communists in government.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after the uprising, coal miners descended on Bucharest
at the behest of the government and beat up the students. Six
people died in the melee and the protest harmed Romania's image to
such a degree that many young Romanians emigrated, believing
democracy would never come to the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh God, come here to see what has become of people,'' went the
lyrics of one of Stelian's songs composed in 1973 and played to
film footage of people who had died during the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Stelian toured the former Soviet Union,
Norway, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, France, England and the United
States. He also set up some recording studios in Romania.
Paula Yates:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- TV personality Paula Yates, girlfriend of the late
INXS singer Michael Hutchence, was found dead at her London home on
Sunday, police said. She was 40.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard said the cause of death was not immediately known,
and that an autopsy would be scheduled. Detective Inspector Mike
Christensen said there were no signs of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Yates was Hutchence's partner from 1994 until November 1997,
when he committed suicide by hanging himself in a hotel room in
Sydney, Australia. She had a daughter with him in 1996, Heavenly
Hiraani Tiger Lily.
</P>
<P>
   News reports in Britain had said Yates was treated for
depression after Hutchence's death. She was also the former wife of
pop musician Bob Geldof, with whom she had three children.
</P>
<P>
   Yates was a co-presenter in the 1980s on the music show ''The
Tube.'' She also had appeared on ''The Big Breakfast,'' an offbeat
morning program where she interviewed celebrity guests on a giant
bed.

   Jeff Lacy of St. Petersburg, Fla., was to box Cleiton Conceicao
of Brazil at 165 pounds later on afternoon card.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez boxed cautiously in the first round and led 3-0 at the
end of the round. He stepped up the pace, landing crunching rights
to the head for a 12-0 lead after two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the third round, Juarez scored with a right, then a left and
finished the match with a right uppercut that made the score 15-0.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez's second-round opponent will be Falk Huste of Germany.
Juarez beat Huste 12-6 in the second round of the world
championships last year in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Huste, a silver medalist at the 1997 world championships, jabbed
his way to 10-6 win over Joni Turunen of Finland, but he did get
tagged with three good rights to the head in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez was the fifth American to qualify. Seven Amercians have
yet to box.

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Kenya 0  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. women's volleyball team will
need all the victories it can get in order to reach the Olympic
medal round. The latest one was easy pickings.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who opened the games with a rousing four-set
victory over favored China, kept their momentum rolling with quick
25-16, 25-6, 25-16 rout of overmatched Kenya on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should get a much tougher test on Wednesday
against Croatia. Both teams are 2-0, and Croatian hitter Barbara
Jelic has been the most spectacular performer of the tournament so
far, recording 63 kills.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya, by far the weakest of the 12 teams in the field, has been
beaten by a combined score of 150-70 in its two straight-sets
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team improved to 4-0 against Kenya in the teams' first
meeting since 1995. The African champions have gotten a little
better since then, however, and Monday's opening set was
competitive for a while.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans struggled to a 10-8 lead, then ran off four
straight points behind Logan Tom's sinking jump serve. Kenya
trailed 22-10 before rallying, and its high point was a rigid stuff
by Edna Chepngeno and Judith Serenge on a hit by Tom. That cut it
to 24-16, but 6-foot-2 U.S. blocker Heather Bown drove home a shot
for the set.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mick Haley emptied his bench for the final two sets, and
American co-captain Allison Weston saw her first action.
</P>
<P>
   Haley also sat outside hitter Tara Cross-Battle, the oldest
player on the team at 32. Demetria Sance took her place.
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Sykora, the former Texas A&AMP;M star, settled into her
position as the American libero. The position, new to these
Olympics, is defense-only, and the player can't serve or spike at
the front row. Sykora played the spot well, coming up with several
diving saves.

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Cuba 0  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- The United States softball team can
hit, too.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Americans opened the Olympic softball tournament
with the games' first solo no-hitter, Crystl Bustos homered twice
to give the United States a 3-0 victory over Cuba on Monday (Sunday
night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Bustos and Sheila Douty hit back-to-back homers in the second
inning, then Bustos added another in the fourth to give the United
States (2-0) an insurance run.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Henderson, the only member of the U.S. rotation who
wasn't with the gold-medal team in Atlanta, struck out seven in
five-plus innings before Christa Williams got the last six outs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba (0-2) managed just two hits and a walk off Henderson, who
also threw a wild pitch and committed two throwing errors.
</P>
<P>
   Bustos also homered in the first game, giving her three so far
and leaving her just one shy of the individual record of four in
the round-robin stage. There are five games to play before the
medal round.
</P>
<P>
   It's a spectacular debut for a player who refused all
invitations to try out for the national team after she was snubbed
by the junior team as an 18-year-old because, she said, she wore
her hat backwards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she went to junior college, then to the Akron Racers of
the Women's Professional Softball League when it was formed in
1997. In 1998, Bustos tore her anterior cruciate ligament midway
through the WPSL season.
</P>
<P>
   And who should come out of the stands to tend to her but Dot
Richardson, the U.S. Olympic team shortstop and an orthopedic
surgeon, who had come to see Bustos play.
</P>
<P>
   Bustos finished the season before having surgery, winning the
league's MVP. In 1999, when the International Softball Federation
changed its rules to allow professionals, Bustos decided it was
time.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, the team's energetic leader and the telegenic
spokeswoman for the sport, moved from shortstop to second base to
make room in the lineup for Bustos' bat. And that made the U.S.
team, which has dominated all comers in a 112-game winning streak,
even more unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans hit three homers in the opener, but the offensive
power was lost in the hoopla over Lori Harrigan's no-hitter. In the
victory over Cuba, though, the hitting was the story.
</P>
<P>
   The game started about 40 minutes late because a traffic jam
delayed the Japanese team on its way to the stadium for the first
game of the doubleheader.

<HEADLINE> Campaigns Probe Undecided Voters  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY BENAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A personals ad from this year's presidential
candidates might look something like this: In search of politically
independent female from small town; no college education necessary.
</P>
<P>
   She's a typical undecided voter, part of a shrinking pool of
Americans yet to tilt toward either Al Gore or George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 percent of Americans remain truly undecided, polls
show, although that rises when those who are leaning but not
committed are included. That has number crunchers for both
campaigns slicing and dicing poll results to learn more about just
who's left to get.
</P>
<P>
   They're likely to find people like Tracey Jones, a 33-year-old
cosmetics saleswoman. She's a registered Democrat but willing to
give Bush a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to vote,'' Jones said as she shuttles among
customers in a D.C. store. ''I just have a lot more homework to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show the undecideds are disproportionately female and
politically independent, with a high school education or less. Some
polls show they're most likely to be young, though a recent survey
found them older. Nearly two-thirds are from small towns or rural
areas. Many are from working-class families. They have moderate
views on the issues and generally favorable impressions of both
Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're probably just tuning in,'' said GOP pollster Linda
Divall. ''They're truly up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   And the uncertainty in this year's race extends well beyond the
undecideds to an even larger bloc of voters who have picked a
candidate but aren't solidly committed. One in four registered
voters said there was a chance they might switch before Election
Day, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center for
the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   That includes people like Kenny Smith, a 29-year-old
construction worker from Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not really undecided, but I can be swayed,'' said Smith, a
Democrat who describes himself as for ''Al Gore -- as of now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm waiting on the debates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, 23-year-old Molly Lorton, a technical writer from
Centreville, Va., says she's leaning toward Bush but far from
committed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just have an overall better feeling about Bush, but it's
really not that strong,'' said Lorton, who doesn't identify herself
with any party. ''I'm going to vote, but it's probably going to
come down to a last-minute decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Independents, who make up more than 40 percent of the
undecideds, have been splitting about evenly between Gore and Bush
when they do weigh in. But Gore has the edge among women,
lower-income and lower-educated voters, groups that are prominent
among the undecided. Bush has the edge among others in the group:
small town and rural voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign lumps together truly undecided voters with
soft Bush supporters and sees a ''persuadable voting bloc'' of
about 15 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategist Tad Devine sees encouraging signs for the
Democrats in this group. Many have favorable impressions of Gore,
already support a Democrat for Congress and tend to lean Gore's way
on major issues, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ''This segment of the population is very available to Al Gore,''
Devine said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans see opportunity as well in those who have yet to
make up their minds. GOP strategists say Bush's challenge is to
excite the undecided voters who tuned out after growing weary of
partisanship during the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why we have to keep a constant drumbeat about
Republican initiatives,'' says party spokesman Mark Pfeifle. The
party is working hard to woo specific population groups such as
Hispanics and active Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of Hispanics defected from Gore to the undecided column
immediately after the GOP convention, but have since gone back,
polls show. Among religiously active Catholics, the GOP believes
about half are ''persuadable,'' even though Catholics overall tend
to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters caution that campaigns mustn't neglect their broader
message as they try to home in on promising segments of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got an entire campaign here, with 100 million people to
vote,'' Divall said. ''You can't focus on just 10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Democratic pollster Mark Mellman says the campaigns
must be careful not to go too far in chasing small relative
differences among voting blocs. For example, while about 60 percent
of undecided voters are women, that doesn't mean campaigns can
ignore the 40 percent who are men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Mellman said, is to keep pushing broad themes while
''looking for special opportunities to reach those people who are
most undecided.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, for example, this week appeared on Oprah Winfrey's TV talk
show -- a good place to reach women -- but spent plenty of time
promoting his education plans to a broader audience.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, while Bush was stumping in the key battleground state
of Florida, Latino singer Jon Secada was in East Los Angeles
seeking support for the Republican ticket among Hispanics.

Clinton Welcomes Indian Prime Minister

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton threw a lavish official dinner today for
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and as glasses clinked, the leaders
praised each other for forging a new friendship to replace the rocky
relationship between the two nations in recent years. In contrast to the cold
shoulder given last week to the military ruler of India's nuclear rival,
Pakistan, Clinton invited Vajpayee to a South Lawn Pavilion tent filled with
fall fruits and tables adorned with gold-base plates, cream china and gold
candles.

   CEDAR KEY, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Gordon plowed into Florida's Gulf
Coast on Sunday with winds just below hurricane strength, drenching rain and a
storm surge with waves over 6 feet high. Michael Loehr, operations chief for the
State Emergency Operations Center said there was some flooding in southwest
Florida, but no serious injuries had been reported. Wind gusts of 60 mph were
reported in this rustic fishing town about 100 miles north of Tampa as the storm
approached. Gordon's top sustained winds fell from 75 mph early Sunday to about
70 mph, just below the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane.

Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, rejected Israel's demand
that most Jewish settlers be allowed to remain in the West Bank, under Israeli
sovereignty, concentrated in large blocs of settlement. Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat insisted Sunday that Israel must transfer control of all land it
captured in 1967 -- including the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem -- to

Army: Honorable Discharge for Gay Lawmaker
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. (AP) -- Army officials today recommended an honorable
discharge for Reserve Lt. Steve May, an openly gay Arizona lawmaker who the Army
said violated its ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy by acknowledging his
sexuality during a legislative debate. Officials wouldn't disclose why a panel
of three Army colonels recommended an honorable discharge after the Army had
pursued an other-than-honorable, general discharge. Honorable discharges are
typical for soldiers forced to leave the military because of sexual orientation.
May said he still considers himself a member of the reserves.

Atlantis Crew Departs Space Station

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Atlantis and its astronauts gently
pulled away from the international space station late Sunday after a short but
productive stay. The spacecraft parted high above Russia, a few minutes late
because of minor computer trouble. They had flown together eight days.
Expedition One -- the first permanent space station crew -- is scheduled to
blast off Oct. 30 aboard a Russian rocket and arrive at the complex two days
later for a four-month mission. The seven men installed the toilet, oxygen
generator and treadmill in the new Russian-built living quarters and, during an
excursion outside last Monday, hooked up power and TV cables.

sisters to task in a column in Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper. McEnroe
objected to comments by Serena Williams, who last year said she would like to
play in a couple of men's tournaments. McEnroe restated his opinion -- earlier
expressed to the New Yorker magazine -- that ''a lot of male college kids and
members of the seniors' tour could beat the sisters.'' But he said that,
contrary to press reports, he had never challenged the sisters to a match --
even though he had been offered $1 million by Donald Trump to take on one of the
pair.

<HEADLINE> Tales Abound At Washington Monument  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On a September morning in 1880, a catapulting
cat leaped from the top of the unfinished Washington Monument -- and
survived, ever so briefly.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington's monument has attracted stories like that
ever since its cornerstone was laid on Independence Day, 1848.
Many, including the tale of the flying cat, were retold this summer
as the monument reopened to visitors after four years of cleaning,
repairs and interior improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Future President Abraham Lincoln was just another face in a very
large crowd when the monument was launched on that hot and dusty
dedication day in 1848. But by the time Lincoln returned to town as
chief executive in 1861, the monument was just a jagged stub in a
field of rubble. All work had been halted in a tangled web of
political recrimination. Mark Twain said it looked like a factory
chimney with the top broken off.
</P>
<P>
   The flight of the death-defying feline gives its name to a slim
volume of monumental anecdotes collected by local historian Jim
Berard: ''The Flying Cat and other Amazing Stories of the
Washington Monument,'' EPM Publications, Delaplane, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Berard, a Capitol Hill press secretary and a volunteer National
Park Service guide, picks up the story as work on the monument
resumed under government control in 1880.
</P>
<P>
   That September, with the monument at the 160-foot level, workmen
arriving at the top of the scaffold one morning startled a sleeping
cat, which leaped off the edge into empty air.
</P>
<P>
   ''Witnesses said the animal spread out its paws, flattened its
body, and glided like a flying squirrel,'' Berard writes. ''The cat
hit the ground on all fours, tumbled over a few times, and righted
itself, dazed but very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   Its troubles had just begun.
</P>
<P>
   Either on the monument grounds or on its way home -- there are
two versions of this story -- the cat met a totally unimpressed dog
that chased, caught and killed it.
</P>
<P>
   An urban legend was born.
</P>
<P>
   Berard has collected lots of other stories from the 555-foot
monument's past, including these:
</P>
<P>
   --Falling Objects. Before the windows at the top were sealed some
decades ago, people were regularly startled by missiles falling
from on high. Berard says people were hit by a number of objects,
including a marble, a camera lens and an orange. At one point, the
missiles of choice were expended shell cases handed out as
firing-range souvenirs at FBI headquarters and dropped out the
monument windows.
</P>
<P>
   --What a Catch: The first person on record to catch a baseball
thrown from the top of the monument did so in 1908, Berard says. He
was Charles ''Gabby'' Street, a catcher for the Washington
Senators. He made the catch in his mitt wearing a catcher's full
protective regalia. The stunt attracted wide notice and the ball
Street caught sold for $40,000 at a war bonds auction during World
War I.
</P>
<P>
   --What a Catch II: An earlier ball catching attempt was made in
1894 when Chicago Colts pitcher Clark Griffith dropped two balls
from the top of the monument. According to one story, William
''Pop'' Shriver, the Colts catcher, snagged the second ball. But
Griffith wrote years later that Shriver missed them both.
</P>
<P>
   --Music in the Air: The monument has been an inspiration to all
sorts. In 1910, Alfredo Warsaw of the Metropolitan Opera sung an
aria from the top of the monument.
</P>
<P>
   --Ups and Downs: There has been an elevator to the top since the
monument's earliest days, but some people preferred the stairs --
all 898 of them. In 1933, one man climbed them, nonstop, with
another man weighing 145 pounds perched on his shoulders. In 1950,
an acrobat ''walked'' all the way down from the top -- on his hands.
One climber went the distance on crutches, another on stilts. One
woman said she had tap-danced from top to bottom. The stairs are
now closed to all but supervised guided tours. And those have been
suspended temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   --Big Jump: One local resident claimed to have outdone all of the
others. David G. Morris said he had jumped over the Washington
Monument. He told no lie. But he did have help. Morris was invited
to the top of the obelisk in 1934 when it was surrounded by
scaffolding for major repairs. The top three feet of the pyramid
top of the monument poked through the surrounding platform. Morris
leaped over the monument, winning bragging rights for the rest of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   --Stop Thief: The 1934 repair led to all sorts of opportunities.
That December, an enterprising and athletic thief climbed to the
top of the scaffold and removed 107 small lightning rods -- each
tipped with gold or platinum -- from the monument's top.

<HEADLINE> US Warns Indonesia About UN Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By SLOBODAN LEKIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen met
with President Abdurrahman Wahid and other Indonesian officials on
Monday, an effort to press them to disband militia groups that have
killed U.N. peacekeepers and aid workers on Timor island.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving in Jakarta Sunday night, Cohen warned the
government to take action against the army-controlled gangs or risk
international isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government will have to decide in terms of what the
consequences will be, cooperation or isolation,'' said Cohen, who
is on a six-nation Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has publicly urged Wahid to disarm East
Timorese militiamen responsible for the Sept. 6 deaths of an
American and two other U.N. aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   They also have killed two U.N. peacekeepers in border
skirmishes.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid maintains the Timor attacks were orchestrated by hardline
commanders loyal to former dictator Suharto in order to discredit
and humiliate his reformist government. The president on Monday
fired his national police chief, Gen. Rusdihardjo, after police
failed to carry out his order to arrest the youngest son of
ex-dictator Suharto to end a spate of unexplained terrorist
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government had guaranteed full security to the
U.N. refugee agency in West Timor before the militia attack on its
office. But when a mob stormed the building, police stood by and
did nothing. No arrests have been made for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   But his defense minister, Mahfud M.D. has publicly accused
Australia of being behind the attack on the office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees in Atambua, a border town in
Indonesian-held West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Mahfud's statement that the killings were designed to prevent
East Timor's reintegration into Indonesia has stunned Western
analysts and U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deeply concerned that the government does not seem to
understand what happened,'' a U.S. official who spoke on condition
of anonymity said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia occupied East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Indonesian army and its paramilitary gangs laid
waste to the province after a U.N. referendum ended with an
overwhelming vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of international troops put a stop to the rampage
and the gangs fled to Indonesian-held West Timor, where they have
used border refugee camps as bases for incursions into East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which is administering East Timor during its
transition to independence, has warned that the militias' aim is to
destabilize the province in the hope that the resulting chaos could
spark calls for the return of Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent show of support for East Timor, four U.S. navy
warships this week visited the half-island territory bearing
reconstruction materials and other aid.
</P>
<P>
   After last year's violence, Washington cut off long-standing
military-to-military ties with Indonesia. The Clinton
administration also has banned exports of military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   During Suharto's 32-year regime, the two countries maintained
close ties. Critics of U.S. policy maintain American military
training enabled the Indonesians to commit massive human rights
abuses in East Timor and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Casino Clock Breaks Taboo  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Casinos aren't known for sure bets,
but there's always been at least one thing gamblers here could
count on: No clocks inside casinos.
</P>
<P>
   The omission is no design oversight. After all, if gamblers saw
clocks, they might realize the time of day. And if they did, they
might decide it was time to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new casino room is breaking that taboo.
</P>
<P>
   Coyote Kate's Slot Parlor, a new addition to the Wild, Wild West
casino at Bally's Park Place, features a 30-foot clock tower in the
middle of the room.
</P>
<P>
   It's the only clock in any of Atlantic City's 12 casinos, not
counting those in restaurants, retail stores and public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Bally's floor-to-ceiling structure, which sprouts up out of a
bank of 14 slot machines, features a four-sided clock face set
inside a multicolored, Victorian-style tower.
</P>
<P>
   The tower complements the rest of the room, which is themed
after a 19th-century western town and includes storefront facades,
a 30-foot-by-70-foot hand-painted mural, a bakery and a general
store. It opened Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Park Place Entertainment Corp., which owns the
casino, decided on the clock because the brick pillar was a key
structure in the building and they wanted to dress it up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was going to be there anyway, so the question became 'What
do we do with it?''' said casino president Kenneth Condon. ''We
thought a clock tower would fit the theme quite well, and it
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Park Place isn't worried about losing gamblers who see the time
on the clock and reconsider whether to keep dropping quarters in
the slot machine.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's strictly old-school casino thinking,'' said Wallace
Barr, executive vice president of Park Place Entertainment. ''We
think it's consistent with everything else we've done in Coyote
Kate's.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of a clock may be old school, but it remains the rule in
most casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Friedmutter, a casino architect with offices in Las Vegas
and Atlantic City, said he knows of no other casino with a clock in
it.
</P>
<P>
   He said the clock taboo reaches back to the early days of Las
Vegas, when casino designers sought to insulate their customers
from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted people to feel like time was irrelevant. It became
one of those dream fantasies: Time doesn't exist, the place doesn't
exist, it's all part of the mystique,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, those traditions have fallen by the wayside.
Exterior windows, another feature long avoided because they also
can remind gamblers of the passage of time, have begun to appear in
casinos over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Is Coyote Kate's clock the start of a trend? Only time will
tell.
</P>
<P>
   But Friedmutter believes it may.
</P>
<P>
   ''As these facilities incorporate more than just gambling,
that's a natural evolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, gamblers are hardly noticing. Most are well-used
to the absence of clocks and wear wristwatches. Gamblers
interviewed at random in the casino last week saw the clock only
after it was pointed out to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's looking up at a clock?'' asked Norbert Meehan, 60,
stopping in front of the $1 Slingo slot machines to crane his neck.
''I think it's a good idea. People should know what time it is so
they leave before they lose everything.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Seek Southern Votes  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The South is rising again in the battle
for presidential votes.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore -- counting on big electoral votes from California and
New York and fighting hard in the Midwest -- originally was expected
to cede the South to Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But as Democrat Gore's poll numbers climb nationally, he's
focusing more on the region both candidates call home. Bush is
governor of Texas; Gore represented Tennessee in Congress for 16
years.
</P>
<P>
   Since Labor Day, Gore has stumped in Kentucky and Florida,
raised money in Georgia and joined his wife, Tipper, in Louisiana.
Daughter Karenna has campaigned in Tennessee, and Gore's running
mate, Joseph Lieberman, has spoken in Arkansas and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and running mate Dick Cheney aren't worried about losing
Texas, so in the South they've focused primarily on Florida, where
Bush's brother Jeb is governor and 25 electoral votes are at stake
-- the fourth biggest prize in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, former President Bush, carried Florida twice; so
did Ronald Reagan. But the Clinton-Gore ticket took the state in
1996, and the state has some 300,000 more registered Democrats than
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been criticized in Florida for pandering to
Cuban-Americans by advocating permanent residency for Elian
Gonzalez, but his health care plans have gained him support from
retirees. His Orthodox Jewish running mate could bring out more
Jewish old folks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anybody who writes Florida off in one column or the other is
making a mistake,'' Gore says. Polls in the state show Bush and
Gore neck and neck.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Bush can't win the presidency without Texas,
Florida and a good chunk of other Southern states and spokesman
Tucker Eskew says the governor's message fits the South well -- ''It
will be one of the foundations on which his victory was built.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's ''compassionate conservatism'' plays well in the South,
and some Southerners -- particularly farmers and coal miners -- have
been put off by Gore's stands on the environment and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ''The battleground is not only in the Midwest, but also in the
South,'' said Ellen Mellody, Gore's Southern communications
director. ''The South has been an area that Republicans could count
on without putting much money or resources into it. That's not true
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that six Southern states now have Democratic
governors. The South also is becoming less agrarian.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot dismiss that it's still more conservative and
moralistic and culturally traditional, but there is movement in
that direction,'' said John Kuzenski, a political science professor
at The Citadel in South Carolina and organizer of an annual
symposium on Southern politics.
</P>
<P>
   A candidate needs 270 of the 538 Electoral College votes to win
the presidency. Texas would give Bush 32. Add Florida (25) and
seven other states trending toward Bush -- Alabama (9), Georgia
(13), Kentucky (8), Mississippi (7) and North Carolina (14), South
Carolina (8) and Virginia (13) -- and Bush would get 129 electoral
votes in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Gore probably will win Tennessee (11) and West Virginia (5). He
has a shot at Louisiana (9) and Arkansas (6), and there's a slight
possibility he could pick off Georgia or Kentucky. And then there's
the fight for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   One key for Gore in the South is turnout by black voters.
</P>
<P>
   His black campaign manager, Donna Brazile of Louisiana, could
help. So could President Clinton, who has strong support from
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   And though some blacks question Lieberman's commitment to
affirmative action, he marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and
registered black voters in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's criticism of Clinton's relationship with a White
House intern also could attract Southern conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   As the candidates campaign in the South, they like to emphasize
their roots. Gore pulls on his cowboy boots; Bush his cowboy hat.
Both pepper speeches with y'alls and drawls. Gore declares himself
a grateful ''son of the South.'' Bush calls himself ''the only true
Southerner'' in the race.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, 52, was born in Washington, D.C.; Bush, 53, in New
Haven, Conn. Both went to private prep schools -- Gore in Washington
and Bush in Massachusetts. Both graduated from Ivy League
universities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did spend much of his childhood in West Texas and moved
back to the state in 1975 after he got his master's degree in
business from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent boyhood summers at his parents' farm in Middle
Tennessee. He lived in an Alabama trailer home while in the Army
and worked as a young man in Nashville. But for the past 24 years,
he has lived in Washington -- as a House member, senator and vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the number of years Bush has spent in Texas and
compare that to the number of years Gore has lived in Washington,''
said Larry Sabato, director of governmental studies at the
University of Virginia. ''Gore has been nationalized; Bush seems
very Southern and very Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   That distinction could matter, he said, since Southerners are
prone to embrace their own.

<HEADLINE> Battlefields Cite Civil War Causes  </HEADLINE>
By MASHA HERBST
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANASSAS, Va. (AP) -- A simple shift in emphasis has reignited a
long-standing debate in the South.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Civil War battlefield sites carefully listed and
diagramed troop movements, military strategies and death tolls.
What actually caused the Civil War, however, was largely omitted.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, in three paragraphs buried in a huge spending
bill, Congress encouraged these federal sites to emphasize the
causes of the Civil War, specifically slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives you more insight,'' 12-year-old Mark Russell said as
he read through the new text panels discussing slavery at Manassas
National Battlefield Park. ''You get to really know what they're
fighting about.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians say the absence of information about slavery at Civil
War battlefield sites over the years was probably due to debates
over what actually caused the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been very contentious,'' said Edward Ayers, a University
of Virginia history professor who is writing a book about the Civil
War. ''It's been, from the first gun until today, the crucial
question we keep arguing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayers said that among most historians, ''there's virtually no
one who argues that the war was not based in slavery in some way.''
The only disagreement is over the degree to which slavery was a
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors other than slavery are most often cited as causes of
the war -- economics and states' rights. While those are valid
points on the surface, Ayers said, a closer look shows that the
economic and states' rights issues both centered on slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's become clear after dozens of books by impartial scholars
that slavery was the driving force behind the Civil War,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the changes say that the Park Service is bowing
to pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have here is political correctness running rampant,''
said Joe Avalon, owner of Civil War Interactive, an online
magazine. ''It's a push by the African-American community, and it's
basically changing the mandate of the museums.''
</P>
<P>
   Park Service officials say the congressional act is not a
mandate, and that they had discussed broadening their
interpretation, or including a wider range of information, before
the appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   At Manassas, visitors can now read panels discussing slavery and
secession as causes of the war, see pictures of an open-air slave
market and learn about the experiences of three civilian families
affected by the war.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors at Richmond National Battlefield Park can listen to
readings taken from letters and diaries of residents, soldiers,
free blacks and former slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we talk about things other than troop movements,'' said
Richmond park superintendent Cindy McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the changes won't dilute the military information
that traditionally has drawn visitors to parks. ''There will still
be, at the end of the day, at the end of the decade, a very
pronounced emphasis on the events that make the sites
significant,'' said Park Service chief historian Dwight
Pitcaithley.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many say the changes are long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gettysburg battlefield superintendent John Latschar: ''Six
hundred thousand people died between 1861 and 1865, and we are
absolutely convinced that the greatest majority of our visitors are
far more interested in why they died than in how they died.''

<HEADLINE> Huffington Calls for GOP Tolerance  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Banking and oil heir Michael
Huffington, who waged a bitter 1994 campaign against Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, is again considering a role in California politics.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the 53-year-old Republican made headlines was in
1998, when he disclosed that he was bisexual.
</P>
<P>
   At the Republican state convention over the weekend, Huffington
grabbed the spotlight again, declaring that he is not through with
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting tolerance within the Republican Party -- for diversity
of race, ethnicity, and particularly sexual preference -- is at the
top of his agenda, he said. His goal to help promote that: winning
the office of mayor or governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason I came out is to say, 'Hey, let's open the door to
the last bastion of discrimination,''' Huffington said Saturday.
''The party of Lincoln should be reaching out to blacks, Hispanics
gays and so forth and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, GOP members should endorse federal
hate-crimes legislation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Huffington's own experience in the California
Legislature and in Congress taught him that a single lawmaker in
such a large body can't make enough of a difference, he said.
That's why he would only consider ''executive'' elected jobs: mayor
or governor.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington said he won't run against Democratic Gov. Gray Davis
in 2002 because challenging an incumbent is too difficult.
Currently, he isn't actively seeking any office, including that of
Los Angeles mayor, which is up for grabs next year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether California is ready for a gay or bisexual leader,
Huffington said the state would eagerly embrace one ''who'll tell
the truth, who doesn't hold back.''
</P>
<P>
   Huffington also stipulated that he would have to be drafted by
Republicans to run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to spend the money or the time away from my kids
unless -- I don't expect this to happen -- but unless the Republican
Party said, 'We need you,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington poured $27.5 million of his own money into the 1994
race against Feinstein, outspending her by 2-to-1 in what was then
the nation's costliest Senate race. New Jersey businessman Jon
Corzine surpassed that this year, spending $36.7 million -- about
$34 million of his own money -- to win the Democratic nomination for
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Huffington said he now spends his time investing in high-tech
companies and helping build monasteries in Europe and the United
States. He said he also enjoys a close relationship with his
ex-wife, syndicated columnist Arianna Huffington. The pair were
married for 11 years before they divorced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he would want to re-enter politics after the
acrimonious 1994 Senate race, Huffington said: ''We only have so
much life left. Before I do die, I want to do something good for
people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Glenn Reeves doubled home two runs in
the eighth inning as Australia rebounded from a disheartening
opening loss and beat South Korea 5-3 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Playing only a few hours after their loss to the Netherlands,
the Australians rallied against South Korea's bullpen to pull out
their first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Nilsson, who had struck out with the bases loaded to end
the second inning, hit a run-scoring double with two outs in the
seventh to tie it at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Australia (1-1) loaded the bases in the eighth on a walk and
singles by Grant McDonald and Mathew Buckley. After South Korea
(1-1) got a forceout at home for the second out, Reeves broke the
tie with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, a 26-year-old outfielder who played in the Florida
Marlins' farm system, also drove in a run with a bases-loaded walk
in the second inning off Chung Min-tae, who lasted only 1 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Anderson, a 19-year-old left-hander who has pitched in the
Seattle Mariners' farm system, allowed one hit over 4 1-3 relief
innings. Grant Balfour struck out three in the ninth for the save.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea used a one-run strategy to stay with Australia. The
South Koreans got the leadoff batter aboard in the first, second
and fourth innings, then called for a sacrifice bunt that set up a
run each time.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A traffic accident and a confused bus
driver delayed a softball game and several boxing matches Monday at
the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   A crash on a highway in western Sydney trapped the Japanese
women's softball team in traffic for almost an hour, forcing a
40-minute delay of its game against China, according to Olympics
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The delay also caused Monaco's Prince Albert to scrap plans to
throw out the first pitch. He had to leave to attend a memorial
service for the wife of International Olympic Committee president
Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   The third day of Olympic boxing was delayed for about 30 minutes
because a bus driver got lost on the way to the Darling Harbor
boxing venue.
</P>
<P>
   Australian boxing team manager Peter Rogers said the driver was
recruited from the countryside and did not know Sydney well.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, an official with Nepal's Olympic team suffered whiplash
when the car he was riding in collided with a bus near Olympic
Park. The official, whose name was not released, was taken to Royal
Prince Alfred Hospital after the collision at 1:30 p.m. Sunday, a
team statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The team said the official remained under observation and was to
be released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third crash in a week involving Olympics
transportation. Last week, the American manager of the marching
band that performed in the opening ceremony was seriously injured
in another car-bus crash, and a British archer had a minor cut when
one bus rear-ended another.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have pulled in hundreds of drivers from outside Sydney
to help transport the tens of thousands of athletes, support
personnel and reporters at the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Prepares for Peru Ballots  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori, dragged down by a
bribery scandal involving his feared intelligence chief, met Sunday
with his Cabinet to pave the way for new elections and plan his
exit from power, as Peruvians took to the streets and flooded radio
stations to voice their joy or sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The new elections will probably be held in six or seven months,
Health Minister Alejandro Aguinaga said after the Cabinet session
Sunday, the morning after Fujimori stunned the nation by announcing
the vote, then added the further bombshell that he would not run as
a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, who pulled out of the May presidential runoff
after charging that Fujimori planned to rig the results, headed
back to Peru Sunday from Washington, saying he is prepared to
govern.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be president. I will be president,'' Toledo told
reporters during a layover at Miami's international airport.
Arriving later at Lima's airport, he told hundreds of cheering
supporters that he planned to meet with other opposition leaders to
discuss a unified candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders Sunday urged Fujimori to step down
immediately and allow for a transition government. Fujimori didn't
say whether or not he would remain in power until the elections are
held.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors spread through Lima on Sunday that Fujimori decided to
call new elections because of resistance from high military
officers when he tried to fire intelligence chief Vladimiro
Montesinos, his shadowy aide at the center of an alleged bribery
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Federico Salas underlined late Sunday that
Fujimori was in full control of the armed forces. He said
Montesinos was in Lima and under investigation, though he had not
been detained.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos was seen by many as even more powerful than the
president, and he hand-picked Peru's top generals. Demands for his
removal -- and calls for new elections -- were fueled last week when
a videotape was released allegedly showing Montesinos paying off an
opposition congressman to support the government.
</P>
<P>
   Mirko Lauer, a columnist for La Republica, a paper that reports
often on the inner workings of Peru's armed forces, said he
understood that Montesinos was holed up at Las Palmas air base,
where the National Intelligence Service is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of Montesinos' continued hold on power, retired army
general Daniel Mora noted that two television stations ''that are
practically run by the intelligence service'' did not broadcast
Fujimori's speech to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos, he said, has ''demonstrated immense power.'' But he
said he did not think there was a military crisis. ''The president
is still the commander in chief of the armed forces,'' Mora said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, before his return, opposition leader Toledo
praised Fujimori's decision to give up power and pave the way for a
peaceful transition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The political opposition in Peru should not be thinking about
a witch hunt,'' he said. ''We have to think about a government of
national unity and preparing an economic reactivation program ...
more than political confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Fujimori, smiling and looking at ease, announced
the new elections in a national address late Saturday. He said the
vote was necessary after the political uproar over Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite having been elected by a majority of the population, I
do not want to become a disturbing factor, and much less, an
obstacle to the strengthening of the democratic system,'' Fujimori
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the opposition, however, worried whether Fujimori would
so smoothly step out of power.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as Mr. Fujimori does not resign, we have no certainty
that things will develop as they should for the reestablishment of
democracy in our country,'' said former U.N. secretary-general
Javier Perez de Cuellar, who lost to Fujimori in the 1995
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Retired army general Francisco Morales Bermudez, who headed a
military regime in 1975-80 before returning power to an elected
government, said Fujimori had given no details on how the elections
would be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   As tens of thousands of opponents celebrated the beginning of
the end to Fujimori's decade in power, supporters spoke out Sunday
to defend his record and remind the world why this son of
impoverished Japanese immigrants has ruled for as long as he has.
</P>
<P>
   ''As many people are doing, I want to thank the president for
all of the work he has done,'' said Carmen Sanchez Hurtado, one of
dozens of Peruvians who flooded radio stations Sunday with calls of
support for Fujimori. ''I'm simply a housewife who saw her
daughters study by candlelight when there was terrorism, afraid to
send them to school because of the problems that existed at that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, however, thousands of Peruvians took to the
streets to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Caravans of drivers waved red-and-white Peruvian flags and
honked their car horns into the early morning hours Sunday,
celebrating the news that the man dubbed ''The Emperor'' for his
tough governing style was stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm drunk with happiness because I am in MY plaza, looking at
MY palace, which is no longer theirs but is MY palace again,''
Fernando Prada, a recent 24-year-old university graduate, said as
he celebrated with friends in front of the Government Palace. ''We
achieved something I couldn't have imagined. It happened because of
the will of the people who have rejected corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, which questioned the legitimacy of
Fujimori's re-election this year, White House spokesman Jake
Siewert said, ''We hope that all elements in Peru will work a
peaceful and transparent process to achieve full democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States, which just before
Fujimori's announcement had pressured him to dump Montesinos,
praised him Sunday for his ''responsible'' decision.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Fujimori, who only last week had a 42 percent
approval rating in a poll, defended his accomplishments -- which
''not even my detractors would fail to recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, he has succeeded in reining in bloody leftist
insurgencies that took 30,000 lives and taming hyperinflation that
reached nearly 8,000 percent his first year in office. He
stabilized a chaotic economy and attracted record amounts of
foreign investment, although his free-market economic policies
failed to generate jobs for millions of Peru's unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Lauer, of La Republica, said Fujimori had no choice but to leave
after military officers opposed Montesinos' removal.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori ''understood that he had lost his battle because he
couldn't go on as president after unsuccessfully trying to sack
Montesinos,'' he said. ''That is the moment he decided to resign,''
Lauer said.

Colorado Fire Forces Evacuations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Hundreds of residents remained evacuated from a
mountain neighborhood Sunday while others returned to chop down trees and clear
brush that could add fuel to an 800-acre fire threatening more than 130 homes.
The fire's thick pall of smoke spread eastward for miles from the canyons and
foothills about 12 miles southwest of downtown Boulder. Temperatures in the 90s
and low humidity dried out grass and pine needles in the fire's path. As
constantly shifting winds fanned the flames, fire managers were doubtful they
could contain the blaze. The containment figure, originally estimated at about
15 percent, had been revised late Sunday to zero.

   CEDAR KEY, Fla. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Gordon plowed into Florida's Gulf

storm surge with waves over 6 feet high. Michael Loehr, operations chief for the
State Emergency Operations Center said there was some flooding in southwest
Florida, but no serious injuries had been reported. Wind gusts of 60 mph were
reported in this rustic fishing town about 100 miles north of Tampa as the storm
approached. Gordon's top sustained winds fell from 75 mph early Sunday to about
70 mph, just below the 74 mph threshold for a hurricane.

Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, rejected Israel's demand

sovereignty, concentrated in large blocs of settlement. Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat insisted Sunday that Israel must transfer control of all land it
captured in 1967 -- including the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem -- to

International Weightlifting Federation rule allowing it to pay a $50,000 fine
for readmission to weightlifting events in Sydney. The entire Romanian
weightlifting team was thrown out of the Sydney Games Sunday after two male
lifters tested positive in out-of-competition tests.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Head Fires Police Chief  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- President Abdurrahman Wahid fired his
national police chief on Monday after police failed to carry out
his order to arrest the youngest son of ex-dictator Suharto in an
effort to end a spate of unexplained terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts, including one that killed 15 people in a garage
beneath the Jakarta Stock Exchange on Wednesday, have cast a shadow
of fear over the capital and have shaken Wahid's year-old reformist
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recent security developments require changes,'' Wahid told a
hastily called news conference at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of Gen. Rusdihardjo also comes amid international
condemnation of Indonesia's security forces, particularly the
police, which failed to stop the mob murders of three U.N.
humanitarian workers Sept. 6 in Indonesian West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid announced the dismissal an hour before he met visiting
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen about deteriorating security
in West Timor, where militias, opposed to independence for
neighboring East Timor, are waging a war of terror with covert
backing from sections of Indonesia's military.
</P>
<P>
   The firing of Rusdihardjo is a slap in the face for Indonesia's
armed forces, which reigned supreme during Suharto's 32-year
authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the police force had been an integral part of
the military, which Wahid has battled for many months to subdue as
part of wider democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's influential head of Parliament, Akbar Tandjung, on
Monday urged Wahid to take firmer measures to prevent terrorist
attacks, but criticized his move to order the arrest of Suharto's
youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in the new era. You cannot arrest someone if you don't
have evidence,'' Akbar said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Wahid stunned many when he publicly demanded that
police arrest Tommy Suharto as a way of ending the bomb attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives questioned the younger Suharto on Saturday, but said
there was no evidence on which to hold the 38-year-old
multimillionaire, who flatly denied any involvement in Wednesday's
attack or other bombings.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombings. But many
blame supporters of former President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions have coincided with major developments in a
corruption case being brought against the former leader, who is
facing trial for allegedly stealing a fortune from the Indonesian
state while in power.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the police force to act on Wahid's order to
arrest Suharto's son has weakened his public image as a leader in
control.
</P>
<P>
   The president said Rusdihardjo, who was appointed to head
Indonesia's 200,000-strong police force after the president assumed
office last October, would be replaced temporarily by his deputy,
Lt. Gen. Bimantoro.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Rusdihardjo had been regarded as a Wahid loyalist who
had been implementing major reforms in the police force -- reviled
during Suharto's time for corruption and human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's security has been tightened, but the president said he
had no information about being personally targeted by the bombers.
''I don't know about any threat about blowing me up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's stock exchange blast had been preceded by explosions
that rocked the attorney general's office, which is responsible for
bringing Suharto to justice, and the home of the Philippine
ambassador. A small bomb also exploded outside the Malaysian
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian shares nose-dived Monday as the Jakarta Stock
Exchange reopened for the first time since the bomb blast there.

<HEADLINE> Yang Sets Weightlifting Records  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Yang Xia of China expected to take on
Taiwan rival Li Feng-Ying for an Olympic women's weightlifting gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, she competed only against herself.
</P>
<P>
   Yang, who dropped a weight class to give herself a better chance
at a medal, broke world records in the snatch, clean and jerk and
total lift to easily win the gold at 116&AMP;frac12; pounds Monday with lifts
totaling 496 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Yang, cheered on by a small but passionate group of flag-waving
Chinese supporters, either tied or set world records with four of
her five lifts. She passed on a third lift in the clean and jerk
after she was assured of the gold and the world records.
</P>
<P>
   Li, the previous world record-holder in the clean and jerk,
simply didn't have the muscle to match the strong and confident
Yang's succession of powerful lifts and took the silver at 468&AMP;frac14;
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Winarni Binti Slamet of Indonesia took the bronze with a total
lift of 446&AMP;frac14; pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Li finished 27&AMP;frac34; pounds behind Yang, a huge difference in a sport
where the top lifters rarely are separated by more than five
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Yang's gold medal was the first of what is expected to be four
golds in women's weightlifting in the games for China, by far the
dominant country in the sport. In the last 13 world championships,
China has won 240 golds to 17 for runner-up Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China probably would win each of the seven women's weight
classes, but no country is permitted to enter more than four
lifters in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Yang first tied the snatch record, then broke it by lifting 220&AMP;frac14;
pounds, breaking the record of 214&AMP;frac34; pounds set by Meng Xianjuan of
China in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Yang the lead going into the clean and jerk, in which
the bar is raised first to the chest and then overhead, allowing
lifters to get more leg drive and arm strength.
</P>
<P>
   Yang initially first lifted 270 pounds to break Li's record of
267&AMP;frac34; pounds set in November. But, aware that Li had the potential
to break her record, Yang then pushed the record to 275&AMP;frac12; pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Yang's total lift of 496 pounds easily broke the world record of
479&AMP;frac12; pounds set by Meng Xianjuan of China in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Li, formerly of China and the reigning world champion, simply
couldn't keep up, hitting 253&AMP;frac12; pounds on her first lift in the
clean and jerk. Then, aware she was well behind Yang and needed to
break the record herself for any chance at gold, she missed at 275&AMP;frac12;
pounds and then at 281 pounds, not coming close on either lift.
</P>
<P>
   Yang was a silver medalist in last year's world championships at
127&AMP;frac12; pounds, then made the drop in class for the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Quake Victims Seek Justice  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALI, Taiwan (AP) -- The bold red graffiti on the living room
walls of an abandoned apartment speaks for many irate Taiwanese,
whose shoddily built homes collapsed a year ago in a catastrophic
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ''The developer should die,'' says a curse in Chinese letters
inside the outline of a coffin, spray-painted by the apartment's
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of poor construction and an unfriendly legal system,
thousands of displaced people still wait for justice following the
Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake, which killed 2,400 in central Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite abundant evidence that developers cut corners and
ignored safety codes, the island's government has yet to convict
anyone on negligence, endangering human lives or similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's legal system, moreover, makes suing developers
difficult -- and builders are tough to track down once they finish a
project.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this happened in the United States, there would be a huge
wave of public protest that would bring these people to court. But
Taiwan isn't like that,'' said Liu Ji-min, who lost his home in
Dali, in central Taiwan, and took a year off from his job as a land
planner to organize victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just not used to fighting for our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   As he walked through the rubble of his razed 12-story apartment
complex Liu broke off a brittle piece of concrete from a fallen
pillar and used his fingers to easily snap it in half -- a sign that
the concrete was not mixed properly.
</P>
<P>
   Builders also skimped on materials and saved time by putting a
thin layer of concrete between bricks in the walls. Steel
supporting rods were sloppily set into the concrete foundation,
compromising the building's structural integrity.
</P>
<P>
   To elude punitive action, many builders dissolve their companies
after a project is complete to avoid taxes and liability for
construction problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some contractors disappeared immediately after the quake,''
said Huang Jong-tsun, head of the government commission handling
quake reconstruction. But Huang said prosecutors are pursuing
several cases and convictions are coming.
</P>
<P>
   While they wait for justice or save for new homes, more than
6,000 families are living in temporary houses. Most of them are
about an hour's drive east of Dali in Nantou County, close to the
7.6-magnitude quake's epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   Once a vacation spot with orchards and lush mountain valleys,
Nantou is struggling to recover. The tremor shook up the terrain,
making the county prone to landslides that continue to scare away
tourists and delay construction.
</P>
<P>
   Brown streaks run down most of the green mountainsides, trails
made by avalanches that sent rocks and soil tumbling below.
</P>
<P>
   Tsai Huang-liang, a legislator from Nantou, said the jobless
rate in the county is 30 percent -- 10 times the national rate of 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated about 20 percent of Nantou's pre-quake population
of 544,000 has left the county seeking jobs or new homes.
Reconstruction has been delayed because local governments are slow
to plan new towns and city sections. Getting homeowners to agree to
plans is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''To this moment, there still has not been a successful town
reconstruction project completed,'' Tsai said.
</P>
<P>
   In Nantou's county seat of Puli, Wei Cheng-chou lamented that
the collapse of the tourist industry has cut profits in half for
his Shang Hau mushroom farm. He said government and lawmakers have
done little to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of officials ... just want things to take care of
themselves,'' he said, as women at tables cut the stems off black
mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses were pleased with the government's efforts. At
Sun Moon Lake, once one of Taiwan's most popular tourist sites, the
government has tried to bring visitors back with TV commercials and
sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government is doing what it can do. It takes a while,''
said Lin Yong P. Pin, owner of the Full House Resort Hotel, a small
guest house that looks like a wooden ski lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Lin had to lay off about 10 workers, including the chef. Now she
has just two left, and had to learn how to cook to run the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated it might take five years until tourist traffic
returns to pre-quake levels, so her hotel could have many more slow
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some days we don't see anyone, not a single person,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Gentler War Promised in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA MARINA, Colombia (AP) -- Right-wing paramilitary forces waging
a bloody battle in the mountains of west-central Colombia pledge to
be more civil in their war against leftist guerrillas and boast
that business owners are flocking to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   His field hat cocked stylishly and his camouflage uniform
impeccable, Commander Santos said his 500-man militia in the hills
overlooking the city of Tulua were making a push to win over the
people in the valley below.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this area, we want to be an example, a model, for the
paramilitaries,'' he said in an interview Friday. ''And let the
good of what we do spread throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   No more, he said, will his men kill civilians -- at least not
without pinning a letter to their chests describing their offenses.
No more will his fighters violate human rights, he said after
meeting with a Swiss representative of the Red Cross. Well, at
least not as often.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to respect human rights as much as it's possible,''
Santos explained with the steady smile of a true believer. ''Of
course, we can't always abide by everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, as the militias are
known, are waging a brutal war against the two main guerrilla
groups that control much of the country. The paramilitaries claim
to have 12,000 fighters; independent estimates put the number at
half that.
</P>
<P>
   The militias have been expanding as business owners and ranchers
grow more desperate about guerrilla kidnappings and extortion -- and
more pessimistic about the U.S.-backed army's ability to defeat
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are something like private security,'' Santos said. ''Rich
people, people with investments in this area, couldn't allow the
guerrillas to take away everything. They sought out our maximum
leader and said, 'We have money, and we need your help.'''
</P>
<P>
   Business support for the paramilitaries is a hot-button
political issue in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying in congress this month, Defense Minister Luis Ramirez
said the army shouldn't be judged so harshly for having ties to the
paramilitary, when many business people support them too.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, chief prosecutor Alfonso Gomez announced he had a
list of suspected paramilitary supporters, and warned he would seek
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   More than a billion dollars in U.S. anti-drug aid to this South
American country is conditioned on government progress in
dismantling the militias and severing the military's ties to them.
</P>
<P>
   While Santos wouldn't say how much business owners contributed
to his local force, he said they paid far more than the $250,000 it
costs each month to maintain his unit, the Calima Block.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Santos' assurances of respect for human rights, the
paramilitaries are known by many in this area to be just as
ruthless as the guerrillas. Peasants are often caught in the
middle, gunned down by one group or another for vague suspicions of
allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   When the paramilitaries moved into this area a year ago, they
staged several attacks on towns, killing selected residents and
ordering others to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government can't wage the same kind of war as we can,''
said Santos. ''It's like their hands are tied against the
guerrillas. We wage the same kind of war against the guerrillas
that they do against us.''

higher than last year,'' Reynolds said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Ticket Scalpers Targeted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Olympic organizers said Monday they
will kick scalpers out of areas near venues and confiscate their
tickets, stepping up a battle against a thriving black market.
</P>
<P>
   One group of scalpers who set up a booth in Darling Harbor, one
of the main Olympic areas, already has been evicted, said Michael
Eyers, deputy chief executive of the Sydney Olympics organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
   More tickets have been sold for the Sydney games than for any
previous Olympics and black-market tickets are changing hands with
mark ups of up to 30 percent, one Sydney newspaper reported this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Eyers urged the public not to go to scalpers for their tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who purchase Olympic tickets from scalpers run the risk
that the tickets they purchase are forgeries and they will find
themselves out of pocket and without a seat at the games,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Rebuild Cross-Border Railway  </HEADLINE>
By JAE-SUK YOO
<TEXT>
<P>
   IMJINGAK, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea started rebuilding a
railroad line across the world's most heavily armed border on
Monday, saying the new link will serve as an avenue for exchanges
with isolated communist North Korea and trade with fast-growing
markets in China and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   When completed by next fall, the railway, and a new four-lane
highway running alongside it, will link the two capitals: Seoul,
South Korea, and Pyongyang, North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The railway and highway will become the first direct transport
link between the two Koreas since the 1950-53 Korean War and set a
new milestone in improving ties between the two Cold War foes.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung presided over the
groundbreaking ceremony in Imjingak, a village just south of the
Demilitarized Zone, which has separated the two Koreas since the
1945 division of the peninsula and the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, we started reconnecting our divided fatherland,'' Kim
said in a nationally televised speech from a platform above the
groundbreaking ceremony. ''For a half century, the severed rail
link has been a symbol of national division and the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of colorful balloons were released to celebrate the
occasion, and firecrackers soared into the clear autumn sky with
plumes of rainbow-colored smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Following the historic summit meeting by their two leaders in
Pyongyang in June, the two countries agreed last month to reconnect
the major railway.
</P>
<P>
   It continues to Shinuiju, a major city on the North's border
with China, and was last used commercially shortly before the
Korean War started in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the only link between the two countries has been a
winding, heavily guarded two-lane road that stops at the truce
village of Panmunjom, which serves as the sole contact point
between democratic South Korea and the North.
</P>
<P>
   A steam locomotive whistled and rolled on a 66-foot rail line
laid for Monday's ceremony. Steering the locomotive was Han
Joon-ki, 73, who drove the last train that ran on the cross-border
line in late 1950, transporting military equipment for U.S. troops
fighting for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North and South Korea still have to negotiate how the railway
and highway will be used, but Seoul officials expect them to be
limited to cargo shipments at first.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope to reunite with my family in North Korea is higher
than ever,'' said Kim Han-keun, 70, one of millions of Koreans
separated from their families during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Seoul will spend $50 million to rebuild the 12-mile stretch of
railway between Munsan city and the Demilitarized Zone, which
separates the two countries. Thousands of South Korean soldiers
will be used to clear land mines inside the 2&AMP;frac12;-mile-wide DMZ
through which it passes.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is expected to use soldiers to rebuild the five
miles of rail line on its side of the border, between the DMZ and
Bongdong, a train station near Kaesung city. Its construction costs
were not known.
</P>
<P>
   The war ended in an uneasy truce, not a peace treaty. The Korean
border is the world's most heavily fortified, lined with an
estimated 1 million mines and guarded by 2 million troops on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, South Korea also started building the $91 million,
four-lane highway that will connect major expressways already in
service in both Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of reconciliation, South Korean Defense Minister
Cho Sung-tae and Kim Il Chul, minister for North Korea's People's
Army, will meet in Cheju Island, South Korea, on Sept. 25-26 to
discuss military cooperation in reconnecting the railroad line.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim said the railway and highway will boost trade
between the two countries, which amounted to $330 million last
year, and give South Korea a long-sought land route to China and
Russia's trans-Siberian railway, through which Seoul hopes to
deliver exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The new link will drastically reduce shipping costs for South
Korean exporters, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   In a congratulatory message to President Kim, Japanese Prime
Minister Yoshiro Mori said he strongly expected the rail and
highway reconnections to ''proceed in nurturing trust in the
military area and bring about an easing of tensions on the Korean
Peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   Inter-Korea relations have thawed significantly since Kim
visited Pyongyang to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. The
two leaders are expected to hold another summit in Seoul by next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Since the summit in Pyongyang, the two sides have stopped
propaganda broadcasts and reopened border liaison offices. Last
week, their athletes marched together behind a unification flag
during the opening ceremony at the Sydney Olympics in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas also allowed 200 people to cross the border in
August for temporary reunions with relatives they haven't seen in
half a century. Two more such reunions are planned before year's
end.

<HEADLINE> Gun Fire Heard in Ivory Coast  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Machine-gun fire echoed through the
streets near the home of Ivory Coast's military leader Monday, amid
growing tensions in the military over pay disputes and deep
political divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
private home of Gen. Robert Guei, in an upscale residential
neighborhood on the edge of downtown Abidjan, had come under attack
early Monday morning by an armed group wearing civilian clothing.
Reinforcements had been sent to the home to help defend it, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One person was killed and four were badly injured in the
fighting, one of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the sound of gunfire began to diminish after dawn, and
officials insisted Guei was not in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The junta leader ''is completely in control of the situation,''
Henri Cesar Sama, the communications minister, told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
   The home is heavily guarded by soldiers loyal to Guei. Less
regular gunfire could be heard in other neighborhoods around
Abidjan, the main city in this West African nation.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict has been growing among Ivorian soldiers, who were
promised large bonuses in exchange for supporting the Dec. 24 coup
that toppled the government of former President Henri Konan Bedie
and brought Guei to power. The bonuses have only been partially
paid and different amounts were paid to different units, increasing
ill feeling among the security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have also been flaring in recent days over the question
of whether Alassane Dramane Ouattara, a popular opposition leader,
will be allowed to run for president in elections set for Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came into question under a new constitution adopted
following a referendum in early August. A last-minute amendment
stipulates that both parents of presidential candidates be ''of
Ivorian origin'' -- a change widely believed to be aimed at
excluding Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara says both his parents were Ivorian. His opponents
insist they were from Burkina Faso. Ouattara is a former prime
minister and International Monetary Fund official who has been a
popular advocate for Ivory Coast's marginalized northern Muslims
and large immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
   There have been two military mutinies since the Christmas Eve
coup, as the junta's initial burst of popularity waned. During the
last mutiny, in early July, mutinous soldiers demanded housing
bonuses worth $9,000 but eventually agreed to $1,600. Only a
fraction of that amount has been paid.

<HEADLINE> French, Slovaks Dominate Kayak  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Davey Hearn didn't want to get out of
his canoe. At 41, he wanted to soak in his third and possibly last
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Giddens rushed out of her kayak with the exuberance you
would expect from someone about to turn 23. She wanted to watch the
rest of the race to see where she would finish.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn wound up 12th and last among the canoes and Giddens was
seventh of 15 kayaks in their slalom finals Monday. The results
were slightly disappointing for the Americans, yet each left with
wide smiles.
</P>
<P>
   France and Slovakia left with most of the medals.
</P>
<P>
   Frenchman Tony Estanguet -- who earned his Olympic berth by
beating out his brother, the 1996 bronze winner -- took the canoe
gold by nearly 2 points over Atlanta champion Martin Martikan of
Slovakia. Juraj Mincik of Slovaki won bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Stepanka Hilgertova of the Czech Republic used a brilliant
second run to overtake France's Brigitte Guibal for the gold.
Guibal took silver despite a stumble late in her bid to overtake
Hilgertova, and France's Anne-Lise Bardet got the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn was among the first to congratulate his counterparts as he
lingered beyond the finish line long after his second run. After
being frustrated by finishing ninth in Atlanta and 11th in
Barcelona, he realized he should make the most out of Sydney in
case he doesn't make it to Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's a lot of meaning to be here at 41 and the
next-youngest guy in the race is 30,'' Hearn said. ''I didn't use
to believe in that stuff about what's important is to struggle
well. But I think I've learned to appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearn said he's undecided about continuing, but realizes that in
recent years he has been congratulating others more than they've
been congratulating him. He hasn't won an international title since
1995 and has been out of the top three since '97.
</P>
<P>
   ''This racing game is difficult,'' said Hearn, of Bethesda, Md.
''It hasn't gotten any easier over 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hearn represents the past, Giddens is the future.
</P>
<P>
   She had hoped to be the present, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''On my second run, I knew I had to go all out to get silver or
bronze,'' she said. ''So I really gave it everything I had.''
</P>
<P>
   That was ruined by an early problem with some upstream gates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came in a little high and instead of gaining time, I lost
it,'' said Giddens, of Atlanta. ''I knew then I wasn't going to
medal, so I just wanted to have a solid run after that and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Giddens was smiling tightly and her voice cracked a bit. The
disappointment was still too fresh. That's probably why she said
she wasn't sure whether she would be gunning for Greece in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, you'll be back,'' said her husband and coach, Eric
Giddens, who finished 20th in canoe slalom in 1996. ''She has too
much fun with it.''

<HEADLINE> Japan's Tamura Wins Judo Gold  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC TALMADGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- When Ryoko Tamura was 8 years old, she
saw something that really intrigued her -- girls throwing boys
around. Boys like her big brother.
</P>
<P>
   That sold her on judo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just thought that was so cool,'' she said. ''I was hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years later, Tamura has won four world championships and
become a national hero in Japan, where she is known as
''Yawara-chan,'' which means ''Softie.''
</P>
<P>
   Now -- finally -- she also has an Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after her first Olympic competition, Tamura took
just 38 seconds to sweep Russia's Lioubov Brouletova to the ground
for the first women's judo gold of the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Her win was followed by another gold for Japan, by her
extra-lightweight counterpart on the men's team, Tadahiro Nomura,
who needed only 14 seconds to beat South Korea's Jung Bu-kyung.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, which introduced judo to the Olympics in Tokyo in 1964,
remains the country to beat -- team spokeman Yoshinori Nagase said
Japan hopes to win five of the 14 golds. But judo is by no means a
one-country sport.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba and Turkey already have won golds. South Korea, France and
Russia have strong teams, and the United States has a world
champion in Jimmy Pedro of Lawrence, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nowhere are judo champions more cherished than in the
land where the sport was created. And Tamura is most cherished of
all.
</P>
<P>
   When Tamura started doing judo in rural southern Japan, not many
girls were in the sport and her mother tried to talk her out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''She didn't like the idea of her little girl doing judo,''
Tamura said. ''She wanted me to play the piano, or maybe take
tennis lessons. Something more girl-like.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, she had her parents' support. And in a few years,
she was competing with the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   At age 16, Tamura competed in her first Olympics -- Barcelona in
1992 -- and won the silver. In Atlanta in 1996, she was the heavy
favorite to win, going into the competition with a four-year
unbeaten record.
</P>
<P>
   But upsets are common in judo, and Tamura ended up being
defeated in the final by Kye Sun Hi of North Korea, a virtual
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her failure to bring Japan any Olympic golds, Tamura's
four world championship victories -- the first in 1993 -- established
her as the best in the world in her weight class. And perhaps the
best in the world, period.
</P>
<P>
   But it was her Olympic jinx and tomboy allure -- she stands just
4-foot 9 and weighs only 109 pounds -- that made her a star in
Japan, where she is a frequent guest on TV variety shows and a
sought-after personality for commercial endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Her nickname comes from the name of a popular cartoon character,
and is also derived from the first Chinese character used to write
the word judo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's the perfect nickname,'' she said. ''It's just
right for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After her win Saturday, Tamura was kept up until 3 a.m. by
Japanese reporters and TV crews looking for interviews. All five
major newspapers in Japan ran the story of her victory with banner
front-page headlines.
</P>
<P>
   When she finally got to bed, she had the medal by her pillow.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is such a good feeling to finally win,'' she said. ''It's
such a relief.''
</P>
<P>
   With the jinx now broken, Tamura said she will continue to
compete and is hoping to win her fifth world championship, which
would be unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   She also is hoping to go to the Athens Olympics for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll still be 28,'' she said. ''I want to have this feeling
one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm going to take it easier now,'' she added. ''The
pressure is off.''

<HEADLINE> Aussies Lead Three-Day Equestrian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The United States lost one rider but
remained in medal contention Monday after the cross-country portion
of the team three-day event competition.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Australia was in first, with the Americans fourth
behind Britain and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have three very good show jumpers, so we have a good medal
chance,'' said Karen O'Connor of The Plains, Va., after her clean
round on Prince Panache.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, David, added only 2.4 time penalties to his
dressage score from the first day on Giltedge, while Nina Fout of
Middleburg, Va., had 20 time penalties and no jump penalties on 3
Magic Beans.
</P>
<P>
   Giltedge is a fine jumper but not very fast, so David O'Connor
was pleased he didn't have any more time penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was 15 seconds faster than I thought I'd be,'' O'Connor
said. ''He was 45 seconds down in '96. That was the round I dreamed
of.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor road Giltedge four years ago as part of the
silver-medal three-day team.
</P>
<P>
   Linden Wiesman of Bluemont, Va., had two falls on Anderoo and
was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Australia finished cross-country with 114.2 total penalty
points, followed by Britain with 127. That gives the Aussies a
two-rail cushion for stadium jumping.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is sitting on 160.8 points, one rail behind
New Zealand with 151.2.
</P>
<P>
   The three best scores of a team's four riders count for the
final score. One rail knocked down in show jumping costs 5 points,
setting up a dramatic showdown on Tuesday for the medals.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day event consists of dressage on the first day,
cross-country endurance on the second and show jumping on the
third.

<HEADLINE> Canada Big Winner in Tourney  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- All the men's basketball teams have
played just one game, but it's already clear who's the big early
winner -- Canada.
</P>
<P>
   By defeating favored Australia in an opening round game, Canada
increased its chances of avoiding the United States until the gold
medal game. In this tournament, that's about as big a victory as a
team can get.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to avoid the Americans,'' Canada coach Jay Troiano
said Monday, a day after his team defeated Australia 101-90 behind
29 points from Michael Meeks and 15 assists from Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
   If Canada can defeat Angola and Spain in its next two games, its
chances of winning a medal in men's basketball for the first time
since 1936 will have improved tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   Victories in those two games would give Canada a record of 3-0.
The Canadians then would play games against highly regarded
Yugoslavia and Russia but, even if they lost both, they almost
would certainly finish no worse than third since they already own
the tiebreaker over Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The mathematics of this equation are tricky since there are so
many variables that could throw everything out of whack. But if the
rest of the first round goes as expected, Canada will be right
where it wants to be -- no lower than third in Group B.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-place team in Group B will have to play its
quarterfinal game against the top-seeded team from Group A, which
is virtually certain to be the United States. The third-seeded team
from Group B will play the second-seeded team from Group A, and the
winner of that game will play the winner of the game between the
top team in Group B and the fourth-place team in Group A.
</P>
<P>
   Although it seems as if a degree in higher mathematics and a
working knowledge of calculus are prerequisites for figuring all
this out, the coaches of the teams from the rest of the world know
how the formula works. The bottom line: Don't finish fourth in
Group B.
</P>
<P>
   ''The coaches try to keep us away from all that so we can focus
on the task at hand,'' said Nash, who plays for the Dallas
Mavericks of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's performance was brilliant, his passes leading to nearly
half of Canada's field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's coaches also deserved credit for switching defender
Sherman Hamilton onto Australia's Andrew Gaze in the second half,
shutting down the home team's best player.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was a bitter disappointment for the Australians, who
were expected to be among the top contenders for a silver medal.
But after jumping out to a big early lead behind the cheers of the
partisan crowd, they allowed Canada to steadily nip away at it and
put the game out of reach well before the final buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really don't like to play games that fast or high-scoring.
We want a more Canadian tempo,'' Troiano said. ''But with the way
they were scoring, that's the kind of game we had to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was similar to the one Canada pulled off in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, last summer to qualify for the Olympics,
defeating the home team before another hostile crowd whose decibel
level and fervor was many times greater than what the Canadians
faced Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never underestimate the heart of these guys,'' Troiano said.
''When we go bowling or play pool or bocce, these guys are
unbelievably competitive. I'm not surprised at their resiliency.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, meanwhile, defeated China 119-72 in a game that
stayed competitive for only a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   China actually held a six-point lead in the early going, but its
three big men picked up four fouls apiece in the first 18&AMP;frac12; minutes.
China's best player, 7-footer Wang Zhizhi, picked up four fouls in
the first 4&AMP;frac12; minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these foreign teams are starting to get better,''
Gary Payton said. ''What surprised us was the three big guys. If
they had stayed out of foul trouble, they might have made a run at
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen had several highlight-reel dunks en route to 21
points, Vince Carter scored 16, Tim Hardaway and Steve Smith added
12 each and Vin Baker 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will play Italy on Tuesday afternoon (1:30 a.m.
Tuesday EDT).

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Junta Denounce Suu Kyi  </HEADLINE>
By AYE AYE WIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- A government newspaper Monday urged
people not to join with democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, calling
her the ''satan of destruction,'' intent only on confronting
Myanmar's nationalist rulers.
</P>
<P>
   '''Relying on the international community and in collusion with
foreign countries, she makes confrontation and tries to cause
difficulty to the government,'' read a commentary in Myanma Alin.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the strength of a nation lies within the country I want to
urge the people to prevent and to be aware of the dangers of
destructionist ax-handles,'' the article said. Ax-handle is a way
of describing a traitor in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Myanmar's state media have stepped up their near-daily dose of
criticism against Suu Kyi during the last three weeks as she and
her National League for Democracy party were locked in a test of
wills with the government.
</P>
<P>
   It started on Aug. 24, when security forces blocked her car as
she tried to travel outside Yangon for party work. She camped out
in the open for nine days before being forcibly hauled back to the
capital on Sept 1.
</P>

   The August-September 1988 upheaval catapulted Suu Kyi, the
daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, Aung San, to political
prominence. She later formed the National League for Democracy but
was put under house arrest from 1989 until 1995. Her party won
national elections in 1990 but the junta never recognized the
results.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Gordon plows into Gulf Coast  </HEADLINE>
By DARA KAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR KEY, Fla. (AP) - Most of the 800 residents in this rustic
fishing town stayed put Sunday evening as Tropical Storm Gordon,
with winds just below hurricane strength, plowed into central
Florida's Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Drenching rain, a storm surge with waves over 6 feet high and
wind gust of up to 60 mph pounded this barrier reef about 100 miles
north of Tampa. Gordon, with top sustained winds near 70 mph, made
landfall at about 8 p.m. Sunday EDT.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries or deaths were reported as of early Monday as the
system began making its way across Florida. The storm's forecast
track had it moving over coastal Georgia and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 Florida National Guardsmen were activated and field
teams were deployed to assess damage at first daylight. State
officials announced that schools in Columbia, Taylor, Citrus and
Gilchrist counties would be closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 a.m. EDT, Gordon's center was near 29.8 north latitude,
82.8 west longitude, or about 30 miles west-northwest of
Gainesville. The storm was moving north-northeast near 12 mph with
top sustained winds near 50 mph, but was forecast to weaken as it
travels overland.
</P>
<P>
   A voluntary evacuation had been recommended in Cedar Key before
the storm came ashore, but many residents preferred to wait out the
storm at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their words are like, 'We've always stayed, we're staying this
time,''' Mayor Heath Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm knocked out electricity to much of the city earlier
Sunday, but most residents had power restored by midnight. Debris
and broken tree limbs littered the empty streets.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a pleasant surprise because it could have gotten
stronger out there,'' said Dan Sandsler, 41, whose family owns a
waterfront restaurant and bar. ''It was disorganized before it got
here, so we kind of dodged the bullet here.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of about 121,000 homes throughout the state were hit
with power outages, as leading bands of the storm brought heavy
rains ashore over central Florida's Gulf Coast. The state's two
largest utilities were working to restore power to customers Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding was reported in southwest Florida, said Michael Loehr,
operations chief for the State Emergency Operations Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've already gotten calls from Charlotte County saying
they've got houses on the coast where you open the front door, the
water's coming in; you open the back door, water's going out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's top sustained winds fell from 75 mph early Sunday to
about 70 mph by late afternoon, just below the 74 mph threshold for
a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The storm weakened as it neared land and also pulled in dry air
from the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern United States, said Hugh
Cobb, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came out good I think, we were very fortunate,'' said
Frances Nesbitt, a Cedar Keys real estate agent. ''I'm not for
hurricanes by any means, but Florida's been having a drought. The
only good thing it does, it raises the water level.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said a storm surge of 5 to 8 feet would lessen by
Monday morning. Cedar Key sits two to three feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   There was a threat of isolated tornadoes near the east coast of
Georgia on Monday morning, forecasters said. At least one tornado
was reported Sunday evening in Palm Beach County, the National
Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials reported about 750 people were taking advantage
of shelters around the state, dozens of flights were canceled at
Tampa International Airport, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays baseball
game with the Oakland A's was called off.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuations were ordered for low-lying areas and mobile home
parks in Citrus and Taylor Counties north of Tampa, and five
counties - Pinellas, Hillsborough, Manatee, Hernando and Pasco -
were under voluntary evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm warning was still in effect for the Florida
Gulf Coast from Anclote Key to St. Marks, and on the Atlantic coast
from Flagler Beach in north Florida, up to Little River Inlet, S.C.
A tropical storm watch also remained in effect north of Little
River Inlet to the North Carolina-Virginia border.
</P>
<P>
   In Sarasota and Pinellas Counties, streets that typically flood
during strong summer thunderstorms were under a few feet of water.
Officials reported four minor car accidents, but no injuries and no
substantial wind damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Courtney Campbell Causeway linking Clearwater and Tampa
across the Hillsborough Bay was shut early Sunday evening due to
high winds. In Levy County, State Road 24 to Cedar Key was closed
and State Road 40 to Yankeetown was partially closed.
</P>
<P>
   Two hurricane watchers from Atlanta who had hoped to watch the
storm's approach were disappointed by Gordon's force.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been chasing hurricanes for about 15 years,'' John
Tyler, a pizza delivery man, said before the storm made landfall.
''It's real weak. ''It's too dry and cool to get much stronger.''

<HEADLINE> Colorado Fire Forces Evacuations  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE VOGT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Firefighters worked through the night to
protect homes as erratic winds threatened to push an out-of-control
800-acre wildfire toward more than 130 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Incident Commander Joe Hartman said 80 to 100 homes were in
immediate danger as firefighters and home owners cleared brush from
around houses and crews manned fire engines to stop the flames.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far we've been able to slow it down and burn it out around
the homes,'' Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   As constantly shifting winds fanned the flames Sunday, fire
managers were doubtful they could contain the blaze. The
containment figure, originally estimated at about 15 percent, had
been revised late Sunday to zero, said fire information officer
George Broyles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was fairly extreme fire behavior,'' Broyles said, adding
that the fire at times was jumping from tree to tree. ''It made
some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   About 450 firefighters dug shallow trenches on steep
mountainsides, lit fires at strategic points and made aerial drops
of fire-retardant slurry to keep the flames from spreading. More
crews, air tankers and helicopters were expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of residents remained evacuated from the mountain
neighborhood Sunday. Some returned to chop down trees and help
protect homes while others anxiously watched firefighters' efforts
from nearby ridges.
</P>
<P>
   The fire's thick pall of smoke spread eastward for miles from
the canyons and foothills about 12 miles southwest of downtown
Boulder. Temperatures in the 90s and low humidity dried out grass
and pine needles in the fire's path.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been living with this threat for years,'' said Steve
Walters, who watched his house from a ridge, but lost sight of it
because of the thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Resident Susan Femmer was unable to use her electric chain saw
to clear out trees surrounding her hilltop home because power to
the area had been cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ''It breaks your heart because it is so beautiful,'' Femmer said
as she planned to find a gasoline-power chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Officials had ordered voluntary evacuations in a half-dozen
subdivisions, and about 200 people had left, Broyles said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started last week on county-owned open space. Larry
Stern of the sheriff's office said it was probably manmade, despite
restrictions or outright bans on open fires across much of the
drought-stricken state.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze was the fifth major wildfire in Colorado this season.
Two forced Mesa Verde National Park to close temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Two others burned more than 10,000 acres each, one southwest of
Denver and one east of Rocky Mountain National Park.
</P>
<P>
   In central South Dakota, a series of lightning-sparked fires on
Sunday joined into a blaze that was estimated at 25,000 acres. Some
of the wildfire was burning at the Houk Ranch, a region made famous
by the movie ''Dances With Wolves,'' starring Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6.7 million acres have burned across the United States
this year, among the nation's worst fire seasons in a half century.
The National Interagency Fire Center reported 23 fires burning in
Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oklahoma, South
Dakota and Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Shatner Explains Book Inspiration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) -- William Shatner says his grief over the death
of his third wife last year inspired him to write ''Star Trek
Preserver,'' the best-selling novel released in July.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Capt. James T. Kirk, the character he played on TV
and in film, struggles to save his dying wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''When someone dies, for a while you want to make some meaning
out of a life,'' Shatner tells the Sept. 23 issue of TV Guide.
''You go on a spiritual journey. And hopefully, you don't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Shatner's wife Nerine drowned in the family's swimming pool in
August 1999. The coroner ruled that alcohol and the sedative Valium
contributed to the accidental drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loss of someone you love is horrible enough. But to do it
with the public, with the media at your heels, is almost
unendurable,'' Shatner said.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) -- World Wrestling Federation superstar Chyna

Playboy.
</P>

   ''A body like mine has been rejected for so many years,'' the

   Chyna says the Playboy spread is not a ''sexual thing.''

   ''It was, 'Look at me. Here I am.' Now people love the body.
It's about damn time.''

   Chyna is also featured in the WWF's first workout video, out

   CEDAR KEY, Fla. (AP) - Most of the 800 residents in this rustic

Gulf Coast.
</P>

<HEADLINE> US-China Relations Face Big Changes  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's generally agreed that the China trade
bill the Senate is set to pass lays the basis for one of the most
profound changes in U.S.-China relations since the first American
ship, the Empress of China, arrived in Canton 216 years ago with 28
tons of ginseng herbs from the slopes of Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the dream of feeding and clothing what is now
one-fifth of the world's population has constantly been thwarted by
war, economic turmoil and revolution. That could be about to
change, although some warn it's too great a risk to American
security and political interests.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it's an exceptional deal. On Tuesday, the Senate is
certain to pass, and send to President Clinton for his signature,
legislation that ends the annual battle over China's trade status
and confers permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, American businesses will benefit from the
drastically lower tariffs and market-opening measures China is
committed to as part of its impending entry into the World Trade
Organization. The United States, which already has open markets,
makes no economic concessions as part of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the biggest trade vote this country has had in the
last 25 years, and will be the most significant in the next quarter
century,'' said Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said the trade pact would contribute
to a relationship that over the next 20 to 30 years ''is going to
have a very direct effect on the quality of life in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes with its entry into the WTO, China will
slash tariffs on U.S.-made goods from 25 percent in 1997 to 9
percent by 2005. Tariffs on high tech products will be eliminated,
and on autos will drop from at least 80 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Josten said China needs to invest $750 billion over the next
several years in infrastructure, everything from roads to plumbing
where U.S. companies excel. ''It's like building a Boston airport
every two months. It's huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all this, there's no guarantee that the growing U.S.
trade deficit with China, which hit $68 billion, will be reduced.
That depends too much on growth rates and exchange rates in the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Critics note there's also no guarantee China will abide by its
promises. Japan, a much closer U.S. partner, has for decades
succeeded in keeping American businessmen out.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO president John Sweeney, in testimony to the Senate
earlier this year, said the United States and China have entered
into four bilateral agreements since 1992 -- on market opening,
prison labor, intellectual property rights and textiles -- and ''the
Chinese government has failed to live up to its obligations in all
four cases.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always going to be tension. The hard part is going to
be implementation,'' Baucus acknowledged. But Marino Marcich of the
National Association of Manufacturers said the Chinese, under the
WTO, ''will be bound by a far more elaborate system of rules'' than
Japan faced in its disputes with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also warn that by granting permanent trade status the
United States is throwing away a crucial means of getting China to
stop weapons proliferation and improve its human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress is debating permanent trade relations, Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
told colleagues that China's human rights record has deteriorated
and its threats to Taiwan have increased. The Senate, ''amidst all
the high-pressure tactics, must no confuse business interests with
the national interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking away the trade leverage, said Sweeney, will ''make it
easier for the Chinese government to go on repressing its citizens
and violating every norm of international conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters counter that increased trade can only help the
reformers in China and lift more Chinese out of poverty, loosening
the grip of the hardliners.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., contended that the trade deal will
benefit U.S. security interests. ''When nations are trading with
each other they are rarely sending their armies against each
other,'' he told the Senate.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   --According to the Business Roundtable, an organization of U.S.
corporate leaders, California, which sold $3.5 billion worth of
products to China in 1998, will see increased opportunities in

   Christopher Michaelson, 21, was ''much improved, alert and
awake,'' said Leslie Hull-Ryde, a Navy spokeswoman in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Michaelson, 21, a boatswain's mate electrician from Fort Shaw,
Mont., fell from the deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln on Sept. 8,
said Lt. Cmdr. Denise Shorey, the ship's public affairs officer.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen visited Michaelson at
Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Hospital on Sunday. Cohen said he held
Michaelson's hand and spoke to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could not talk,'' Cohen said. ''But he was conscious. He
was aware of what I was saying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall it looks quite favorable for him, but he's been
through a pretty rough time,'' Cohen said. ''Thank goodness, he
seems to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaelson was spotted by a lookout, pulled from the water by a
helicopter and brought aboard ship about 45 minutes after he fell,
Shorey reported. Shorey declined to detail Michaelson's injuries.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore surges to 13-point lead over Bush  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Democrat Al Gore has surged to a 13-point
lead over Republican George W. Bush in New Jersey, according to a
new Star Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers poll released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven percent of those polled said they would vote for
Gore if the election were held today. Thirty-four percent favored
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests that Gore's performance at the Democratic
National Convention and his choice of Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman as his running mate significantly boosted his standing
among New Jersey voters. A June Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers poll
indicated Gore and Bush in a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests that New Jersey might no longer qualify as one
of the so-called battleground states in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like New Jersey is now Gore's to lose,'' said Cliff
Zukin, poll director and professor of public policy at Rutgers.
''At least for now, New Jersey has moved from a toss-up state into
the Democratic column.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll indicated minimal support for third-party presidential
candidates among Garden State voters. Ralph Nader, the Green Party
nominee, polled only 3 percent, while Reform Party candidate
Patrick Buchanan got 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results are based on interviews with 670 registered
voters between Sept. 6 and Sept. 13. The margin of error is plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also suggests that Gore has improved his image among
New Jersey voters. Sixty-three percent of those polled said they
had a positive view of Gore, with 30 percent holding a negative
view. The June poll had only 46 percent with a favorable view of
the vice president, 28 percent negative and 25 percent with no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent polls also indicate Gore in the lead in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A Gannett New Jersey poll taken in late August had Gore in a 39
percent to 32 percent lead among likely voters. The poll's margin
of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore led 49 percent to 37 percent in a Quinnipiac University
poll of registered voters released Aug. 24. The poll's margin of
error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Cops: Gunmen Release Nine  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY PRATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen released nine captives Monday from
a group of at least 40 people kidnapped the day before from two
restaurants and a family farm in southwest Colombia, police said.
One American citizen was among the remaining hostages, her freed
Colombian husband said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the mass kidnapping Sunday probably was the
work of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, Colombia's
second-largest guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 armed men, many wearing military-style uniforms and
bulletproof vests, barged into the restaurants in the highlands
outside the city of Cali on Sunday, police said, taking 36 people.
Gunmen also seized four people from a nearby farm.
</P>
<P>
   Physician Eduardo de Lima, who was released due to cardiac
problems, said his wife Elena, seized along with him from their
farm outside Cali, is a U.S. citizen who has lived in Colombia for
34 years.
</P>
<P>
   Men with rifles, pistols and sawed-off shotguns burst into their
home and dragged them away, along with de Lima's sister and nephew.
They and dozens of other people seized from two restaurants were
then driven into the mountains, de Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told us to be still and that nothing would happen to
us,'' he told RCN radio.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate demands for ransom or claims of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The mass kidnapping recalled the ELN's May 1999 abduction of 150
worshippers at a Roman Catholic Mass in Cali. All those hostages
have since been released.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything indicates that it was the ELN,'' National Police
director Ernesto Gilibert told RCN.
</P>
<P>
   Police told journalists at the scene of Sunday's kidnapping that
it may have been carried out by the ELN working with members of
Colombia's biggest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   In past mass kidnappings, rebels have sought both ransoms and
political concession from the government.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-takers struck where many residents of Cali go to
escape the tropical city's sweltering heat for a drive into the
nearby mountains and a Sunday meal. The two restaurants that were
targeted are among many that line the Via Al Mar, or Highway to the
Sea, which meanders toward the Pacific Ocean, 45 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has one of the highest kidnapping rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of this year, 1,750 people were kidnapped,
according to Free Country Foundation, a private group. The FARC was
responsible for 477 and the ELN 381 of the kidnappings, Free
Country said.

<HEADLINE> UN Scales Down W. Africa Operation  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The U.N. refugee agency said Monday it has scaled
down operations along the Guinea-Liberia border in West Africa
because of fighting that left one worker dead and another missing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees stopped work in the
Guinean town of Macenta since the head of its mission, Mensah
Kpognon, 50, was killed Sunday by gunmen at his home. Another
staffer, Sapeu Laurence Djeya, was kidnapped during the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is still fighting in the area,'' said UNHCR spokesman
Ron Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Nonessential UNHCR personnel were to remain in their homes and
all dependents of international staff were being taken to Conakry,
the capital of Guinea, Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   Guinea hosts more than 460,000 refugees, one of the largest
refugee populations in Africa. About 330,000 are from Sierra Leone
and 126,000 from Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Because of security concerns, UNHCR operations -- and those of
other agencies and charities -- may be scaled back, Redmond said.
</P>
<P>
   The main impact of the cutback would be on 10,000 Liberians who
crossed into Guinea about a year ago, said Kris Janowski, another
UNCHR spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberians are dependent on the agency for food and would
probably start running out of supplies only after several weeks,
Janowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 108,000 refugees in the area have been there
longer and have their own garden plots to supply food. The agency's
main service to them is to make sure authorities don't force them
back into Liberia, where they are perceived as opposition to the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''They might be in trouble,'' Janowski said.
</P>
<P>
   A still greater concern would be if the pullback spreads
westward, where the agency is caring for 300,000 refugees from
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia has accused Guinea of harboring rebels who crossed into
northern Liberia in July and have been fighting government forces
there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the refugees in the Macenta area are Liberian, but some
Sierra Leonean refugees have fled into the area recently following
attacks by Sierra Leonean rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's attack at the U.N. worker's home came less than two
weeks after three UNHCR staff members were killed by pro-Indonesia
militiamen in a West Timor office of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why are innocent, unarmed humanitarians like Mensah Kpognon, a
father of four children who was simply trying to make the world a
better place, being struck down in the most brutal way?'' asked
U.N. High Commissioner Sadako Ogata, who was in Herat, Afghanistan,
when word came of the latest attack.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. agency renewed its appeal for international help in
finding and freeing Djeya.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond said UNHCR had contacted all governments in the area,
particularly Liberia, because Djeya was last seen being taken by
her abductors toward Liberia. She was in Macenta after delivering
supplies from the UNHCR office in Danane, Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that the staff in Macenta had been
targeted because they worked for the agency, UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
   Many other buildings in the town were burned as the assailants
were retreating from Macenta following a pre-dawn raid on the
town's military garrison, said UNHCR. An unspecified number of
Guineans were also killed in Sunday's raid, UNHCR said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Troops Pursue Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Government troops pursued Muslim
rebels through jungles Monday in the third day of an assault to
rescue 19 hostages, but Philippine officials held back from saying
that all the captives were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Some Abu Sayyaf rebels fled to the coastlines of small southern
Jolo Island in an attempt to escape, Gov. Abdusakur Tan said. The
rebels are believed to have bought speedboats with some of the more
than $15 million ransom they received from Libya and Malaysia for
freeing other hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Civil defense officials said four civilians were confirmed dead.
More injured civilians were believed trapped inside a tight
military blockade of rebel areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 villagers fled to the Jolo capital, Zamboanga, and
were being housed in mosques and schools, Tan said, as mortars,
attack planes and helicopter gunships pounded rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the assault began Saturday, the military has overrun two
major Abu Sayyaf camps and smaller hide-outs but found no signs of
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Officials continued a news blackout on most details of the
assault, which the military said could last up to six days. But
they appeared less confident that all the hostages remained alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've not given them up yet,'' said presidential Press
Secretary Ricardo Puno. ''As far as we are concerned, we are
hopeful, we're optimistic that many of them will turn up safe and
sound, and can be recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Various Abu Sayyaf factions are holding an American, two French
journalists, three Malaysians, a Filipino kidnapped with a larger
group in April, and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists who came to
pray for the other hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Eight rebels have been killed and 20 captured in the three days
of fighting, while six government troops were wounded, military
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting continued in many scattered areas of Jolo's jungles,
Tan said.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation and telephone links to the island were cut by the
military.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada's decision to attack the rebels after
nearly five months of negotiations has been widely supported by
Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of members of the evangelists' Jesus Miracle Crusade,
however, demonstrated Monday to protest the assault.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have put the lives of all the hostages in great danger,''
said Brother Danny Cuarteros, a member of the crusade who was
earlier released by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   France, Germany and Malaysia have also expressed concern that
the attack would endanger the captives.
</P>
<P>
   But acting Foreign Secretary Franklin Ebdalin said the
Philippine government decided on the assault because ''all the
avenues of negotiations have been exhausted and there seems to be
no end to the cycle of hostage-taking.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zamboanga city, provincial health officer Nelsa Amin
assembled antibiotics, oxygen tanks and a team of surgeons to treat
the injured but was unable to find transportation to Jolo, about 85
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   She urged the military to temporarily halt the attack so that
wounded civilians could be located.
</P>
<P>
   Before their kidnapping spree began in March, the Abu Sayyaf had
fewer than 200 armed men. The number swelled to more than 3,000 as
the huge ransom payments attracted recruits, the military says.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Ivory Coast Gunbattle  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Mutinous soldiers attempting to kill
Ivory Coast's junta leader stormed his house Monday, but were
defeated by loyalist forces.
</P>
<P>
   Two presidential bodyguards were killed in the gunbattle, which
began about 3:30 a.m., Gen. Robert Guei, who came to power in a
December coup, told reporters. Four others were badly injured,
officials said, though it was not clear if they were mutineers or
presidential guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some young military people were more or less invited by
certain people known to me to make an attempt on my life,'' Guei
said in a nationally broadcast television address. He said he'd
been warned of a possible attack.
</P>
<P>
   Guei's home, in an upscale residential neighborhood on the edge
of downtown Abidjan, came under fire by ''isolated elements'' of
armed men, who were driven back by loyalists, Information Minister
Henri Cesare Sama said on state radio. Guei said the men were
dressed in civilian clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The counterattack was fatal, swift and hard,'' Sama said,
accusing ''opportunists'' of trying to destabilize Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came amid growing tensions in the military over pay
disputes and deep political and ethnic divisions ahead of
presidential elections scheduled for Oct. 22, which are to return
the country to civilian rule. Guei has declared himself a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers Monday expressed anger at Guei for declaring his
candidacy in upcoming presidential elections, a senior military
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't have any judgment on who it was,'' Guei told
reporters, adding: ''The people who did this are trying to make
sure the elections don't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted the elections would go forward, and said the
government ''will do everything to guarantee'' the security of
foreigners living in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of machine-gun fire echoed through the streets of
Abidjan, the main city in this West African nation, for about two
hours before ending just after dawn. While the fighting appeared to
have been confined to the area around Guei's house, machine-gun
fire could be heard across the city at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In at least one suburban neighborhood, young men took advantage
of the trouble, attacking passing cars with metal pipes and
attempting to stop the drivers and rob them.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed soldiers were deployed to key points around the
city, blocking roads around Guei's home and near broadcast
facilities for radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, after the shooting had ended, the streets of
Abidjan were busy with cars, buses and people walking, though most
stores remained closed.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict has been growing among Ivorian soldiers, who were
promised large bonuses in exchange for supporting the Dec. 24 coup
that toppled the government of former President Henri Konan Bedie.
The bonuses have only been partially paid and different amounts
were given to different units, increasing ill-feeling among the
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have also been flaring in recent days over the question
of whether Alassane Dramane Ouattara, a popular opposition leader,
will be allowed to run in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came into question after a new constitution was
adopted following a referendum in early August. A last-minute
amendment stipulates that both parents of presidential candidates
be ''of Ivorian origin'' -- a change widely believed to be aimed at
excluding Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara says both his parents were Ivorian. His opponents
insist they were from Burkina Faso. Ouattara is a former prime
minister and International Monetary Fund official who has been a
popular advocate for Ivory Coast's marginalized northern Muslims
and large immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Coulibaly of Ouattara's Rally of the Republicans party
accused the military regime Monday of issuing veiled threats
against the party and said he was worried the government was using
growing instability as a ''pretext'' to arrest Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Guei had lashed out at his opponents in a televised speech on
Sunday, warning: ''It's now the time of the sword.''
</P>
<P>
   While he did not specifically mention Ouattara or his party, the
speech was widely viewed as a threat against them.
</P>
<P>
   There have been two military mutinies since the Christmas Eve
coup, as the junta's initial burst of popularity waned. During the
last mutiny, in early July, mutinous soldiers demanded housing
bonuses worth $9,000 but eventually agreed to a sum of $1,600. Only
a fraction of that amount has been paid.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Ivorians, mainly Christian, also grown increasingly
resentful of the growing flood of northern ethnic groups, mostly
Muslim, seeking farm homesteads and jobs in the agriculturally rich
south. Last week, one village in southwestern Ivory Coast was
burned down and another abandoned in fighting between various
indigenous and migrant ethnic groups.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 67; Nasdaq Slips 61  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A selloff of blue chip and technology issues
pushed the stock market lower Monday as investors searched for
direction following Friday's big decline.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks left in the third quarter, corporate
profits again preoccupied the market.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 67.42 at 10,859.58. On Friday, the Dow fell more
than 160 points amid concerns about rising oil prices and company
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also down Monday. The Nasdaq
composite index fell 61.01 to 3,374.22, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index slipped 10.13 to 1,455.68.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, fixated on earnings, were quick to sell stocks that
warned of disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   ICG Communications fell $2.38 to $1.53, a nearly 61 percent
drop, after the telecommunications company warned of lower profits
as it tries to conserve cash and fix product problems that have
resulted in the loss of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette fell $2.06 at $27.75 after it warned its third-quarter
sales would be flat because of problems in its battery business and
continued weakness in the euro, the European currency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hearing a lot more about this euro/dollar weakness and
the market is trying to delineate which companies are going to be
affected,'' said Brian Belski, a vice president with U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray. ''That's why today you have a little more weakness
in the Dow stocks. They're old economy and multinationals are going
to be a little bit more affected by this.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors were also rewarding companies that delivered good
news.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City traded up 94 cents at $25.56 after it announced
earnings in line with Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm shares were up $3.88 at $70.13 on the Nasdaq market
after a First Union analyst upgraded its shares to ''strong buy''
from ''buy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, Amcol International was up 81 cents -- more
than 20 percent -- at $4.56 after the specialty chemicals and
minerals company announced it had hired an investment bank to
''explore strategic alternatives,'' including a possible sale,
merger or spinoff of one of its divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 3-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 422.75
million shares, well below the 638.79 million shares in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 8.94 at 521.94.

<HEADLINE> Off-duty Newark officer killed in motorcycle accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WOODBRIDGE, N.J. (AP) - An off-duty Newark police officer died
when the motorcycle he was driving collided with a pedestrian, who
was also killed, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Williams Jr., 27, was driving home in Woodbridge after
attending a bicycle race earlier Saturday when he collided with
Volodymyr Shcherbyak, 45, of Passaic, who was running across Route
9, police and family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was thrown from his 1998 Kawasaki motorcycle, and both
men were pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex County prosecutors were investigating the accident to
see whether excessive speed played a role in the collision,
Assistant Prosecutor Nicholas Sewitch said. Prosecutors also said
Shcherbyak was not crossing the street at a light or an
intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Williams joined Newark's police force four years ago after
serving five years as a military police officer in the U.S. Army.
Williams was assigned to the West District, but was one week away
from completing training for a new job as part of the city's
mounted-patrol unit, said police spokesman Sgt. Amilkar Velez.

<HEADLINE> Archdiocese, parish school settle with alleged sex abuse victim  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Archdiocese of New York settled a $150
million lawsuit Monday with a Bronx man who charged that a former
nun had sexually abused him when he was 12 and she was his seventh
grade teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the alleged victim, Brian O'Rourke, and for the
archdiocese refused to disclose details of the settlement, which
was sealed. They would say only that they were satisfied with the
result.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke, 25, had sued the former nun, Linda Baisi, 53; the
archdiocese; and the school, St. Frances de Chantal in the Bronx,
for $150 million over what he said was five years of sexual abuse
that began when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   In opening statements, Michael Dowd, O'Rourke's lawyer, called
Baisi a ''sexual predator'' and lawyers for the archdiocese and the
school acknowledged that Baisi had sexually exploited the youth.
</P>
<P>
   Baisi never came to court. Her lawyer, Brian O'Dwyer, said she
could not finance a defense or pay a judgment, so there was no
reason for her to be there. He refused to say where she is or what
she is doing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Rourke said his affair with Baisi, his homeroom and English
teacher at the Throgs Neck area school, subjected him to his
classmates' ridicule, drove him to alcoholism and drug abuse, and
caused him to have sexual problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd disputed claims by lawyers for the archdiocese and the
school that no one in authority knew about the affair. He said
every student and much of the faculty knew.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dowd said, an anonymous letter to the archdiocese
reported that Baisi was carrying on an improper relationship with
O'Rourke. Dowd said that letter disappeared before trial.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was reached in the second day of trial. O'Rourke,
a laboratory technician at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, said
only that he was satisfied with the outcome.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Cops: Gunmen Release 13  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY PRATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- Gunmen released 13 captives Monday from a
group of at least 40 people kidnapped the day before from two
restaurants and a family farm in southwest Colombia, police said.
An American woman was among those freed.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the mass kidnapping Sunday probably was the
work of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, Colombia's
second-largest guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 armed men, many wearing military-style uniforms and
bulletproof vests, barged into the restaurants in the highlands
outside the city of Cali on Sunday, police said, taking 36 people.
Gunmen also seized four people from a nearby farm.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. citizen Elena de Lima, kidnaped along with her Colombian
husband and two other family members from a farm outside Cali, was
freed on Monday. Her husband, Eduardo, had been released
late-Sunday, however his sister and nephew remain hostages.
</P>
<P>
   De Lima, who has live in Colombia for 34 years, told Caracol
radio she had been freed in order to deliver to a wealthy
brother-in-law ransom demands for her husband's nephew and sister.
</P>
<P>
   They were seized by men with rifles, pistols and sawed-off
shotguns burst into the family's home. They and dozens of other
people seized from two restaurants were then driven into the
mountains, de Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told us to be still and that nothing would happen to
us,'' he told RCN radio.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate demands for ransom or claims of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The mass kidnapping recalled the ELN's May 1999 abduction of 150
worshippers at a Roman Catholic Mass in Cali. All those hostages
have since been released.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything indicates that it was the ELN,'' National Police
director Ernesto Gilibert told RCN.
</P>
<P>
   Police told journalists at the scene of Sunday's kidnapping that
it may have been carried out by the ELN working with members of
Colombia's biggest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   In past mass kidnappings, rebels have sought both ransoms and
political concession from the government.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-takers struck where many residents of Cali go to
escape the tropical city's sweltering heat for a drive into the
nearby mountains and a Sunday meal. The two restaurants that were
targeted are among many that line the Via Al Mar, or Highway to the
Sea, which meanders toward the Pacific Ocean, 45 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has one of the highest kidnapping rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   During the first half of this year, 1,750 people were kidnapped,
according to Free Country Foundation, a private group. The FARC was
responsible for 477 and the ELN 381 of the kidnappings, Free
Country said.

<HEADLINE> Manhattan teen indicted in horse stable blaze  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A grand jury has indicted a teen-ager on charges
he killed 21 horses at a Brooklyn stable by starting a fire ''for
his amusement.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes, who announced the
indictment Monday, called the incident ''a vicious and twisted act
that boggles the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges Frank Esposito, 17, of Manhattan, with
multiple counts of arson, reckless endangerment, criminal mischief,
cruelty to animals and drug possession.
</P>
<P>
   Police allege that while smoking marijuana at the Bergen Beach
Stables in the Mill Basin neighborhood on June 10, Esposito
purposely ignited a clump of hay and ''watched it burn for his
amusement.'' He allegedly left the hay burning inside the 46-stall
wooden barn, which was quickly engulfed by flames.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one horses, most of them privately owned, died in the
fire. Three other horses in the stable were unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the most serious charge - third-degree arson -
Esposito would face up to 15 years in prison. His attorney did not
immediately return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant is free on $75,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die After Fall in Swiss Alps  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRINDELWALD, Switzerland (AP) -- A New Zealander and a Briton
were killed in a fall while they were trying to climb the
forbidding North Face of the 13,024-foot Eiger in the Swiss Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Bern cantonal police also confirmed that a crew from a British
television crew captured the fall on video. Police said the camera
crew gave them a copy of their tape.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to identify the victims. But British news reports
identified them as Matthew Hayes, 31, of Hampshire and New
Zealand-born Phillip O'Sullivan, 26, a resident of West Sussex,
England.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred Tuesday on the lower part of the
mountain's Second Icefield. The upper climber lost his grip and
pulled the second, who was tied to him by a rope, after him, the
SonntagsBlick newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men fell nearly 2,000 feet. The bodies were recovered
Wednesday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Face, a daunting 5,905-foot wall of crumbling
limestone dubbed ''The Ogre'' by climbers, is considered Europe's
greatest challenge to mountaineers. More than 700 people have
climbed the North Face since the first successful ascent in 1938,
but 50 others have been killed.

<P>
	   NEPTUNE, N.J. (AP) - A group of mayors in Monmouth County is
seeking a state law to let them pass the processing fees on credit
card transactions to those who use cards to pay municipal court
fines.
</P>
<P>
   The Two Rivers Council of Mayors says allowing payment by credit
card increases collection rates, but said it is unfair that the
fees are paid by taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which represents 14 towns by the Navesink and
Shrewsbury rivers, said it will ask the New Jersey Conference of
Mayors to join them, the Asbury Park Press of Neptune reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Visa and Master Card add 2 percent to 2.5 percent to a
transaction for processing, while American Express has a 4 percent
surcharge, the council said.
</P>
<P>
   The courts cannot pass that along to offenders without
legislative action, the council said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Leader Fires Police Chief  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- An hour before meeting the U.S.
Defense secretary on Monday, Indonesia's president announced the
dismissal of the national police chief for failing to arrest the
youngest son of former President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   In firing Gen. Rusdihardjo, President Abdurrahman Wahid alluded
to a series of bombings, including one that killed 15 people
beneath the Jakarta Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recent security developments require changes,'' Wahid told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   After their hour-long meeting, Defense Secretary William Cohen
warned of possible economic sanctions against Indonesia unless
army-sponsored militias are disbanded on the divided island of
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said President Clinton was disappointed that Jakarta had
done little to rein in the thugs who killed an American and two
other U.N. aid workers in West Timor on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who is on a six-nation Asian tour, demanded action
against the militias in West Timor, who oppose independence for
neighboring East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The militias must be disarmed,'' Cohen told reporters. ''They
must be disbanded. They must be held accountable. That is something
the (military) and the government must be dedicated to.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure to do so ''will have certainly some serious financial
implications,'' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Indonesia meets with aid donors in Tokyo to
negotiate a new round of financing for its debt-ridden economy. The
World Bank has said the success of the meeting will rest on
Jakarta's ability to disband the militias in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also reiterated that U.S. aid to the Indonesian military --
suspended last year -- will not resume until the generals
demonstrate their commitment to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's firing of Rusdihardjo is a slap in the face for
Indonesia's armed forces, which reigned supreme during Suharto's 32
years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the police force had been an integral part of
the military, which Wahid has battled to subdue as part of wider
democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure of the police force to act on Wahid's order to
arrest Suharto's son Tommy has weakened his image as a leader in
control.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's head of Parliament, Akbar Tandjung, on Monday urged
Wahid to take firmer measures to prevent terrorist attacks, but
criticized his order to arrest Suharto's youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in the new era. You cannot arrest someone if you don't
have evidence,'' Akbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives questioned Tommy Suharto on Saturday, but said there
was no evidence to hold the 38-year-old multimillionaire, who
denied involvement in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the bomb attacks. The
explosions have coincided with major developments in a corruption
case against former President Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid said Rusdihardjo, who was appointed to head Indonesia's
200,000-member police force after the president assumed office last
October, would be replaced temporarily by his deputy, Lt. Gen.
Bimantoro. Many Indonesians use one name.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's security has been tightened, but the president said: ''I
don't know about any threat about blowing me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian shares nose-dived Monday as the Jakarta Stock
Exchange reopened for the first time since the bombing there.

<HEADLINE> Hamilton teachers back to school; vote on tentative contract set for Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAMILTON, N.J. (AP) - Two days after reaching a tentative
contract agreement, striking Hamilton Township teachers and their
students hit the books Monday in a belated start of the school
year.
</P>
<P>
   The district's approximately 1,100 teachers and nearly 400 other
union members were scheduled to vote on the contract offer after
school Tuesday and were expected to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Mellk, the attorney for the Hamilton Township Education
Association, said Monday that the teachers and the district ''have
arrived at an agreement they can both live with, and they're
looking forward ... to getting back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the teachers are very excited to be back in the
classroom,'' Mellk said.
</P>
<P>
   Voting on the three-year contract was to be held between 1 and 7
p.m. Tuesday inside one of the 13,000-student district's schools,
according to Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey
Education Association teachers union.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement, reached Saturday morning after an
overnight bargaining session, calls for the teachers to receive
raises totaling 13.55 percent. The teachers would receive a 4
percent raise in the first year, followed by raises of 4.75 percent
in the second year and 4.8 percent in the final year, according to
Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials originally sought a total increase of 15
percent. The board responded with an offer of a 12.3 percent raise
over the three years. The two sides worked toward a compromise
figure during several lengthy negotiation sessions since the
teachers, who had been without contract since June 30, went on
strike on Sept. 6, what would have been the first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph said the other main sticking point in the negotiations
was the district's wish to shift teachers to a different dental
insurance plan without providing any advance information or a
process to appeal disputed claims. The district eventually agreed
to provide information on the exact level of benefits and set up an
expedited arbitration process for teachers dissatisfied with
decisions about coverage, she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the teachers' return to the classroom, the state judge
overseeing the dispute canceled a Monday morning hearing with
lawyers for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   No new hearing has been scheduled. Superior Court Judge Anthony
J. Parrillo still must sort out whether the teachers, their union
and other workers who supported their strike can afford to pay
fines he levied when the teachers ignored the back-to-work order he
issued after teachers skipped the first day of school.
</P>
<P>
   Parrillo ordered the teachers' union to pay a fine of $100,000
for each day the teachers stayed on the picket lines, rather than
in classrooms, starting on Sept. 11. He also ordered fines of $300
per day for individual teachers who did not report to work, and $50
per day for school secretaries and skilled workers, such as
electricians, who have valid contracts but honored the teachers'
picket lines.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Embrace Opposition Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Stanko Saric pushed his way past the
women holding babies and farmers extending their hands. In front at
last, he handed a jar of his prized honey to the man challenging
Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see?'' Saric said, his black mustache twitching in
excitement, after shaking the hand of candidate Vojislav Kostunica.
''I can talk to him! He is the one I want for my president.''
</P>
<P>
   Saric is only one of the thousands swarming to see Kostunica, a
law professor who has dared take on Milosevic in Sunday's vote.
Wherever Kostunica goes, from village to town across Serbia, people
rush to embrace him -- an ordinary man like themselves who has
rekindled faith long lost among the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowds are feverish, chanting with passion and
conviction. More than 20,000 spilled onto the streets last week in
Novi Sad, an opposition stronghold, to wave banners and thunder in
unison: ''Kostunica, save us from this madhouse!''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments flow easily from those suffering the fatigue of
Milosevic's decade in power -- four Balkan wars, international
isolation and economic misery -- though people realize he surely
will not relinquish power without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   They rush to see the soft-spoken academic who dares campaign,
going door-to-door throughout this troubled land of 10 million --
unusual in a country where the aloof Milosevic keeps away from
masses.
</P>
<P>
   He has even inspired suggestions that his candidacy fulfills an
old prophecy that Serbia would one day be saved by a man with the
same family name as his ancestral village.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Kostunica, whose roots go back to Kostunici, a village on
the slopes of Mount Suvobor. The 400 peasants living there today
swear his name alone is proof he is the country's savior.
</P>
<P>
   The no-frills Kostunica, 56, seems an unlikely hero. He's never
held a major office, speaks in low monotones and is known for gray
suits and dark circles under his eyes. Though he once dreamed of
playing professional basketball, constitutional law proved more
absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   More important to voters, though, he has never been involved in
the scandals and shady deals linked to ruling officials. His
campaign poster simply reads: ''Who can look you straight in the
eyes?''
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the bursts of euphoria at his rallies, the shy
professor seems startled and says he ''only wanted to talk to the
people, hear their troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I am encouraged by all this rebirth of hope, but I
am also aware of the tremendous responsibility,'' Kostunica said.
''Along with despair, decade-long bitterness and humiliation, there
is faith in some sort of divine justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Picked by an alliance of 18 opposition parties, Kostunica has
long hovered on the fringes of Serbia's political scene. A fervent
anti-communist, he was fired in 1974 from Belgrade Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, Milosevic's Socialists offered him his job
back, but Kostunica refused, founded the Democratic Party of Serbia
and has led it ever since. He was always critical of the ''falsely
reformed, renamed communists, like Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's personal and political consistency, steadfast belief
in rule of law and Serb patriotism are qualities that endear him to
average voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''He appeals to all, disillusioned nationalists,
traditionalists, monarchists, urbanites, farmers, refugees and the
young,'' says Belgrade analyst Aleksandar Tijanic. ''In a fair
ballot, Kostunica would undoubtedly win.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country still recovering from NATO bombings last year and
where Milosevic scorns opponents as Western stooges, Kostunica has
succeeded in mixing the right dose of criticism and tactical
distance from the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to make our peace with Europe and the world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, Milosevic paid little heed to Kostunica's
campaign, despite trailing him in every independent opinion poll.
But when Kostunica came to a northern Serb enclave in Kosovo,
Milosevic supporters pelted him with stones, hitting him squarely
under the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica simply wiped the blood from his cheek and suggested
that Milosevic must be frightened in order to react with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, he warned the throngs in Novi Sad that the president
was ready to rig the vote or even resort to force to secure a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic's regime has stolen years of our lives,'' Kostunica
said as he wrapped up the rally. ''And now it's preparing the theft
of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president, charged with war crimes by a U.N.
tribunal, has taken steps to ensure victory: refusing to permit
independent Western monitors, tightening control of media and
cracking down on opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic has failed to snuff out faith that change is
possible -- as the crowds that greet Kostunica testify.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he leaves Novi Sad to head home to his wife, Zorica,
two cats and dog in a Belgrade apartment, peasants are burning the
chaff of the wheat to prepare the soil for next year's harvest.
</P>
<P>
   His caravan drives through the glow of the fires and treads on.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 93; Nasdaq Drops 113  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A selloff of blue chip and technology issues
pushed the stock market lower Monday as investors searched for
direction following Friday's big decline.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks left in the third quarter, corporate
profits again preoccupied the market.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 93.32 at 10,833.68. On Friday, the Dow fell more
than 160 points amid concerns about rising oil prices and company
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also down Monday. The Nasdaq
composite index fell 113.05 to 3,772.18, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index slipped 17.49 to 1,448.32.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been uneasy in recent weeks as more economic data
suggests that the economy is moderating. While the slower growth
rate makes it less likely the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates for a seventh time in the last 15 months, it's not clear what
the change in the economy will mean for company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The market's skittishness about earnings was again evident
Monday as investors unloaded stocks of companies that warned of
disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   ICG Communications fell $2.22 to $1.69, a nearly 57 percent
drop, after the telecommunications company warned of lower profits
as it tries to conserve cash and fix product problems that have
resulted in the loss of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette fell $2.19 at $27.63 after it warned its third-quarter
sales would be flat because of problems in its battery business and
continued weakness in the euro, the European currency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hearing a lot more about this euro/dollar weakness and
the market is trying to delineate which companies are going to be
affected,'' said Brian Belski, a vice president with U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray. ''That's why today you have a little more weakness
in the Dow stocks. They're old economy and multinationals are going
to be a little bit more affected by this.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors were also rewarding companies that delivered good
news.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City traded up $1.13 at $25.75 after it announced
earnings in line with Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Amcol International was up 88 cents -- more than 20 percent -- at
$4.63 after the specialty chemicals and minerals company announced
it had hired an investment bank to ''explore strategic
alternatives,'' including a possible sale, merger or spinoff of one
of its divisions.
</P>
<P>
   And Qualcomm shares were up $2.63 at $68.88 after a First Union
analyst upgraded its shares to ''strong buy'' from ''buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a nearly 3-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 649.89 million
shares, well below the 833.85 million shares in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 13.20 at 517.68.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Sentences Six To Death  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A military court on Monday sentenced six
Muslim militants to death by hanging for planning terror attacks
against U.S. and Israeli targets in Jordan. All but four remain at
large and were tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   The three-man State Security Court acquitted six other men and
handed down prison terms ranging from 7&AMP;frac12; years to life on the
remaining 16 defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling absolved all 28 men, including 12 fugitives tried in
absentia, of ''affiliation with an illegal organization'' --
al-Qaeda allegedly led by Saudi militant Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, who has taken refuge in Afghanistan, is wanted by the
United States for the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania that killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
   The accused, who had pleaded innocent and denied links to bin
Laden, claiming their confessions were obtained under duress, often
interrupted the verdict with calls of ''Allahu Akbar,'' or God is
great.
</P>
<P>
   They stood in the dock wearing dark blue prison uniforms and
long beards, some clutching the Muslim holy book, the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 men appearing in court -- 14 were Jordanians of
Palestinian origin, one was an Iraqi and the other an Algerian. Of
the 16 in court, two were sentenced to death. The other four
sentenced to death are fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Tayel Raqad, the presiding judge, said ''the charge of
being affiliated with an illegal group does not apply to any of the
defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian officials had maintained the men were a sophisticated
group with a global network behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Raqad, however, said that the men weren't organized and were
''merely exchanging ideas on carrying out terrorist attacks against
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the six sentenced to die ''had a determined will to
carry out terrorist attacks against American and Jewish interests
in Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   The targeted sites, the prosecution said, included Mount Nebo,
where tradition says Moses saw the promised land, and a Christian
settlement along the Jordan River said to be the site where Saint
John the Baptist baptized Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution had charged the 28 men with ''conspiracy to
carry out terrorist attacks'' against Israeli and American
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and Israeli embassies in Jordan declined comment on the
verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Sameeh Khreis, one of 11 defense lawyers, said capital
punishment ''was too harsh because there were no crimes that had
been actually carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   Special military forces toting machine guns were deployed around
the court building and some streets were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Abu Ghalous, 17 -- one of the six acquitted -- said: ''I am
so happy that this nightmare is over.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My preoccupation with the trial made me fail in my high school
exams this year,'' said the 12th grader, hugging family members.
''Now I can start my life anew.''
</P>
<P>
   Military prosecutor Lt. Gen. Mahmoud Obeidat has said the
plotters had been collecting explosive material 1996 from Arab
countries, including Syria and Iraq. Many of the suspects had
received military training in camps in Syria, Lebanon and
Afghanistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But defense witnesses testified that the acid and gunpowder
seized from the defendants were unfit to make explosives.

<HEADLINE> Study: NY Commuters Don't Wash Hands  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Apparently the city that never sleeps is also too
busy to wash up. A new survey of public restroom habits in five
U.S. cities finds New York commuters are least likely to clean
their hands after using the john.
</P>
<P>
   The results, released Monday, are the latest installment in the
American Society for Microbiology's effort to cajole folks into
following Mom's most basic hygiene advice.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the society sponsored a study to see how often
people take time for soap and water in restrooms. Researchers stood
around, endlessly combing their hair or putting on makeup, while
watching what people did. Or didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   They found that about one-third of Americans skipped washing. So
the society sponsored a ''clean hands campaign'' to educate folks
about the importance of hand washing in stopping the spread of
colds, diarrhea and other infectious diseases
</P>
<P>
   This month, they did the survey again. The result: Not much has
changed. If anything, Americans are even slightly more slovenly
than they were in 1996. Especially in New York City, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, 60 percent of folks using the rest rooms at
Grand Central and Penn stations washed up afterward. This time, it
was just 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To the microbiology society, made up of infection control
experts, this is serious business. ''Fifteen seconds of soap and
water and rubbing your hands is a wonderful way to get germs off.
We are not making a lot of progress,'' said microbiologist Judy
Daly of Primary Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City, the
society's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the New York train stations, the observers peeked at
bathroom habits at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, the Navy Pier
in Chicago, a Braves game in Atlanta and a casino in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   --Overall, 67 percent of people washed with soap and water and
then dried their hands.
</P>
<P>
   --The cleanest people were in Chicago, where 83 percent washed,
followed by 80 percent in San Francisco and 64 percent in New
Orleans and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   --Women were generally more likely than men to wash. The dirtiest
guys of all were at the Atlanta ball game. Just one-third stopped
to wash.
</P>
<P>
   --In a random telephone survey conducted at the same time, 95
percent of Americans claimed they wash their hands after using
public restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   --In the survey, about three-quarters of people said they also
wash before handling food or after changing a diaper.
</P>
<P>
   Microbiology officials released the data at their annual meeting
in Toronto. Without belaboring the obvious, they said that people
really should wash up after using a public restroom, no matter what
they do in there. It's just an environment where people are likely
to encounter a lot of germs, especially the ones that cause
diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's cheap, it's easy to do, and it works,'' noted Dr. Julie
Gerberding of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
''If we were really compulsive about washing our hands, we could
have a lot less colds.''
</P>
<P>
   Both years, the survey found similar differences in hand-
washing habits in the five cities. However, the researchers are not
sure what to make of this. Of course, folks in some places may
truly be cleaner than others. But other factors could also help
explain the difference, such as how crowded the restrooms are, how
clean or filthy they are and how big a rush people are in.

<HEADLINE> Prototype Fighter Jet Makes Flight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing's entry in the multibillion-dollar
competition to build the military's next fighter jet successfully
completed its first flight Monday, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is competing with Lockheed Martin to build the Joint
Strike Fighter, which would be used by the Navy, Air Force, Marines
and Britain's Royal Navy. The contract could be worth $220 billion
over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said its prototype X-32A took off from the company's
plant at Palmdale, Calif., and flew to Edwards Air Force Base,
about 40 miles away. ''The plane is a pleasure to fly,'' said test
pilot Fred Knox.
</P>
<P>
   The X-32A will undergo five months of flight tests.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the competition is expected to be named in 2001.
Production of an anticipated 3,000 fighters is not expected to
begin until 2007.

<HEADLINE> Ridership up 10 percent during first six months of year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - More than 36 million riders used the PATH
commuter rail line in the first six months of 2000, the highest
six-month total in nearly 40 years, the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent increase in ridership was more than twice the
increase of 4.1 percent for the same period last year, Port
Authority spokesman Steve Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The 36.1 million riders who boarded trains between lower and
midtown Manhattan and Newark, Jersey City and Hoboken were the
largest number of passengers in six months since the Port Authority
took control of the line from the Hudson and Manhattan railroad in
1962, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest increase on the system came on departures from
Manhattan's 33rd Street Station, where ridership rose from 3.4
million to 4 million, or 18 percent, the agency said. Ridership was
up 14.9 percent to 1.9 million at Jersey City's Pavonia-Newport
Station, and up 14.2 percent to 1.85 million at Jersey City's
Exchange Place station.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman attributed the increase to new development both near the
33rd Street station and along Hudson County's waterfront, which he
said could increase interstate commuting.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend ridership on the system also rose 8 percent in the first
half of the year to 165,144.
</P>
<P>
   About 249,000 people on average take PATH on weekdays.

<HEADLINE> Father, near tears, testifies in sex abuse case  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A man whose sons allegedly were
molested in their beds by a teacher he had invited to spend the
night recoiled Monday at the sight of the boys' bunks and
bedclothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I have to touch these?'' he asked, nearly weeping, as the
prosecutor asked him to identify comforters, NFL sheets and a baby
blanket.
</P>
<P>
   He pushed away a photo of the bunkbeds, tearfully saying, ''No.
They're gone,'' when Assistant District Attorney Lisa Linsky asked
him to describe it. After the judge ordered a recess, the father
said he had thrown away the beds as soon as police had finished
examining them.
</P>
<P>
   Defendant Steven Nowicki, meanwhile, seemed unperturbed,
comparing notes with his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki, 37, who was a fifth-grade teacher at Dobbs Ferry Middle
School, is accused of stealing into the boys' room on Jan. 1, 1999,
after the father, thinking him drunk, invited him to ''sleep it
off'' after a New Year's Eve party.
</P>
<P>
   The father testified that he hadn't thought about driving
Nowicki home rather than suggesting he stay over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't think of it,'' he said. ''I wish I did, but I
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Westchester County Court Judge Mary Smith ordered the last
remark stricken, as well as the man's comments about not wanting to
touch the bedclothes.
</P>
<P>
   The father testified that Nowicki, the last guest to leave the
houe party, walked out with a crystal wine glass in his hand and
without saying good-bye. Curious, the father went outside after him
and found him slumped over the steering wheel of his car. He said
he now doubts Nowicki was drunk and cannot recall seeing him drink
at the party.
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, defense attorney John Mangialardi
suggested that by backing off the claim that Nowicki was drunk, the
father was trying to bolster his $50 million civil suit, which
blames the Dobbs Ferry School District for hiring Nowicki. He
pointed out that two days after the incident, the father told
police Nowicki had been drinking beer, wine and vodka.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyer also brought out that in a deposition in the
civil case, the father had said, ''I personally had a conflict with
what I perceived to be a possibly gay individual,'' meaning
Nowicki. On the stand Monday, the father said he could not recall
any such conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The father said he got Nowicki to get out of his car and bed
down on the couch. He was awakened after 5 a.m. on New Year's Day
by his wife and 10-year-old son, who said ''some guy'' had molested
him. When he went into the boys' room to check on the younger son,
he found Nowicki on the floor and the 8-year-old boy in a fetal
position in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ''What are you doing in the boys' room?'' he said he asked
Nowicki. ''It's 5:30 in the morning and my wife and my son have
just accused you of molesting my children. Did you touch my
children?''
</P>
<P>
   He said Nowicki answered with an obscenity and added, ''Your
kids tell you something like that and you ask me that?''
</P>
<P>
   The father then ordered Nowicki out of the house. He said
Nowicki never denied the accusation but he let the teacher go
because, ''I didn't want to believe it was true.'' Since the
incident, the father said, his boys' schoolwork has suffered and
both have seen therapists. He said one therapist said of the boys'
feelings toward Nowicki, ''One wants him dead and one wants to get
rid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the father said, ''They don't trust me to protect
them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki, of Hastings-on-Hudson, is accused of sodomy, sexual
abuse and endangering children. If convicted he could be sentenced
to up to 25 years in prison.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration urged the United
Nations on Monday to establish a war crimes tribunal to try Saddam
Hussein and other Iraqi officials in the deaths of up to 250,000
civilians in Iraq, Iran, Kuwait and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at the National Press Club, David J. Scheffer,
ambassador at large for war crimes, said: ''It is beyond any
possible doubt that Saddam Hussein and the top leadership around
him have brutally and systematically committed war crimes and
crimes against humanity for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council is debating whether to set up an
International Criminal Court. Establishment of the court could take
two years, and it would lack jurisdiction over crimes committed
earlier, Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, he said, a special court is necessary to judge
Iraqi President Saddam's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Special tribunals already are sitting in judgment over war
crimes in Rwanda and former Yugoslavia. At the request of the
United States, the Yugoslavia panel has indicted Slobodan
Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, for crimes in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In its last months, the Clinton administration has stepped up an
already vigorous campaign against Milosevic and Saddam, accusing
the Serbian leader of intimidation and other tactics designed to
''steal'' Yugoslavia's presidential election in November and
alleging countless human rights abuses and crimes by Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a tribunal to hear charges against the Iraqi will not be
easy, as several Security Council members do not share the
administration's zeal to punish him. Scheffer suggested as an
alternative that a commission of experts be appointed to judge
Saddam and his associates. Or, Scheffer said, courts in various
nations may be able to investigate and indict Iraqi government
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our primary objective is to see Saddam Hussein and the
leadership of the Iraqi regime indicted and prosecuted,'' Scheffer
said,
</P>
<P>
   Detailing what he said the United States knows about Saddam's
record, Scheffer said approximately 5,000 Iranians were killed by
chemical weapons between 1983 and 1988 during the Iran-Iraq war, an
estimated 5,000 Kurdish civilians died from chemical weapons in the
Iraqi town of Halabja in 1988, and poison gas killed an estimated
50,000 to 100,000 Kurds in Iraq in 1987-1988.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Scheffer said, during Iraq's occupation of Kuwait in
1990-91 more than 1,000 Kuwaitis and nationals from other countries
were killed, and Iraq committed war crimes against American service
members.
</P>
<P>
   Many civilians were among 30,000 to 60,000 Iraqis killed by
Iraqi forces in suppressing an uprising that began in the south of
the country in 1991, after the end of the Persian Gulf War in
February. In addition, the country's southern marshes were drained,
beginning in the early 1990s, to deprive thousands of Iraqi Shiites
of their livelihoods, Scheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The use of poison gas and the draining of the marshes are crimes
against humanity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Scheffer said, Saddam has used murder, torture
and, lately, rape in a campaign against political opponents. And,
he said, Saddam is carrying out a systematic campaign of murder and
intimidation of clergy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein did not commit these
crimes on his own,'' Scheffer said. ''He has built up one of the
world's most ruthless police states, using a very small number of
associates who share with him responsibility for these criminal
actions.''

<HEADLINE> Joe and Ali Torre launch prostate cancer Web site  </HEADLINE>
By ULA ILNYTZKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Yankees manager Joe Torre remembers ''blanking
out mentally'' when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1999.
But his wife, Ali, took the situation in hand and together they
waded through the medical maze that eventually led to his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Torres helped launch ''Two Against One: Couples
Battling Prostate Cancer,'' a multimedia support and education
program that was billed as ''a spouse's guide to coping with
prostate cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The spouse plays such a major role in this fight against
prostate cancer,'' Torre said in a telephone interview. ''Once I
got diagnosed, I kind of blanked out mentally and my wife, Ali,
really kept a level head and put us on the road to start fighting
against this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali Torre added, ''I think, in the case of prostate cancer,
there are a lot of different options. It's like going through a
maze to try to absorb it and find your path to the right treatment.
Maybe that is why some men say, 'You make the decision for me.' But
I think it's healthier for the spouse to be an advocate, help him
sort through that information.''
</P>
<P>
   The Torres decided to get involved in ''Two Against One''
because the process of arriving at a treatment decision was such a
difficult one for them - a process that also offered little support
for the patient's spouse or partner.
</P>
<P>
   ''To my surprise, as we were going through the process of
recovery, we both realized we were going through similar
emotions,'' said Ali Torre. ''It was important for Joe and I to
communicate our feelings with each other because we were playing a
guessing game and trying to protect each other. Part of the process
of recovery is being able to be aware of those emotions and deal
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Two Against One,'' which includes a Web site, deals with those
emotional and medical decisions, with candid information on the
side effects that can result from treatment, including incontinence
and impotence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's difficult for some couples to discuss the
intimate parts of this disease,'' said Ali Torre, 43. ''It's very
important that you have this open communication so you can discuss
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Joe Torre: ''I've had to deal with side effects, but
compared to the ability to live a productive life, the side effects
are minimal in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, 60, eventually opted for surgery, and is in remission.
Other options include hormone therapy followed by radioactive seed
implants, the treatment which Mayor Rudolph Giuliani underwent on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two Against One'' was developed by the prostate cancer
advocacy group US TOO! International, Inc., the American Foundation
for Urologic Disease and an alliance of urologists and oncologists.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies Amgen and Praecis Pharmaceuticals are
sponsoring it.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 76; Nasdaq Drops 74  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A selloff of blue chip and technology issues
pushed the stock market lower Monday, furthering September's
downward trend as corporate profit warnings again preoccupied the
market.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks left in the third quarter and growing
anxiety, investors had little tolerance for stocks that even hinted
at disappointing earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 76.30 at 10,850.70. On Friday, the Dow fell more than 160
points amid concerns about oil prices and company profits.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell Monday. The Nasdaq composite
index fell 74.32 to 3,760.91, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
slipped 12.81 to 1,453.00.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the declines reflected investors' uncertainty about
the future in light of more economic data suggesting economic
growth moderating.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the markets are concerned about earnings going forward
and the effect the slowdown of the economy will have on them,''
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan
Associates. ''I would say overall markets are in a correcting
process and ... it has taken the failure of a succession of rallies
for investors to recognize this change.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said investors are also concerned about the weakness of
the euro, Europe's chief currency, and the effect higher oil prices
will have on corporate profits. The upcoming presidential election,
which looks to be a tight race, also has some investors on the
sidelines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The market's skittishness about earnings was again evident
Monday as investors unloaded stocks of companies that warned of
disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   ICG Communications fell $2.19 to $1.72, a nearly 56 percent
drop, after the telecommunications company warned of lower profits
as it tries to conserve cash and fix product problems that have
resulted in the loss of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette fell $2.38 to $27.44 after it warned its third-quarter
sales would be flat because of problems in its battery business and
continued weakness in the euro, the European currency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hearing a lot more about this euro/dollar weakness and
the market is trying to delineate which companies are going to be
affected,'' said Brian Belski, a vice president with U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray. ''That's why today you have a little more weakness
in the Dow stocks. They're old economy and multinationals are going
to be a little bit more affected by this.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors were also rewarding companies that delivered good
news.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City traded up $1.25 at $25.88 after it announced
earnings in line with Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Amcol International was up 94 cents -- 25 percent -- at $4.69after
the specialty chemicals and minerals company announced it had hired
an investment bank to ''explore strategic alternatives,'' including
a possible sale, merger or spinoff of one of its divisions.
</P>
<P>
   And Qualcomm shares were up $4.19 at $70.44 after a First Union
analyst upgraded its shares to ''strong buy'' from ''buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a nearly 3-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 759.64 million
shares, well below the 960.40 million shares in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 11.88 at 519.00.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Flood Death Toll Hits 109  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAM NONG, Vietnam (AP) -- Sitting under a ragged tarp alongside a
road, Tran Van No huddled with the few precious possessions he
managed to save from the water that swallowed his house: a bicycle,
his pig, a few pieces of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just afraid that a storm or strong wind will blow this
away,'' said No, a 40-year-old fisherman in Vietnam's Dong Thap
province. ''Then what will I have left?''
</P>
<P>
   Like No, an estimated 150,000 people in the Mekong Delta face an
uncertain future. Officials said Monday it could be two months
before floodwaters recede enough for them to return home.
</P>
<P>
   They don't know what the next day will bring or what the next
meal will comprise.
</P>
<P>
   A similar situation is in store for neighboring Cambodia, where
two months of floods -- the worst in 70 years -- have killed 109
people. In Vietnam, 27 people have died, including 18 children.
More than 1 million people have lost homes, lands, livestock,
property or relatives in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross appealed last week for $1.9 million in aid, with
the bulk going to Cambodia. Officials said this week an additional
appeal of up to $1.5 million will be launched for Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problems associated with this massive flooding will be
with us for months,'' said Richard Neville of the International
Federation of the Red Cross, who is advising the Cambodian Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   About 350,000 homes have been inundated in the four Vietnamese
Delta provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap, Long An and Kien Giang.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists say nearly half the provinces are submerged, with
water levels at or above those of 1996, when floods killed 217
people.
</P>
<P>
   People have taken shelter on earthen dikes or alongside roads
built on higher ground. Home is a shanty of plastic tarp and bamboo
poles.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the province, a few rooftops and telephone poles jut
above the water. But for the most part, the flooded rice paddies
resemble vast lakes shimmering into the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many families have to move two to three times because the
water keeps rising,'' said Nguyen Huu Hien of Long An's flood and
storm control bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Along a highway leading north from Dong Thap's provincial
capital of Cao Lanh, homeless families have set up threadbare
encampments beside the road.
</P>
<P>
   Under a small shelter she shares with her husband and two
children, Nguyen Thi Hue, 42, showed off her charcoal brazier, some
pots and a prized bottle of fish sauce.
</P>
<P>
   They are all she salvaged from her house lying just beyond the
road, she said, pointing to its weathered roof peeking above the
flood.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has forced neighbor to reach out to neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Duong Nua, 49, is among the lucky few to remain unscathed. He
harvested his last crop just days before the rains began in July.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing his good fortune, Nua offered up his large home, built
on high stilts, as shelter for 15 or 16 families at night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I give them a place to sleep because they are my neighbors,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cambodia, officials expect the raging Mekong River to fall in
coming weeks, but the next worry for aid workers is that people may
not have enough to eat, said Peou Samy, the top relief official in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our biggest concern,'' said Peou Samy, the
secretary-general of the National Committee for Disaster Relief.

<HEADLINE> Police officer pleads guilty to extortion, drug possession  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A Schenectady police officer indicted on
drug possession and extortion charges pleaded guilty in federal
court on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Barnett, 30, faces up to 20 years in prison on each of
the charges. He also faces fines totaling more than $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Barnett admitted that in August 1999, he and another officer
broke up a drug transaction in Schenectady's Hamilton Hill
neighborhood. Instead of arresting the suspect, Barnett said the
officers took his crack cocaine and let him go.
</P>
<P>
   The officers later gave the drugs to another person as a reward
for providing information about criminal activity, Barnett said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in August also charged Schenectady Police
Officer Michael Siler, 32, with the same counts. His case is
pending.

<HEADLINE> 'Dryness Disease' Gets Attention  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They call it the dryness disease. Its hallmark
symptoms of dry mouth and eyes at first are simply annoying -- until
they make patients' teeth fall out or damage eyesight.
</P>
<P>
   Sjogren's syndrome is no mere nuisance illness.
</P>
<P>
   Dryness is just the start of this mysterious, painful disease
that can gradually attack the joints, organs and nerves, affecting
more than 1 million sufferers. But it's so hard to diagnose that
patients spend years hunting a medical Sherlock Holmes to solve the
puzzling symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the ignorance, the National Institutes of Health
this week holds an unprecedented meeting to teach health workers
how to spot Sjogren's (pronounced ''show-grins'') and ease
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the meeting comes as an influx of new research -- ranging
from eye-lubricating hormones to attempts at artificial salivary
glands -- has experts hoping improved therapies finally may be on
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers now realize ''this is not just dry eyes and dry
mouth in little old ladies,'' explains Sjogren's expert Dr. Elaine
Alexander of San Diego's Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Sjogren's is an autoimmune disease, meaning patients' immune
systems create antibodies that attack their own tissue. Salivary
glands and eye glands that produce tears and oils that keep eye
moisture from evaporating often are damaged first. Tooth loss,
fungal infections, corneal abrasions are common; some people can't
hold a conversation without constant sips of water.
</P>
<P>
   But dryness isn't always the first symptom. Fatigue and
arthritis are common. Sjogren's can attack the thyroid, liver,
kidneys or pancreas. It damages nerves, causing numbness in hands
and feet. It can inflame blood vessels, called vasculitis. During
pregnancy, it can cause fetal heart defects. Patients even have a
44-fold increased risk of the cancer lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the diagnosis problem is that symptoms vary so widely,
and can range from mild to debilitating, says Dr. Stanley Pillemer
of the NIH's National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows Sjogren's cause. Ninety percent of patients are
women. Once thought a problem of old age, it actually can strike
quite young.
</P>
<P>
   Take Katherine Hammitt, whose first symptom came at age 15. She
wasn't diagnosed until 32, by then suffering tremendous joint pain
and numbing nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can so many people have a disease no one's ever heard
of?'' asks Hammitt, past president of the Sjogren's Syndrome
Foundation. ''You go to doctor after doctor. ... I went to a
neurologist for my numbness and when I could touch my nose, he
asked, 'Have you seen a psychiatrist?' After a while, you just quit
trying.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of treatments: Prescription pilocarpine and
cevimeline stimulate remaining salivary gland tissue to produce
more moisture. Moisturizing eye drops are standard. Some doctors
prescribe the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to reduce
inflammation, and steroids for severe symptoms like vasculitis.
</P>
<P>
   Now an array of new research attempts to pinpoint Sjogren's
attacks and improve therapy:
</P>
<P>
   --Dr. David Sullivan at Harvard Medical School discovered
Sjogren's patients have low levels of androgens, male sex hormones
like testosterone. Even women need a certain amount of
testosterone, and low levels are linked to inflamed and
dysfunctional eye glands. His lab created a testosterone eye cream
that he said Allergan Corp. should begin testing in clinical trials
soon to see if it restores eye-lubricating glands.
</P>
<P>
   --NIH's Sjogren's clinic is hunting patients for clinical trials
to see if certain inflammation-reducing drugs -- the rheumatoid
arthritis treatment Enbrel and thalidomide, that notorious birth
defect-causing drug now being cautiously used against some
intractable diseases -- can help.
</P>
<P>
   --NIH's Dr. Bruce Baum is attempting to use tissue engineering to
grow artificial salivary glands, and to insert new genes into
damaged salivary glands to make them secrete more saliva and block
the immune-system destruction. It's much more preliminary than his
colleagues' medication testing -- years away from clinical trials --
but experts say the research is promising enough to one day work.
</P>
<P>
   --Australian scientists recently discovered antibodies targeting
specific cell receptors may cause certain Sjogren's damage.
Alexander's Arena Pharmaceuticals is hunting drugs that might
protect those receptors and thus prevent dryness and nerve damage.

<HEADLINE> Clamming to resume in part of area near fuel leak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIDDLETOWN TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Clammers on Tuesday can resume
harvesting in part of the Monmouth County Bayshore that was closed
to shellfishing last week after a Navy supply ship spilled diesel
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The two clam purification plants, which handle about one-fourth
of all clams sold in New Jersey, were ordered to use additional
filtering until state authorities rescind the directive.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Marine Water Monitoring took the actions Monday,
four days after a tugboat helping guide the USS Detroit toward the
pier at the Earle Naval Weapons Station here collided with the
58,000-ton ship, ripping a 4-foot-by-4-inch hole in its side.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau lifted the ban on the Navesink and Shrewsbury rivers,
and most of Sandy Hook Bay to the east of the pier at the Earle
Naval Weapons Station, said Loretta O'Donnell, a spokeswoman for
the state Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The Raritan Bay to the west of the pier remains closed, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a problem, that's the area that it would be,''
O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
   The determination was based on a computer model provided by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanup crews finished work Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Earle spokeswoman Nancy Eldridge said Monday officials had no
estimate yet on how much of the fuel was recovered from the water
using absorbent booms and ''skimmer'' ships that glean it from the
water's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30,000 gallons of No. 2 diesel fuel that were spilled,
3,000 gallons were recovered, Eldridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Containment booms that cleanup ships had placed around the slick
on Thursday were wrecked during a storm early Friday, allowing it
to spread. Winds and high waves from the storm dissipated most of
the 4-mile-long slick on Friday, and there were no reports of fuel
washing up on any New Jersey beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The 23,000 acres of shellfish beds in northern Monmouth County
produce almost 40 million clams a year.
</P>
<P>
   The spill could also threaten other marine life and shore birds.
</P>
<P>
   Repairs to the USS Detroit were expected to be completed within
a week.

<HEADLINE> Prince Gives Gift To Polish Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Britain's Prince Andrew has given Poland's
leader a World War II-era encoding machine, thanking the country
for helping crack Nazi Germany's Enigma code.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Enigma codes would not have been broken if it were not for
the knowledge of Polish mathematicians,'' the prince told Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek as he presented an encoder taken from a
captured Nazi submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Poland has long said its mathematicians broke the Enigma code
used by the Nazis to send secret orders and messages. Until the
mid-1970s, the British had claimed it was solely their achievement,
a version that still appears in the respected Encyclopaedia
Britannica.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jon Bon Jovi says he had to take his shoes
off and unplug his guitar to make an impression.

   The rock star, who has been touring and making hit records for
nearly two decades, said he was terrified of disappointing a
celebrity-packed audience at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Debate on Cuba Embargo Upcoming  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With momentum growing in Congress to ease the
Cuba embargo, advocates on both sides will make their cases Tuesday
in one of the biggest official debates on the 38-year-old
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The planned hearing is part of an International Trade Commission
study that some Cuba experts describe as the most comprehensive
effort by a federal agency to determine how the embargo has
affected the Cuban and U.S. economies. The commission is an
independent, nonpartisan agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could almost say this is going to be the Woodstock of the
Cuba issue,'' John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and
Economic Council, said of the large anticipated crowd. ''But in
Woodstock, there were mostly people of like minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The large number of participants -- 36 as of Monday -- prompted
commissioners to add a second day of hearings
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been some congressional hearings with long witness
lists, but this is something else,'' said Philip Peters, vice
president of the Lexington Institute, a think tank.
</P>
<P>
   The commission study was requested by the House Ways and Means
Committee in March. A final report, due Feb. 15, won't make
recommendations about whether the sanctions should be lifted. But
that won't stop both embargo supporters and opponents from
facing-off at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Among those participating: Cuban exile groups that favor
sanctions to pressure Fidel Castro's government, humanitarian
groups who say the sanctions hurt innocent people, businesses and
agricultural groups that believe they would benefit from trade with
Cuba and others that believe they would be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has been receiving renewed attention with some farm-state
Republicans joining liberal Democrats in favoring the easing of
restrictions on the sales of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban exile movement, which favors maintaining the
sanctions, was weakened following the battle over Elian Gonzalez,
the young castaway who returned to Cuba after a long dispute
between his father and his Florida relatives. Also, the debate over
trade relations with China has made some lawmakers take a new look
at Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that sanctions could be eased have ''galvanized''
embargo supporters, said Dennis K. Hays, executive vice president
of the Cuban-American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no longer possible to sit on the sidelines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates of the embargo are skeptical about the study's
importance, noting that it was requested by an opponent of the
sanctions, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. They question the study's
ability to gauge how the United States and Cuba would be affected
if the embargo were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult to quantify the impact of what are you not
making,'' said Otto Reich, an international business consultant and
former ambassador to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts see the report as unique given the
commission's objectivity and independence. Two commission
economists visited Cuba in July, meeting with government officials.
They are also conducting a survey of U.S. businesses and trade
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Peters said the commission's report could be influential, given
the depth of its research and its objectivity
</P>
<P>
   ''They are authoritative, they don't have a dog in this fight,''
he said. ''They have tremendous resources, so they are going to be
able to do a pretty thorough look at the impact of the sanctions
and the potential trade that could flow.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Spy Chief Detained in Peru  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori's deposed security
chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, has been detained by the military,
Peru's independent CPN radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station, citing an unidentified military source, said
the order for the arrest was issued by Montesinos' close associate,
Gen. Jose Villanueva Ruestra, commander of Peru's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   A Defense Ministry spokesman declined to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   But Miguel Gutierrez, a reporter for the opposition newspaper La
Republica said he had confirmed the arrest with high ranking
military sources.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos has been at the center of a bribery scandal since a
videotape emerged last week allegedly showing the shadowy
intelligence man bribing an opposition lawmaker to defect to the
president's congressional bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the revelation, Fujimori announced that he would call
new elections -- and not run as a candidate himself. It was a
shocking announcement from the man who has led Peru for more than a
decade, and who recently won a disputed election for an
unprecedented third term.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station said Montesinos was being held on the second
floor of a building at a Lima air force base, where the National
Intelligence Service has its headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   The radio station said Montesinos' sister had already filed a
request asking a court to order the military to free the
54-year-old security chief.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos -- once dubbed Fujimori's ''Rasputin'' -- had built a
wide base of support inside the military during his years at the
helm of the feared intelligence service. He was widely believed to
control the judicial system, the attorney general's office and the
military.
</P>
<P>
   He was suspended from his position on Saturday when Fujimori
announced he was ''deactivating'' the intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's foes accuse Montesinos of spearheading smear
campaigns against the president's opponents in the recent
presidential elections. His intelligence service also has been
linked to death squad killings and torture.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the video, released Thursday, had caused an
irreparable rift between Fujimori and his spy chief, who Fujimori
had relied on to help maintain an overwhelming grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts said Fujimori's decision to oust Montesinos was
likely supported by discontented midlevel officers, fed up with
Montesinos' meddling in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Before the reported arrest Monday, Fujimori appeared to be in
control of the armed forces, and military barracks were reported to
be calm.
</P>
<P>
   Retired army Gen. Daniel Mora said before the reported arrest
that he doubted Montesinos had enough pull in the military to
launch a barracks revolt. He said opponents in the armed forces had
enough power to ''dissuade any action Montesinos may want to
develop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The elections to replace Fujimori will likely be held in six to
seven months, Health Minister Alejandro Aguinaga said Sunday. Salas
said Fujimori would remain in power until the elections took place.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Peru's opposition want Fujimori out now.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewert, traveling in Pennsylvania
with President Clinton, said Sunday that the United States has been
encouraging political reform since the May elections.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Fujimori's decision to call new elections, Siewert
said, ''We hope that all elements in Peru will work a peaceful and
transparent process to achieve full democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Alejandro Toledo, who headed back to Peru from
Washington on Sunday, said he is prepared to govern.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be president. I will be president. I am prepared to
govern,'' Toledo told reporters during a layover at Miami's
international airport. Arriving at Lima's Jorge Chavez
International Airport, he told hundreds of cheering supporters that
he planned to meet with other opposition leaders to discuss a
unified candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who had been Fujimori's main challenger, boycotted May's
presidential runoff vote, charging the vote would be rigged.
Fujimori won.
</P>
<P>
   The video was the clearest evidence to date backing up
widespread accusations that Montesinos' main function in Fujimori's
government was to subvert Peru's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori lost his majority control of congress in this year's
election. But he regained it before his July 28 inauguration amid
allegations that Montesinos and his agents bribed and blackmailed
opposition lawmakers to defect to Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori came to power in 1990, and later teamed up with
Montesinos to co-opt Peru's military, eliminating a time-honored
promotion system based on seniority and merit.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Peru's top military commands are filled with former army
cadets from Montesinos' 1966 graduating class at the Chorrillos
military college.

<HEADLINE> Dow, Nasdaq End Down More Than 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A selloff of blue chip and technology issues
pushed stocks sharply lower Monday, sending the Dow Jones
industrial and Nasdaq composite index falling more than 100 points
apiece as corporate profit warnings again preoccupied the market.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks left in the third quarter and anxiety
about earnings increasing, investors had little tolerance for
companies that even hinted at disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed down 118.48 at 10,808.52, according to
preliminary calculations. On Friday, the Dow fell more than 160
points amid concerns about oil prices and company profits.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell Monday. The Nasdaq dropped
108.71 to 3,726.52, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 21.30
to 1,444.51.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the declines reflected investors' uncertainty about
corporate earnings amid increasing evidence suggesting that the
economy's growth is moderating.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq is off nearly 12 percent since Sept. 1, when it had
its most recent high close, 4,234.33. The Dow, meanwhile, is off
about 4.4 percent since it reached 11,310.64 on Sept. 6 and the S&AMP;P
is off 5 percent since it reached 1,520.77 on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the markets are concerned about earnings going forward
and the effect the slowdown of the economy will have on them,''
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan
Associates. ''I would say overall markets are in a correcting
process and ... it has taken the failure of a succession of rallies
for investors to recognize this change.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said investors are also concerned about the weakness of
the euro, Europe's chief currency, and the effect that rising oil
prices, which hit their highest level in a decade Monday, will have
on corporate profits. The upcoming presidential election, which
looks to be a tight race, also has some investors nervous about
making big commitments, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The market's skittishness about earnings was obvious again
Monday as investors unloaded stocks of companies that warned of
disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   ICG Communications fell $2.25 to $1.66, a nearly 58 percent
drop, after the telecommunications company warned of lower profits
as it tries to conserve cash and fix product problems that have
resulted in the loss of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell International fell $7.69 to $30.50 after the electronic
controls and communications company said soft demand would keep its
corporate profits for the year below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette was down $2.19 at $27.63 after it said its
third-quarter sales would be flat because of problems in its
battery business and continued weakness in the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hearing a lot more about this euro/dollar weakness and
the market is trying to delineate which companies are going to be
affected,'' said Brian Belski, a vice president with U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray. ''That's why today you have a little more weakness
in the Dow stocks. They're old economy and multinationals are going
to be a little bit more affected by this.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors reward companies that delivered good news.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City traded up 88 cents at $25.50 after it announced
earnings in line with Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Amcol International was up 63 cents -- nearly 17 percent -- at
$4.38 after the specialty chemicals and minerals company announced
it had hired an investment bank to ''explore strategic
alternatives,'' including a possible sale, merger or spinoff of one
of its divisions.
</P>
<P>
   And Qualcomm shares were up $3.56 at $69.81 after a First Union
analyst upgraded it to ''strong buy'' from ''buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy stocks also got a boost from higher oil prices with Exxon
Mobil up 58 cents at $89.65. BP Amoco rose 81 cents to $55.94.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a about a 4-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 951.85
million shares, well below the 1.23 billion shares in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 14.20 at 516.68.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Mull Medicare Rules  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Terminally ill patients are spending fewer of
their last days in hospices, says a government report, prompting
some lawmakers to wonder why people are not using such facilities
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office in its report said that patients
spent two weeks less in hospices in 1998 than patients did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The report raised questions among several senators about why
more patients aren't taking advantage of hospices earlier in their
illness and whether confusing Medicare benefits rules are to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hospice care is Medicare's hidden treasure,'' said Sen. Chuck
Grassley, R-Iowa, during a Monday hearing of the Special Committee
on Aging, which he chairs. ''Too few people use the hospice benefit
for too little time. That has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana, the committee's ranking Democrat,
said the shorter hospice stays stem partly because doctors aren't
recommending patients earlier. ''There's a disconnect with most
physicians who are not trained to recommend hospice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the number of Medicare beneficiaries
doubled from 1992 to 1998 to 360,000 even though the amount of time
spent in hospice decreased significantly.
</P>
<P>
   During that time period, the average length of stay declined 20
percent from 74 to 59 days. Half of Medicare hospice users are
enrolled for 19 or fewer days, the report found. Patients in
hospice for a week or less is common.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although more beneficiaries are choosing hospice, many are
doing so closer to the time of death,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   That's troubling news for lawmakers and health care providers,
who view hospice as an ideal way to give terminally ill patients
and their families the at-home care they need in their final days.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report did not specify an exact reason for the
decline, much of the concern Monday on Capitol Hill centered around
Medicare's requirement that a physician must certify that a patient
is likely to die within six months. As long as a doctor continues
to make that certification, there is no time limit on benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say many physicians are confused by the six-month
qualification, and many hospice managers complain they are subject
to fraud scrutiny if they let patients stay longer than a short
period.
</P>
<P>
   Health Care Financing Administrator Nancy-Ann Min DeParle wrote
hospice providers last week to clarify the law. ''There also is a
disturbing misperception that hospices and beneficiaries will be
penalized if a patient lives longer than six months. Nothing could
be further from the truth,'' DeParle wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bob Dole, the author of the 1982 legislation
creating the Medicare hospice benefit, told the committee that the
six-month rule was not ''meant to be a barrier or limit.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't know we were setting up barriers,'' Dole said.
''Maybe we didn't make good history.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said he planned to write officials at the Health Care
Financing Administration and ask that they review the benefits
criteria and possibly recommend legislative changes for next year.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Seeks $10B for Service  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's first high-speed train service is
almost a year behind schedule, but congressional supporters still
plan a major push this week to devote $3.3 billion to develop 11
other high-speed rail lines throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Under proposed Senate legislation, Amtrak would be allowed to
raise $10 billion over 10 years through sale of bonds exempt from
federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say such a financial boost is premature, because Amtrak
is under congressional edict to prove it can operate without
federal subsidies by 2003. If the deadline were to be missed,
Congress could liquidate Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are strongly opposed to inclusion of yet another bailout
for Amtrak'' without further congressional hearings, Republican
Sens. Phil Gramm of Texas and John McCain of Arizona wrote Monday
to Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation say high-speed trains will be
necessary whether or not Amtrak survives as the nation's provider
of long-distance passenger rail service.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Senate version of the bill refers to ''Amtrak,'' the
House version uses the generic phrase ''qualified intercity
passenger rail carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four senators and 155 representatives have signed as
co-sponsors of onto the legislation, sponsored by Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., and Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Roth added the bill's language to legislation granting tax
breaks and new government programs for impoverished, rural and
inner-city communities. The legislation is supported by President
Clinton and Republican leaders in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's committee will consider the legislation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The push for high-speed rail comes while passengers still are
waiting for its delayed debut. Amtrak's bullet-nosed Acela Express
trains, originally planned to begin service last year, may begin
running late next month at speeds of 150 mph on the
Boston-Washington Northeast Corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, which has consumed more than $22 billion in federal
operating subsidies since its creation in 1971, is relying on
high-speed rail to boost revenues and help it achieve
self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   High-speed corridors are defined as rail lines where train
speeds of 90 mph or greater are possible. In addition to the
Northeast Corridor, the government has designated eight corridors,
and the Transportation Department has authority to choose three
more.
</P>
<P>
   The eight designated corridors are in upstate New York;
California; Florida; Pennsylvania; between Oregon and Washington;
on the Atlantic Coast between Washington, D.C., and Florida; on the
Gulf Coast between Texas and Alabama; and in the Midwest, linking
Chicago to several cities including Detroit and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's backers say 18 of the country's 20 most delay-prone
airports are located along the corridors. They pitch high-speed
rail as a relaxing and reliable alternative to air travel.
</P>
<P>
   ''With congestion increasing on our highways and airways,
American travelers are demanding another option to get where
they're going, and high speed rail is the surest way to deliver
it,'' said Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, Amtrak's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for high-speed train service can include
straightening tracks, strengthening bridges, improving
intersections between tracks and roads, renovating stations and
buying train sets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, Amtrak could sell tax-exempt bonds, as
states and local governments do, and states would match at least 20
percent of Amtrak's share.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Taxation Committee says the cost to the federal
government in lost tax revenue would be $3.3 billion over 10 years.
Ronald D. Utt, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage
Foundation, said in a foundation report the cost could reach $16
billion over 30 years.

<HEADLINE> For Cole, Herrera and Dennis, spring has sprung  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCINE PARNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - This week the calendar marks the start of fall,
but for New York's fashion industry, spring has sprung.
</P>
<P>
   The garment business marches in its own time zone, and through
Friday the main attraction is the semiannual brigade of designer
previews, spring-summer 2001 edition. Even as 7th on Sixth, the
organizing body of the shows, conducts talks with production firms
about a possible sale, Fashion Week has grown to the biggest its
ever been, offering nearly 100 previews.
</P>
<P>
   The marathon event has attracted department store buyers,
journalists, celebrities and other members of the fashion pack to
view not only the main American collections, but also a smattering
from Africa, Hong Kong, Australia and Portugal. The shows, preceded
last week by men's wear designers, are now in full swing with
women's collections.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, guests including Vice President Al Gore's daughter
Karenna Gore Schiff, Ron Reagan and Billy Baldwin turned up for the
spring showing of Kenneth Cole. The politically-oriented designer
is known for quirky ads such as, ''What you stand for is even more
important than what you stand in,'' which tackle topics from gun
control to abortion and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore his political point, Cole had mailed invitations
that read ''Be seen. Be heard,'' including voter registration
forms, and his show started with a short film in which Hillary
Rodham Clinton said, ''If you vote, you will look better.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole, who co-hosted summer fundraisers at both the Republican
and Democratic National Conventions, struck another note for
bipartisanship by presenting on his runway for the first time both
men's and women's collections.
</P>
<P>
   In a season expected to be preoccupied with looks including hot
pants, metallics and leather, Cole mined several trends. He dipped
into signs of the '70s, interpreted as patchwork suede in lime and
tan with a hippie outlook; tie-dyed hot pants just this side of
legal; hip-slung pants; and enough metallic shine on flared leather
pants to light up a disco.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's recent foray into women's wear is fueled by the company's
licensing agreement last February with Liz Claiborne Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The image of his $700 million empire is urban, casual and meant
to look accessible to the masses - even if in private life he has
golfed with President Clinton, is related by marriage to the
Kennedys and is married to Maria Cuomo, daughter of former Gov.
Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   For men, the look translates into a studied casualness, in which
suits go with sandals and half-tucked shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every morning I walk into my closet and say, 'What do I wish
was here?' '' says Cole. ''I'm in a very enviable place because I
have the ability to create it. My customer is a contemporary person
who wants to have a sense of identity and personality when he or
she gets dressed in the morning but also doesn't want to be the
focal point of the crowd because of what he or she is wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not so at Carolina Herrera. In the front row Melanie
Griffith caused a flashbulb frenzy, as she was smartly outfitted
with both a lipstick-red leather pantsuit and Antonio Banderas, who
called the collection ''beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrera specializes in well-appointed clothes that can move
seamlessly from the drawing rooms of Park Avenue to blue-blood
resorts of Europe. This time she offers her clientele a little
something for their spring wardrobe - with the emphasis on little.
</P>
<P>
   Hot pants caught the attention of 15-year Herrera customer Ivana
Trump, who eyed them as a favorite look, cast as a beige and brown
romper.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera sent out other looks that just might blanket the runways
this week, including geometric prints, shirtdresses,
off-the-shoulder tops and a rainbow of bright colors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about New York and Rome and Paris and Berlin - wherever
you go,'' says Herrera. ''These women who wear these clothes have
to be comfortable wearing them in all those places.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Cheers Fujimori Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States cheered Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori's decision to end his 10-year authoritarian rule,
and appealed to the country's military to ''work toward a peaceful
transition'' of power.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori called Saturday for new elections and said he would
deactivate Peru's National Intelligence Service, generating
questions about how military leaders -- especially the agency's
head, Vladimiro Montesinos -- would react.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart declined to comment Monday
about Montesinos, who is at the center of a bribery scandal.
Opposition leaders have urged Fujimori to order Montesinos arrested
over the bribery allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart called Fujimori's announcement an important step that
the United States had hoped he would take in the wake of the
''flawed elections'' earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the extent that effort has succeeded, then we welcome the
move that was announced,'' Lockhart said. ''We call on all parties
involved in Peruvian society to work toward a peaceful transition
and work toward a democratic election.''
</P>
<P>
   He said while the military's role in that transition is not
entirely clear, the United States would continue to work along with
the Organization of American States to ensure ''full
democratization'' of Peru.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Probes Biotech Corn Allegation  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is investigating whether taco
shells sold in stores under the Taco Bell name contain a variety of
biotech corn that isn't approved for human consumption due to
questions about whether it could cause allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The crop, which is genetically engineered to kill an insect, is
grown on less than 1 percent of the total U.S. corn acreage and
approved for use only in animal feed. But tests commissioned by an
anti-biotech environmental group found traces of the corn in taco
shells that had been purchased in suburban Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Environmental Protection Agency and Food and
Drug Administration said they were looking into the finding and
that FDA may have its own tests done. Kraft Foods Co., which made
the taco shells, said it would consider a recall if further testing
confirmed the initial results.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern, of course, is whether or not this product, which
is registered for animal feed, is somehow illegally finding its way
into food that people eat,'' said David Cohen, an EPA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   If the test results are correct, FDA officials said they would
consider action to get it out of the food supply.
</P>
<P>
   The corn at issue, which is produced by Aventis Corp. and goes
under the trade name StarLink, is the only biotech crop that isn't
approved for human consumption. It is one of several varieties of
biotech corn that contains a bacterium gene that makes the plant
toxic to the European corn borer.
</P>
<P>
   A scientific panel that advises EPA was unable to decide this
summer whether the protein in the corn, Cry9C, should be allowed in
food. The protein has shown resistance to digestive juices and
heat, signs that it might cause allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Aventis is required to have agreements with farmers to make sure
that the corn is kept separate from grain that is approved for food
use. The company could lose its license to market the crop if it
violated EPA's restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft made the taco shells at a plant in Mexico using corn meal
purchased from a Texas mill, which in turn got the corn from
farmers in five states, said Michael Mudd, the company's vice
president for corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The ''highest priority right now is to confirm whether or not
the protein is indeed present in our product,'' he said, adding
that ''if a recall is judged to be the right course, that is
something we will do immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Aventis officials denied any wrongdoing and questioned whether
the test results were accurate. Anti-biotech activists said the
finding showed that the government isn't regulating biotech crops
adequately.
</P>
<P>
   ''It concerns me and should concern American consumers that this
is a glimpse of things to come as genetically engineered products
are rushed to store shelves without real mandatory safety testing
and labeling programs in place,'' said Rep. Dennis Kucinich,
D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The taco shells were among 23 corn products that representatives
of the Friends of the Earth submitted to Iowa-based Genetic ID Inc.
for testing for the Cry9C protein. Three sets of tests, performed
first in August, all found evidence of the protein in the taco
shells. None of the other products, including corn flakes, tested
positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used the most sophisticated checks and balances to verify
our results and we've done it three times. We've very confident,''
said Jeffrey Smith, Genetic ID's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   EPA and biotech industry officials say that the company has made
mistakes in the past in testing for gene-altered crops. Aventis
officials said they take care to ensure farmers know that the
biotech corn can't be put into food channels.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers ''are generally very astute businessmen who act
responsibly,'' said Aventis spokesman Rick Rountree. ''On the other
hand, mistakes can happen, but we've not seen evidence that that's
been the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The StarLink corn was grown on about 300,000 acres this year
nationwide, or about 0.4 percent of the total corn acreage. About
73 million acres of corn are expected to be harvested this year, of
which 20 million acres are of genetically engineered varieties.

<HEADLINE> Dow, Nasdaq Fall Over 100 Points  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A selloff in blue chip and technology issues
pushed stocks sharply lower Monday, sending the Dow Jones
industrial average and Nasdaq composite index down more than 100
points apiece as corporate profit warnings again preoccupied the
market.
</P>
<P>
   With less than two weeks remaining in the third quarter and
anxiety about earnings increasing, investors showed little
tolerance for companies that even hinted at disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow closed down 118.48 at 10,808.52. On Friday, the Dow fell
more than 160 points amid concerns about oil prices and company
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell Monday. The Nasdaq dropped
108.71 to 3,726.52, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 21.30
to 1,444.51.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the declines reflected investors' uncertainty
about corporate earnings amid increasing evidence that the
economy's growth is moderating.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq is off nearly 12 percent since Sept. 1, when it had
its most recent high close, 4,234.33. The Dow, meanwhile, is off
about 4.4 percent since it reached 11,310.64 on Sept. 6 and the S&AMP;P
is off 5 percent since it reached 1,520.77 on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the markets are concerned about earnings going forward
and the effect the slowdown of the economy will have on them,''
said A.C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan
Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif. ''I would say overall, markets
are in a correcting process and ... it has taken the failure of a
succession of rallies for investors to recognize this change.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said investors are also concerned about the weakness of
the euro, Europe's chief currency, and the effect that rising oil
prices, which hit their highest level in a decade Monday, will have
on corporate profits. The near-term price for a barrel of crude oil
passed $37 on the New York Mercantile Exchange before falling back
slightly and closing at $36.88.
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming presidential election, which looks to be a tight
race, also has some investors nervous about making big commitments,
Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   The market's skittishness about earnings was obvious again
Monday as investors unloaded stocks of companies that warned of
disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   ICG Communications fell $2.25 to $1.66, a nearly 58 percent
drop, after the telecommunications company warned of lower profits
as it tries to conserve cash and fix product problems that have
resulted in the loss of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell International fell $7.69 to $30.50 after the electronic
controls and communications company said soft demand would keep its
profits for the year below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel Networks fell $4.75 to $68.25 after an analyst lowered
his earnings estimates for the wireless communications company.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette was down $2.19 at $27.63 after it said third-quarter
sales would be flat because of problems in its Duracell battery
business and continued weakness in the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hearing a lot more about this euro/dollar weakness and
the market is trying to delineate which companies are going to be
affected,'' said Brian Belski, a vice president with U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray. ''That's why today you have a little more weakness
in the Dow stocks. They're old economy and multinationals are going
to be a little bit more affected by this.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors did reward companies that delivered good news.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City traded up 88 cents at $25.50 after it announced
earnings in line with Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Amcol International was up 63 cents -- nearly 17 percent -- at
$4.38 after the specialty chemicals and minerals company announced
it had hired an investment bank to ''explore strategic
alternatives,'' including a possible sale, merger or spinoff of one
of its divisions.
</P>
<P>
   And Qualcomm rose $3.56 to $69.81 after a First Union analyst
upgraded it to ''strong buy'' from ''buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy stocks also got a boost from higher oil prices with Exxon
Mobil up 58 cents at $89.65. BP Amoco rose 81 cents to $55.94.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a nearly 4-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.16
billion shares, well below the 1.46 billion shares in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 14.20 at 516.68.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.94 percent as
prices tumbled on Asian exchanges in response to oil prices and
Friday's decline on Wall Street. European stocks also dropped, with
Germany's DAX index slipping 1.54 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 down
0.11 percent, and France's CAC-40 off 1.40 percent.

Ralph G. Hubbell, radio legend, dies
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Ralph G. Hubbell, a western New York
sportscasters for six decades, is dead. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ''Hub'' to listeners, Hubbell stopped broadcasting
regularly, but he continued serving as a toastmaster and attending
sporting events. He died Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell was born in Duluth, Minn., but spent four years in
Buffalo during his boyhood and returned upstate after graduation
from high school in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for various radio stations during the early 1930s and
in 1939 he was hired by the Buffalo Broadcasting Corp.'s combined
WGR-WKBW radio operation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Hubbell began broadcasting University of Buffalo
football games, both home and away. Hubbell, often calling himself
''Old Man Mose,'' did sports commentary, reporting, play-by-play
and vignettes.
</P>
<P>
   He had a wide audience that included non-sports fans. He also
attended countless sports nights, banquets, luncheons and other
gatherings, including several where he was toasted - or roasted.
</P>
<P>
   Later he worked in Niagara County, covering sports for WHLD
Radio, and writing a column for the Niagara Gazette. For a time, he
served as vice president for public relations of the Buffalo Braves
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   By 1995, Hubbell was still working - as a columnist, and the
host of ''Aging is for Everyone,'' a monthly program on WKBW.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, the former Ann Bolton, died in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his second wife, Olive Turner Hubbell; two
sons, Peter of Siesta Key, Fla. and Phil of Eggertsville; a
daughter, Emily Forbes of Lakewood, Colo.; 16 grandchildren; and 15
great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Japan Sued by Alleged Sex Slaves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alleging they were forced into sexual slavery
by Japan's army during World War II, 15 elderly Asian women filed a
lawsuit Monday in an effort to get an apology and compensation from
the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
   The former ''comfort women'' from China, Taiwan, the Philippines
and Korea are using a U.S. law passed in the 18th century which
provides foreign citizens the right to sue other foreign citizens
or entities for abuses of international law.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the nature of the sex slave system was so
flagrant that Japan cannot argue it has immunity as a sovereign
state.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say up to 200,000 women were forced into sexual
slavery by the Japanese military and sent to military brothels
known as comfort stations.
</P>
<P>
   Japan claims it has already compensated war victims sufficiently
and is under no obligation to give more money.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo government says it has paid more than $860,000 to
former sex slaves through a privately funded organization. Most of
the women have refused to accept payment, saying it is not enough
and is part of Japan's attempt to avoid taking full responsibility
for its wartime actions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now in American courts the Japanese government will pay the
consequences for its deplorable action against women and girls
during World War II,'' said Dongwoo Lee Hahm, president of the
Washington Coalition for Comfort Women Issues Inc. an independent
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hausfeld, an attorney representing the women who helped
prepare the suit filed in U.S. District Court, said at a news
conference that ''in an era of increased focus on morality and
individual human rights, this atrocity cannot continue to be
ignored. These women deserve justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Last June Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., a member of the congressional
human rights caucus, and 30 other House members introduced a
resolution calling on Japan to formally apologize to war crimes
victims and pay reparations.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the U.N. Subcommission on Human Rights passed a
resolution urging compensation from Tokyo for the sex slaves. The
resolution said governments are responsible for war crimes and
other rights violations by their soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Former ''comfort women,'' many of them in their 70s, and groups
that support them said the U.N. resolution will help them obtain
restitution from a government they claim wishes the issue would
simply disappear.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Foreign Minister Quitting  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy
announced Monday that he will leave politics, saying he would step
aside as his nation's representative to the world as soon as the
government chooses a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old former University of Winnipeg professor has
worked to ban land mines, encouraged peacekeeping missions,
supported development aid to poorer countries and emphasized
negotiation over force.
</P>
<P>
   ''After more than 27 years in elected office, the time has come
to pursue other opportunities outside government,'' Axworthy wrote
in a letter Friday to Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   He told The Winnipeg Free Press he wants to spend more time with
his wife, Denise, and son, Stephen, 15. He is expected to take a
job directing The Liu Center for Global Issues, a think tank in the
western province of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy will hold his post until Chretien appoints a
replacement in a Cabinet shuffle or until the next federal
election. Chretien has until the autumn of 2001 to set a date for
voting.
</P>
<P>
   First elected to the federal parliament in 1979, Axworthy rose
to power in the Liberal Party governments of Pierre Trudeau, the
popular former prime minister who retired in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy was a military and foreign affairs critic when his
Liberal Party became the official opposition to Brian Mulroney's
Conservative government from 1984-93.
</P>
<P>
   After Chretien came to power, he was minister of human resources
development, from 1993-96, before being named foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy's announcement Monday came a day after winning promises
from Sudan to free children conscripted into war. The agreement was
reached during a weeklong conference in his hometown of Winnipeg.

<HEADLINE> Dem Holds Clinton Nominations  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an end-of-session twist, Democrats are
holding up President Clinton's federal judicial nominations in the
Senate hoping to win additional approvals for other judges.
</P>
<P>
   Four judges have cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee --
including a woman who would be the first Latina federal district
judge in Arizona. But Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
is refusing to let the Senate vote on the judges.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who heard Democrats complain all session about how
few Clinton nominees are getting through the Senate, especially
minorities and women, immediately attacked Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats often claim that Republicans are blocking judicial
nominees and that women and minorities are not getting confirmed,''
said Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., whose Republican-controlled state
would get three of the four judges. ''But it is the Democrats who
are guilty of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle spokeswoman Renit Schmelzer said Monday the hold is to
point out the fact that other Clinton judges have not yet made it
through the Senate or the Senate Judiciary Committee. ''Sometimes
the only way to get people to pay attention is to hold up people,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Congressional Black Caucus have claimed that
delays in approving Clinton's minority and female judges showed
racist and sexist tendencies in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said more minority and female judges have been approved
by the Senate under his chairmanship than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four judges caught up in this battle is Mary Murgia,
who wants to be a U.S. District judge. If approved, she would be
the first Latina on the federal bench in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The other three U.S. district judge nominees are Susan Bolton
and James A. Teilborg of Arizona and Michael Joseph Reagan of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Schmelzer said Daschle has no particular objection to any of
these judges but ''they want to see fairness for all of those who
have been waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   She said several other minority judges have been waiting even
longer than Murgia, including Roger Gregory of Virginia, who wants
to become the first black member on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time in recent weeks Democrats and
Republicans clashed over nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., announced that he would
put a hold on all new Clinton judicial nominations for the rest of
Clinton's term in revenge for Clinton making 17 temporary
appointments while the Senate was not in session during August.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House needs to know that what they did greatly
complicated this process,'' said John Czwartzcki, spokesman for
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Schmelzer said negotiations with Republicans were ongoing. ''We
haven't seen the end of this,'' she said.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Thousands of protesters marched in
central Haiti on Monday to demand the resignation of a legislature
controlled by the Lavalas Family Party of former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
</P>
<P>
   Radio stations reported that about 5,000 people marched, which
would be the biggest protest since recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''Down with Lavalas! Down with Aristide!'' demonstrators shouted
as they marched from the village of Papaye to nearby Hinche, about
45 miles northeast of Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic gunfire toward the end of the march triggered panic
among the demonstrators, but no injuries were reported and the
protest ended peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The march was organized by the Papaye Peasants' Movement, the
biggest rural workers' organization in Haiti, and was endorsed by
the opposition Convergence coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition accuses President Rene Preval's government of
rigging local and legislative elections in May, June and July in
favor of Lavalas. Preval's critics have also charged Lavalas with
being behind street violence aimed at opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Lavalas Family is trying to gag any expression of
opposition to (Aristide's) plan to establish a dictatorship,'' said
Gerard Pierre-Charles, spokesman for the former parliamentary
majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States has expressed doubts about
the way candidates were selected for the second round of the
elections. The European Union and the United States have threatened
to withhold funds, or channel them through non-governmental
agencies, if Haiti does not revise the results.

<HEADLINE> Rowland said he would oppose a special election should Lieberman win both races </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gov. John G. Rowland said Monday he would
veto any bill calling for a special Senate election in less than
two years should Joe Lieberman win both the U.S. Senate and vice
presidential races.
</P>
<P>
   Were Lieberman forced to resign his Senate seat, Rowland would
appoint his replacement. By law, a special election would be held
in 2002 to fill the position. But the Legislature could call an
election before then.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would veto it, absolutely,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor said he would not appoint himself to the
Senate seat should Al Gore and Lieberman win the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would never appoint myself,'' he said. ''I think it's too
self-serving and I like this job and I want to finish this job.''
</P>
<P>
   A short of list of successors would include Republican Reps.
Christopher Shays of Bridgeport and Nancy Johnson of New Britain,
Rowland said. When asked if Lieberman's Senate race challenger,
Philip Giordano, is off that list, Rowland said only that ''there
would be some others to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Giordano said he expects to win in November, but said he also
would expect to be appointed by Rowland should Lieberman win both
races.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am the endorsed Republican Party candidate,'' he said.
''Fourteen-hundred of the 1,600 Republican party delegates selected
me to be the candidate and want me to be their U.S. senator.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Quinnipiac College poll taken in July, Lieberman was
favored over Giordano in the Senate race, 71 percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, running for his third term, could quit his
re-election campaign as late as Oct. 27, but has said he plans to
remain in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sen. Lieberman still fully intends to run for re-election, and
still believes that a U.S. Senate seat is too important and too
valuable to fill on the fly, which is essentially what would happen
should he drop of the race,'' Dan Gerstein, a Lieberman spokesman,
said. ''There would be a rushed, chaotic process, and worst of all
there would be an undemocratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerstein said Lieberman will be in the state next Monday to
campaign for the Senate seat. Locations and times have not yet been
set.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd said Connecticut Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal, state Senate President Pro Tempore
Kevin Sullivan, U.S. Rep. John Larson and U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro
were among Democratic prospects to succeed Lieberman, but insisted
he did not have any kind of short list in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if there's any short list, I think there's a long
list,'' said Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he believes it's too early to start discussing
whether their should be a special election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if you ask most people on the street if they'd rather
have an appointment or election, they'd rather have an election. On
the other hand, I think we'd have to wait until after the election
to ask the governor. Right now it's not a relevant issue,''
Sullivan said.

<HEADLINE> FBI agent: Terrorism suspect was read his rights repeatedly  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An FBI agent testified Monday at a pretrial
terrorism hearing that an Algerian man arrested in Brooklyn was
repeatedly advised of his rights as he was apprehended on charges
related to an alleged plot to sneak explosives into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The special agent, Francis J. Schulte Jr., said Abdel Ghani
Meskini even agreed to read his Constitutional rights out loud last
Dec. 30 on the car ride into Manhattan after he was arrested in an
early morning raid in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ''He read it perfectly,'' Schulte said. ''He said he would
answer questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte said Meskini signed a page explaining the rights at two
separate times after reading them.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came at a pretrial hearing in which Meskini's
lawyer, Roland Thau, tried to show that his client's Constitutional
rights were violated as he was arrested in a pre-New Year's Eve
terrorism crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan will continue the Manhattan
hearing Tuesday and rule some time later.
</P>
<P>
   Schulte said Meskini had a slight accent but otherwise spoke
English well as he questioned him for more than two and a half
hours. Meskini, Schulte said, never asked for a lawyer as he spoke,
legs shackled and one arm handcuffed to a metal rail along a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt he was somewhat evasive in his answers,'' Schulte said.
</P>
<P>
   The agent said he wanted to learn about Meskini's travels and
associates after he was linked to Ahmed Ressam, another Algerian,
who was arrested days earlier as he crossed the border from Canada
into Port Angeles, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Explosives and timing devices with Ressam's fingerprints on them
were found during an inspection of Ressam's car after it rolled off
a ferry boat, authorities say. Ressam has pleaded innocent to nine
felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini and Mokhtar Haouari, another Algerian, are accused of
conspiring since October 1997 to support members and associates of
a terrorist group as well as providing and concealing support for
Ressam. They are also accused of conspiring to distribute fake or
stolen passports and of using fake credit and bank cards.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Meskini has asked that the charges against him
be dropped, saying his rights were violated after FBI agents broke
through his apartment door, ordered him to the floor and pointed
guns at him.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're in big trouble,'' he recalled a female police officer
telling him.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agent Paul Sutherland testified Monday that he twice
shouted very loudly, ''FBI, open the door!'' before telling another
participant in the 7 a.m. raid to break down Meskini's door.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland said he quickly spotted Meskini in sweat pants, a
T-shirt and slippers, walking through a dining room toward the
front door. He said he told him in an authoritative and loud voice
to ''get on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulte said he or other agents ''might have mentioned the
possibility of substantial jail time if he was connected to the
Seattle case'' as they questioned him to try to get him to confess.
</P>
<P>
   Schulte said that when he finished with Meskini, he passed him
along to other investigators, who questioned him more.
</P>
<P>
   Thau said the agents interrogated his client for about 10 hours
before he finally got an initial court appearance and received
legal representation.

<HEADLINE> Democrats challenge Verizon on plan they say will raise telephone rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Democratic lawmakers plan to use a hearing
Tuesday to protest a change in telephone rates they say will double
costs for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat in the state Senate urged Republican
legislators to join him in a formal challenge to the plan filed by
Verizon Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats plan to testify before the Board of Public
Utilities and they have hired an expert witness to plead their
case.
</P>
<P>
   They claim consumers have complained about existing service
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is ludicrous for Verizon to be rewarded with a doubling of
rates after a doubling of complaints,'' Sen. Richard J. Codey,
D-Essex, said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John O. Bennett, R-Monmouth, has also opposed the plan and
is reported to be soliciting support among fellow Republicans for a
challenge as well.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Verizon proposed offering three separate options for New
Jersey customers, based on their calling patterns. One would offer
unlimited local calls for $17.50 a month. Residential customers
currently pay an average of $13.37 in basic telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   All three options include 25 free minutes of regional calls and
three add-on features like call waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon wants the BPU to agree that there's enough competition
for telephone service in New Jersey to warrant the change.
</P>
<P>
   But competitors have said the utility still has a monopoly on
local telephone service because of the high rates it charges
competitors to lease Verizon's which includes telephone lines and
billing systems. The rivals say it would take years to build a
network from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates also have opposed the Verizon plan, saying it
forces customers to choose premium options to avoid higher rates.

<HEADLINE> Somali Gunmen Release Aid Workers  </HEADLINE>
By OSMAN HASSAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- Somali gunmen released two European
aid workers unharmed Monday after holding them hostage for 55 days.
</P>
<P>
   Francoise Deutsch, 46, of France, and Jonathan Ward, 31, of
England, were kidnapped July 26 by armed raiders who stormed the
office of the French aid agency, Action Against Hunger, in the
Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
   A convoy of pickup trucks, armed with anti-aircraft guns,
carried Deutsch and Ward to a hotel, where they released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been given enough food and water, and we have been
treated well,'' said Ward, who was dressed in a traditional
''mawiss,'' a sarong-like garment worn by Somalians.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters he and Deutsch had been held together in a
''tiny room'' in a heavily fortified building somewhere in south
Mogadishu. ''I will not be discouraged from my work with
humanitarian efforts worldwide,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia descended into chaos after opposition leaders joined
forces to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Factional
leaders then fought with each other, turning the nation of 7
million into battling fiefdoms ruled by heavily armed militias.
</P>
<P>
   Action Against Hunger is one of the few international
humanitarian organizations to remain in Somalia. Others pulled out
after a U.N. force left in 1995 because of insecurity and the
threat of kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch, looking tired and wearing the flowing veils worn by
Somali women, said her biggest worry had been the absence of news
during their captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Local businessmen said they had secured their ''unconditional
release.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These efforts have been made to erase the bad image of
Mogadishu,'' said Omar Sheik Ali, speaking on behalf of the
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Action Against Hunger issued a statement saying the agency had
had no direct contact with the kidnappers, relying on
''traditional'' Somali negotiations to secure the release of their
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it wanted to emphasize that ''it had paid no
ransom to obtain the freedom of its two volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency said it was concerned about the increasing difficulty
of carrying out humanitarian work in Mogadishu. It would not
discuss the future of its projects in Somalia before further
studying situation.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in Mogadishu indicated Monday that a payment of as much
as $80,000 may have been made to the kidnappers by the businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Action Against Hunger thanked Somalia's
President Abdiqasim Salad Hassan and the international community.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, there has been hope that stability could be
restored to Somalia following the last month's inauguration of
Hassan and a new 245-member Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Ward and Deutsch were expected to leave Mogadishu for the Kenyan
capital, Nairobi, on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> White House Faults GOP Drug Plans  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid Republican turmoil about which
prescription drug benefit to back, the White House on Monday
reiterated its position not to accept any plan that would derail
the chance of getting a drug benefit for 39 million Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration released a 13-page study that
denounces plans being discussed in Congress that target low-income
citizens. Republicans quickly responded, saying the study was a
partisan shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think a low-income prescription drug benefit offers little
more than an empty promise and I think this report makes quite
clear that it is a step backwards, not a step toward providing
meaningful prescription drug coverage to seniors or people with
disabilities,'' said Chris Jennings, White House health care policy
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of plans in the House and the Senate. The
House earlier this year passed a plan to give private insurers
money for giving drug coverage to Medicare recipients, but the
industry didn't embrace it. Now, the GOP is considering a more
limited plan aimed at helping those who need it most.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., is pushing a proposal that would
offer up to $31 billion for temporary, immediate prescription drug
assistance under Medicare. It is similar to proposals made by GOP
presidential candidate George W. Bush and would operate under
control of the states.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said such proposals leave at least 25 million seniors
and people with disabilities with no assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you really do care about targeting the low-income
population, you'll want to pass a Medicare prescription drug
benefit ... and you want to make sure that it's a meaningful
benefit that would not vary from state to state, that would not
have caps on the drugs covered, that would not have limitations on
the type of diseases covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said his plan
provides help now to those most in need, giving Congress time to
enact longer-term reforms next year. He says he views it as a
safety net, not a final solution, that gives immediate coverage to
millions more seniors than coverage today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have put forward a temporary solution that could, upon
enactment, take care of the prescription drug needs of our nation's
neediest seniors,'' Roth said in a statement. ''This legislation
would cover those seniors until Congress and the White House reach
agreement on a more comprehensive Medicare prescription drug plan,
which judging from the tone coming out of the White House isn't
going to be this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings stopped just short of saying Clinton would veto such a
prescription drug plan if that was all Congress could pass before
it adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is absolutely no reason for him or anyone in the
administration to want to move toward a policy that would undermine
the outcome of providing a meaningful Medicare prescription drug
benefit for seniors and people with disabilities,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hot dogs recalled for undercooking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - A Florida company is recalling 40,000 pounds
of chicken and turkey franks that may not have been cooked
sufficiently, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The franks, made by Lykes Meat Group Inc. of Plant City, Fla.,
were distributed to stores in California, Florida, Georgia, New
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The franks, which were sold under the names Smithfield and
Fairgrounds, were produced Aug. 14 and bear ''P-2653'' on the
label. The problem was discovered after a consumer complaint, but
no illnesses have been associated with the product, USDA said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the potential foodborne illness, we urge consumers
not to eat the franks and hot dogs but return them to the place of
purchase,'' said Ronald Hicks, acting administrator of USDA's Food
Safety and Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
   The products and the identifying codes are:
</P>
<P>
   -Fairgrounds ''jumbo franks,'' code dated 227002A, for use by
Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   -Smithfield ''grill ready chicken franks,'' code dated 227002A,
for use by Oct. 13.
</P>
<P>
   -Smithfield ''premium hot dogs,'' code dated 227002B, for use by
Oct. 13 or Oct. 23.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Debt-Reduction Measure  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House overwhelmingly approved a
campaign-season measure Monday aimed at letting congressional
Republicans advertise their party's turnaround from focusing on tax
cuts to debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also underlines another change of heart by Republicans:
They are ready to spend billions more in fiscal 2001 than the
GOP-written budget that Congress passed earlier this year was to
allow.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, passed 381-3, calls for setting aside about
$240 billion for debt reduction, or about 90 percent of the $268
billion overall surplus the Congressional Budget Office expects in
the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. That includes the
entire projected Social Security and Medicare surpluses, plus an
additional $42 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Members of this House are either for protecting Social
Security and Medicare and paying down the debt, or they are not,''
said Rep. Wally Herger, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would leave $28 billion from next year's projected
surplus for tax cuts and extra spending that lawmakers and
President Clinton will negotiate in the waning weeks of this year's
session of Congress. Republicans have said they want to use that
money half for spending, half for tax cuts, although House GOP Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Texas, told reporters that the proportions are
negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats voted for the measure en masse, but ridiculed it as a
GOP ploy aimed at salvaging a year in which their chief push, for
tax cuts, has been largely blunted. Clinton vetoed the two biggest
Republican tax-cutting measures -- reducing levies for many married
couples and for people who inherit large estates.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't be on the floor one week arguing for gigantic tax
cuts, and come in the next week arguing for debt reduction,'' said
Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also contended that the proposal marks an abandonment
of GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, whose tax-cutting plans
would eat up far more than 10 percent of projected surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote was likely to be symbolic because the measure is
expected to bog down in the Senate, where Democrats can use
procedural delays to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Republicans were hoping the bill would demonstrate
their party's devotion to debt reduction, which polls show the
public considers a top-tier budget priority.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also hope the political allure of the measure's goal
-- reserving 90 percent of next year's surplus for reducing the $3.4
trillion publicly held national debt -- will help limit the extra
spending Clinton is likely to win in year-end budget talks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, the measure represents an abandonment of the
spending limits Republicans wrote into the budget for the coming
fiscal year that Congress approved last April.
</P>
<P>
   That budget was to limit spending for fiscal 2001 discretionary
programs to $625 billion. Those programs -- financed in the 13
annual spending bills -- cover everything but automatically paid
benefits such as Medicare and interest payments to holders of
Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure approved Monday would go well beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office's $268 billion surplus estimate
for next year that Republicans are using assumes that discretionary
spending would be $638 billion -- $13 billion higher than the GOP's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Republicans say they would allow an additional
$14 billion for spending out of the $28 billion in surplus dollars
that would not have to be used for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   That would total $652 billion in spending, or 4 percent more
than the $625 billion in the 2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
   That would also be 7 percent more than the $608 billion expected
to be spent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the measure were Reps. Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va.; Jerrold
Nadler, D-N.Y., and Martin Sabo, D-Minn.

<HEADLINE> Maps provide a detailed look at the environmental hazard next door  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Ever wonder what environmental hazards are
lurking right in the neighborhood?
</P>
<P>
   An online mapping program unveiled Monday by federal Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo will allow anyone with a computer to find
out what pollution problems are nearby. The free Internet mapping
program allows computer users to input an address and up pops a
diagram with select information from the Environmental Protection
Agency on brownfields, hazardous waste, air pollution levels and
waste water discharge in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The site also maps out the locations of various programs from
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the first time
federal agencies have combined their data on a web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a great tool in this new technology,'' Cuomo said
Monday. ''We want to provide the information to the citizens and
let them know what's going on in their backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said he was hopeful that those seeking community
development grants from HUD would use portions of the federal money
for environmental cleanup once they saw what problems existed in
their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by supermodel Christie Brinkley, who has fought
pollution from nuclear plants near her home on eastern Long Island,
Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes and Greg Wetstone, director of
programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Police: Gunmen Release 15  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY PRATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- An American woman freed by guerrillas on
Monday said she was deeply shaken by her ordeal but has no
intention of abandoning this violence-torn South American country
that's been her home for 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   Helena de Lima was among at least 40 people abducted Sunday by
rebels from roadside restaurants and a private estate along a
stretch of highway outside Cali. De Lima, the only American in the
group, was among 15 released Monday; the guerrillas had freed two
others on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The mass abduction showed how lawless and insecure Colombia has
become as a 36-year guerrilla war escalates. It is likely to damage
fledgling peace talks between the government and the leftist
National Liberation Army, or ELN, which was believed responsible
for the kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 troops have surrounded the area where the remaining
hostages were thought to be held, but officials said they had no
immediate plans to attempt a military-style rescue.
</P>
<P>
   A 58-year-old Baltimore native, de Lima and her Colombian
husband, Eduardo, were kidnapped from their estate along with
Eduardo's sister and a nephew. Eduardo de Lima was freed hours
before his wife, but his two relatives were still being held.
</P>
<P>
   ''I walked four hours in the black of night,'' de Lima said of
her ordeal in the cold Andean mountains. ''I felt very vulnerable,
very scared.''
</P>
<P>
   With her short white hair and wire-rim glasses, de Lima told The
Associated Press she believes she was freed because of her age.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so sad to go through this after giving your life and love
to Colombia,'' de Lima said. ''I've always defended Colombians
because they are basically good, warm people. There has to be
another way of working this conflict out.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gustavo Bell called the action a ''flagrant
violation'' of international law and said it contradicted the ELN's
assertion that it is genuinely interested in peace.
</P>
<P>
   No group has claimed responsibility, but police said they are
almost certain it was the ELN, a 5,000-member rebel group and
Colombia's second-largest leftist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The de Limas said their captors wore ELN armbands.
</P>
<P>
   The mass abduction was carried out by at least 50 heavily armed
men, many of them wearing military-style uniforms and bulletproof
vests, initially claiming to be members of Colombia's secret
police.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to the de Lima estate, the gunmen snatched at
least 36 hostages from two restaurants along the Via Al Mar, or
Highway to the Sea, which meanders from Cali toward the Pacific
Ocean, 45 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen have been released but others remained in captivity
Monday, although it was not immediately clear how many. Some
released hostages said they believe there are as many as 50 people
still being held in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping has further unnerved residents of Colombia's
third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in Cali are known for our love of the outdoors,'' said
Adolfo Lopez, a top city official. ''Now we feel like prisoners in
our own house.''
</P>
<P>
   The ELN carried out a string of mass abductions last year,
including a raid on a Catholic Mass near Cali, to obtain ransoms
and pressure the government for concessions in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has the world's highest kidnapping rate, with nearly
3,000 abductions reported last year and at least 1,750 through July
of this year, according to the private Free Country monitoring
group.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Colombians have left the country in the past two
years as the war makes leading an ordinary life increasingly
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But de Lima, who met her husband when he was studying medicine
in the United States, said she had no plans to abandon the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''My roots here are as deep as the ones I stepped over in the
jungle,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists seek court help to stop city from spraying  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A woman who said she could barely speak after
pesticide hit her face was among several witnesses called Monday by
environmentalists who hope to convince a judge to block the city's
all-out attack against the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   The pesticide ''is very dangerous, particularly in the manner in
which the city is applying it,'' said Robert K. Simon, an
environmental and toxicological scientist with an independent
environmental company in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses were called by a number of environmental groups
trying to prove to U.S. District Court Judge John S. Martin that
the city's effort to stop the deadly West Nile virus has been a
health disaster of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was expected to rule later in the week on whether the
groups can at least temporarily block the city from continuing to
spray pesticides on neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the West Nile virus killed seven people in the New
York City metropolitan area. This year, 11 people have been
diagnosed with the mosquito-borne virus in New York City and one in
New Jersey. None has died.
</P>
<P>
   The city has been using pesticides to kill the mosquitoes that
carry the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Felthem, a Staten Island resident, testified in a hushed
voice that she was hit by the spraying.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was struck when she opened her door at 9:30 p.m. on
Aug. 27, thinking spraying would not start until 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sprayed in the face,'' she said. ''I closed the door and
immediately washed my face. My eyes began tearing. I felt a
tightness in my chest. My voice was getting weaker. Within an hour,
my voice was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her voice was recovering but she will not go into her
backyard until she is confident spraying is over.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Coplin, a lawyer for groups including the No Spray
Coalition Inc. and the National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Pesticides Inc., said ''hundreds of innocent New Yorkers are being
exposed to insecticides.''
</P>
<P>
   Inga Van Eysten, a lawyer for the city, told the judge that
public health agencies at every level of government have supported
the city's spraying campaign and its efforts to educate the public
about the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very real problem,'' she said. ''We are proceeding in a
way that ensures the public health will be protected and which
follows all applicable laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Eysten said city officials were doing their duty by ordering the
spraying of neighborhoods across the city to kill infected
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon said the spraying was a mistake because the pesticides
have immediate damaging effects on people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The same thing that happens to mosquitoes happens to humans,''
he said. ''All of your muscles start twitching. It starts affecting
your respiratory system.''

<HEADLINE> Albright on Foreign Presidents  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Barred by the U.S. Constitution from becoming
president because she was born abroad, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said Monday that foreign-born Americans should have the
right to seek the highest office.
</P>
<P>
   And she pledged to do everything she can to help a woman become
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright -- the first women to be U.S. secretary of state and
the highest-ranking female in the Clinton administration -- dodged a
question about whether she would have sought the presidency, had
the U.S. Constitution allowed her to run.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because I never had to think about it, I never have,'' she
said. ''It's like (asking), would I be a pole vaulter today in
Sydney, Australia?''
</P>
<P>
   Albright discussed women's leadership in the 21st century at a
meeting co-sponsored by The White House Project, which is dedicated
to having a qualified woman successfully run for the presidency
within the next decade. The event was also co-sponsored by The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that there will be a woman president sooner rather
than later,'' Albright said. ''I think we all have to work for that
to happen because there are remarkable women'' in the U.S. Senate
and House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a lack in our country in many ways,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Wilson, president of The White House Project and the Ms.
Foundation for Women, said the project's polling shows that 76
percent of the American public would like to vote for a woman
candidate for president. But research on focus groups shows that
voters worry that women lack the experience and ability to conduct
foreign policy and address national defense issues, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I have helped in this,'' Albright said. ''I truly do. I
don't like being called a 'school marm' when I'm tough because I
think that when men are tough they're not called 'school marms.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson replied: ''I can guarantee you that ... you have made an
enormous difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright was born Marie Korbelova in Prague in 1937. Her father
was a Czech diplomat who took his family to London as Germany took
over their homeland at the start of World War II and then moved to
Denver in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   A former academic, foreign policy adviser and U.N. ambassador,
Albright said she never believed she would be secretary of state
until the moment President Clinton asked her. And she paid tribute
to him for putting more women into top posts than any of his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have managed something that I never, ever thought would be
possible, which is to have the highest-level job in the field of my
choosing,'' she said. ''I've loved every minute of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution bars Albright or any other foreign-born citizen
from the presidency -- a ban Albright said she would like to see
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do believe people that have not been born here ought to have
the opportunity to serve at the highest level,'' she said, to loud
applause from more than 200 women in the audience.

<HEADLINE> Court arguments over whether Con Ed must pay refunds  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A lawyer for Consolidated Edison told a
judge Monday that a state-mandated $162 million customer refund was
''punitive'' and improperly singled out the utility.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City-based utility claims the refund law approved
by the state Legislature and Gov. George Pataki this year is
unconstitutional and wants a federal judge to block its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   The law was approved after the utility's Indian Point 2 reactor
in Westchester County failed and went off line in February.
Proponents of the refunds to some 3 million Con Ed customers said
it was not fair for the utility to pass along added costs to
customers associated with the outage.
</P>
<P>
   Those refunds - from $14 to $21 for residential customers - are
being held up as Con Ed wages its court fight. U.S. District Court
Judge Lawrence Kahn heard oral arguments Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McTiernan, a lawyer for Con Ed, told Kahn the utility
was being unfairly singled out by the law and that it was denied
due process. He said the Legislature circumvented proper procedures
for setting utility rates and had ordered Con Ed to refund money
for even routine refueling and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's punitive,'' McTiernan argued. ''It went over the edge,
your honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending the law were attorneys for state utility regulators,
the attorney general's office and state Assembly Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant attorney general Jeffrey Mans argued that Con Ed was
using generators at Indian Point with a known history of defects
and that it was being properly held accountable to the public.
State Public Service Commission attorney Kevin Lang said the
Legislature worked months on the bill, providing due process.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a prime sponsor of the bill,
appeared in court to contend that the Legislature acted within
time-honored boundaries. He said lawmakers did listen to Con Ed
when crafting the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Con Ed seeks to undermine 200 years of court and legislative
decisions,'' said Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn, who is being asked by Con Ed to issue a preliminary and
permanent injunction, promised a decision within weeks
</P>
<P>
   The Public Service Commission has ordered the refunds not go out
until at least October in light of the court challenge. Lang said
the PSC would revisit the issue after Kahn's ruling.

<HEADLINE> Maps Detail Environmental Hazards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ever wonder what environmental hazards are
lurking right in the neighborhood?
</P>
<P>
   An online mapping program unveiled Monday by federal Housing
Secretary Andrew Cuomo will allow anyone with a computer to find
out what pollution problems are nearby. The free Internet mapping
program allows computer users to input an address and up pops a
diagram with select information from the Environmental Protection
Agency on brownfields, hazardous waste, air pollution levels and
waste water discharge in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The site also maps out the locations of various programs from
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the first time
federal agencies have combined their data on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a great tool in this new technology,'' Cuomo said
Monday. ''We want to provide the information to the citizens and
let them know what's going on in their backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said he was hopeful that those seeking community
development grants from HUD would use portions of the federal money
for environmental cleanup once they saw what problems existed in
their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by supermodel Christie Brinkley, who has fought
pollution from nuclear plants near her home on eastern Long Island,
Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes and Greg Wetstone, director of
programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.

<HEADLINE> 'The Watcher' Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By JUDY LIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''The Watcher,'' a thriller about a serial
killer, was the top film for the second straight week as the
nation's theaters reported their slowest weekend in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The film starring Keanu Reeves, James Spader and Marisa Tomei
pulled in just $5.8 million as theaters reported the
lowest-grossing weekend since Sept. 12, 1997, said Paul
Dergarabedian of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., a box office
tracking firm.
</P>
<P>
   There were 129 films playing in North America over the weekend
and their combined box office take was just $54 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a situation where moviegoing hasn't been a top
priority of the general public in recent weeks,'' Dergarabedian
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For the last eight weeks, he suggested, people have been
preoccupied with the Olympics, CBS's ''Survivor'' and the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   All of it has hurt the bottom line, Dergarabedian said,
especially when compared with last year's unusually robust films,
including ''The Sixth Sense,'' ''Stigmata'' and ''Blue Streak,''
which kept revenues strong in a typically slow post-summer period.
</P>
<P>
   ''There hasn't been a product sparking audience interest to the
degree necessary to have a strong box office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only film that beat the trend is ''Almost Famous,'' which
averaged $17,669 on 131 screens in limited release. The film
fictionalizes Cameron Crowe's teen-age days writing about rock 'n
roll for Rolling Stone magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Studios could see a reversal toward the end of month when
''Almost Famous'' goes into wide release. Also, ''Remember the
Titans'' and the re-release of ''The Exorcist'' may bring people
back to theaters.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Elizabeth Dole helps raise campaign cash for Fifth District Candidate Mark Nielsen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WESTON, Conn. (AP) - Elizabeth Dole visited this affluent suburb
Monday, helping to raise campaign cash for Republican Mark Nielsen
in his bid for the Fifth Congressional District seat.
</P>
<P>
   The former Red Cross president and U.S. Transportation secretary
joined about 50 people for a private fund-raiser at the home of
Michael Shea, president of a Rocky Hill office equipment company,
and his wife, Becky. Organizers were hoping to raise about $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, who dropped out of the race for the GOP presidential
nomination last year, praised Nielsen for never voting for a tax
increase and for helping reform Connecticut's welfare system while
he was a state senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel strongly that people are yearning for leadership,''
Dole said. ''Mark says what he means, means what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen is challenging incumbent Democrat Jim Maloney, who
narrowly beat Nielsen for the House seat in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The contest is one of the most-watched in the country. The
national Republican and Democratic committees are taking a special
interest in the race because only six seats separate the Democratic
minority from the Republican majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton last week raised more than $200,000 for
Maloney's campaign during a visit to Danbury. Nielsen got some
high-profile support of his own earlier this month when GOP vice
presidential candidate Dick Cheney appeared in the district to tout
a Republican plan for prescription benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The race has become bitter, with both Nielsen and Maloney
hurling accusations at each other.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raiser on Monday, Dole said GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush would need Nielsen's support in Congress to push the
Republican agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the wife of former Senator Bob Dole, said Nielsen would
work to reform health care, education and government spending if
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen expressed confidence in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm running circles around the competition,'' he said. ''We're
on the offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney's campaign criticized the visit, saying Nielson had
''used up every name in the Republican party'' to aid his ''ailing
campaign.''
</P>

   ''I think it's hypocritical for a man who has taken more than
$56,000 from tobacco companies and executives to also be seeking
help from the former president of the Red Cross, and organization
dedicated to saving lives,'' said Betsy Arnold, Malony's campaign
spokeswoman.

<HEADLINE> State Police believe missing woman's body found in Vincentown pond  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VINCENTOWN, N.J. (AP) - State Police believe a body found in the
Mill Dam Pond Monday afternoon is that of a woman missing since her
boat sank there Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The body discovered just below the surface at about 5 p.m.
Monday is believed to be that of 28-year-old Nicole Apostol, State
Police spokesman Sgt. Al Della Fave said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're 90 percent sure based on her clothing, but technically
it has to be the medical examiner to say,'' Della Fave said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy will be performed by the Burlington County Medical
Examiner's Office, according to Della Fave. Authorities will use
dental records to make a positive identification, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apostol and her husband, Anthony, were out in the small boat
late Saturday night when the craft began to take on water and sink.
Anthony Apostol swam to shore and called for help when he realized
his wife was not behind him, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police divers searched unsuccessfully for Nicole Apostol again
Monday. But Della Fave said as they were cleaning their equipment
and getting ready to leave Monday a dog used to search for bodies
by a local first-aid squad reacted at a spot in the pond. The body
was then pulled from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Della Fave said the death is not considered suspicious and is
being treated as a drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still looking at it as a tragic accident unless
something changes in the next few days with the autopsy,'' Della
Fave said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Slow on Eyeing Deutch  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon was alerted in the summer of 1998
that former CIA Director John Deutch downloaded defense secrets to
unsecured personal computers and was urged to assess the damage.
But documents show it waited until last February to begin
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who were told that the CIA was recommending a
Pentagon damage assessment was Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a spokesman for Cohen, said the
secretary did not act in 1998 because the Pentagon was ''not in
possession of any documentation from the CIA's investigative
efforts.'' He said that when information was turned over last
February, Cohen ''turned right around'' and ordered the probe now
under way.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon documents, obtained by The Associated Press, show
that in 1998, Cohen was at least informed by his inspector general
that the CIA had evidence that Deutch download defense secrets to
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen finally ordered a review in February when he said
information was received by the Pentagon ''for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the July 1998 memo to Cohen and his top deputy, acting
inspector general Donald Mancuso wrote, ''The CIA believes it may
be necessary for DOD (Department of Defense) to conduct an
assessment of any possible security compromises identified in their
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo said the CIA was ''investigating allegations that Mr.
Deutch created and maintained highly classified and compartmented
documents and journals on a number of computers, including personal
computers at his homes in Maryland and Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   The computers ''were regularly used'' in conjunction with
Deutch's America Online Internet account and ''may have been used
to transfer such information without regard to security
procedures,'' the 1998 memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Deutsch and his attorney for comment were not
immediately successful.
</P>
<P>
   Last Feb. 9, Cohen sent the Pentagon's general counsel and the
inspector general a memo that confirmed ''oral instructions''
provided two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''On or about that date, the Department of Defense received for
the first time certain material from the Central Intelligence
Agency which the CIA inspector general gathered in the course of
their investigation'' of Deutch, Cohen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Included in this material is a lengthy journal reportedly kept
by Dr. Deutch during the time he served as undersecretary of
defense ... and deputy secretary of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   A June 1998 memo from a Pentagon investigator to the inspector
general gave further information on what the Pentagon had learned
from the CIA at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Deutch kept very thorough journals, which include
significant quantities of DOD classified and other sensitive
information,'' investigator Mark Spaulding wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA believed that ''a damage assessment by DOD is required
to protect the significant quantities of DOD information on the
computers,'' Spaulding added.
</P>
<P>
   Other Pentagon documents said Deutch was under investigation for
maintaining the ''highly classified'' documents on his personal
computers, and for carrying, in his shirt pocket, a 1,000-page
journal on computer disks and cards containing classified
information.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch left the CIA in 1996 and now teaches at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, the DOD spokesman, said the Pentagon inspector general
and the assistant defense secretary for command, control,
communication and intelligence are conducting separate, parallel
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office is ''trying to track the hard
drives and the floppy drives that were in Dr. Deutch's possession
over time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant secretary was ''doing the damage assessment''
mentioned in the July 1998 memo to Cohen, Quigley said. That probe
is trying to ''look at the actual content of material that was
present on those computers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Peru's Spy Chief Detained  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos,
Peru's most vilified man and one of its most powerful, was detained
Monday, his sister alleged in court documents that demanded he be
set free.
</P>
<P>
   Radio station CPN said he was detained on orders of the
commander of Peru's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Ana Montesinos said in a writ of habeas corpus seen by The
Associated Press that her 54-year-old brother had been detained
illegally at the headquarters of the National Intelligence Service,
the agency that is at the center of Peru's latest political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But a retired army general and several opposition leaders
charged that Montesinos was not being held against his will and
said the reports of his detention were a ruse to buy time.
</P>
<P>
   The development came after opposition leaders met into the
pre-dawn hours and called on President Alberto Fujimori to order
Montesinos' detention with no further delay.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Fujimori said that a videotape allegedly showing
Montesinos bribing an opposition lawmaker to defect to the
president's congressional bloc had damaged the stability of his
government and of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori announced he was deactivating the National Intelligence
Service, known by its Spanish initials SIN. He then stunned
Peruvians by saying he would call new elections but would not be a
candidate, ending his decade-long hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Gutierrez, a member of the investigative unit at the
opposition paper La Republica, said Monday that high-ranking
military officers confirmed Montesinos' detention. Gutierrez said
navy commandos loyal to Fujimori entered the Las Palmas air force
base, where Montesinos has his headquarters, and detained him.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos was being held in his offices on the second floor of
the building housing the intelligence service, according to radio
station CPN and Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
   Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade earlier charged that Montesinos was
still running the intelligence service and was holed up in the
agency's headquarters. Unconfirmed news reports said he was
feverishly destroying documents that would incriminate him.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials had no immediate response to Andrade's
accusation nor did they confirm Montesinos' detention.
</P>
<P>
   The radio report, citing unidentified military sources, said the
order for preventative arrest was issued by Montesinos' close
associate, Gen. Jose Villanueva Ruesta, commander of Peru's armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Carmen Ojeda, an attorney representing Montesinos' sister,
said the habeas corpus demand would be evaluated by Judge Percy
Escobar Lino, obligating him under Peruvian law to verify
Montesinos' whereabouts within 24 hours and to determine whether
the military has sufficient legal grounds to detain him.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's critics say Montesinos has manipulated Peru's
intelligence network to infiltrate illegally all branches of
government for Fujimori -- and they have accused him of
masterminding a campaign of smear attacks and dirty tricks to
assure Fujimori's re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts and persons knowledgeable about the inner
workings of the armed forces said Fujimori was forced into his
decision to deactivate the intelligence agency because high-ranking
army officers loyal to Montesinos tried to pressure him into
protecting the intelligence chief.
</P>
<P>
   The radio report said that some of the generals who studied with
Montesinos in the Chorrillos military academy in the 1960s, and who
were later hand-picked by Montesinos as regional commanders, were
upset with his detention.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique issued early Monday, leaders of nine opposition
parties expressed their ''surprise and condemnation for the fact
that 24 hours after the convocation of new elections and the
deactivation of the SIN ... there is evidence that presidential
adviser Vladimiro Montesinos still manages the intelligence service
that he has controlled for the past 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 protesters holding red-and-white Peruvian flags gathered
quietly outside the Las Palmas air base earlier Monday to demand
that Montesinos be detained. Soldiers in combat clothing and armed
with automatic rifles guarded the base's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Vargas Llosa, the famed novelist defeated for the
presidency by Fujimori in 1990, warned that the generals placed in
key positions by Montesinos were dangerous because ''they are
defending the little power they still have left.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A wounded beast is more dangerous than a healthy beast,'' he
said in a radio interview from Puerto Rico. ''Montesinos is a
person who has no place to run to, who is known to the whole world
for his misdeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Military experts said Fujimori's decision to deactivate the
intelligence service was likely supported by discontented midlevel
officers, fed up with Montesinos' meddling in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Retired army Gen. Daniel Mora said he doubted Montesinos had
enough pull in the military to launch a barracks revolt over
Fujimori's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's decision to step down from power was a shocking
announcement from the man who recently won a disputed election for
an unprecedented third term.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cheered the decision, and appealed to the
country's military to ''work toward a peaceful transition'' of
power.

<HEADLINE> House Dems Target GOP Report  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats are protesting in advance a
yet-to-be-released report Wednesday by congressional Republicans
that sharply criticizes the Clinton administration's handling of
U.S.-Russian relations after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The 209-page report, written by 12 Republicans on the Speaker's
Advisory Group on Russia and scheduled for release Wednesday, says
the relationship between the two nations has soured in recent
years. It contends deterioration occurred partly because America
has spent too much time with too few leaders in Moscow, ignored
corruption and given poor and ineffective economic advice to the
former communist state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putting this report on congressional letterhead is sending a
fraudulent message to the American people that this is a
congressional report,'' the Democratic congressmen said in the
letter sent Monday to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by five ranking Democratic members of
House committees with jurisdiction over U.S.-Russia policy: Armed
Services, Banking, Appropriations, Intelligence and International
Relations. They complain they were not invited to any of the
advisory group's meetings, hearings or policy discussions and still
have not seen the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a political hatchet job. It's outrageous,'' said Rep.
Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., ranking minority member of the House
International Relations Committee. ''They wrote this report trying
to distort the administration's record on Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who chaired the advisory group,
defended the review. He said the report, in the works since March,
is being released now before Congress adjourns and because U.S.
policy toward Russia, like Medicare prescription drug benefits and
Social Security, should be at issue in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's important to have Republican policy on Russia.
We're a democracy. That's how we make public policy choices,'' Cox
said. ''There can be no better time than now.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that the report is meant to attack Vice
President Al Gore. As co-chairman with former Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin of the U.S.-Russia Commission on
Economic and Technical Cooperation, Gore was an architect of
Russian foreign policy during the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   Timing of the release, in the waning days of the 106th Congress
and just seven weeks before the presidential election, make the
report appear to be an ''election-year gimmick,'' Gejdenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the regular congressional committee process to examine
Russian foreign policy would have ensured bipartisan participation
in the writing of the report, the letter said. It said the process
also ''would have had the added benefit of saving the American
taxpayers the additional monies that were spent by your ad hoc
group on its secretive and partisan exercise.''

<HEADLINE> Corzine discloses charitable gifts, urges GOP to stick to issues  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine on Monday
laid out the details of more than $10 million in checks he and his
family foundation have written to charities in the past 21 months.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, Corzine attempted to extinguish the latest blowup
over his fiscal secretiveness, urging Republican opponent Bob
Franks to deal with the issues that matter to voters instead of
side concerns about his personal wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do recognize that in the world of politics, there are those
who will choose to use our giving as a way to create controversy
and to divert attention from their own inaction, public or
private,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, the Franks campaign and other Republicans on Monday
continued hammering Corzine for refusing to disclose his personal
tax return to identify his investment holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who spends over $34 million, and people have said over
$42 million, on a primary alone, that's the issue, unfortunately,
and he has made it the issue,'' said State Republican chairman
Garabed Haytaian.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's donations last year included $50,000 to Operation
PUSH, the minority education program spearheaded by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who came to New Jersey on the eve of the June 6 primary to
boost Corzine in his contest with former Gov. Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's foundation also donated $25,000 to St. Matthew's AME
Church of Orange, where the pastor is the Rev. Reginald Jackson,
director of the influential New Jersey Black Ministers Council. The
council's key officers, including Jackson, endorsed Corzine on
April 17, although the council itself does not make endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said his foundation's gifts were not intended to win
coveted endorsements from the two black leaders, but to show his
support for their community programs. Corzine said he had been a
supporter for years of PUSH's efforts on Wall Street to introduce
minorities to the investment field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our contributions reflect a strong personal commitment to the
same issues and principles that I have chose to address in my
campaign,'' Corzine said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought his money may have influenced the two
black leaders into backing him, Corzine told reporters, ''I suppose
you will have to ask them that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the details Corzine disclosed Monday about his
spending on charities, and his public reports on campaign spending,
offer only half the picture. They said no one can see the sources
of the Democrat's immense wealth, and whether his holdings or
earnings from securities make him beholden to any businesses or
political groups.
</P>
<P>
   Haytaian said, ''This campaign, unfortunately, has to focus on
his money. He has to explain where he is getting it from.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine fed into the GOP flames with another glitch at Monday's
news conference held at Newark's Robert Treat Hotel. While
providing lists of the charities that received checks from him,
Corzine did not have on hand complete copies of his foundation tax
return. He told reporters at a 3:30 p.m. news conference the
returns were available only at his accountant's office in Manhattan
- a place none of them would be able to get to by the close of
business.
</P>
<P>
   The complete tax return would give precise numbers as to what
the Jon and Joanne Corzine Foundation has on hand and where it
invests those funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Corzine gave $8.9 million worth of stock to his
foundation and another $4.5 million in stock to other charities. He
also gave $133,000 in personal checks to various charities and to
fund-raising events which were outside his foundation activities.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation itself doled out checks totaling $4.6 million
during 1999 and has given out $1.4 million in checks so far this
year, leaving a balance of some $4 million in the foundations
coffers. This sum does not include residual balances from 1998 or
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine himself reported no personal donations yet in 2000,
though he said his gift to his own foundation is usually made at
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   When Haytaian last week castigated Corzine for withholding tax
reports about his foundation's activities, Corzine said he would
seek to delay filing these reports with the IRS until after the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Then his accountants quietly completed and filed the reports
Friday, and Corzine scheduled the Monday news conference to discuss
them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the delay, Corzine said it was routine for such
foundations and for individuals with complex tax returns to seek
extensions from the customary April deadline. Corzine said he
wanted to review the foundation tax return personally before
agreeing to file it with the IRS and to make it public.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been a little busy with other things,'' Corzine said,
referring to his campaign. ''I have always considered giving to be
a moral responsibility, a joy and a private matter.''

presidential nominee George W. Bush, energized New Jersey
Republicans on Monday as they opened the Bush campaign's state

</P>
<P>
   Koch said New Jersey voters were tired of the Clinton-Gore White

<HEADLINE> Milosevic To Visit Montenegro  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a pre-election move that could
fuel tension in Montenegro, Slobodan Milosevic is planning to make
his first trip as Yugoslav president to the independence-minded
republic, his chief ally said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who faces a tough challenge in Yugoslavia's Sept. 24
elections, will speak at a rally Wednesday in the northern
Montenegro town of Berane, said Momir Bulatovic, the leader of the
pro-Serb camp here in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia is comprised of Montenegro and the much larger
Serbia, Milosevic's power base. Montenegro's pro-Western government
opposes Milosevic, and has taken several steps toward independence,
complaining of his autocratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrins remain deeply divided over whether the province
should seek independence or remain in the federation. Pro-Serb
Montenegrins mostly live in the north of the republic bordering
Serbia. Berane is one of their strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   Those divisions will be highlighted by Milosevic's visit, which
is apparently a challenge to President Milo Djukanovic's
government. Djukanovic has called for a boycott of the Yugoslav
presidential, parliamentary and local elections, declaring them
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Montenegro -- the first since Milosevic became
Yugoslav president in 1997 -- is also designed to boost his image
ahead of the balloting amid reports that he is trailing an
opposition candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Some fear Montenegro's tensions could flare into clashes if
Milosevic is re-elected president. Djukanovic has hinted he might
call an independence referendum if that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic has accused Milosevic of increasing pressure on
Montenegro through the Yugoslav army forces stationed in the
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic said Milosevic will deliver a message that Serbia has
no plans to move against Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole of Montenegro, Yugoslavia and the whole world will
have a chance to hear that our president will never attack one part
of our country and that he will never come on cannons, or tanks,
but on the wings of popular will,'' Bulatovic said at an election
gathering in the northern town of Kolasin.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic accused the Montenegrin government of working under
instructions from the United States and other NATO countries to
break up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must protect ourselves and think about our national
interest,'' he said. ''And, our national interest is a free, strong
and democratic Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic almost never travels outside Serbia proper, while his
rare public appearances are always organized under maximum
security. If he tries to travel abroad, Milosevic faces arrest
because of an international war crimes indictment against him.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic, who has close ties with the United States and its
allies, has pledged to cooperate with the U.N. war crimes tribunal,
but has ruled out any arrest of Milosevic, saying it would
destabilize Montenegro.

<HEADLINE> Lyndhurst commissioner charged with altering his military records  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - A Lyndhurst official has been charged
with altering his military records at the borough tax office to
falsely indicate that he served in the Green Berets and was awarded
a Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   Albert P. Opacity, 50, an elected commissioner in Lyndhurst, is
charged with tampering with public records, according to Bergen
County Prosecutor William H. Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Opacity filed an alternate document to enhance his record by
showing he served in Vietnam, rose to the rank of captain, and
received a Purple Heart, a Republic of Vietnam Campaign Ribbon and
a Combat Infantry Badge, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Opacity's actual military record showed he was a member of the
armed forces from March 1975 to March 1977, when he was discharged
as a clerk/typist, Specialist 4th class, according to Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Opacity was released on his own recognizance.

<HEADLINE> Frankel associate pleads guilty to securities fraud  </HEADLINE>
With BC-Frankel Investigation
prho
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - An associate of former fugitive
financier Martin Frankel pleaded guilty Monday to federal
securities fraud and tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Guyer, 62, of Dundee, Mich. ran a security brokerage
house that served as a front for Frankel's illegal operations,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel had been barred by the SEC from acting as, or
associating with broker-dealers in 1992. But at Frankel's request,
Guyer assumed the position of president of Liberty National
Securities, Inc., prosecutors said. Guyer then registered the
brokerage house in several states, claiming he was solely
responsible for all control, management and policy decisions at
LNS.
</P>
<P>
   All calls to the company were automatically forwarded to
Frankel, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel, who is accused of bilking more than $200 million from
insurance companies in five states, was able to hide millions of
dollars in stolen money by saying he had safely invested the funds
with the brokerage, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Guyer, who pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District Court, faces
up to eight years in federal prison and $350,000 in fines when he
is sentenced. Frankel is currently awaiting extradition from
Germany where he was arrested a year ago following a four-month
international manhunt.

House of Commons Session Gets Off To Slow Start
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The expected fireworks fizzled Monday as federal
politicians returned to the Commons from their long summer vacation
and lined up in familiar partisan camps.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost as if they'd never left.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian Alliance and Conservatives demanded tax cuts, New
Democrats called for better health care and the Bloc Quebecois
wanted federal action to combat criminal biker gangs in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jean Chretien kept a profile so low he was nearly
invisible, answering only three questions and leaving his cabinet
members to defend the Liberal record.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lackluster start to a parliamentary session that has
been billed as an old-fashioned pre-election brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was that Alliance Leader Stockwell Day and
Conservative Leader Joe Clark were relegated to the visitors'
gallery. They will not be sworn in until Tuesday to occupy the
seats they won in by-elections while the House was on holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Strahl, Alliance House leader, attributed Chretien's
restrained performance to the absence of his chief opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guess is that he's waiting (because) he wants to go
mano-a-mano against the big guy,'' said Strahl. ''He's looking for
the prime ministerial answers to come when he responds to Stockwell
and not before.''

Harvard Expert Predicts Spread of West Nile Virus to Canada
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- There's no way to stop the West Nile virus from
moving into Canada and health authorities should be planning to
deal with it, says a top American expert.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of the virus to the Western Hemisphere is probably
related to climate change, and chances are it will be followed by
other mosquito-borne diseases, said Paul Epstein of Harvard Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Toronto has already seen a case of locally spread
malaria, a mosquito-borne disease, although there was only one
victim in that 1998 case.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus infected 80 people in New York City last
summer, killing seven. A current outbreak in Israel has
hospitalized 120 people, killing 10. The virus is well established
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's inevitably going to come to Canada,'' said Epstein,
interviewed at a conference on the health impact of climate change.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big problem. Only seven people died in New York last
summer, but of the 62 survivors, most suffered chronic neurological
disabilities. This is a very serious disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long predicted global warming will result in the
spread of diseases once confined to hot countries, and the
appearance of West Nile in North America has been seen as evidence
for that hypothesis.

WTO Drug Patent Ruling Could Cost Taxpayers up to $100 million
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal government says it's ''disappointed''
but likely must live with a World Trade Organization ruling that is
estimated to cost the health system tens of millions of dollars in
higher drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO on Monday dismissed Canada's appeal of a ruling that
found parts of the country's patents law are illegal because they
fail to protect inventors for a sufficient period.
</P>
<P>
   The generic drug industry says that will cost Canada's
health-care system about $100 million in higher-cost brand-name
medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Prime Minister Jean Chretien announced plans to
invest $23.4 billion in health care over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will bite a big piece from that, said Jim Keon,
president of the Canadian Drug Manufacturers Association, the
generic industry's lobby group.
</P>
<P>
   ''A good chunk of the extra health-care spending money that was
targeted to go to medicines will now go into the coffers of the
multinational drug manufacturers . . . to fund the higher costs
because the generics won't be on the market until later.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 medicines are still at issue, with outstanding patents
ranging from one month to three years, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The trade dispute has pitted the generic industry -- backed by
social, labor and health groups -- against brand-name drug
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Major multinational firms argue they deserve lengthy patent
protection because of heavy investments in drug research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on drugs is the fastest-growing component of health
budgets and the second largest -- topping doctors fees.
</P>

Ruling on Drugs Favors Show Jumper Eric Lamaze
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- An adjudicator has accepted the ''exceptional
circumstances'' surrounding Eric Lamaze's use of cocaine and has
lifted his lifetime ban from equestrian competition.
</P>
<P>
   But Lamaze's fight to compete at the Sydney Games continues.
</P>
<P>
   In a summation ruling released Monday, Edward Ratushny ruled
that the show jumper should not be suspended for a positive cocaine
test on Aug. 29 that cost him his spot on the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Ratushny said Lamaze's character, ''remorse, prospects for
rehabilitation or other such criteria,'' did not factor into his
decision. His full ruling is expected later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Ratushny accepted Lamaze's explanation that the one-time
addict -- barred from the '96 Games for drug use-- was driven back to
cocaine by news of another ban he received Aug. 18 following a
positive test for a banned substance he mistakenly ingested through
a dietary supplement.
</P>
<P>
   He fell into depression and contemplated suicide before the
first ban was quietly lifted Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on top of my game before all of this happened,'' Lamaze
said at a news conference Monday. ''It's been a difficult process,
but I've never given up the thought of going to the Olympics.''

<HEADLINE> Hostages Spotted in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Government troops pursuing Muslim
rebels through a southern Philippine jungle to rescue 19 hostages
have reported the first sightings of some of the captives, an
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Abu Sayyaf rebels fled to the coastlines of small Jolo
island in an attempt to escape, officials said. The rebels are
believed to have bought speedboats with some of the more than $15
million ransom they reportedly received from Libya and Malaysia for
freeing other hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Civil defense officials said four civilians were confirmed dead.
More injured civilians were believed trapped inside a tight
military blockade of rebel areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some 5,000 villagers fled to the island's capital and were being
housed in mosques and schools, Gov. Abdusakur Tan said, as mortars,
attack planes and helicopter gunships pounded rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
   Since the assault began Saturday, the military has overrun two
major Abu Sayyaf camps and smaller hide-outs, but until Monday
found no signs of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday the reports from the field said some of the hostages
were sighted,'' presidential Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said
Tuesday. ''We're very hopeful that this will pan out.'' He declined
to provide further details, including their nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials continued a news blackout on most details of the
assault, which the military said could last up to six days.
</P>
<P>
   Various Abu Sayyaf factions are holding an American, two French
journalists, three Malaysians, a Filipino kidnapped with a larger
group in April, and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists who paid to
enter the rebels' camp to pray for the other hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Eight rebels have been killed and 20 captured in the three days
of fighting, while six government troops were wounded, military
officials said. Fighting continued in many scattered areas of
Jolo's jungles, Tan said.
</P>
<P>
   The military cut transportation and telephone links to the
island. Cell sites were shut down because the rebels were using
cellular phones to communicate, Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   Filipinos have widely supported President Joseph Estrada's
decision to attack the rebels after nearly five months of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of members of the evangelists' Jesus Miracle Crusade,
however, demonstrated Monday to protest the assault.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have put the lives of all the hostages in great danger,''
said Brother Danny Cuarteros, a member of the crusade whom the
rebels had earlier released.
</P>
<P>
   France, Germany and Malaysia have also expressed concern that
the attack would endanger the captives.
</P>
<P>
   But acting Foreign Secretary Franklin Ebdalin said the
Philippine government decided on the assault because ''all the
avenues of negotiations have been exhausted and there seems to be
no end to the cycle of hostage-taking.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zamboanga city, provincial health officer Nelsa Amin
assembled antibiotics, oxygen tanks and a team of surgeons to treat
the injured but was unable to find transportation to Jolo, about 85
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   She urged the military to halt the attack temporarily so that
wounded civilians could be located.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller of two rebel groups seeking an
independent Islamic state in the predominantly Roman Catholic
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Before their kidnapping spree began in March, the Abu Sayyaf had
fewer than 200 armed men. The number swelled to more than 3,000 as
the huge ransom payments attracted recruits, the military says.

<HEADLINE> One killed, two hurt in crash on Benjamin Franklin Bridge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A woman was killed and two other people were
hurt Monday in a collision on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge that
forced the closure of all westbound lanes for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   A Nissan sedan was headed east on the bridge at about 2:30 p.m.
when it crossed into westbound traffic and hit a Volkswagen, said
My Linh Nguyen, a spokeswoman for the Delaware River Port
Authority, which operates the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   A third car, a Ford station wagon, which also was headed west,
then collided with the Nissan, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The women driving the Volkswagen died later due to injuries from
the crash, Nguyen said. The woman's identity was not released
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The woman driving the Nissan had to be extricated. The male
driver of the Ford was the least seriously injured. Both were taken
to Cooper Hospital University Medical Center. The Nissan driver was
in stable condition Monday night, Nguyen said. The Ford driver was
later transferred to West Jersey Hospital, Nguyen said. His
condition was not available.
</P>
<P>
   There were no passengers in any of the cars, she said.
</P>
<P>
   All westbound lanes were closed and only one eastbound lane was
in use from before 3 p.m. until after 4 p.m. Traffic was diverted
to other Delaware River bridges.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Police: Gunmen Release 25  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY PRATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia (AP) -- An American woman freed by guerrillas on
Monday said she was deeply shaken by her ordeal but has no
intention of abandoning this violence-torn South American country
that's been her home for 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   Helena de Lima was among as many as 80 people abducted Sunday by
rebels from roadside restaurants and a private estate along a
stretch of highway outside Cali. De Lima, the only American in the
group, was among 23 released Monday; the guerrillas had freed two
others on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The mass abduction showed how lawless and insecure Colombia has
become as a 36-year guerrilla war escalates. It is likely to damage
fledgling peace talks between the government and the leftist
National Liberation Army, or ELN, which was believed responsible
for the kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 troops have surrounded the area where the remaining
hostages were thought to be held, but officials said they had no
immediate plans to attempt a military-style rescue.
</P>
<P>
   A 58-year-old Baltimore native, de Lima and her Colombian
husband, Eduardo, were kidnapped from their estate along with
Eduardo's sister and a nephew. Eduardo de Lima was freed hours
before his wife, but his two relatives were still being held.
</P>
<P>
   ''I walked four hours in the black of night,'' de Lima said of
her ordeal in the cold Andean mountains. ''I felt very vulnerable,
very scared.''
</P>
<P>
   With her short white hair and wire-rim glasses, de Lima told The
Associated Press she believes she was freed because of her age.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so sad to go through this after giving your life and love
to Colombia,'' de Lima said. ''I've always defended Colombians
because they are basically good, warm people. There has to be
another way of working this conflict out.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gustavo Bell called the action a ''flagrant
violation'' of international law and said it contradicted the ELN's
assertion that it is genuinely interested in peace.
</P>
<P>
   No group has claimed responsibility, but police said they are
almost certain it was the ELN, a 5,000-member rebel group and
Colombia's second-largest leftist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The de Limas said their captors wore ELN armbands.
</P>
<P>
   The mass abduction was carried out by at least 50 heavily armed
men, many of them wearing military-style uniforms and bulletproof
vests, initially claiming to be members of Colombia's secret
police.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to the de Lima estate, the gunmen snatched dozens
of hostages from two restaurants along the Via Al Mar, or Highway
to the Sea, which meanders from Cali toward the Pacific Ocean, 45
miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five have been released but some 55 others remained in
captivity Monday, the army's GAULA anti-kidnapping squad told The
Associated Press, based on interviews with witnesses and freed
hostages. Earlier, police had placed the total number of people
kidnapped, including those freed Monday, at about 40.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear.
Families of kidnap victims in Colombia often choose not to report
the abduction to authorities, preferring to deal directly with the
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's kidnapping has further unnerved residents of Colombia's
third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in Cali are known for our love of the outdoors,'' said
Adolfo Lopez, a top city official. ''Now we feel like prisoners in
our own house.''
</P>
<P>
   The ELN carried out a string of mass abductions last year,
including a raid on a Catholic Mass near Cali, to obtain ransoms
and pressure the government for concessions in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has the world's highest kidnapping rate, with nearly
3,000 abductions reported last year and at least 1,750 through July
of this year, according to the private Free Country monitoring
group.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Colombians have left the country in the past two
years as the war makes leading an ordinary life increasingly
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But de Lima, who met her husband when he was studying medicine
in the United States, said she had no plans to abandon the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''My roots here are as deep as the ones I stepped over in the
jungle,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Princess Di's brother says family history helped him through sister's death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Earl Spencer, brother of the late Princess
Diana, said researching his family's history gave him the strength
to survive the loss of his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ''You draw strength when you go back to your roots,'' he said
Monday on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   His research went into a new book, ''The Spencers: A Personal
History of an English Family.'' Spencer said it does not cover
Diana's life, but is instead the history of ''an aristocratic
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really want to cash in on that,'' Spencer said of the
very public life and death of his sister. ''This is really more a
history book. I didn't want to intrude upon the modern age. That
wasn't the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer also told King that his title means very little to him,
since ''the aristocracy in Britain doesn't mean a whole lot to
anybody anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Gay Reservist To Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By JACQUES BILLEAUD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- An Arizona state lawmaker fighting his ouster
from the Army Reserves after announcing during legislative debate
that he is gay said Monday he won't surrender his case but expects
to lose.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of three colonels recommended Sunday that Lt. Steve May
be honorably discharged for violating the military's ''don't ask,
don't tell'' policy regarding homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation is subject to a review by a general and
approval by the Defense Department. In the meantime, May will
continue as a reserve lieutenant two days a month.
</P>
<P>
   May has filed an appeal but believes the military won't decide
in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible, but history is not on our side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Reserve maintains that booting May was part of abiding
by Defense Department policy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ''don't ask, don't tell'' rule enacted in 1994, gays
are admitted to the Armed Forces as long as they don't declare
their sexual orientation. In turn, the military is barred from
seeking such information about a service member.
</P>
<P>
   Since the policy has been in force, more than 5,000 people have
been discharged for breaking their silence.
</P>
<P>
   But May's case is unique because of his role as a legislator,
said Dixon Osburn, co-director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network, a group helping military members facing discharge because
of their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the grandest of ironies that the voters of Arizona chose
Steve May partially because of his honesty in being gay, and the
Army is punishing him for his honesty,'' Osburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis, who helped draft the anti-gay
policy, said May's political credentials don't have any bearing on
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't deny saying it,'' said Maginnis, now an official
with the Family Research Council. ''The (panel of colonels) had no
choice but to discharge him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army began investigating May after he discussed his
sexuality during a 1999 legislative debate over denying government
benefits to employees' gay partners.
</P>
<P>
   May, who had been open about his sexuality since his first
campaign for office in 1996, made the comments after he was
honorably discharged and before he was recalled to active duty
during the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people look at this objectively, they will recognize the
Army has made a mistake in trying to expel an outstanding officer
who has done nothing wrong,'' said Christopher Wolf, May's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   If May doesn't win his appeal from the military, he plans to
proceed in civilian courts.

<HEADLINE> Former Castro Bodyguard Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Jesus Yanez Pelletier, a human rights activist who
served as Fidel Castro's jailer, his bodyguard, then finally his
detractor, died of a heart attack Monday after collapsing as he
left a meeting at the U.S. Interests Section, his family and
friends said. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Yanez Pelletier was often introduced as ''the man who saved
Fidel,'' a former prison guard who refused orders by his superiors
in then-President Fulgencio Batista's army to poison Castro when
the future Cuban leader was jailed in the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Yanez Pelletier joined the rebel forces and after the
revolution in 1959, served as one of Castro's bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Yanez Pelletier grew disillusioned with the new
government and ultimately spent more than a decade in prison for
his political views. He joined the government opposition after he
was freed in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for his visit to the American mission was unknown.
After his collapse, he was taken to Havana's Calixto Garcia
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:20 p.m., relatives
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was in perfect condition when he left the house,'' his
stepdaughter Jesica Menendez said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   News of Yanez Pelletier's death saddened Cuba's small circle of
human rights advocates and government opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking about a man of history,'' said Elizardo
Sanchez, president of the non-governmental Cuban Commission of
Human Rights and Reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Yanez Pelletier had originally belonged to Sanchez'
organization, but broke away and helped form the Cuban Pro Human
Rights Committee, of which he was vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Yanez Pelletier was a young prison officer in 1953 when Castro
was jailed for 22 months after he and his followers launched a
disastrous attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern
city of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   That attack marked the beginning of Castro's revolutionary
battle and is now commemorated annually as a holiday by the
communist government.

   On Castro's first trip to the United States as Cuba's new prime
minister, Yanez Pelletier accompanied him and can be seen in
black-and-white photographs of Castro's meeting with then-Vice

<HEADLINE> Colombia Peace Process Hits Impasse  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Peace talks with Colombia's largest
rebel group hit an impasse Monday over the guerrillas' refusal to
deliver to authorities a rebel who hijacked an airplane earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, announced
it would not hand over Arnubio Ramos, the man who commandeered a
commuter airliner Sept. 9 and forced it to land in rebel territory.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, including peace envoy Camilo Gomez, had
insisted the guerrillas turn over the hijacker as a matter of
respect for the law and an indicator of its sincerity in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   But the guerrillas flatly refused in a statement issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos hijacked the plane on his own account, the rebels argued,
meaning that ''the FARC bears no responsibility.'' The group said
it had signed no agreement binding it to hand over fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse written reply, the government said the FARC's
decision ''contributes nothing to the advance of the dialogues and
the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed to meet again later this month. However,
the government indicated it would be impossible to press ahead with
the peace negotiating agenda until the dispute over the hijacker is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators had planned to begin discussions this month on a
cease-fire in the South American country's 36-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels warned President Pastrana against using the hijacking
as a ''pretext to rupture the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, a federal prisoner, grabbed a gun and hijacked a plane
with 22 aboard as he was being transported. He eluded three federal
prison guards who were escorting him on the flight from Bogota to
the southwestern city of Florencia.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping him off at a FARC-run southern airport, the plane
and its occupants returned safely to its route.
</P>
<P>
   The episode has prompted new and sharp criticism of Pastrana's
peace gestures toward the 15,000-strong FARC.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel-held airport is in a five township area from which
Pastrana evacuated all government troops in November 1998 as a
concession to the rebels. Slow-moving peace talks are being held in
the region, about twice the size of New Jersey, that is openly
administered by the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have already been accused of using the demilitarized
zone to conceal hijack victims, forcibly recruit new soldiers and
deepen their involvement in drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> S. African Discusses HIV, AIDS  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- In a country where roughly 10
percent of the population is HIV positive, South Africa's health
minister on Monday joined the president in saying that she
questions whether HIV alone causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   President Thabo Mbeki, who has drawn fire for courting views of
fringe AIDS theorists, has stated that the spread of AIDS can also
be linked to poverty, malnutrition and tuberculosis -- views that
defy mainstream scientific opinion.
</P>
<P>
   About 4.2 million South Africans, or 10 percent of the
population, are HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are other things we must be looking into in order to
have a comprehensive response,'' Health Minister Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang said during a news conference after attending
parliamentary briefings.
</P>
<P>
   Tshabalala-Msimang would not say whether she believed there was
a causal relationship between HIV and AIDS, and when asked whether
people not infected with HIV could die of AIDS, the minister
replied, irately: ''I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Tshabalala-Msimang's fuddled perspective on the disease may stem
from Mbeki's comments. Other members of Mbeki's Cabinet have been
equally obtuse about the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ''My views on whether HIV causes AIDS are irrelevant,'' Kader
Asmal, the education minister, said last week when asked how sex
educators planned to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Health workers say there is no clear indication of whether the
government's approach has exacerbated the spread of the virus, but
complain government statements are confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to have a campaign where people are clear and when
mixed messages are sent out and people are confused, that makes the
task more difficult,'' said Rob Eiger, director of the Society for
Family Health.
</P>
<P>
   Tshabalala-Msimang said the government had always encouraged
condom usage -- for a variety of reasons, including stopping the
spread of HIV, sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are encouraged by the increasing demand for condoms -- 200
million condoms were purchased and distributed last year by the
public health system,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Essop Pahad, a Cabinet minister in Mbeki's office who is
responsible for government communications, last week denied that
the government's AIDS prevention campaign had been a public
relations disaster, but conceded more needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government's HIV/AIDS stance drew fire from a
traditional close ally -- the 1.8 million-strong Congress of South
African Trade Unions or COSATU.
</P>
<P>
   ''For COSATU, the link between HIV and AIDS is irrefutable and
any other approach is unscientific and unfortunately likely to
confuse people,'' the labor federation's president Willie Madisha
told delegates attending a conference near Johannesburg.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Claims Victory  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's opposition claimed
Monday it had captured a string of villages and military posts from
the ruling Taliban in two days of sustained fighting near the
northern city of Taloqan.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition was driven out of Taloqan two weeks ago in a
major setback, and now holds dwindling pockets in the north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But in fighting just outside the city, the opposition seized two
villages northwest of Taloqan in fighting that erupted before dawn
Monday, opposition spokesman Mohammed Abil said.
</P>
<P>
   At least six Taliban soldiers were killed, and the opposition
lost two fighters in an artillery battle that lasted several hours,
Abil said by telephone from northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the opposition captured nine military posts northeast of
Taloqan on Sunday, though Taliban fighters managed to retake one of
them Monday, Abil said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition has vowed to launch a counteroffensive for
Taloqan, 160 miles north of the capital Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, which control more than 90 percent of Afghanistan,
have imposed rigid Islamic law in areas under their authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are seeking to cut off opposition supply routes
before the winter sets in. The opposition, which is composed of
ethnic Tajiks and other minorities, receives supplies via
neighboring Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 civilians, mostly children and the elderly, became
sick and died after the mass exodus from Taloqan two weeks ago, an
opposition official said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Mateen Adrak, who heads the opposition's relief efforts,
estimated that about 100,000 civilians -- half of Taloqan's
population -- fled to surrounding villages as the Taliban seized
control.
</P>
<P>
   The impoverished villages have also been hit by drought this
year and have little food or medicine, Adrak said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups and journalists who visited the region have offered
similar assessments.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Taliban newspaper said many residents who initially
fled had returned to Taloqan and were pleased that order had been
restored to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition was exaggerating the number of displaced people
in a bid to receive additional aid, the newspaper Hewad reported
Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- David Flusser, whose research on early
Christianity's relationship to Judaism won him international
recognition, died Friday of heart disease. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   His book ''Jesus'' was translated in several languages and was
celebrated for presenting the Christian messiah in the context of
his time.
</P>
<P>
   Flusser was born in Vienna, Austria, and came to Palestine as a
refugee from Europe on the eve of World War II. He received his
doctorate at Hebrew University where he taught in the comparative
religions department. He won the Israel Prize, the country's most
prestigious award, in 1980.
Gordon Hanson:
</P>
<P>
   RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) -- Journalist Gordon J. Hanson, who had
worked for The Associated Press and the Rapid City Journal, died
Saturday in a car crash. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson retired from the Rapid City Journal in 1991. Before that,
he was an Associated Press correspondent in Fargo and Bismarck,
N.D.
</P>
<P>
   He was a founder and first president of the West River chapter
of the Korean War Veterans Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters.
Ralph G. Hubbell:
</P>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Ralph G. Hubbell, a western New York
sportscaster for six decades, died Friday. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell worked for various radio stations during the early
1930s, and in 1939 was hired by the Buffalo Broadcasting Corp.'s
combined WGR-WKBW radio operation.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, often calling himself ''Old Man Mose'' or ''Hub,'' did
sports commentary and play-by-play coverage of University of
Buffalo football games staring in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his 80s, he was still doing some work as a columnist and
host of ''Aging is for Everyone,'' a monthly program on WKBW.
Stanley Reed Murphy:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Stanley Reed Murphy, a leading University of
Washington oceanographic engineer whose research benefited
commercial fishing interests and submarine builders, died Sept. 11
of cancer. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had been a director of the university's Division of
Marine Resources, Washington Sea Grant and the Applied Physics Lab
and played a central role in establishing the national Sea Grant
program, which helped provide information from oceanographic
research for commercial and military applications.
</P>
<P>
   His research on ocean temperatures, salt concentrations and
currents proved vital in making submarines difficult to detect. He
retired in 1987.
Jesus Yanez Pelletier:
</P>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Jesus Yanez Pelletier, a human rights activist who
served as Fidel Castro's jailer, bodyguard and later became a
detractor, died of a heart attack Monday. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Yanez Pelletier was often introduced as ''the man who saved
Fidel,'' a former prison guard who refused orders by his superiors
in then-President Fulgencio Batista's army to poison Castro when
the future Cuban leader was jailed in the mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   After the revolution in 1959, he became one of Castro's
bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   But over time, Yanez Pelletier grew disillusioned with the new
government and ultimately spent more than a decade in prison for
his political views. He joined the government opposition after he
was freed in the 1970s.
William Zimmerman:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- William Zimmerman, who started the Pic ''N''
Save retail chain with a single store in Southern California, died
Sept. 9. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, a World War II veteran, settled in Los Angeles in the
late 1940s and began reselling merchandise purchased from
manufacturers at discount to grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually opened his own store, called Freight Outlet, and
roamed in a convertible filled with goods he purchased for as
little as 10 cents on the dollar. He renamed the close-out chain
Pic ''N'' Save in the 1960s to erase the image that it sold salvage
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   The company grew from its first store in Culver City and to 90
outlets in seven southwestern states. The nationwide chain is now a
part of Consolidated Stores.

<HEADLINE> Gangs Free 200 Brazil Inmates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Three gangs of armed gunmen broke into
three jails in separate incidents, freeing more than 200 inmates,
many of them convicted and suspected drug traffickers, officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ten men wearing masks and armed with automatic weapons Sunday
night stormed the jail in the city of Sumare, about 80 miles
northwest of Sao Paulo, and after ''overpowering and
pistol-whipping two guards, freed 91 inmates,'' inspector Paulo
Roberto Rodrigues said by phone. Six inmates had been recaptured so
far.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the breakout, 100 prisoners were being held in
four cells built to hold no more than 40 inmates, Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, seven men armed with shotguns raided a
jailhouse in Santa Isabel, a poor district on the outskirts of Sao
Paulo, and freed 86 inmates, 14 of whom were recaptured.
</P>
<P>
   ''They grabbed the two guards on duty and locked them in a
cell,'' local Police Chief Naif Saad Neto said. ''Then they opened
the other cells and freed the inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the jailhouse, which was built to hold 32 inmates, was
holding 136.
</P>
<P>
   The third breakout occurred early Monday, when 15 men armed with
machine guns barged into the police station in the Sao Paulo
district of Sapopemba and freed 28 prisoners. So far, three inmates
had been recaptured.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all happened in about three minutes,'' Sapopemba Police
Chief Eliton Martinelli said. ''The five guards on duty, one of
whom was pistol-whipped, were easily dominated and had no chance of
reacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the three jails said most of the escaped inmates
were either convicted or suspected of drug trafficking or burglary.
</P>
<P>
   The Sao Paulo State Security Department said there were no clear
signs that the three jailbreaks were part of a coordinated action.

<HEADLINE> Cool Weather Helps Colo. Fire Fight  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Residents breathed a sigh of relief Monday
as firefighters took advantage of cooler, cloudy weather to get the
upper hand on a fire threatening dozens of mountain homes.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was 60 percent contained by nightfall Monday and full
containment was expected late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not over yet, but it's close,'' said Randy Burgess, a
spokesman for the fire managers.
</P>
<P>
   About 220 residents were told they could return to their homes
Monday night. But electrical power had been cut and could remain
off three more days, Boulder County Sheriff's Office supervisor
Krista Kaknes said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which jumped from treetop to treetop Sunday, smoldered
close to the ground Monday. Crews worked in 70-degree weather,
clearing brush away from houses and building lines around the blaze
near Flagstaff Mountain about 10 miles southwest of Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe the fire was started by an illegal campfire
in the area on Friday. It grew quickly throughout the weekend,
nearly doubling in size on Sunday to nearly 1,100 acres.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, land just outside the houses was blackened but
all homes were saved, incident commander Joe Hartman said. Many
residents had waited at roadblocks, hoping for a chance to return
to home.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gullett, waiting in a pickup truck packed with personal
belongings, including his grandmother's crystal and his 7-year-old
son's school artwork, said he was pleased with the firefighters'
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been amazing. It's really something how they work real
hard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Colorado fires burned more than 10,000 acres each in June,
one 35 miles southwest of Denver and the other just east of Rocky
Mountain National Park. In July, fires in and around Mesa Verde
National Park burned 23,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Near Glencoe, Okla., a fire destroyed at least four houses and
charred dozens of acres of trees and ranch property. Residents
hosed down their homes as flames leaped over 20-foot pine and cedar
trees nearby.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, a series of lightning-sparked grass fires on
Sunday joined into a blaze that was estimated at 25,000 acres
before it was contained early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Six outbuildings and an old unoccupied farmhouse were burned.
Some of the acreage blackened was in the Houk Ranch, which was
shown in the movie ''Dances With Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6.7 million acres have burned across the United States
this year. It has been called the nation's worst fire season in a
half century.

<HEADLINE> Driver dies as NJ Transit bus plows into house, but which came first? </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENNIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - A bus plowed into a house Monday
after its driver was stricken at the wheel. He died at the scene,
but authorities were unsure which came first - his death or the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   James Rapp, 49, of Blackwood, a veteran NJ Transit driver, was
piloting the Philadelphia-to-Cape May bus when he slumped over and
lost control about 9 a.m., witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The 15,000-pound bus then veered off Route 47, crossed two grass
medians, ripped through a guardrail and plunged down a 5-foot
embankment before piercing the front of the unoccupied house.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the seven passengers aboard were hurt. Beatrice Smith,
73, of Millville, was in serious but stable condition in the
intensive care unit at Burdette Tomlin Memorial Hospital on Monday
night; Tonya Palmer, 28, of Glassboro, was still under observation
Monday night and was in satisfactory condition, and Ramonita
Tirado, 55, of Woodbine was treated and released, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was talking to the one lady, and she said he just kind of
slumped over in his seat,'' said Lt. Fred McFarland of the New
Jersey State Police.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy will be performed Tuesday to determine the cause of
death. ''We're leaning toward some type of medical problem, but we
won't know for sure until the autopsy's complete,'' said Sgt. Al
Della Fave, a spokesman for the state police.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not know how fast the bus was traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was asleep, but I woke up when I heard this lady
screaming,'' said passenger Edward Pettit, 37, of Villas. ''We were
on the median, and then we flew through that guardrail like it was
nothing, like it wasn't even there.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no skid marks. Witnesses said the bus never slowed
down after it left the eastbound lane of Route 47, traveling about
300 feet before it hit the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard three bangs, that was it,'' said a neighbor who
wouldn't identify herself. ''No screeching brakes, no horns, no
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus came to rest with its front end wedged into the left
front corner of the wood-frame, two-story house, demolishing the
living room and part of the front porch. The bus's left front wheel
was hanging into the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The impact lifted the house about 6 inches off its foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The man and woman who own the home were at work when it
happened. Her two children were at school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel lucky for not being here and the kids being in school,
but I feel unlucky because I don't know what I'm going to do now,''
said Paula Guzinski, 36, surveying the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp, a 26-year driver for NJ Transit, had a clean record,
according to state Department of Motor Vehicles officials and NJ
Transit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a stellar driving record,'' said NJ Transit spokeswoman
Anna Farneski. ''Mr. Rapp has not received a citation for
committing any sort of traffic violation for more than 24 years. In
bus circles, that's pretty impressive. This is someone who drove
eight hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after the accident, two NJ Transit tow trucks pulled
the bus away from the house, triggering a shower of glass shards,
wood slats and insulation.
</P>
<P>
   The bus's front windshield was shattered, and a 15-foot board
jutted awkwardly from the front of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never did like buses that much,'' said Wayne Boney, 31, who
lives with Guzinski. ''They need to slow down. They go 65 and 70
miles per hour through here.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzinski said she had just taken out a home equity loan to fix
up the house, which is about 100 years old. Now, she said, she
doesn't know what she will do.
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't going to make 101,'' McFarland said.

<HEADLINE> Small explosion, fire forces evacuation of building at Rutgers-Newark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A small explosion and fire forced the
evacuation of a classroom building at the Rutgers University Newark
Campus on Monday night, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured by the small blast and blaze believed to be
caused by a student science experiment that went awry at about 6
p.m. in Boyden Hall, according to university spokeswoman Helen
Paxton.
</P>
<P>
   A student or lab supervisor quickly extinguished the fire,
Paxton said. The building was evacuated and an acrid smell hung in
the air, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The building was expected to be kept clear through Tuesday
morning while members of the Rutgers Environmental Health and
Safety unit went through.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think it's something hazardous, but they are cleaning
it up,'' Paxton said.
</P>
<P>
   While it was believed to be caused by a student experiment in
the building that houses science classrooms and labs, Paxton said
the cause of the explosion is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> New Trial Sought in Aryan Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- A defense lawyer on Monday sought a
new trial for the white supremacist Aryan Nations, which could lose
all its assets as a result of a $6.3 million civil judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Steele, who represents the group and its leader, Richard
Butler, argued that his clients did not receive a fair trial before
the Sept. 7 verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the motion alleges juror misconduct. During
the trial, some jurors indicated they wanted to send a message to
the Aryan Nations that it was not wanted in northern Idaho, the
motion said.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors ruled that Butler, his organization and its corporate
entity, Saphire Inc., were negligent in selecting and overseeing
security guards who assaulted a mother and son, Victoria and Jason
Keenan, outside the group's compound in 1998. The Keenans sued.

<HEADLINE> FAA orders Pro Air to shut down at midnight Monday  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GOODMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) - Citing serious aircraft safety problems, the
Federal Aviation Administration ordered discount carrier Pro Air to
halt its flights by midnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Air failed to perform some scheduled engine maintenance,
allowed dents to go unrepaired for years and failed to fix other
safety defects, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling 3-year-old airline operates three Boeing 737
aircraft from Detroit City Airport. It has faced increasing
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's emergency order Monday revoked Pro Air's operating
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   The safety agency said it acted because Pro Air has shown it
''lacks the qualifications required of the holder of an air carrier
certificate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Continuing maintenance, oversight, quality control and
record-keeping problems resulted in widespread failures to comply
with applicable federal aviation regulations,'' the FAA said in a
news release.
</P>
<P>
   A Pro Air employee who would not give his name said he was
unaware of the order. He said the airline had a plane arriving from
New York and leaving for Chicago on Monday night, and it would fly
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   He said any other information would have to come from Eisbrenner
Public Relations in Troy. A message was left with the company
Monday evening seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines said Monday night that it would accept most
Pro Air tickets for flights on its own aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will take for standby travel anybody who's holding a
confirmed ticket for Pro Air, that is, anybody who's paid money,''
said Jon Austin, a spokesman for Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest would not honor standby tickets bought by Pro Air
customers who had not left their original destination Monday,
Austin said. But those who used standby tickets to complete half of
a round trip, or were laid over after the first leg of a trip,
could fly Northwest back to their original destination at no cost,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under FAA rules, Pro Air has 10 days to appeal the emergency
order but cannot operate unless and until it is reversed.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal would be to an administrative law judge for the
National Transportation Safety Board, said FAA spokesman Eliot
Brenner.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Pro Air, the FAA said the airline:
</P>
<P>
   -Delayed required engine fan lubrication on one aircraft this
spring by 138 flight hours beyond the maximum of 2,000 flight hours
required by safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   -Failed to repair a dent on the leading edge of one plane's
horizontal stabilizer for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   -Operated a plane for six days in February with a broken handle
on an emergency escape door.
</P>
<P>
   The order is a serious blow to Pro Air's efforts to remain in
business but is not necessarily the end of the line for the
discount airline.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA issued a similar order against ValuJet after a 1996
Florida crash that killed 110 people. The company then merged with
the Orlando-based carrier AirTran Airways, and now flies under the
name AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Air lost $9.9 million on operating revenues of $8 million in
the second quarter of 2000, according to U.S. Department of
Transportation records.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of this year, the company lost $19.8 million,
and it has lost $52 million since it began flying on July 4, 1997,
The Detroit News has reported.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Air in June halted flights to four unprofitable
destinations, as part of cost-cutting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to trimming about 90 employees, Pro Air stopped
flying to Philadelphia, Indianapolis, Seattle and Newark, N.J. It
continued flying to Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Baltimore and
Orlando, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Plane Crash Kills Four  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUIQSUT, Alaska (AP) -- A small plane crashed Monday while
landing at the Nuiqsut airport on Alaska's North Slope, killing
four of the 10 people aboard, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the plane crashed about 3 p.m. near the runway of
this village north of the Arctic Circle. It went into the tundra
and did not hit any buildings, said Paul Carr, chief of the North
Slope Borough Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The six survivors were taken by helicopter to hospitals in
Barrow, Fairbanks and Anchorage, Carr said. The identities of those
killed were being withheld pending notification of kin.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews from the North Slope Borough and the Nuiqsut
Volunteer Fire Department were at the scene near Prudhoe Bay, some
400 miles north of Fairbanks. Investigators with the National
Transportation Safety Board were expected to arrive at the crash
site Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine aircraft belonged to Cape Smythe Air in Barrow.
Cape Smythe President Grant Thompson said there were nine passenger
and a pilot aboard the Piper 1040.
</P>
<P>
   Several Cape Smythe Air planes have had mishaps this year.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a Cape Smythe Air pilot was injured after his plane
crashed on sea ice about three miles from the Kotzebue airport. On
Feb. 9, while landing at Wales, a Piper Cheyenne veered out of
control while landing, causing minor injuries to eight passengers
and a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the pilot of a Piper 1040 landed in Savoonga without
lowering his landing gear. No one was injured.

<HEADLINE> Women 'Testing' Firm Lose Bias Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Two women who applied for jobs to test whether a
security firm discriminated against minorities have lost their
lawsuit, a key federal case that asked whether it's legal to lie to
an employer in an effort to document wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   JK Guardian Security Services did not engage in biased hiring
practices by denying employment to the two black applicants who
were paid representatives of the Legal Assistance Foundation of
Chicago, a jury decided Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the first case of this kind ever to go to trial, the jury
sent a clear message that claims of discrimination will need more
than just the fact that African-Americans did not receive job
offers,'' said Douglas Drach, an attorney representing JK Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Testing opponents say one or two visits to an employer are
insufficient to prove bias.
</P>
<P>
   But civil rights advocates say testers -- long used to document
housing discrimination -- are necessary to investigate employers.
Most testing is done by private groups with financial support from
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Housing Act authorizes the use of discrimination
testers in housing. But there is no federal law or definitive court
ruling on employment testers, which made the Chicago case an
important test.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, Kyra Kyles and Lolita Pierce said they applied for
a receptionist job at Guardian in 1995 and were told selected
applicants would be called later for second interviews. But when a
white tester with similar credentials applied for the same job, she
was immediately tested, interviewed and offered the job, they said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Suzanne Conlon threw out the lawsuit, saying
the testers had no standing to sue because they didn't want the job
for which they had applied.
</P>
<P>
   But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the
decision and sent the case back for trial. The appellate court
ruled civil rights workers who apply for jobs to test whether
employers discriminate against minorities in hiring may sue those
who show bias.
</P>
<P>
   Diana White, a lawyer for the Legal Assistance Foundation, said
the group was surprised and disappointed by last week's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't talk to jurors so we don't know why they did what
they did. We thought we had strong case,'' she said. ''I don't
think it invalidates employment testing. There are plenty of other
uses for it.''

<HEADLINE> Braves 6, Mets 3  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SALADINO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Greg Maddux extended his scoreless streak to 29
innings, the longest of his career, and the Atlanta Braves once
again dominated the New York Mets at Turner Field, winning 6-3
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (18-8), coming off consecutive four-hit shutouts of
Arizona and Florida, allowed five hits in seven innings, walked
none and struck out one to beat Mike Hampton (13-10).
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, seeking its ninth straight division title, has won 19
of 21 games against the Mets in Atlanta since 1997, including last
year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves increased their NL East lead to four games over
second-place New York -- their widest since Aug. 8 -- by winning the
opener of a three-game series. The teams play three games in New
York next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who held a one-half game lead over the Braves entering
September, have staggered to a 6-11 record this month. Atlanta has
gone 10-6, including winning three in a row and five of six.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton allowed five runs, six hits and walked five in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took a 1-0 lead in the third when Andres Galarraga
doubled, took third on a groundout and scored on a squeeze bunt by
Walt Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta broke it open in the fourth on RBI singles by Chipper
Jones and Brian Jordan, and Walt Weiss' run-scoring groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga hit an RBI double in the fifth and Jordan homered off
Pat Mahomes in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored three runs in the eighth on Derek Bell's solo
homer off Kerry Ligtenberg and Robin Ventura's two-run single off
Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker retired pinch-hitter Bubba Trammell on an
inning-ending popup and finished for his 23rd save in 25 chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mike Piazza went 1-for-4 and is in a 9-for-53 slide (.170).
The Braves lead the season series 5-3. ... Hampton was hit on the
right wrist in the third inning by a Galarraga liner that knocked
the glove off his hand, but he threw Galarraga out at first. ...
Maddux was hit in the lower left leg on a one-hopper by Todd Zeile
in the fifth and threw Zeile out. ... Maddux' previous best
scoreless string was 26 innings with the Chicago Cubs from May
6-17, 1988. ... The crowd of 41,937 gave the Braves a season
attendance total of 3,000,164, the sixth time the club has gone
over 3 million and fourth straight.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 2, Cubs 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jeff D'Amico dominated the Chicago Cubs once
again, taking a shutout into the ninth inning Monday night as the
Milwaukee Brewers began their final homestand at County Stadium
with a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico (12-5) won for the third time in three starts this
season against the Cubs. He pitched 23 consecutive scoreless
innings against the Cubs this season before allowing a run in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico, who has won 10 of his last 11 decisions, walked three
and struck out seven. He didn't allow a runner to reach second base
until walking two straight batters with one out in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Leskanic relieved and allowed Mark Grace's RBI single
with two outs before getting his 11th save.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, who leads the majors with 50 home runs, was lifted
for a pinch-hitter in the fourth inning for the Cubs with lower
back tightness. He is day to day.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has lost sixth straight games and 16 of 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, who moved into County Stadium in 1970 when the
Seattle Pilots franchise relocated, are scheduled to move next
season into Miller Park.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Van Poppel (3-5), making his first start this season after
49 relief appearances, allowed one run and four hits in 5 2-3
innings, striking out eight.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers took a 1-0 lead in the third inning when Marquis
Grissom singled with two outs and Mark Loretta followed with an RBI
double into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee added an unearned run in an odd seventh. Ron Belliard
led off with a single. Raul Casanova followed with a long fly to
right-center. Right-fielder Damon Buford was charged with an error
on the misplayed fly ball, which bounced into the seats. But
Casanova was called out for passing Belliard, who hesitated between
first and second, before being awarded third base.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico hit a sacrifice fly to score the run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brewers right-fielder Jeromy Burnitz threw out Eric Young
at second base trying to stretch a single for Burnitz's 12th
assist. ... Loretta extended his hitting streak to nine games with
his third-inning double. ... Loretta reached all four times with
two doubles and two walks. ... Van Poppel became the 12th starting
pitcher used by the Cubs. The team record is 15, the last time in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors: SLA Has Violent Past  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors urged a state appeals court
Monday to allow evidence about the violent history of the
Symbionese Liberation Army into a former fugitive's bombing
conspiracy trial.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA was linked to dozens of crimes, the most notorious being
the 1974 kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Jane Olson's attorneys objected to introducing the evidence
because some of the incidents prosecutors want to bring up never
resulted in charges or occurred before their client allegedly
joined the radical group.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Soliah, is accused of
attempting to murder Los Angeles police officers by placing pipe
bombs under two squad cars in 1975, allegedly to avenge the deaths
of SLA members killed in a fiery police shootout in Los Angeles.
The bombs did not detonate and no one was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Olson was indicted in 1976 and remained a fugitive until her
arrest last year in Minnesota, where she had lived as a wife and
mother. Free on $1 million bail, she is scheduled to go on trial in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want to include evidence of other SLA crimes under a
blanket conspiracy theory and to corroborate testimony by Hearst,
now Patricia Hearst Shaw, the prosecution's reluctant star witness.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst was kidnapped by the SLA at age 19 and ultimately joined
the group. She was later convicted of taking part in an armed bank
robbery, but President Carter commuted her sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to understand the nature of the crime and the nature
of (Olson's) participation in it, it is necessary to understand the
nature of the SLA and its members,'' according to a petition filed
Monday by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge James Ideman ruled last January that
prosecutors could discuss the group's history and philosophy when
Olson goes on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's attorneys have argued that background on the SLA would
prejudice a jury during the trial and accused prosecutors of trying
to ''salvage'' a weak case by putting the SLA's entire history on
trial.

<HEADLINE> Niedermayer Isn't Asking for Trade  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Scott Niedermayer isn't going to
ask the Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils for a trade despite
getting a final offer that is $2.7 million less than he's seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can you ask for a trade when you win the Stanley Cup?''
the defenseman asked during a conference call Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been through a lot here and now is not a situation where
you ask for a trade. I hope it doesn't come to that. If it does,
this has gone a lot further than I thought it would.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer, 27, is seeking a three-year, $13.5 million deal.
Devils general manager Lou Lamoriello has offered a three-year deal
that will pay Niedermayer $3.5 million this season, with salary
increases of $100,000 in each of the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello's deal also offers incentives for selections to the
All-Star team and postseason honors that could push the deal to $4
million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello has started deducting money from his offer because
Niedermayer is missing training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer, who had seven goals and 31 assists in 71 games last
season, said what he is asking for is fair and realistic. He made
$3.25 million last season.
</P>
<P>
   The average salary of the 10 highest paid defensemen in the NHL
is $5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer is considered among the top 10 defensemen in overall
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not blind to how tough Lou is to negotiate with and how he
runs the team,'' said Niedermayer, who had five goals and two
assists in 22 playoffs games last season. ''But it's so hard to
understand his stance now.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer went through tough contract talks with Lamoriello
two years ago and played briefly in the International Hockey League
before signing a contract for basically what Lamoriello originally
offered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't enjoy fighting for every contract,'' Niedermayer said.
''I'm not hurt. It's a business and that's the nature of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer, suspended for 10 games late last season for hitting
Florida's Peter Worrell over the head with a stick, has been
skating every day while staying home in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The only other major holdout for the Devils is center Jason
Arnott, who scored the Stanley Cup-winning goal as New Jersey beat
Dallas in six games in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott has been offered a two-year contract worth $5.1 million.
He made $1.8 million in each of the last two seasons.

<HEADLINE> U.S., North Korea To Resume Talks  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and North Korea, in another
step toward a smoother relationship, have agreed to resume talks on
three key issues -- missile proliferation, nuclear weapons and
terrorism -- next week, a senior U.S. official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   From the U.S. standpoint, while North Korea recently said it
would suspend its tests of long-range missiles in exchange for an
easing of U.S. sanctions, the talks beginning Sept. 27 in New York
are designed to halt the spread of North Korean technology to Iran,
Iraq and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   At the last round of inconclusive missile talks in July, North
Korea made clear it regards its missile program as a sovereign
exercise in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   From Pyongyang's standpoint, the meetings are a chance to air
complaints that North Korea has not received all the energy
supplies due it under an agreement with the United States to freeze
its nuclear weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   The third issue, terrorism, needs to be resolved before North
Korea can hope to win U.S. acceptance. The communist North is
listed by the State Department as a supporter of terrorism, and
thereby under U.S. law is barred from receiving other than
humanitarian assistance such as food.
</P>
<P>
   The senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the talks could go on a few days or longer, depending on the
progress made.
</P>
<P>
   U.s relations with North Korea have been on the upswing since
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung moved toward reconciliation
with the Stalinist regime in the North -- a move that was welcomed
by North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   But the search at the Frankfurt, Germany, airport of the North
Korean delegation to the United Nations' Millennium Summit earlier
this month caused a ripple of ill will.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation canceled its trip to New York, and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright subsequently said she regretted the
incident and that the search by German security personnel was not
authorized by U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun decided
not to attend the U.N. General Assembly meetings last week. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said ''unavoidable reasons''
were behind the cancellation and not aimed at slowing momentum
toward improved relations.
</P>
<P>
   The visit had been foreseen as a possible opportunity for
Albright to meet with the foreign minister, which would have
shifted the improving relationship into higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   The New York talks next week will be held at the working rather
than ministerial level.

<HEADLINE> Brazil 3, Egypt 0 in Volleyball  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Brazil got a scare in the opening set
from Egypt before recovering to win 3-0 in the second round of
men's volleyball preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Amaral had 13 kills and the Brazilians neutralized Egypt's
limited offensive threats in the 30-28, 25-18, 25-21 victory
Tuesday (Monday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Brazil (2-0) next faces the Netherlands, the 1996 gold medalist,
in Group A.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt (0-2), making only its second Olympic appearance after a
10th-place finish in 1984, simply didn't have the blockers to stop
the efficient Brazilian attack.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Egyptians actually had Brazil at match point in the
first set, leading 24-23. But a solid slam by Gustavo Endres and a
short dink by Douglas Chiarotti gave the Brazilians the lead back.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt staved off four match points, but on the fifth, Brazil's
Nalbert Bitencourt drove a spike off the block out of bounds for
the winner at 30-28.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt got within 21-19 in the third set before Brazil surged
again, with Amaral delivering the winning kill.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdy El Safy had nine kills to lead Egypt, which had an attack
percentage of just .446, compared with .568 for the Brazilians.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Insurance Commissioner Harry Low took the

   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Orioles right fielder Brady Anderson
was ejected by home plate umpire Jerry Meals in the fifth inning of
Monday night's game against Oakland for arguing balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   After Meals called a 2-1 pitch from Athletics starter Kevin
Appier a strike, Anderson stepped out of the batter's box, calmly
disagreeing with Meals.
</P>
<P>
   When the discussion lasted almost a minute, Orioles manager Mike
Hargrove came out of the dugout to intercede, standing between
Anderson and Meals and carrying on an animated discussion with the
umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove returned to the dugout, but Anderson continued to argue
the call and was ejected for the second time this season. He was
previously ejected on July 14.

By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- Oh, Doctor!
</P>
<P>
   Dot Richardson committed two errors in the top of the 11th
inning as Japan beat the United States 2-0 on Tuesday (Monday night
EDT) to snap the U.S. softball team's 112-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The United States (2-1) loaded the bases in the seventh, eighth
and ninth innings. In the 10th and 11th, when each team starts with
a runner on second, the Americans had two runners on each time.
</P>
<P>
   But they couldn't manage the hit they needed off reliever Juri
Takayama -- stranding 20 runners in all to suffer their first loss
since the 1998 world championships -- and their first loss ever to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11th, Japan (3-0) moved its free baserunner to third on a
groundout. Haruka Saito hit a grounder to Richardson; the erstwhile
orthopedic surgeon bobbled the ball, then recovered before throwing
it wild to first base and allowing the game's first run to score.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's second error came as she tried to cut off a throw
to second to guard against a double steal. The ball rolled into
center field and another runner came home to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Bustos and Sheila Douty singled to score the free
baserunner and make it 2-1. But Douty was caught going to second,
then Takayama struck out Jennifer Brundage and Stacey Nuveman
looking to end it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Maureen O'Toole can't do it every time
and, apparently, neither can the U. S. women.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's captain, Bridgette Gusterson, scored with 2:56
remaining to lift the home country to a 7-6 victory over the
Americans on Tuesday (Monday night EDT) at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans fell behind 5-3, but tied it on a power-play goal
by Brenda Villa -- started by an O'Toole's steal -- with 3:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   Gusterson, who had two goals, came down on Australia's next
possession and whipped a right-handed shot past goalie Nicolle
Payne for the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had several chances to tie. Villa hit crossbar
on her next attempt, Coralie Simmons had a turnover and, in a
6-on-5 situation in the final minute, Australia's Joanne Fox broke
up a crossing pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, now 2-1-1 in the Olympics' first women's
tournament, are still in great shape for the medal round. In their
final preliminary game, they meet Kazakstan, which has been
outscored 27-11 in losing its first three games.
</P>
<P>
   An air of magic that had surrounded the United States, led by
39-year-old star O'Toole, was taken away by the Australians and
their wild fans. Each American error was cheered. When chants of
''U-S-A, U-S-A'' went up at the Ryde Aquatic Center, they were
overwhelmed by ''Aussie, Aussie, Aussie.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia moved in front with three goals in the first 1:19 of
the third quarter, the first two following fouls by Ericka Lorenz.
Naomi Castles tied it at 3-all, Yvette Higgins hit a penalty shot
when Lorenz fouled Debbie Watson in the two-meter area and
Bridgette Gusterson threw in a quick pass from Castle to lead 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Then it looked as if the Americans tried too hard to find
O'Toole, the best player in the history of women's water polo, who
returned from retirement for her only Olympic chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians were ready, swimming two and three people her
way. When O'Toole did get a clear shot, she fired wide over the top
of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenz scored twice for the United States, which slipped behind
Australia, 3-1-0, in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   After a rest day Thursday, the medal semifinals will begin
Friday. The gold and bronze games will be held Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Brazil got a scare in the opening set
from Egypt before recovering to win 3-0 in the second round of
men's volleyball preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Amaral had 13 kills and the Brazilians neutralized Egypt's
limited offensive threats in the 30-28, 25-18, 25-21 victory
Tuesday (Monday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Brazil (2-0) next faces the Netherlands, the 1996 gold medalist,
in Group A.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt (0-2), making only its second Olympic appearance after a
10th-place finish in 1984, simply didn't have the blockers to stop
the efficient Brazilian attack.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Egyptians actually had Brazil at set point in the
first set, leading 24-23. But a solid slam by Gustavo Endres and a
short dink by Douglas Chiarotti gave the Brazilians the lead back.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt staved off four set points, but on the fifth, Brazil's
Nalbert Bitencourt drove a spike off the block out of bounds for
the winner at 30-28.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt got within 21-19 in the third set before Brazil surged
again, with Amaral delivering the winning kill.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdy El Safy had nine kills to lead Egypt, which had an attack
percentage of just .446, compared with .568 for the Brazilians.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Cuban blocking duo of 6-foot-9
Ihosvany Hernandez and 6-8 Pavel Pimienta was too much for Spain,
as the Cubans bounced back from an opening loss with a 3-1 victory
in the second round of men's volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had 16 kills and Angel Denis, the best leaper on a
Cuban team full of athletic players, had 14 in the 25-21, 25-12,
21-25, 25-20 victory Tuesday (Monday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, ranked third in the world, was routed by the defending
Olympic champions from the Netherlands in the first round 3-0. Cuba
came out strong against the Spaniards, winning the first two games
before getting behind early in the third and losing that game.
</P>
<P>
   An errant hit by Pimienta let Spain get within 22-19 in the
fourth set, but the Cubans stormed back to win three of the final
four points.
</P>
<P>
   Spain (1-1) was led by Jose Luis Molto's nine kills.

<HEADLINE> Uzbek Coach Makes Plea in Drug Case  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- An Uzbek Olympic official accused of
illegally importing a banned performance-enhancing substance will
plead innocent to the charges, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Track and field coach Sergei Voynov is free to stay in the
Olympic Village with the Uzbek team after he was granted bail
Tuesday, but he was ordered to appear in court Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Voynov, 45, was served a summons last week after Customs
officers said they found 15 vials of the banned muscle-building
drug human growth hormone in his luggage at Sydney airport.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said Voynov brought the drug into Australia as
part of treatment he was seeking for a skin disorder that causes
baldness.
</P>
<P>
   Voynov did not appear at a brief court hearing Tuesday (Monday
night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Australian lawyers acting for him asked Magistrate
Jennifer Giles to adjourn the case to another date and grant bail
to allow him to stay with the Uzbek team. Lawyers for Australian
Customs said they did not oppose bail, despite noting that Voynov
was planning to leave the country Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Under Australian state laws, magistrates have the power to order
suspects to hand in their passports if the court believes there is
a flight risk.
</P>
<P>
   Under laws passed in March, a person caught illegally importing
a performance-enhancing drug into Australia could face a maximum
penalty of five years in prison or a fine of $54,000.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials have said they could withdraw Voynov's
accreditation if it is determined he was improperly carrying human
growth hormone, or HGH.
</P>
<P>
   Uzbek National Olympic Committee president Sabuirjan Ruziev said
last week Voynov has a skin disorder called Alopecia capitis
totalis, or total baldness of the scalp, and that Voynov had
treatment with the drug Somatotropine before coming to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   An Uzbek NOC doctor said Somatotropine contained HGH.
</P>
<P>
   ''He brought it for himself because he is sick,'' said Ruziev.
</P>
<P>
   He said Voynov does not speak English and did not understand the
questions on the Customs form he turned in upon arrival in Sydney.
Voynov voluntarily informed customs officers he had the drug,
Rusiev said.

<HEADLINE> Rowing: Skricki an Olympic Finalist  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PENRITH, Australia (AP) -- Anyone who thinks it's too late to
start a world-class athletic career, especially in a sport they've
never tried, should look at Carol Skricki.
</P>
<P>
   Skricki was getting over the breakup of her alternative rock
band in 1991 when she took her first sculling lesson only because a
friend dragged her along. She was so hooked, she quickly traded her
bass guitar for an oar.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday (Monday night EDT), Skricki and partner Ruth Davidon
advanced to the Olympic finals in the double scull by winning their
second-chance classifying heat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day, I'm amazed,'' said Skricki, who was 30 when she
first climbed into a scull and 35 when she moved to the double.
''Sometimes when we're out practicing, it just hits me. It's a
great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's coxless pair of Missy Ryan and Karen Kraft also won
their heat in the consolation repechage round. The 1996 Olympic
silver medalists also move straight to the finals on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, are an inspiring group, having given up the sport
immediately after a close loss in Atlanta and then reuniting two
years ago. Ryan's comeback is special because two months after the
last Olympics, she donated a kidney to her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always some nerves to get into the final, so we're
happy to be there,'' said Kraft, who used the time off to begin
working on a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   The other three U.S. teams that competed Tuesday advanced to
Thursday's semifinals: single scullers Monica Tranel Michini and
Don Smith, and the men's double scull of Henry Nuzum and Mike
Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Another round of repechage will be held Wednesday for the other
seven rowing events. The United States is the only country that
qualified for all 14 events and so far is on pace to make all the
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Davidon making the finals is no surprise considering she
finished sixth in the single sculls in Atlanta. Skricki was among
the people she beat in the Olympic trials that year.
</P>
<P>
   Skricki entered the race mainly to try catching the eye of the
U.S. coaches in hopes of earning a spot on the national team. A few
months later, national sculling coach Igor Grinko invited her to a
training camp in Augusta, Ga., because he was intrigued by her
6-foot-2 frame and raw strength.
</P>
<P>
   Skricki was switched to the double and success came quickly. She
won on national champion crews in 1997 and '98, then won the '99
national team trials.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year she was teamed with Davidon, who had retired
after Atlanta to pursue a medical degree. They finished second at
the Olympic qualifying regatta in Lucerne, Switzerland, and took
bronze at a World Cup stop in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may seem like I have risen quickly, but I don't feel like
I've sat in one place,'' said Skricki, who now lives in Augusta.
''I've gone up in a pretty methodical way.''
</P>
<P>
   Skricki doesn't play much guitar any more. In case you couldn't
tell, she's the type who goes all out into whatever she's doing and
demands a lot from herself. So if she can't play at her best, she
would rather not do it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rowing takes so much mental and physical energy,'' she said.
''I like to be very focused on one point. Ruth can multitask. We're
very different, but when we're in the boat, we have one mind.''

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Lead Skins 17-14 After 3Q  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys overcame two touchdowns
by Stephen Davis and a pair of turnovers to take a 17-14 lead over
the Washington Redskins after three quarters Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Up 14-7 at halftime, the Cowboys moved 62 yards on the first
possession of the third quarter before Tim Seder kicked a 32-yard
field goal. The drive was aided by a pass-interference call against
Darrell Green and featured a 14-yard quarterback draw by Randall
Cunningham on third-and-10 from the Washington 32.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys then forced a punt. On first down, a high pass from
Cunningham deflected off Chris Warren's hands and was intercepted
by Sam Shade at the Dallas 23. Davis ran five straight times,
scoring from the 1 to bring Washington to 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   On Dallas' next series, Ragib Ismail fumbled on the Washington
35. But the Redskins failed to capitalize and punted after making
one first down.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Cunningham threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to
Warren and Emmitt Smith scored on a fourth-down run for the
underdog Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The lone score of the second quarter came by Smith, who took a
pitchout on a fourth-and-1 play from the 3 and avoided two
defenders on his way into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The drive, which covered 51 yards, started after Greg Ellis
recovered a fumble by Washington quarterback Brad Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Warren made it 7-7 with 2:32 left in the first quarter. The
running back lined up wide and was all alone when catching the pass
from Cunningham, who started a second straight week with Troy
Aikman sidelined by a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins took a 7-0 lead when Champ Bailey ran 54 yards
after taking a handoff from Deion Sanders on a punt return, setting
up a fourth-down touchdown run by Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, facing his former team for the first time, caught the
Cowboys' first punt of the night on the 10 and broke left. Bailey
took a handoff and ran toward the right sideline, moving to the
Dallas 33 before finally being hauled down.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were seeking to avoid falling to 0-3 for the first
time since 1989, when they went 1-15. Their only win that season
was a 13-3 upset of the Redskins on the road.

<HEADLINE> IOC Rips Weightlifting Rule  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A senior International Olympic
Committee official on Tuesday (Monday night EDT) criticized the
rule that led to the short-lived suspension of the entire Romanian
weightlifting team.
</P>
<P>
   The International Weightlifting Federation kicked out the
seven-member team Sunday because three Romanian lifters -- including
two on the Olympic team -- had failed drug tests this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the federation lifted the ban on the five ''clean'' lifters
Monday after the Romanian Olympic Committee agreed to pay a $50,000
fine. Such a waiver is included in the IWF's rules.
</P>
<P>
   The decision led to widespread confusion, with the IOC medical
director declaring at one point that Romania couldn't buy its way
back. Later, after a frantic round of phone calls and meetings, the
reinstatement was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a difference of opinion and interpretation of the
rule,'' IOC vice president Kevan Gosper of Australia said. ''The
IWF has put in a rule that is not appropriate. The rule is open to
misinterpretation and ambiguity and this was a classic case of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure the federation will learn the lesson from that. They
should take the guys out who cheated and leave in the others. The
real issue is the people who have cheated should be taken out,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the whereabouts of Traian Ciharean, one of the
Romanians who tested positive, was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Ciharean, a bronze medalist at the Barcelona Olympics, left the
athletes' village Monday night after turning in his credential and
has not been in contact since, team spokesman Alex Epuran said.
</P>
<P>
   Epuran said Ciharean did not leave Sydney on the flight booked
by the Romanian Olympic Committee.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Health Care Workers Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hundreds of nurses and other
Sacramento County health workers went on strike for higher wages
Monday, closing at least one clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The Women, Infants and Children clinic also had to turn away
about 300 patients because only three of 23 employees showed up,
office manager Susan Ickes said. A clinic in the south part of the
city was closed for lack of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The strike was authorized earlier this month by the 550-member
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local
146. Approximately 300 union members formed picket lines over what
they say are low wages plan to continue the strike Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't make any more unless I leave or get a raise in this
new contract,'' said Janet Morales-Rodriquez, a nutritional
assistant who makes $12 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The county's rejected offer would have left them earning 15
percent below market level, workers said, adding that the proposed
cost-of-living increase doesn't take workers' own rising insurance
costs into account.
</P>
<P>
   The workers' three-year contract ran out June 30.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Transit Strike Affects 450,000  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL CHAVEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A transit strike forced nearly half a million
Southern California commuters to scrounge for rides or get behind
the wheel themselves Monday at the start of the work week,
worsening traffic on already clogged streets and freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Some commuters showed up at bus stops and waited in vain as
temperatures rose into the 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't know what else to do. I called my friend, but I
don't see him,'' Cesar Marroquin, 34, said as he waited for a ride
to East Los Angeles Occupational School, where he was scheduled to
take a test.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,300 members of the United Transportation Union went on
strike over wages and overtime Saturday, halting 2,000 buses and
rail and subway lines serving a 1,400-square-mile area. An
estimated 450,000 people in the car-dependent region depend on the
transit system.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from both sides planned to meet Tuesday, and
Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman Rick Jager said
transit system negotiators and a state mediator were ready to
bargain. Union spokesman Goldy Norton said only that union
representatives would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Freeway traffic rose about 5 percent during the morning commute,
the California Highway Patrol reported. The CHP said a lack of
major crashes helped highways absorb the additional traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a substantial amount, but it didn't result in a major
headache like we thought,'' CHP Officer Bill Preciado said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different story on city streets, where cars snaked
bumper-to-bumper through downtown and workers complained that
commuting times had been doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Bus driver Lisa Smith picketed on a Pasadena Freeway overpass.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people should be on the buses,'' said Smith, pointing to
the freeway traffic mess below. ''People who rely on buses need
buses. We do care about the people. This is as stressful a time for
us as it is for our passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   MetroLink commuter trains, which aren't part of the strike,
arrived on schedule at the downtown Union Station. Once there,
commuters waited for others to pick them up or scattered on foot
and bicycles, which they had carried on the trains.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's affecting my boss more than me. He's stuck in traffic,
and I just have to sit out here and wait until he gets me,'' said
MetroLink commuter Tim Herrera, 31, of Fontana, who works at
Paramount studios in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA said it faces a $438 million operating deficit over the
next 10 years if it doesn't cut costs or raise fares. It wants $23
million in savings from its rail and bus operators over the next
three years by cutting overtime costs 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA proposed that 400 of its 4,400 drivers accept four-day
work weeks in which they would be on duty at least 12 hours but be
paid for only 10 hours a day. Overtime would kick in only after 12
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA has offered 2.7 percent raises per year for three years;
the unions want 4 percent per year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes To Salvage Peace Process  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A high-ranking Palestinian official said Monday
that a U.S. team was working on a position paper aimed at salvaging
the Mideast peace deal, which stalled over the sovereignty of a key
Jerusalem shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath, in the United States for
consultations on the peace process, said the paper would probably
be completed by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The paper would be comprehensive,'' Shaath said in a phone
interview from New York, where he is attending the opening of this
year's session of the U.N. General Assembly. ''It will include the
positions given by the two sides at Camp David and offer ideas to
bridge the gaps between the two positions on the issues where there
are still differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in New York, Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said
the Clinton administration was expected to ''assess'' the status of
the peace process after separate talks this week with Palestinian
and Israeli negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   It would then decide whether there is ground ''for a possible
brief and conclusive endgame, or for further fine-tuning ... or
saying that the peace process has come to an end in its present
form and we need to devise alternative ways,'' Ben-Ami said.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation at a Council on Foreign Relations luncheon in
New York, the minister said Palestinians and Israelis need to come
to agreement by mid-October ''at the latest.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the moment for further negotiations. It is the
moment of decision for leaders,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Talks broke down over Jerusalem, which both sides claim as their
capital, during U.S.-mediated peace efforts in July at the Camp
David presidential retreat in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has accused the other of backtracking on proposals
made at Camp David and progress had been deemed unlikely before the
United States issued its own bridging proposals.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ruled out Islamic
sovereignty over a key Jerusalem shrine sacred to Muslims and Jews,
formally rejecting a Palestinian compromise proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel is not only opposed to transferring sovereignty on the
Temple Mount to the Palestinians, but it is also absolutely opposed
to transferring sovereignty on the Mount to any Muslim body,''
Barak told his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, when told of Barak's response,
said, wagging his finger: ''It's not up to him to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks remain stalled over the sovereignty of the
compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as Haram
as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have insisted on sovereignty over traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem, including the Old City and its holy shrines.
Arafat has said the only other option he was willing to consider
was to hand sovereignty over the Haram as-Sharif to the Islamic
world's Jerusalem Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it is willing to relinquish parts of east
Jerusalem, but not the Temple Mount. Still, Barak has suggested he
is open to creative ideas concerning sovereignty over the Temple
Mount, as long as it is not given to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who met Monday with Christian leaders in the West Bank
town of Bethlehem, said it was not up to Israel to decide who will
be sovereign over the Old City's shrines. ''This is a Muslim,
Christian and Arab decision,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman Promotes High-Tech  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman
toured one of the high-tech companies that are cropping up on the
''Digital Coast'' here, promising economic policies that will
promote the industry's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ''This part of the country was called the Wild West,'' he told
200 employees and supporters Monday at Guidance Solutions Inc.,
which helps businesses go online. ''It's truly now become the wired
West.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut senator said Democrats, under President Clinton,
had learned to create the environment for growth to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Government policies that are fiscally responsible create
confidence in the government and help keep interest rates low so
businesses and individuals can borrow money easily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government should also aggressively promote scientific
research that can later be converted into commercial uses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman's followed his brief appearance with a $3 million
Beverly Hills fund-raiser with Vice President Al Gore, bringing the
pair again up close to the entertainment industry figures they have
scolded for marketing violent films and TV.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have charged that raising money from the industry is
hypocritical, but Kerry Glover, a director at Guidance, said she
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They stood up and said, 'Please regulate yourself, there's too
much violence,''' Glover said. ''They stood up to Hollywood and
that's not in conflict with asking them for money. At least they're
honest about it.''

<HEADLINE> Teen With AIDS Returns to Wisconsin  </HEADLINE>
By MELISSA McCORD
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A 14-year-old AIDS patient involved in a
two-month custody battle was flown back to Wisconsin on Monday to
prepare for a court hearing over where she will live.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Ray left Phoenix under orders of a Waukesha juvenile
court judge. Walking into the terminal at Milwaukee's Mitchell
International Airport, she quickly spotted friend Alicia Seabourn,
13, holding a sign that said: ''Welcome back Stephanie.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend sobbed. The girls hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie was 5 when her mother died of AIDS. Now an AIDS
patient herself, she wants to live with her paternal aunt, Cathy
Stelter, in Glendale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   But the Waukesha County Department of Health and Human Services
says she belongs in Wisconsin foster care until she can be reunited
with her father, Robert Ray. He lost custody of Stephanie two years
ago due to neglect but has undergone treatment for alcoholism in an
effort to win her back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to be back here,'' said Stephanie, who ignored
two prior court orders to return from Arizona this summer after a
two-week visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad couldn't take care of me,'' she added softly. ''We
don't even know if that's changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jennifer Shick said she would argue at Wednesday's
hearing that Ray's physical and emotional abuse of Stephanie went
beyond his alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie is not asking that Ray's parental rights be revoked
but that she may finish the school year in Arizona, giving him more
time to prove his recovery is a lasting one, Shick said.
</P>
<P>
   Shick suggested Ray renew his custody request once he is out of
a halfway house and has a steady job.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Assassination Attempted  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- The clatter of machine-gun fire
erupted in the streets of Abidjan on Monday as loyalist forces said
they battled back gunmen who stormed the home of Ivory Coast's
junta leader in an assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-dawn gunfire marked widening political and military
divisions ahead of the Oct. 22 presidential elections and
underscored fears of growing instability in this West African
nation, once a model of prosperity and calm.
</P>
<P>
   Two presidential bodyguards were killed in a two-hour gunbattle,
officials said. Four others were badly injured, they added, though
it was not immediately clear if they were attackers or presidential
guards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some young military people were more or less invited by
certain people known to me to make an attempt on my life,'' junta
leader Gen. Robert Guei said in a nationally televised broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Guei said he had been warned of a possible attack and that the
attackers were dressed as civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Guei's private home, in an upscale neighborhood on the edge of
downtown Abidjan, came under fire by armed men, Information
Minister Henri Cesare Sama said on state radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''The counterattack was fatal, swift and hard,'' Sama said.
Officials said four of the approximate 20 attackers had been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Machine-gun fire persisted for hours around Guei's residence,
and sporadic bursts could also be heard in some neighborhoods
across the city into mid-morning.
</P>
<P>
   State television showed Guei's villa scarred by hundreds of
bullets, the parking area filled with Mercedes, their windows
blasted out by gunfire. Three bloody prisoners, who had apparently
been beaten, proclaimed their innocence in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said the three prisoners were all from
northern Ivory Coast, a stronghold of support for opposition leader
Alassane Dramane Ouattara. They said a fourth was from neighboring
Liberia. Other suspects were being pursued.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent foolhardiness of an attack by a few gunmen, and the
government's swift arrests, interrogations and public airing of the
evidence sparked skepticism. Some Ivorians suspected the attack was
scripted by the junta to give the government an excuse to crack
down on Guei's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Guei came to power in a Dec. 24 coup that toppled President
Henri Konan Bedie.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior military official
said the attackers expressed anger at Guei for declaring his
candidacy in the Oct. 22 vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Guei lashed out at his opponents in a televised
speech, warning: ''It's now the time of the sword.''
</P>
<P>
   An official with Ouattara's party, the Rally of the Republicans,
on Monday accused the junta of issuing veiled threats against his
party, and said he was worried the government was using growing
instability as a pretext to arrest Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been flaring over whether Ouattara will be allowed
to seek the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came into question after a new constitution was
adopted in August. A last-minute amendment stipulates that both
parents of presidential candidates be ''of Ivorian origin'' -- a
change widely believed to be aimed at excluding Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara insists his parents were Ivorian. His opponents -- who
appear to be organized with junta support -- say they were from
Burkina Faso. Ouattara is a former prime minister who has been an
advocate for Ivory Coast's marginalized northern Muslims and large
immigrant community.

<HEADLINE> Guard Shot, Killed in Calif. Office  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LAWRENCE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A man whose disability claim had been
denied walked into a Social Security office Monday and fatally shot
a security guard before surrendering, police said. A bystander was
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Xioung Tou, 52, of Sacramento laid his gun on the guard's desk
and walked outside to give himself up, Lt. John Kane said. A
2-year-old boy believed to be his son was found outside, unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Xioung had filed a disability claim with the office that was
rejected and currently on appeal before an administrative law
judge, Social Security spokeswoman Susan Kost said, declining to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were reviewing the claim and did not know if it
was a motive for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a file that must be that thick,'' police Sgt. Rich
Gardella said, holding his fingers about 3 inches apart.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-year-old boy, found in the suspect's car, was placed in
state custody. Xioung's 3-year-old daughter was safe with relatives
late Monday but police were still trying to confirm the whereabouts
of his girlfriend who was said to be out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses ran out as the shooting started shortly after 11 a.m.
One hurried down the block to a California Highway Patrol office
and alerted officers, Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   The guard, Vincente Pacificar, 56, died on the way to a hospital
or shortly after arriving, Kane said. He worked for Paige's
Security.
</P>
<P>
   The bystander, Huang Qu Hui, 70, was shot in the abdomen. He was
in fair condition after surgery at the UC Davis Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The guard never had a chance to draw his gun, Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody was screaming and hollering ... and he said ''Hush,
hush I'm not here to hurt you guys,''' witness Diane Way told
KCRA-TV.
