<HEADLINE> Canada, US to Set Salmon Fishing Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States will
have a salmon fishing season this year again without agreement,
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
"Hopes for a negotiated settlement and cooperative management of
the North Pacific salmon fishery are effectively dead this year," said
Canada's leading newspaper the Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
Canada and the U.S. has held rounds of talks without reaching any
agreement. The United States sent a last-minute counterproposal to
Canada's final concessions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is virtually certain to be rejected soon because it revisits
scientific issues on which Canada has already taken a firm stand," the
paper reported.
</P>
<P>
"Science is not the issue," a senior advisor to the Canadian
government was quoted as saying. "We've been through those issues for
months and months."
</P>
<P>
By this weekend, Canada is likely to announce this season's fishing
plan for the Canadian fleet, in a manner which offers no cooperation
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Canada will allow its fishermen to intercept the maximum U.S.-bound
fish possible, subject only to constraints for conservation purposes.
</P>
<P>
And the United States plans to allow its fishermen to intercept
even more Canadian-bound Fraser River sockeye than it was asking in
talks which broke down last Friday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Fisheries Minister David Anderson has said that Canada is
ready to go ahead and fish salmon without reaching an agreement with
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"We have done that for the last four years, gone into a fishing
season without agreements with the Americans. It's possible to do,"
the minister was quoted as saying.

<P>
BONN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
announced today that Germany has temporarily closed its embassy in
the Central African Republic due to the worsening situation there.
</P>
<P>
Bonn also called on German nationals to leave the Central
African Republic and warned against traveling to the country.
</P>

The situation in the central African country flared up last
week after an initial protest by soldiers against unpaid wages

allowed to become an African version of the domino theory."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday, he called on the international
community to intensify their efforts in order to create the

<HEADLINE> China Wants Step-by-Step Prohibition of Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China is not opposed to a phased
ban on anti-personnel landmines (APL), but cannot agree to any
immediate total ban, China's ambassador to the Conference on
Disarmament Sha Zukang said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the last meeting of this year's second session of
the U.N.-sponsored talks, Sha said, "In order to meet its
legitimate territorial defense requirements, China cannot but
reserve its legitimate right to use APLs on its own territory
before alternative means are found and defensive capabilities
established.
</P>
<P>
"China can only accept an international APL agreement that fully
accommodates its above-mentioned security concerns," Sha said in
his speech.
</P>
<P>
"China has always pursued an independent foreign policy of peace
and never engages in overseas aggression," Sha said. "We have no
intention of using landmines in other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Should China use APLs under legitimate circumstances, it would
be for the purpose of defending itself against foreign military
intervention or aggression, safeguarding its national unification
and territorial integrity and ensuring a peaceful life for its own
people."
</P>
<P>
The conference today decided to appoint a special coordinator to
look into launching talks to ban the use, storage, production and
transfer of landmines.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation to Remain Low this Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Canada will remain at
the low end of the Bank of Canada's target range of 1 to 3 percent
for the rest of the year, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Thiessen, governor of the central bank, said Canada's
inflation would remain low because there is still slack in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Recent data showed the rate of economic expansion in Canada had
accelerated since the beginning of the year, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
The increased demand came from households and was concentrated
on interest-rate sensitive items such as housing and consumer
durables.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian industry is in a strong competitive position, and
foreign demand for Canadian goods and services would remain an
important contributor to the expanding economy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, business demand also continued strong with
increased investment in capital goods.
</P>
<P>
Canada's core rate of inflation, excluding food, energy and
indirect taxes, was 1.7 percent in March, compared with a peak of
1.8 percent in December last year.
</P>
<P>
There is still an output gap representing slack in the economy
and this will help keep inflationary pressures in the lower half
of the bank's target range, the governor noted.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rejects Line-Item Veto Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of the United
States has turned down a challenge against the presidential
line-item veto in a 7-2 decision Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was to go into effect earlier this year before
the court challenge, gives the president the power to veto
individual appropriations and limited tax loopholes instead of
having to veto an entire bill.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. District Judge Thomas Jackson ruled the law
was unconstitutional because it tried to allow Congress to
transfer legislative power to the president.
</P>
<P>
The suit challenging the line-item veto was filed in January by
five Democrats and a retired Republican Senator.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and the Justice Department had
urged Jackson to uphold the law, then the administration appealed
directly to the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Maltreatment of American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
denied any maltreatment of a black American who was arrested
eight months ago on charge of unlawful entry into the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-run official news agency IRNA, the
Iranian representative mission at the United Nations in its
statement "outrightly rejected the maltreatment of an American"
and termed it as "part of the Clinton administration's
propaganda against Iran."
</P>
<P>
Tehran issued the statement in a response to the accusation by
U.S. State Department spokesman John Dinger Wednesday against
Iranian officials for maltreating American citizen.
</P>
<P>
A black American man named Joseph Morris has been in
detention in an Iranian prison for eight months for unlawful
entry into the country.
</P>
<P>
The arrest was revealed by Iran's Judiciary Chief Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi at a press conference here on June 24.
</P>
<P>
An aide to the judiciary chief said "the gentleman, a black
Muslim, was caught in Ahvaz eight month ago. He has been in
detention since then."
</P>
<P>
Dinger said that American citizens visiting Iran were badly
treated by Iranian officials. "The State Department had
forewarned U.S. citizens of detention and harassment by Iranian
officials," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian statement said that these remarks are another
example of the malevolent U.S. propaganda against Iran.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that those individuals who illegally
enter Iran are regarded as violators and like any other sovereign
nation, Iran reserves the right of prosecuting a violator
according to the defined laws of the country.
</P>
<P>
More than once, the U.S. citizen who is detained for illegal
entry into Iran has met officials of the Swiss consulate in
Tehran which takes care of American interests in Iran, the
statement said.

<HEADLINE>   China's Disarmament Ambassador on Anti-Personnel Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Ambassador for Disarmament
Affairs Sha Zukang today appealed to developed countries to make
greater efforts to help clear anti-personnel landmines (APL) left
over from past conflicts so that local people affected by the
mines could lead normal lives.
</P>
<P>
He said the clearance of abandoned landmines should become an
important element in resolving the APL issue, both from the point
of view of humanitarian concerns and of the fulfillment of arms
control obligations.
</P>
<P>
Sha was speaking at the last meeting of the current session of
the Conference on Disarmement in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to appoint a coordinator to look into
launching talks on banning the use, storage, production and
transfer of landmines.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The most pressing issue facing the international
community is the early elimination of civilian casualties caused
by landmines.
</P>
<P>
"Almost all such casualties have been caused by those landmines
already deployed. So long as these landmines remain uncleared,
people living in landmine-affected places cannot enjoy
tranquility, let alone a peaceful life and economic
reconstruction."
</P>
<P>
Sha said he hoped all capable countries, especially those
developed countries with better financial resources technologies
and equipment, would make even greater efforts to help removing
landmines left over from past conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Talking about landmines on the territories of some countries
deployed or abandoned by foreign troops, Sha said, "These countries
concerned have requested the mine-deploying countries to shoulder the
responsibility of removing those landmines."
</P>
<P>
Sha said measures should also be taken to prevent the
indiscriminate use of landmines, especially the old-type dumb
mines. "Only in this way can we resolve the landmine issue once
and for all."

<HEADLINE> EDs: Repeat With Date Correction hke -- Waigel Says Tax Reform Vital for German Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
said today that the government's planned tax reform would help
boost the economy, employment and flagging foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-99 tax reform plan involves cutting mainly income and
corporate tax levels, with total net tax cuts reaching 30 billion
marks (17.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The negative image of Germany as a high-tax country will
become invalid," Waigel told the Bundestag, the lower house of
parliament dominated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's center-right
coalition, which is expected to pass the tax bill today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bill would close a series of complex tax
loopholes to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
Waigel said the tax reform plan would boost economic growth,
help reduce Germany's record unemployment which is now over 11
percent and reverse the fall in foreign investment over the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
After being approved by the Bundestag, the bill will go to the
Bundesrat, the upper house, which is controlled by the main
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD). The SPD has vowed to
veto the reform plan.
</P>
<P>
Its finance expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier described as "crazy"
the government's plan to reduce the top marginal income tax rate
to 39 percent from the present 53 percent.
</P>
<P>
If the veto succeeds, the bill will be sent to a mediating
committee consisting of government and opposition members to
negotiate a compromise.

<HEADLINE> Russian Opposition Defends Lenin Mausoleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Russian left-wing
oppositions today expressed their determination to prevent the
reburial of Lenin's body and to defend the Lenin's Mausoleum in
Red Square, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the editorial office of the newspaper
"Pravda" the leaders of the recently formed "Lenin Defense
Committee" unanimously agreed that the reburial of Lenin's body
and removal of the Mausoleum from the Red Square would mean "a
step towards civil war".
</P>
<P>
A statement distributed at the press conference warns that "the
wrath of the people could erupt into unpredictable forms and
dimensions if this dark plan was carried out."
</P>
<P>
These opposition leaders said in the document "We declare that
we shall resort to all the available ways and means to resist it,
ranging from the publication of leaflets to direct confrontation."
</P>
<P>
The "Lenin Defense Committee" consists of leaders of most of
the Russian parties and organizations of communist hue and of
"left-patriotic" orientation, include leaders of the "Labour
Russia" -- Viktor Anpilov, the Russian Communist Party-CPSU --
Alexei Prigarin, the Russian Communist Party -- Anatoly Kryuchkov,
and other committee members.
</P>
<P>
Prigarin said that in addition to "all forms of propaganda and
agitation, we shall consider the possibility of forming
detachments to defend the Mausoleum". These will not be armed
formations, he explained, "but, if it is needed, tens or even
hundreds of times more people will march to Red Square than those
that gathered at the White House in 1993."
</P>
<P>
Leader of the "Revival" Party Valery Skurlatov said that his
party members are ready to the defense of the Mausoleum when the
alarm signal is sounded."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Anpilov also promised to draw up a "black
list" of journalists, scientists, cultural leaders, and artists,
who share the idea of reburying the body of the leader, as well as
a list of "Lenin's friends."

MOGADISHU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the armed wing of
the Islamic Fundamentalist Organization, Hassan Dahir Aweys was
wounded and another religious militia officer killed last night
by unidentified gunmen along the road linking Mogadishu to Baidoa
in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports today, the two officers were leading
AL-Itihad reinforcement militiamen towards Gedo region where
fighting is taking place between their forces and the Marehan
clansmen of Somali National Front (SNF).
</P>
<P>
The AI-Itihad reinforcement unit consisting of three vehicles
and a number of armed men was ambushed by unidentified militiamen
near the airport of Ballidogle, 90km west of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Militia officials from the fundamentalist group said the
incident was tactfully pre-planned to sabotage what they called
the Holy Jihad against the pagans who invaded Gedo region,
nevertheless independent sources attributed the attack to
banditry activity that persisted in the area for some time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international aid agencies in Mogadishu and the
port town of Merca suspended their operations today in a one-day
mourning for the killing of the Portuguese gynecologist doctor in
Baidoa on Friday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Urged to Invest in Former Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy Foreign
Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad today called on domestic companies to
speed up exploring investment opportunities in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"Many international companies are pouring into that region to
seek new opportunities for investment and trade purposes," Pahad
said, noting that "if South African companies hesitate, it will
be a hesitation to their own loss."
</P>
<P>
Pahad made the remarks at a press conference briefing
reporters on a two-day visit by a government task team to the DRC
earlier this week to explore how South Africa could assist
reconstruction in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The group, headed by Pahad, included officials from the South
Africa Reserve Bank, the Development Bank of South Africa, and
the Departments of Finance and of Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Their mission included talks with DRC President Laurent
Kabila, who took over the country in May after ousting former
president Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
"With the new attempt to form a less corrupt and more honest
government, our investors should consider that it is a good
opportunity to go in," Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
Several South African companies, especially in the mining
industry, were already involved in the DRC. "It would be good if
people go and see how to increase their involvement. I want to
believe the potential is tremendous," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Pahad, priorities in DRC include mass rural
electrification projects and industrialization, with the emphasis
on the manufacturing and mining sectors.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said the task team would submit proposals to the
government and other bodies on how South Africa could get
involved in the DRC's reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> 10 Killed in Clash in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed and
an undetermined number of others wounded in today's intense combat
between government soldiers and Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) rebels in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Citing an initial military report, the local television ABS-CBN
said the slain included four soldiers and two civilians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MILF Vice Chairman Al Hadj Murad told the television
that the group has decided to postpone its peace talks with the
government scheduled for June 28 and 29 due to the ongoing
fighting in North Cotabato province.
</P>
<P>
But Gen. Arnulfo Acedera, chief of staff of the Armed Forces,
told reporters that the military will continue its ongoing
offensive against the MILF despite the rebels' threat to pull out
from the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
He said the military will go on with its ground and air attacks
on the positions of the rebels to save the 40 hostages who remain
in the hands of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Acedera said this new hostage-taking incident was a
diversionary tactic of the MILF to relieve military pressure on
its Rajamuda camp in Pikit town, North Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
Today's conflict broke out at 5:30 a.m. in Kabacan, North
Cotabato, when MILF rebels stopped three buses along a highway
near the town and held hostage some 100 passengers.
</P>
<P>
Sixty hostages were rescued after the military, backed by
helicopter gunships, fought a four-hour battle with the rebels who
used the hostages as human shields.
</P>
<P>
The highway, linking North Cotabato and Davao province, was
reopened at noon and a group of marines were later deployed to
guard it.
</P>
<P>
The government troops are now tracking down the fleeing rebels
in the towns of Carmen and Pikit in North Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
Since early last week, the government troops and the MILF have
fought fierce battles in Pikit town after the MILF separatists
seized 43 oil workers as hostage.
</P>
<P>
The military rescued all the hostages and began to pursue the
MILF kidnappers. Earlier reports said 47 rebels and five soldiers
were killed during the fierce clashes between the MILF and the
military in the past 10 days.

<HEADLINE> New Reductions Made in S.Africa's International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- South African telephone
company Telkom today announced reduced fee rates for international
telephone calls to 29 destinations from July 1.
</P>
<P>
The new reductions see fee rates reduced to countries as far
afield as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and
Kenya, Telkom spokesman Marius Ochse said.
</P>
<P>
"These reductions form part of a process which kicked off in
April, when international rates were reduced to eight countries,"
Ochse said.
</P>
<P>
Telkom international business Executive Rhynie Greeff said the
reductions would enable South African companies to lower
operating costs, allowing for greater competitiveness in the
global arena.
</P>
<P>
Those with family and friends abroad would also be able to
keep in touch at much more affordable rates. More reductions were
on the cards, Greeff said.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations with Telkom's international telecommunication
partners are going ahead full steam, and we are confident that we
will be able to announce further rate reductions before the end
of the year," Greeff added. Endtiem

<HEADLINE> Damascus Declaration FMs Ends Meeting in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LATAKIA, SYRIA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
Damascus Declaration Signatories (DDS), today issued a joint
statement emphasizing their commitment to acting in accordance
with the principles included in Arab conventions and resolutions.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement issued at the conclusion of the
meeting here this morning, Syria and Egypt submitted two working
papers on setting up a free trade zone to include the DDS members
of Egypt, Syria and six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to
serve as a nucleus to an Arab economic community.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The participating ministers agreed that experts from both Syria
and Egypt would hold two meetings with their counterparts from the
(GCC) General Secretariat, one in the Saudi capital of Riyadh not
later than next September, and the other in Cairo of Egypt to
prepare a basic framework for an Arab common market.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the participants reaffirmed that a
fair and overall peace requires the restoration of Arab rights in
accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions, especially the Security
Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425.
</P>
<P>
These resolutions stipulate that Israel should withdraw
completely from the Golan Heights, south Lebanon and the occupied
Palestinian territories, and that the Palestinian people should
exercise their legitimate rights including their right for
self-determination and setting up an independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers expressed their rejection of the attempts
made by the Israeli government to evade its commitment to a total
pullout from the Golan Heights, considering this evasion a threat
to the peace process and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The DDS foreign ministers called on the co-sponsors of the
Mideast peace march, particularly the U.S. to ensure complete
adherence to the commitments and pledges made by the parties
concerned to the peace talks, in view of the fact that it is the
only way to revive the peace process and bring it back to its
right course.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement said that the ministers voiced their full
support for Syria's stance and its demand for the return of its
territory occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The participants expressed regret at U.S. Congress hostile
attitudes toward the Arabs, strongly condemning the recent
U.S. House of Representatives resolution on Jerusalem,
</P>
<P>
The DDS foreign ministers appealed to the U.S. Congress to
reconsider the decision on the status of the controversial holy
city.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed their great concern over the
Turkish-Israeli military and security cooperation, saying
that it poses a threat to the security of Arab states and
to the stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
They called it totally contrary to the charter of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference and the traditional ties
linking Turkey with Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers asked Turkey to reconsider its
cooperation with Israel and to return to its ties of cooperation
and good neighborliness with Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The statement denounced Turkey's recent incursion in northern
Iraq, underlining their respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It emphasized the sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates over
the three Gulf islands of Abu Moussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs
in its dispute with Iran, calling on both sides to enter into
serious negotiations for a peaceful solution to this issue.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves $800 Mln to Back Russia's Social </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) --The World Bank today announced
the approval of a 800 million U.S. dollar loan to assist Russia's
social reform program.
</P>
<P>
The program is targeted to create an effective and sustainable
system of social protection that meets the requirements of a
market economy. The program is also designed to mitigate the
adverse effects of transition on the poorest and most vulnerable
population of the society.
</P>
<P>
Russia's major economic transition of the past years has had
severe social costs, a news release from the World Bank said. As a
result of falling output and high inflation, real wages in 1996
averaged less than half of their level in 1991. Emerging open
unemployment, along with the prevailing hidden unemployment, is
estimated to have reached 15 percent by 1997. Wage and pension
arrears have accumulated rapidly.
</P>
<P>
As various surveys indicate, 25-35 percent of Russia's
population, primarily families with children, the unemployed, and
the elderly living on minimum pension, is living in poverty today,
the World Bank said. The Social Program of Reforms, approved in
February 1997, outlines the government's strategic objectives for
the period up to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's loan is repayable in 17 years, including a
5-year grace period. So far, the Bank's commitments to Russia
total about 8.3 billion dollars for 37 projects.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Russia to Pass START-2 Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The visiting U.S. First Deputy
Defense Secretary John White today urged the Russian parliament to
ratify the START-2 treaty as soon as possible, the Itar-Tass News
Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said that the ratification will be in the
interests of both the United States and Russia. It does not affect
security interests and will enable advance in discussing START-3
treaty, he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides, other matters of Russo-american relations in the
military-political area, specifically the holding of joint
Russian-U.S. military exercises, were also touched upon by John
White on Wednesday during his meetings with Russian Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, First Deputy Defense Minister Andrei
Kokoshin, representatives of the Russian States Duma Disarmament
Committee and with staffers of various independent research
institutions in defense and security areas.
</P>
<P>
In replying to a question how the United States call to reduce
arms stockpiles goes along with the creation of a new kind of
nuclear weapons, White said that his country does not conduct
nuclear weapon tests and keeps from developing new types of
nuclear armaments.

<HEADLINE> UK Trade Gap Up 43 Percent as Imports Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's trade gap soared by 43
percent to almost 1 billion pounds (1.6 billion US dollars) during
April as import volumes rose by the highest monthly rate for 16
years.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that the
worldwide bill for imports rose by an "underlying" 11 percent in
April, after excluding the effects of trade in oil and erratic
items such as ships, aircraft and precious stones.
</P>
<P>
Exports failed to keep pace but nevertheless also rose by a
surprise 8.3 percent. The combination of the two factors led
economists to predict another interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
David Kern, chief economist at NatWest, gave warning that the
current overheating would force an early rate rise to 7 percent.
He also predicted measures to raise up to 3 billion pounds (4.8
billion US dollars) in next week's Budget.
</P>
<P>
The rise in imports is the result of strong domestic demand
and the appreciation of sterling to a five-year high.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Europe rose particularly rapidly, suggesting that
those countries whose currencies have depreciated most against the
pound are beginning to take advantage of their increased
competitiveness to step up sales.
</P>
<P>
Economists reacted with concern because the trade figures
corroborate other recent evidence that consumer spending may be
getting out of control.
</P>
<P>
Richard Jeggrey, group economist at Charterhouse, said: "The
trade figures are the obvious reflection of excess demand in the
UK economy."
</P>
<P>
"The economy is not capable of satisfying the level of consumer
and capital spending that is currently being recorded," he added.
</P>
<P>
Simon Briscoe, UK economist at Nikko Europe, said: "If imports
continued to grow and exports are hit in the second half of this
year, as expected, by the stronger pound, the deficit could widen
to an extent that worries the market."
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that so far the impact of the
strength of the pound on the trade gap has been muted by falling
import prices. This effect is likely to wear off as the year
progresses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most economists still reckon the growth in export
volumes will slow down, following the slowdown in orders reported
by recent business surveys.
</P>
<P>
They expect that when that happens, the buoyancy of imports as
a result of booming consumer spending could lead to a very rapid
deterioration in Britain's trade position.

<HEADLINE> Trade Surplus Registered in May in S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's trade account
continued to perform admirably in May, with higher exports
resulting in a record massive surplus on a month base, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to customs and excise figures released here, the
month-on-month trade surplus rose to 1.745 billion Rand (about
388 million US Dollars) in May from April's 161 million US
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that the value of South African
exports improved by nine percent last month to 12.316 billion
Rand (about 2.74 billion US Dollars), compared to stagnant
imports of 10.57 billion Rand (about 2.35 billion US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The higher-than-expected surplus lifted the trade account's
cumulative overrun to more than one billion US Dollars, almost
tripling the surplus of 373 million US Dollars in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The export of precious and semi-precious stones, mineral
product and agricultural produce all contributed to the increase
of the trade surplus last month, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the value of machinery and electrical equipment
imports has increased 8.6 percent so far this year.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Leaves for EU Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides left here today for Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to attend
a briefing Friday of the candidate countries for European Union
(EU) accession on the results of the EU Intergovernmental
Conference (IGC).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before his departure, Clerides said that
after the Cypriot government is informed of the results of the
IGC, it will submit its views on the issue of the Cyprus'
accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Other countries that will attend the briefing are Poland,
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria,
Slovenia, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU has said that Cyprus and Malta will be involved in the
next phase of the union's enlargement, while its Council of
Ministers decided, on March 6, 1995, accession negotiations will
begin with the government of Cyprus six months after the end of
the Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for full EU membership in July 1990.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on statements made Wednesday by British
special envoy for Cyprus, Sir David Hannay, Clerides quoted
Hannay as saying Turkey has promised help toward a Cyprus'
solution.
</P>
<P>
Hannay reportedly said that during an earlier visit to Turkey,
he was given very clear indications that the Turkish government
intended to engage constructively for a negotiated solution.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkey has not shown such indications so far on the
specific aspects of the problem, on which it intends to alter its
intransigent position, Clerides added.
</P>
<P>
Clerides will attend the U.N.-sponsored direct negotiations
with the Turkish Cypriot side, due to be held near New York
between July 9 and 13.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at hammering out a comprehensive
settlement to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after the Turkish troops occupied its
northern third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Journalists Urged to Pay Prime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian journalists have been
urged to pay prime attention to drug abuse and drug trafficking
in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the call came today from
a workshop on the role of the mass media on the prevention of the
drug abuse organized by the Ethiopian Health Ministry at Nazareth,
some 90 km from here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a 5-day workshop, Beyene Seiletsion, Head of
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Sub Control Division in the
Ministry of Health, said most government officials are not aware
that drug abuse and drug trafficking have become serious in
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He further said even some top authorities of the Ministry of
Health doubt the seriousness of the problem untill they see
evidences presented to them.
</P>
<P>
''If higher government officials and that of mass media are
ignorant of the problem, how could we be able to prevent the abuse
of drug among the youth and drug trafficking,'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
This trend has resulted in the increasing of rate of the abuse
of drugs such as chat, cannabis, alcohol and even some other hard
drugs among the youth in the country, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Today is the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit
Trafficking. The theme of this year's observation is ''mobilizing
communities to prevent drug abuse''. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has made representations
to the United Nations over fresh violations of its airspace by
Turkish military planes.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Nicos Agathocleous, Cyprus' permanent representative to the world
body, protested against the violation of the country's airspace
by two C-160 Turkish military planes on two separate occasions
on June 22, Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Such unauthorised intrusions into the Nicosia Flight
Information Region and the airspace of the republic are in
violation of international air traffic rules and seriously
endanger civil aviation flights over Cyprus," Agathocleous noted.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that such violations are "in complete
disregard of the international law, the U.N. Charter and the
relevant decisions of the organization on the question of
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot diplomat stressed that these violations, which
have heightened tension in Cyprus, occurred at a most sensitive
phase of the efforts to resume the intercommunal talks for a
solution to the Cyprus problem, due to begin near New York on
July 9.
</P>
<P>
Both Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot

president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah return to the country, a report reaching
here said today.
</P>
<P>
Koromah, who toppled Kabbah in the May 25 coup, said in an address
to the nation that Kabbah could return as long as he stopped
"misleading" the international community.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would soon announce the composition of his new

<P>
Commenting on the coup, Koromah said, "We just could not sit down

maimed."
</P>
<P>
The new military leader said Kabbah should have
incorporated Foday Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary United
Front into his government but had failed to do so.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Canada Raises Rates 25 Basis Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada's central bank today raised
its key bank rate 25 basis points to prop up the Canadian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada raised the bank rate by 25 basis points to
3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The operating bank for the overnight interest rate has
consequently been raised by the same amount to 3 - 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This increase in the Bank Rate is designed to counter
excessive easing in monetary conditions and to provide support for
the currency," the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In its May Monetary Policy Report, the bank indicated that
monetary conditions were highly stimulative and that any possible
need for further easing had largely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
"Since May, persistent weakness in the Canadian dollar against
the U.S. dollar and other major currencies has in fact resulted in
further ease," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Today's rate hike by the bank is the first since 1995, and was
likely the first of many this year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bank cut the bank rate 11 times to its lowest
level since December 1961 to spur the sluggish Canadian economy.

<HEADLINE> France Registers Big Industrial Trade Deficit with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- France registered a 27 billion franc
(4.6 billion U.S. dollar) industrial trade deficit with the United
States in 1996, said the French State Secretariat of Industry in a
study published today.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. market remains the biggest receiver of French
investments, which amounted to 38.2 billion francs (6.6 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
France has also fallen from the ninth to the 11th largest
exporter to the U.S., mainly because of fierce competition in the
market of high-technological products.
</P>
<P>
Computer products, medical equipments, precious metal raw
materials, electronic components, and plane motors make up the
major U.S. exports to France, while France mainly sells planes,
car equipments and pharmaceutical products to the United States.
</P>
<P>
France also has taken advantage of the economic growth in the
United States to sell its food products and luxury goods, but it
met with strong competition from Italy, Britain and America's home
producers themselves in the field.
</P>
<P>
Most of the French exporters to the U.S. are affiliate
companies of French enterprises in the U.S. or Italian companies
established in France.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 French companies are running affiliates in the
United States, employing 400,000 workers.

ADDIS ABABA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Science and
Technology Commissioner Asrat Bulbula today stressed the role of
geoinformation in the socio-economic development of Ethiopia, a
local report said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a two-day workshop here attended by over 100 people
from various sectors, Asrat said despite the existence of an
estimated annual runoff of 111 billion cubic meters from
12 major river basins and about 2.6 billion cubic meters of
exploitable ground water resources in the country, only fractions
have been developed so far.
</P>
<P>
"Only about three percent of the 3.5 million hectares of
irrigational land has been utilized and only 26.3 percent of the
population has access to clean and safe water supply," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the commissioner, geoinformation is the basic
input for agricultural projects, mineral exploration and
exploitation, development and conservation of water resources,
natural hazards monitoring and reduction, urban development
planning, infrastructure construction and environmental

<HEADLINE> Canada Calls for Binding Dispute Settlement with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada proposed today that the
Pacific salmon dispute with the United States be resolved through
binding dispute settlement, following the U.S. rejection of its
final offer.
</P>
<P>
Canada made a final comprehensive proposal Monday after an
intense series of talks, which ended on June 20 without agreement.
</P>
<P>
Months of talks have failed to resolve the long-standing
dispute, leaving each side to set up its own fishing arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"This outcome is very disappointing," Canadian Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"After months of negotiations, the U.S. offer has not changed
significantly," Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
"We need a new approach," he said. "Under the current
circumstances, the best way to resolve the issue is to refer it to
binding dispute settlement to obtain a long-term solution."
</P>
<P>
Canadian Fisheries and Oceans Minister David Anderson insisted
that his country made "a fair and constructive proposal" and the
U.S. showed "inflexibility by refusing to moderate its demands."
</P>
<P>
"However, Canada will not allow the salmon resources to suffer
the consequences. We will establish our own fishing arrangements
so that conservation is paramount," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also called upon the United States to show
restraint in this year's fisheries.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturers' Prices Little Changed in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Canadian manufacturers' prices
continued to show little overall change in May, Statistics Canada
said today.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, Canada's industrial product prices remained
unchanged in May from April. And the 12-month change in
manufacturing prices dropped back to 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that there continues to be relatively little
upward pressure on goods prices in the Canadian economy," the
federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial product price index stood at 130.7 in May, the
same level as in April.
</P>
<P>
Yet, if the effects of Canada-U.S. dollar exchange rate
movements are removed, Canada would have seen a 0.3 percent
increase in manufacturing prices in May and a 12-month price
change of 0.6 percent, the agency noted.
</P>
<P>
The May decline in the value of the U.S. dollars against the
Canadian dollar reduced the value in Canadian dollars of all
export prices quoted in U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
This reduced the month-to-month change in industrial prices
from 0.3 percent to 0.0 percent. And the impact was most
noticeable for motor vehicles, pulp, paper and wood products, the
agency said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Per Capita Income Triples in Past Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The per capital income in Cyprus
tripled during the past decade thanks to the thriving tourism and
a booming specially-tailored service industry for foreign business
in the island, according to a World Trade Organization (WTO)
report.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income has increased from 4,570 U.S. dollars in
1985 to approximately 13,650 dollars in 1996, said the report
tabled at a WTO meeting held in Geneva Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoted by Cyprus News Agency today, also refers to
Cyprus' application for EU membership and its efforts to harmonize
its laws, policies and institutional structure with the European
Union (EU) standards, noting that it already meets the Maastricht
convergence criteria.
</P>
<P>
Measures by Cyprus to harmonize laws and policies with the EU
and the WTO include abolition of discretionary import licensing,
revision of anti-dumping and countervailing legislation, and
introduction this year of a new foreign direct investment policy,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The EU, the report said, remains Cyprus' most important trading
partner.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested that Cyprus could take further steps
to conform with multilateral rules such as lowering tariffs on
certain farm products.

<HEADLINE> French Government Has No More Money to Spend: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The French Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn said today that the government does not
have "margins of budgetary maneuver" to spend more money on
social and economic projects.
</P>
<P>
"All makes think that there is a slippage at the level of
budget and social account," said Strauss-Kahn at a forum on
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
During his legislative campaign, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin,
then the leader of the opposition Socialist Party, promised to use
public budget to create 350,000 jobs for the youths.
</P>
<P>
But Jospin failed to put the project into the primary agenda in
his declaration of general policy before the parliament last week.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the French Senate today, Jospin admitted that he
was faced with "contradictory demands" from both his electoral
supporters and France's European partners.
</P>
<P>
"We will effectively keep to the contradictory demands of a
growth to support, an unemployment to make drop, and at the same
time a control of public accounts," said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
Strauss-Kahn said that the budget reduction planned by the
budget law drafted by the former government of Prime Minister
Alain Juppe has not been made in the primary months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The budget such as it was voted has not been mastered during
the primary months of 1997," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the government of Prime Minister Jospin will
see to it that the 1997 and 1998 public deficits of France will be
"coherent" with the need to launch the European single currency.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denounces Alien Support for PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish military today accused
some neighboring countries of supporting the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) rebels.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters in the southeastern city of
Diyarbakir, Colonel Husnu Dag, spokesman for Chief of the General
Staff Ismail Hakki Karadayi claimed that Iran, Greece, Serbia,
Cyprus, Armenia and Syria have given the rebels political,
financial and training support.
</P>
<P>
Turkey made such allegations before but they were denied.
</P>
<P>
"This support has been confirmed by documents obtained by the
Turkish military and confessions of those terrorists captured
alive," reports reaching here quoted Dag as saying.
</P>
<P>
A number of arrested PKK members, among whom nine were Syrians,
were reportedly shown to reporters at the news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that these countries should realize that
they themselves might be victims of the extremist activities
someday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Oguz Kaleli, also official of the General Staff, told
the news conference that it was confirmed that Greece and Syria
have joined hands in backing the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Citing confessions of some PKK captives, Kaleli said that
some PKK rebels had been given shelter in the Greek capital of
Athens, and they had received political training in Syria.
</P>
<P>
He added that retired Greek officers trained PKK rebels on how
to operate missiles.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today said that 157 Greek
parliamentarians have signed a joint petition to invite PKK leader
Abdullah Ocalan to visit Athens.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly criticized the countries for their
backing of the PKK that has fought a 13-year-old separatist war
in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000-strong Turkish government troops have performed
massive military operations since mid-May in an attempt to wipe
out the PKK rebels stationed in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's cross-border campaign has drawn sharp criticism from
the Arab world and some Western countries as well.

<HEADLINE> Ahern Elected Ireland's New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's Fianna Fail party leader
Bertie Ahern was elected the country's new Prime Minister in
Dublin today after winning support from some independent
legislators.
</P>
<P>
Ahern, whose opposition alliance has snatched a cliffhanger
election victory early this month, won a parliamentary vote
against outgoing Prime Minister John Bruton by 85 votes to 78 in
the 166-seat parliament, press reports from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
Caoimhghin O'Caolain, a legislator with Sinn Fein, the
political wing of Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas, also
voted to support the Fianna Fail leader.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein legislator noted that he would back Ahern, who
has promised to make a solution to the 28-year Northern Ireland
conflict a top priority of his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
However, Ahern had reportedly ruled out the possibility of
enlisting support from Sinn Fein, whose IRA allies have been
fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the prospects of his minority government after his
appointment, Ahern said: "Many of the best governments in this
country have been minority governments".
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old new Irish Prime Minister promised to build "a
sound, stable and productive government."

<HEADLINE> Industry Group Urges Swift Structural Reforms in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of German Industry
(BDI) today called for urgent structural reforms in Germany in a
bid to stem a decline in the country's competitiveness on the
world market.
</P>
<P>
Although Germany exports had experienced a continuing upswing
since the beginning of this year, the nation's share in the
fast-growing world market dropped in 1996 and is expected to
continue to lose ground in the current year, said a latest
economic report issued today by the BDI, Germany's premier
business lobby.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Germany saw a foreign direct investment inflow
plummet from 18.2 billion marks (10.6 billion U.S. dollars) in
1995 to only 1.1 billion marks (640 million dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Both are indications of the declining competitiveness of
Germany as an industrial base and of the urgent need of structural
reforms," the BDI said.
</P>
<P>
The group called on political parties to come up with swift and
consistent reforms in the country's taxation and pension systems
in a bid to relieve enterprises of the heavy burden of high labor
costs.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the reforms should be targeted to spur
economic growth and bolster investment and should not fall a
victim to political calculations.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM-Designate to Submit Cabinet List Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister-designate
Mesut Yilmaz is to submit his cabinet list to President Suleyman
Demirel early next week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following a meeting with Demirel,
Yilmaz said that the president had promised to appove a
government supported by four parties in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, chairman of the second largest Motherland Party
(ANAP), said that the cabinet list might be delivered to the
presidential palace Monday or Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister-designate today started the second round
of talks with Democratic Left Party (DSP) leader Bulent
Ecevit and Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Deniz
Baykal in an effort to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
The DSP and CHP leaders had earlier expressed their full
support for the proposed government, but Baykal said that his
party had no plan to take part in the government.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Ecevit earlier today, Yilmaz told
reporters that he and the DSP leader agreed that a joint
commission should start working Friday on the structure and
program of the new government.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ecevit will be the deputy prime minister of the
proposed government, adding that he also hoped to see the
participation of Democratic Turkey Party (DTP) leader Husamettin
Cindoruk in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Cindoruk, whose party enjoys seven seats in the parliament,
had said that all DTP deputies would be supporters of the new
government, describing backing the proposed government as "a
national duty."
</P>
<P>
On June 20, President Demirel asked Yilmaz to form a new
government to replace the resigned Welfare Party (RP)-True Path
Party (DYP) coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Islamic Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, under pressure from
both the military and the DYP over his government's failure to
curb the rapidly expanding fundamentalism in the secular
republic, resigned on June 18.
</P>
<P>
DYP leader Tansu Ciller, who had planned to take over
premiership from Erbakan, was annoyed by Demirel's appointment of
Yilmaz to form a new government, calling it "a Cankaya
(presidential palace) coup."
</P>
<P>
She said that the RP-DYP alliance with the nationalist Grand
Unity Party could defeat Yilmaz's efforts to set up a new
government in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, however, expressed optimism about the new government
he is trying to form, saying that he believed the new government
would win a vote of confidence in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the developments in the coming days will
expand the margin. The outcome of the vote will not be very
close," the ANAP leader said.
</P>
<P>
DYP parliamentarian Isilay Saygin resigned earlier today and
jointed the ANAP, increasing the number of ANAP deputies to 130
in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the ANAP, DSP, CHP and DTP enjoy a total
of 254 seats in the 550-seat parliament, not enough to obtain a
parliamentary majority.

<P>
BONN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Cologne-based German airline
Deutsche Lufthansa today said its profit in the first half of this

</P>
<P>
Without releasing the figure, company chairman Juergen Weber
told shareholders in Cologne that Lufthansa would show a "powerful
ascent" this year.
</P>

Earlier this year, the company reported its first ever profit
in the first quarter, which totaled 20 million marks (11.6 million
US dollars), with turnover reaching nearly 5 billion marks (2.9
billion dollars), up 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, lufthansa's group turnover rose 4.8 percent to 20.9

WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A judge in Tennessee of the
United States has set a November 10 trial date for the youth
accused of shooting two teachers and a student in 1995, killing
two of them.
</P>
<P>
Three mental health experts have testified, with differing
prognoses of the defendant, Jamie Rouse, The United Press
International reported.
</P>
<P>
One psychologist said Rouse was sane, one called him insane,
and the third testified the teenager would be ready to stand trial
in six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
The judge said Rouse's trial should begin in November, two
years after he allegedly gunned down three people in Richland High
School in Lynnville, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Only teacher Carol Yancy survived to talk about the attack.
</P>
<P>
Yancy was in the Lawrence County, Tennessee, courtroom for the
hearing and told the court she's disappointed by the length of
time it has taken to bring Rouse to trial.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee law prohibits the death penalty for teenagers but
Rouse could be sentenced to life in prison, if convicted.
</P>
<P>
A second teen, Stephen Abbott, who drove Rouse to the high
school and helped plan the shooting rampage, already has been
convicted for his part in the slayings.

provision of 50 locomotives, 150 passenger cars, 400 wagons and 20
rail cars by the Chinese, is undertaken by the China Civil
Engineering Construction Corportion (CCECC).
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech at the ceremony, held in this industrial base
in northern Nigeria, Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha
expressed satisfaction at the progress made so far in the project.
</P>
<P>
He said he is fully convinced of the determination and capability
of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"I believe they can successfully complete the railway
rehabilitation project," Abacha said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yongfu, Deputy Railways Minister of China, said the Chinese
government and his ministry, aware of the great importance of the
project to Nigeria's economic development, give top priority to it.
</P>
<P>
An official decision has been made to give full support to CCECC so
that it can "muster superior resources and equipment and launch a mass
campaign of construction so as to complete this project with high
quality on schedule".
</P>
<P>
Under the contract between Nigeria's Ministry of Transport and
the CCECC signed in September 1995, the project is to be
completed at the end of September 1998, when trains will be able
to travel at a speed of 60 to 80 km per hour compared with the
current about 40 km.
</P>
<P>
To date, work on survey and designing of the entire railway
network has been over, production of ballast is underway while
progress has been achieved in the rehabilitation in some
sections. Chinese experts have also arrived to give technical
training to the staff of the Nigerian Railway Corportion (NRC)
and part of the locomotives and rolling stocks has been provided.
</P>
<P>
With the help and cooperation with China, said NRC Sole
Administrator G.C. Ilukwe, his corporation is "determined and
impatient to transform the railways at shortest possible time".
</P>
<P>
The NRC will also create a restructured management manned by
active and forward looking managers capable of leading the
corporation into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Minister of Transport Major-General I.D. Gumel
shared the same view in his speech on the occasion. He said the
revitalization and rehabilitation project is targeted at
establishing "an efficiant railway system capable of providing
effective service to the Nigerian populace at reasonable price".
</P>
<P>
While expressing his thanks to the Chinese government for the
understanding, support and cooperation concerning the project, Gumel
believed that the CCECC will achieve a succeess in it.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the ceremony, General Abacha and other Nigerian
leaders made an inspection trip on a 30-km section of rehabilitated
railway in a China-built train, accompanied by Sun and Chinese
Ambassador to Nigeria Lu Fengding.
</P>
<P>
All the Nigerian leaders thumbed up at the railway and train,
saying that it is an indication of the future railway system and its
service in the country.

<HEADLINE> US Mortgages Rate Drops to Lowest in 4 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Average interest rates on
30-year, fixed-rate mortgages in the U.S. declined this week to
the lowest level in four months.
</P>
<P>
The average decreased to 7.58 percent from 7.61 percent a week
earlier, the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said today.
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest rate since the week ended on February 20,
five weeks before the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) tightened
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
After the Fed tightened the monetary policy with increasing
the U.S. federal fund rate by a quarter percentage point on March
25, the average rates of 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages rose to a
seven-month high of 8.18 percent for the week ended April 3 and
has declined in nine of the 12 weeks since.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 15-year mortgages, a popular option for those
refinancing mortgages in the U.S., averaged 7.13 percent this
week, also the lowest since the week ended February 20 and down
from 7.14 percent a week earlier.

<HEADLINE> US Chamber of Commerce Hails NAFTA Huge Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The first three years of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was formally
set up on January 1, 1994, have been a huge success for American
business and workers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said today.
</P>
<P>
"Under NAFTA, American companies have increased their exports
to Mexico by 35.7 percent. In 1996 alone, exports to Mexico were
up to 23 percent while imports from Mexico grew just 18 percent,"
noted Willard W. Workman, chamber vice president for international
affairs. For instance, he said, U.S. automobile exports to Mexico
grew from 1.4 percent of the total Mexican market before NAFTA to
24.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 57 billion U.S. dollars in export to Mexico support more
than 1 million U.S. jobs, not counting the jobs created by imports
from Mexico, Workman added.
</P>
<P>
He also said the stable trade and investment rules under NAFTA
have given U.S. companies a clear advantage over their Asian and
European competitors trying to export to the growing Mexican
market. American businesses increased their market share in Mexico
from 70 percent in 1994 to 75 percent in 1995, and it continues to
grow.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Double Aid for Bosnian Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 27 (Xinhua)-- Sweden is to double its financial
contribution to the Bosnian elections scheduled in this fall,
Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen told a EU foreign
ministers' meeting in Luxemburg Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sweden had previously promised to allocate 7.5 million Swedish
kronor (about 1 million U.S. dollars) to support the
election. However, the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE), which is supervising the election, still doesn't
have enough money. So the Swedish Government has decided to
contribute another 7.5 million Swedish kronor.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Strikes Down Key Gun Control Act Provision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court, in a
5-4 decision Friday, struck down a key portion of the Brady Act,
which requires local sheriffs and police chiefs to conduct
background searches on handgun purchasers.
</P>
<P>
The narrow majority says the federal government cannot force
the states to administer a program to enforce federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
The decision does not affect the federal government's ability
to regulate firearms, but does affect the dwindling number of
states without instant computer background checks.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the law, the federal government must make a
federal database available to the states by November 30 next year.
</P>
<P>
Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia says, "We held
in New York (vs. United States) that Congress cannot compel the
states to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program. Today we
hold that Congress cannot circumvent that prohibition by
conscripting the state's officers directly."
</P>
<P>
He adds, "The federal government may neither issue directives
requiring the states to address particular problems, nor command
the states's officers, or those of their political subdivisions,
to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program."
</P>
<P>
Justice John Paul Stevens, who led the dissent, says, "When
Congress exercises the powers delegated to it by the Constitution,
it may impose affirmative obligations on...state and local
governments as well as ordinary citizens."
</P>
<P>
Today's decision reverses lower-court rulings in favor of the
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government signed an
agreement here today with Australia's Snow Mountain Engineering
Corporation (SMEC) on implementation of the West Seti hydro
electricity project.
</P>
<P>
According to the Water Resources Ministry, the 750,000
kw-capacity West Seti hydro electricity project, in far western
Nepal, is to be developed into an export-oriented power project.
</P>
<P>
This is the first large hydro electricity project in Nepal ever
involving a foreign private company.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government and the SMEC West Seti Hydro-electric
Corporation Ltd. already signed an agreement in May on export of
electricity generated under the project.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that the SMEC has the right to control
and regulate the whole water basin of the Seti River and to sell
power to India.
</P>
<P>
An average of 3.1 billion units electricity will be generated
under the project, said the Water Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the project will begin in 1999 and is
expected to be completed by the end of 2004 at a cost of about one
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a huge hydroelectric potential of 83 million kw, but
less than one percent has been utilized so far.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's water resources development policy,
domestic and foreign private sector is encouraged to invest in
this sector.

MADRID, June 27 (Xinhua) -- World chess champion Garry Kasparov

laptop computers to plot strategy during their matches.
</P>

game.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese JLG Should Focus on Main Task: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) should make great efforts to quicken the handling of
main transitional affairs in Macao, a top Chinese official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jiading, chief representative of the Chinese side of the
JLG, said at the Macao International Airport after returning from
Lisbon on conclusion of the 29th plenary session of JLG that the
joint group should focus its efforts on the issues concerning with
stable transition and smooth handover of power in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have settled such issues as the Orient Foundation,
the revision of the contract on gambling monopoly and the
establishment of a new foundation, we should move our focus to the
main tasks," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The localization of civil service, the use of Chinese as an
official language and the localization of law, which are called
the "three leading issues", and handling of the transfer of
archives and government assets are among the main tasks, he said.
</P>
<P>
A working panel on the transfer of archives and government
assets should be established immediately since the two sides
reached agreement on the setup of the panel four years ago, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Lisbon-based Orient Foundation, which is accused by local
media of siphoning money from Macao to Portugal, will have to
spend most of its income in Macao, and must report its expenditure
to the Macao government, according to a consensus reached in the
29th session.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Tourism and Amusement Company (STDM), which
previously supplied money to the Orient Foundation, stopped doing
so from January 1, 1996. It will have to divert the money to a new
foundation called the "Macao Development and Cooperation
Foundation."
</P>
<P>
The new foundation will be set up soon by the present Macao
government and will belong to the Macao Special Administrative
Regional Government by December 20, 1999. It is aimed at promoting
arts, academic activities, science and technology, education,
social affairs and welfare in Macao, according to the consensus.

<HEADLINE> hkhk-Chief Executive's Office Expresses Concern over Hasty Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Office of
the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) today expressed grave concern over the hasty passage of
legislation in the past few days, including several labor laws.
</P>
<P>
In response to press inquires, the spokesman said the HKSAR
would review the newly passed bills because drastic changes might
adversely affect the community and would not be in the interest of
long-term labor relations.
</P>
<P>
The bills had been pushed through very quickly without careful
consideration, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the labor legislation had not been fully
considered by the Labor Advisory Board, a well-established
mechanism for discussion of labor issues.
</P>
<P>
"The SAR government will assess the social and economic
implications which these changes have on society and take all
necessary action," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Crimes (Amendment)(No.2) Bill 1996 passed on June 24,
the spokesman said Article 23 of the Basic Law clearly states that
the HKSAR shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of
treason, secession, sedition and subversion.
</P>
<P>
"We have already indicated that these laws which might have
wide implications are best left to the first SAR legislature and
that legislative proposals should be worked out after wide public
consultation," he said.
</P>
<P>
An editorial of a local newspaper also points out today that
the hasty passing of dozens of laws at the last meeting of the
Legislative Council is not an ideal choice from any point of view.
"Why not leave them for more careful deliberations later?" it
says.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the "political reform" package imposed
unilaterally by the British side, which sabotaged the "through
train" arrangement, the last Legislative Council under the Hong
Kong-British government will be dissolved on June 30, 1997,
according to a decision of the Ninth Session of China's Eighth
National People's Congress in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Everything is ready for the Hong
Kong 97 Spectacular, the largest live show ever produced on water
in Hong Kong, the Better Hong Kong Foundation announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
"At present, everything is on schedule, the 31 barges and all
the production equipment have arrived and undergone final
installation and trials, said Leonie Ki, chief executive of the
Better Hong Kong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
on the night of July 1, 1997, a flotilla of 31 fully
illuminated barges, in various lively forms and shapes, will be
parading around the Victoria Harbor, amidst colorful water
fountains, lasers and lights, and fireworks to form the climax of
the "Hong Kong 97 Spectacular".
</P>
<P>
At 9:00 p.m., the spectacular begins with Pearl of the Orient,
a tribute to Hong Kong's glamorous international reputation,
performed in music, water fountains, searchlights, lasers and
special effects.
</P>
<P>
Then, the decorative and neon lights of the 140 high-rises
along the waterfront will begin to turn dim slowly as the first of
31 illuminated barges begins its parade around the harbor in the
sea of life section.
</P>
<P>
The barges feature artistic lantern decorations made by the
renowned lantern craftsmen of Foshan. They include the Mighty
Dragon, the biggest lantern ever made by traditional handicraft,
measuring about 40 meters long and 18 meters high and carrying
more than 2,200 light bulbs, she said.
</P>
<P>
The would-be-record-breaking Karaoke will allow millions of
local people to sing with one voice a medley of seven Chinese
songs, which include the "Pearl of the Orient", the New Moon",
"Under the Lion Rock", "Red Cotton Tree", "Tomorrow will Be Better
Day", "Children of the Dragon" and "China's Dream".
</P>
<P>
The sponsors have already distributed 200,000 copies of the
lyrics for the karaoke.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, lasers will dance upon screens of water shooting
out of the Pearl Barge. Boats with fountains of fireworks will set
out from both sides of the harbor and meet, creating a symbolic
bridge linking China and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The grand climax of the Hong Kong 97 Spectacular will be
celebration, when Hong Kong's harbor will explode in its
biggest-over pyrotechnics display. This colorful tribute to Hong
Kong will feature 20 tons of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, will join some 2,000 distinguished guests
and residents in Hong Kong to view the show from the promenade of
the new extension to the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition
Center.
</P>
<P>
The spectacular was initiated by the Better Hong Kong
Foundation, which has raised 100 million HK dollar within a short
period with the support of local industrial and business circles.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Wins Practice for French Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- World championship leader Michael
Schumacher of Germany, driving a Ferrari, sets the fastest time in
opening practice in rain for Sunday's French Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old double world champion clocked a best time of
one minute 18.339 seconds in Magny-Cours, 1.4 seconds better than
his nearest rival Italian Giancarlo Fisichella's best effort in
his Jordan as the track dried out in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
His Ferrari team mate Eddie Irvine of Britain, whose future is
under threat from the Italian team's admiration for Finn Mika Salo
of Tyrrell, was not given a chance to go out on slicks and wound
up down in 20th place out of the 22 runners.
</P>
<P>
Irvine's contract expires at the end of the year and Ferrari's
option to renew it expires at the end of July. Their inactivity
-- despite Schumacher's forthright support for Irvine -- has
suggested they are considering approaching Salo to succeed the
Northern Ireland man next season.
</P>
<P>
Italian Jarno Trulli, replacing the injured Olivier Panis in
the Prost team, was 19th fastest.
</P>
<P>
Frenchman Panis suffered double fractures to both legs when he
crashed during the Canadian Grand Prix two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Tarso Marques, the 21-year-old Brazilian who was called up to
replace Trulli at Minardi was 14th fastest while Norberto Fontana
of Argentina who replaced broken arm victim Italian Gianni
Morbidelli at Sauber, wound up 18th on his debut.

<HEADLINE> I'm Full of Confidence in the Future: Tycoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing
expressed confidence in the future of Hong Kong in an interview
today.
"The return of Hong Kong to its motherland is a historic moment
the Chinese people have long been expecting. I'm very proud to be
a Chinese," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of property developer Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. and
conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., Li was named by the Forbes
magazine one of the world's 10 richest individuals in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid, I saw the miseries and sufferings of our
country and people inflicted by foreign invasions," he recalled.
"As a Chinese living in Hong Kong for so many years, it is hard
to express by words my feelings to see my motherland growing
stronger day by day."
</P>
<P>
He said it would have been impossible for China to recover Hong
Kong by peaceful means if the country had been as weak as it was
more than 150 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Having been involved in return of Hong Kong-related affairs
ever since the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed in 1984,
Li has witnessed developments in Hong Kong throughout its
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong is now going through a "very good"
period both economically and in terms of people's morale and that
Hong Kong people's confidence in the future keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
Two fundamental factors have contributed to Hong Kong's smooth
transition, he said. "One is the principle of 'one country, two
systems', a policy that works for the overall national interests
of the country; and the other is rapid economic development in
China's interior areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "one country, two systems" policy has
dispelled worries of many Hong Kong citizens by ensuring that Hong
Kong's existing economic system and way of life will remain
unchanged.
The policies of reform and opening to the outside world and rapid
economic development have made China more powerful and benefited
the Hong Kong economy, too, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great pity that Mr. Deng Xiaoping is unable to see
what happens today," Li, who met Deng on many occasions, sighed
with regret.
</P>
<P>
Deng, chief architect of China's reform and opening up and
creator of the "one country, two systems" principle, passed away
in Beijing last February. He had repeatedly expressed the wish to
visit Hong Kong when the handover occurs.
</P>
<P>
"It is comforting that, under the leadership of the central
authorities with President Jiang Zemin at the core, China is
becoming richer and more powerful, with its international status
rising day by day," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that every time he met with Jiang and other state
leaders, he was impressed by the Chinese government's firm
determination to carry out the Basic Law and the policy of "one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
"From my own experience and China's course of development, I
have reached this conclusion, that the future of Hong Kong is in
our own hands," he said. "I am full of confidence in Hong Kong's
future."
</P>
<P>
He said that after July 1, Hong Kong will become a focus of
world attention and that people all over the world will be
watching how Hong Kongers perform in the new era.
</P>
<P>
"We must show the cohesive force of our nation to the rest of
the world and work together to maintain Hong Kong's long-term
prosperity," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> S. Arabian FM Stresses United Arab Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister
Prince Saud Al-Faisal Al-Saud stressed here today that a united
and firm position of Arab countries and a change of Israel's
intransigent policy are the guarantee for a restart of the
deadlocked Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Faisal made the remarks at a meeting with his Lebanese
counterpart Farez Boueiz in the latter's office.
</P>
<P>
He said that he briefed Boueiz the outcome of a two-day
meeting of foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration
signatories,which ended in Syria's Mediterranean resort of
Lattakia Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and six Gulf Arab states,
namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, agreed that either there is a just and comprehensive
peace based on international resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle, or there is no peace in the region, Faisal noted.
</P>
<P>
Faisal welcomed the idea of establishing a common Arab market,
adding that the issue of a regional economic summit scheduled to
be held in Qatar next November will be discussed by Arab foreign
ministers when they meet in Cairo in September.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have said that they will boycott the Qatar
economic summit, the fourth of its kind, due to Israel'
participation. They called for an Arab economic summit to take
its place.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi foreign minister, who is accompanying Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz in the current visit to Lebanon,
underlined the significance of the visit, the first by a senior
member of the Saudi royal family since 1975. Faisal noted that the
visit would "promote the brotherly relations between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
He clarified that "the kingdom of Saudi Arabia has always
stood on Lebanon's side, supporting its sovereignty,
independence and integrity of its territory, and has proved
this through the efforts exerted during the painful time," a
reference to the Lebanese 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi crown prince, heading an entourage exceeding 140
people, arrived in Lebanon from Syria Thursday afternoon for a
three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> China Helping Handicapped People to Escape Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government helped
600,000 handicapped people solve their food and clothing problems
in 1996, Deng Pufang, chairman of the board of the China Welfare
Fund for the Handicapped, told the 13th meeting of the Board of
Directors, in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
last year, Deng said, China gave 200 million yuan (about 24
million US dollars) in issuing loans and carrying out
poverty-relief activities to help the handicapped in 528
counties. 250,000 cataract sufferers had surgery and 13,000 deaf
children got training. Up to now, the state has provided 530,000
special instruments for handicapped people's daily use, and set up
more than 100 schools to provide special education. In addition,
About 24 million handicapped people in iodine-deficient areas have
been provided with iodized oil, and 93 percent of the cities and
counties, and 72 percent of towns and townships have formulated
regulations on aiding the handicapped and have begun issuing
national welfare certificates to the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, China set up a special fund for
rehabilitation and poverty-relief work among the handicapped and
helped 250,000 handicapped people who were able to work escape the
poverty, according to Deng.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the work of aiding the handicapped has entered a
stage of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The fund received more than 25 million yuan (three million US
dollars) in overseas donation last year and spent more than 21
million on rehabilitation, education, comprehensive services, and
the cultural and sports activities for the handicapped.

<HEADLINE> Laws to Be Enforced in Hong Kong (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said the Law on China's Territorial Waters and Adjoining
Areas, which is important for national sovereignty over
territorial waters and adjoining areas, should also be added to
the Annex 3 of the Basic Law of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued the Announcement of the PRC government
on the Border Line of Chinese Territorial Waters on May 15,
1996. As part of the Law on Territorial Waters and Adjoining Areas
the announcement should be included when the HKSAR makes laws to
implement the law.
</P>
<P>
From July 1, China will begin providing privileges and immunity
to the foreign consular officials and staff members. The People's
Liberation Army troops to be stationed in the HKSAR will enter
Hong Kong at zero hour of July 1.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Regulations on Consular Privileges and Immunity
in the PRC and the Garrison Law of the PLA Troops Stationed in the
HKSAR, which are necessary for the central government's
administration of HKSAR's foreign and defence affairs, should be
added to Annex 3 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the NPC approved the "Explanation of
Some Problems on Implementing the Nationality Law of the PRC in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region", as part of the
Nationality Law, which should be included if the HKSAR passes new
laws to implement the law, Cao explained.
</P>
<P>
Cao said that, according to Article 18 of the Basic Law of the
HKSAR, "The national laws shall not be applied in the HKSAR except
for those listed in Annex 3 to this Law. The laws listed therein
shall be applied locally in legislation of the Region."
</P>
<P>
"The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress may
add to or delete from the list of laws in Annex 3 after consulting
its Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special

<HEADLINE> Tajik Government, Opposition Sign Historic Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik government and the
opposition signed a landmark peace accord in Moscow today, ending
the tiny central Asian nation's four-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The deal was signed by Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov and
Islamic opposition leader Sayid Abdullo Nuri at a ceremony in the
Kremlin hosted by Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to exchange prisoners of war and establish
a Nuri-led 26-member National Commission for Reconciliation, with
places to be divided equally between each side.
</P>
<P>
Rakhmonov will remain president but 30 percent of government
posts must be given over to the opposition under the accord.
</P>
<P>
Opposition forces must integrate with government troops or lay
down their weapons and fresh parliamentary elections must be held
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Praising the accord, Yeltsin said, "This day should go down as
a remarkable page in the history of Tajikistan. It brings an end
to one of the longest and bitterest conflicts on Earth."
</P>
<P>
Russia will try to help Tajikistan proceed along the road of
peace and national reconciliation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since Tajikistan gained independence in September 1991 after
the collapse of the Soviet Union, conflicts among different
political, religious and ethnic groups intensified.
</P>
<P>
Islamic opposition forces, the main rival of the Tajik
government, set up bases in mountainous border areas between
Tajikistan and Afghanistan and launched a guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale fighting ended after the Tajik government and the
opposition forces signed a truce last December, but sporadic
clashes continued until today.

ABU DHABI, June 27 (Xinhua)-- Israel has given a go-ahead for
the construction of Sheikh Zayed City, a 15,000 apartment
project for Palestinians donated by the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) president in Jerusalem, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, minister for Jerusalem affairs of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) told Gulf News in an
exclusive telephone interview from Jerusalem that they received
permission from Israel Thursday night to start the project in the
outskirts of Jerusalem, in territory B which falls under PNA's
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al Nahyan promised to
provide donation to the project two years ago at the Jerusalem
Festival held in Abu Dhabi, the UAE's capital, but the project
was delayed because of Israel's refusal to grant construction
permits.
</P>

Husseini said he estimated the project would cost 150 million
U.S. dollars a year and it will be finished within four years.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Despite Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokehle's breakaway to form the Lesotho Congress for Democracy
this month, a senior Lesotho government official today described
the present situation in the country as " being stable " under
the ruling Basutholand Congress Party (BCP).
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's Justice, Law and Constitutional Minister Sephiri
Motanyane said that Lesotho, which was poised to hold
elections next year, was not anticipating upheavals in the wake
of Mokehle's move.
</P>
<P>
Motanyane, who is on a visit here, made the statement after
briefing Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe of events in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
"There is no change because Mokehle still receives
overwhelming support from ministers and members of the National
Assembly," he said, adding, "regardless of his recent political
move, he will remain the country's prime minister, and there will
be no change in the way of running government."
</P>
<P>
Motanyane said, "'Mokehle formed a new party because he was
prompted by the in-fighting within the ruling party, and he saw
that as a political solution to the problem."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe is currently Chairman of
the Organization of African Unity, and of Organ on Politics,
Defense and Security of the Southern African Development
Community.
</P>
<P>
There have been fears that violence might erupt in Lesotho
after Mokehle left the BCP to form his own party.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wool Industry Threatened by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia's wool industry was in
danger unless wool growers improved the quality of their product
by reducing contamination in wool bales, Primary Industries
Minister John Anderson warned today.
</P>
<P>
Anderson said buyers in Italy, France, Germany, Britain, Japan
and China had threatened to stop buying Australian wool unless the
level of contamination was reduced.
</P>
<P>
He announced a working party, comprising leaders of the wool
industry and government backbencher David Hawker, would be set up
to consider the best ways to improve the standard of wool exports.
</P>
<P>
It would consider how the industry could eliminate the use of
polypropylene hay baling twine, a chief contaminant of wool, the
benefits of a phased move to nylon wool packs and quality
assurance schemes.
</P>
<P>
The minister said even shears and bale-handling equipment
sometimes ended up in the bales sent to overseas customers.
</P>
<P>
Customers "were adamant that we don't seem to be recognizing,
despite warnings for decades, that it is putting the industry's
future at risk," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Some of them are quite openly warning that they will look to
alternative fibers in the future if we don't do something serious
about it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The working party, set up after Anderson held talks with chief
executives of the Australian Wool Exchange, the Wool Council, the
Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organization and other
industry groups, will report its suggestions in October.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Sergio Rail, a Brazilian of
Chinese descent, who oversees a Dutch bank's business in China,
has been living a flying life since he came to Hong Kong two years
ago. Two or three days a week he stays in Hong Kong but otherwise
rushes between six branches and representative offices in the
inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
With four days left before Hong Kong returns to China, Rail
said: "I still don't know where I'll be on June 30, but surely
I'll watch TV. It's a historic event, and I'm very happy to see it
and experience it."
</P>
<P>
"Being a Hong Kong resident, I hope this is the beginning of a
great future," said the banker working for ABN Amro Bank of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"The transition in Hong Kong has been going on smoothly. For
people living here, business is as usual," said Rail, adding that
he might spend the day working rather than celebrating.
</P>
<P>
ABN Amro has been in Hong Kong for 91 years, according to Rail.
In the Asia-Pacific region, Hong Kong has been the top profit
maker for his bank, the world's 14th largest. After July 1, the
bank will continue to base its regional headquarters in Hong Kong
and go all out to expand its presence in the rest of China, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rail said the bank has confidence in Hong Kong's future.
"Because we have confidence in Hong Kong people. They are
extraordinarily adaptable, quick and focused. It is Hong Kong
people who have really made this place what it is," he said.
</P>
<P>
Like Serge Rail, tens of thousands of professionals have come
to this international financial center, working for banks, funds,
insurance companies, accounting agencies and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world's third largest banking center, where
some 500 authorized institutions from 43 countries and regions
have established their presence, including licensed banks,
restricted license banks, deposit-taking companies and
representative offices of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Of the world's top 100 banks, 82 have had offices here, among
which 73 are operating with a full banking license. Around 67
percent of banking business is done in foreign currencies. Most
recently, Hong Kong has been the largest supplier of syndicated
loans and the largest debt issuer in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has the world's fourth largest gold bullion market,
fifth largest foreign exchange market, seventh largest derivatives
market, eighth largest stock market, one of the world's leading
insurance markets and the most vibrant bond market in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are over 1,300 mutual funds in Hong Kong,
which manage assets totaling 100 billion US dollars and invest
widely in securities markets both in China's inland areas and
abroad. Hong Kong is also the second largest center of venture
capital in the Asia-pacific region.

Andrew Lo, chairman of the Hong Kong Investment Funds
Association (IFA), said that the return of Hong Kong to China will
bring tremendous opportunities for Hong Kong's funds management
industry.
</P>
<P>
"China has a huge population of 1.2 billion and a huge pool of
savings but few investment channels. There is a potentially huge
market for fund managers," said the IFA chairman.
</P>
<P>
Lo added that, as a long-term investment, funds play a
stabilizing role on an international financial market like Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Cheng, executive director of the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation Ltd, said: "The way things will go in the
future will depend on China's economic reform and open-up
policies, its readiness to implement the promise of 'one country,
two systems' and the competitive edge of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Apart from some natural conditions that make Hong Kong flourish
as a global financial hub, Cheng pointed out that Hong Kong's
success relies largely on the diligence of the people here and
their faith and confidence in the future. "Investment is made on
the basis of confidence," said the Hong Kong banker.
</P>
<P>
His views are shared by Anthony Leung, a managing director of
the Chase Manhatten Bank, who overseas the American bank's
regional business here.
</P>
<P>
Also a member of the HKSAR's Executive Council, Leung said
that, to preserve Hong Kong's status as an international financial
center, there are five fundamental and indispensable elements --
the rule of law, a level playing field, free flow of information,
an efficient and corruption-free civil service, and law and order.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that, in the foreseeable future, Hong Kong will
continue to be the best place where foreign investors can seek
business opportunities in China's inland areas. Meanwhile,
enterprises from inland areas can meet their business partners in
Hong Kong, where so many multinational companies base their
regional headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, more than 60 percent of overseas
investment flowing into China's inland areas came from or through
Hong Kong. Today, 32 enterprises from the inland areas have been
listed at the Hong Kong stock exchange. They have raised a total
of 6.6 billion US dollars by issuing H shares.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a number of local China-backed companies issuing what
is called as "red chip" shares, have had a growing presence in the
local market. H shares and Red Chips now account for about ten
percent of total market capitalization in Hong Kong's stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Cheng, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong said
that Hong Kong should attract more and better enterprises from the
inland areas to its bourse. Meanwhile, Hong Kong should preserve
its monetary system and supervisory framework in accordance with
the international standard so as to draw foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Anthony Neoh, chairman of the Securities and Futures
Commission, expressed the same view. He said: "The ultimate
objective of supervision is to keep confidence in the market."

The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong is the second largest in Asia
next only to Japan's. Its current market capitalization hits 600
billion US dollars, and the Hang Seng Index, the market indicator
for blue-chips, has increased by a big margin so far this year.
The stock market not only serves Hong Kong but has also become an
important fund-raising source for Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Exchange Fund, or its foreign exchange reserves,
reached 66.6 billion US dollars in May, 1997, ranking the seventh
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) estimated that, if the 20-billion-US dollar Land Fund is
added, Hong Kong's total foreign exchange reserves will exceed 86
billion US dollars when Hong Kong becomes a Special Administrative
Region of China. "This will put Hong Kong in the fourth or fifth
place in the world in terms of the size of foreign exchange
reserves," said Yam.
</P>
<P>
However, as the HKMA chief executive said, the success of today
does not guarantee success for tomorrow. In his view, the historic
change on July 1, when China resumes the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong, will mark not only the beginning of a new era for
Hong Kong, but also the beginning of a new era for its financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
"We need increasingly to rely on our innovative and dynamic
spirit to maintain and strengthen Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center," said the 49-year-old Yam who has
assumed his present post since 1993.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the spirit of "One country, Two systems" gives
Hong Kong ample room to be creative and to ensure the continued
prosperity of Hong Kong. He believed that the financial
relationship between Hong Kong and inland areas will be based on
the principle of one country, two currencies, two monetary systems
and two monetary authorities, as the Chinese government has
stressed time and again.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law has laid down a clear legal foundation to ensure
that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) formulate
its own monetary and financial policies.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar, as the legal tender in the HKSAR, will
continue to circulate and be freely convertible. Free flow of
capital within, into and out of Hong Kong will be maintained and
the Exchange Fund will be managed and controlled by the HKSAR
government.
</P>
<P>
China's determination to fulfill its commitment to "One
country, two systems" is the cornerstone that supports confidence
in the future among Hong Kong's financial circles.
</P>
<P>
Dr Miron Mushkat, chief economist of Lehman Brothers, a global
investment banking giant, said: "The historic change on July 1
will not adversely affect Hong Kong's status as an international
financial center in the next five or ten years." On the contrary,
he stressed that the change will prove beneficial for the Hong
Kong economy in the short term. Thanks to greater economic
integration between Hong Kong and inland areas, Hong Kong will
play an increasingly important role as a good middleman.

banking and financial system, is a major market for banking
consortiums in the Asia-Pacific area. It is also an important
arena for Hong Kong banking business to provide fund raising
service for the interior areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong boasts the world's most complete and developed
telecommunication network, which will give an impetus to the
economic progress in the interior areas, said Norman Yuen.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the businessmen noted, Hong Kong will be an
important thoroughfare for the interior areas to link with the
international market.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Defense Minister Joins Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Minister Renato
de Villa today formally entered the ranks of the ruling Lakas-NUCD
party, setting the stage for a struggle for the endorsement of
President Fidel Ramos in the 1998 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos-chaired ruling party earlier set June 30 as the
deadline for those presidential aspirants seeking Ramos'
anointment as the party's presidential candidate to join the
party.
</P>
<P>
Attending de Villa's low-profile oath-taking ceremony were
Ramos and Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia,
a main rival for de Villa in contending for Ramos' support. De
Venecia is general-secretary of the governing party.
</P>
<P>
Other contenders for Ramos' backing include his economic
adviser Emilio Osmena, Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo and his
younger sister, Senator Leticia Ramos-Shahani.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo, who is not a Lakas member, has said he will join the
party at a proper time.
</P>
<P>
Political observers said a fierce struggle for Ramos' backing
would possibly lead to the party's breakup.
</P>
<P>
In the presidential election in 1992, Ramos broke away from the
Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino party and formed the Lakas after
losing nomination in the party's national convention. But he won
the polls with the strong support of former president Corazon
Aquino.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Visiting Russian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, in a
meeting with Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin here
today, said that the development of the strategic partnership
between China and Russia will most certainly bring a good
Sino-Russian relationship into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"In next century, our two countries will enjoy better
relations," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Sino-Russian ties have seen big growth in recent
years and that the two countries have signed four joint
communiques that determined the ways and means for Sino-Russian
long-term cooperation for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Principles have been established for increasing bilateral ties
and strengthening cooperation in various fields, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Sino-Russian relations will grow
steadily and healthily just as long as the two sides stick to the
spirit of equality, mutual trust, good neighborliness, and
cooperation for mutual benefit and joint development.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told Jiang that promoting Russia-China ties is a
priority in Russian foreign relations and that there are many
possibilities for cooperation. The two sides are now cooperating
effectively in the economy and in trade, he said, adding that he
hopes there will be more and better cooperation projects between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the regular meetings between the two prime
ministers are very good, something that could make for overall
planning in pushing forward bilateral collaboration, including
some large projects of major strategic importance.
</P>
<P>
This mechanism has proven effective and has shown vitality
since it began, Jiang continued. New progress will be made, he
said, as long as the two sides start from a strategic point of
view and continue to consult each other in a practical way.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin congratulated China on the return of Hong Kong,
calling it a major event in the 20th century and said that Russia
believes that Hong Kong's prospects will be even better.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that all Chinese are inspired by the return of Hong
Kong, and that this is an important step in China's reunification
of the motherland in accordance with the "one country, two
systems" concept presented by Deng Xiaoping, and that this step
has far-reaching historical significance.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes that after the handover, Hong Kong will
be even more prosperous and will continue to make a distinct
contribution to the development of the Asia-Pacific region and the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also told Chernomyrdin that China expects President Boris
Yeltsin to visit China at his convenience.

<HEADLINE> Laws To Be Enforced In Hong Kong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislative body has
decided that 10 national laws will be enforced in Hong Kong after
July 1.
</P>
<P>
The 26th meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) discussed a proposal on a draft
decision to add or delete national laws to or from Annex 3 of
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
According to the draft, the five laws to be added to Annex 3 of
the Basic Law are: the National Flag Law of the People's Republic
of China (PRC), Regulations on Consular Privileges and Immunity in
the PRC, the Law on the National Emblem of the PRC, the Law on
China's Territorial Waters and Adjoining Areas, and the Garrison
Law of the PLA Troops Stationed in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The law to be deleted from Annex 3 of the Basic Law is the
Order on the National Emblem of the PRC Proclaimed by the Central
People's Government Attached: Design of the national emblem,
Notes, and Instructions on Use.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee,
explained the draft decision. Six national laws were part of the
Basic Law of 1990, Cao said. The NPC and the Standing Committee
have made laws related to national defence and foreign affairs
which were outside the HKSAR's rule according to the Basic Law,
and some needed to be added to the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Cao said that the draft decision was to delete the Order on the
National Emblem of the PRC Proclaimed by the Central People's
Government Attached from Annex 3 of the Basic Law. The reason is
that Law on the National Emblem of the PRC covers the Order.
</P>
<P>
The draft decision does not delete a resolution on the national
capital, and the national anthem and national flag of the PRC made
by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on
September 27, 1949.
</P>
<P>
Cao explained that the resolution made stipulations on the
national capital and national anthem and national flag.

<HEADLINE> NPC Discusses Ending of Preparatory Committee for HKSAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislature began
deliberations today on ending the National People's Congress's
Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
According to the legislature's draft, the Preparatory Committee
has met its goal of preparing to establish the HKSAR according to
the HKSAR Basic Law and decisions of the NPC and its standing
committee, after it was established in January, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee is expected to approve the proposal
on ending the Preparatory Committee, which held its ninth session

LUSAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Two Lusaka businessmen were found
guilty and sentenced by the Lusaka Magistrate Court today for
trafficking more than 20 kilograms of cannabis.
</P>
<P>
The two, Alarm Sikaonga and Lucas Sagile, were arrested by the
police at a road block on a van they were traveling on after a
policeman searched the vehicle and found cannabis concealed in
two bags on April 10 this year.
</P>
<P>
In mitigation, the two criminals pleaded for forgiveness and
promised never to trafficking such drugs again.
</P>
<P>
The magistrate, Betty Musongko, gave the two a suspended
sentence of two years as they were first offenders and had shown
willingness and a repentance never to commit the crime again.
</P>
<P>
She, however, warned that while the economic problems are
affecting everyone, it is not an excuse to get involved in
criminal activities and then end up being imprisoned.

<HEADLINE> Top Securities Watchdog Confident in HK Financial Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to
prosper and maintain its status as an international financial
center after it becomes a special administrative region of China
on July 1, Anthony Neoh, chairman of the HK Securities &AMP; Futures
Commission, said here today.
</P>
<P>
With only four days to go before the Hong Kong's return to
China, Neoh made a detailed analysis of the strength, advantages
and new opportunities for Hong Kong's financial market, in a
speech titled "Building up Confidence and Keeping Abreast of the
Time".
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate goal of market supervision is to build up
confidence," he said. "A market cannot thrive if the investors do
not have much faith in it."
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Hang Seng Index has been
rising rapidly, he added, and both the overall market value and
the transaction volume of stocks have reached a new height.
</P>
<P>
"This has indicated the strong confidence in the market," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The overall market value of the securities on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange, which has more than 620 listed companies, has now
approached 600 billion US dollars, and the transaction volume for
the first four months this year totaled 102 billion US dollars,
more than half of the overall transaction volume of 183 billion US
dollars for 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong stock market is the world's eighth largest, and
the number two in Asia next to Tokyo," said Neoh. "It is a major
fund-raising channel for enterprises in China's interior areas."
</P>
<P>
Since the first enterprise from China's interior was listed in
Hong Kong in 1993, he noted, there have been 32 H shares at
present -- shares for companies from China's interior areas -- on
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which have raised a total capital of
6.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local stock market would suspended business during the first
three days of the next week, he noted, and the July 1 decision by
the US Federal Reserve Board on the change of interest rate could
have some impact on the market.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "We have made necessary preparations to
deal with any possible risks."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hong Kong's markets for futures and funds have also
been developing steadily, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 200 fund companies are doing business in Hong
Kong, and there are over 1,300 government-recognized funds with
total assets worth nearly 100 billion US dollars in the market.
Hong Kong has become the second largest fund management center in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"To preserve Hong Kong's current advantages, our commission
will work to maintain a fair, effective and transparent market,
and strive to establish a supervisory system that is compatible
with the international standards," said Neoh, who became the
chairman in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
The commission will also increase its cooperation with China's
interior areas in the aspect of market supervision, and encourage
the participation of international institutions in the Hong Kong
market, he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing the "China factor" as Hong Kong's "unique and
incomparable advantage", he said the listing of enterprises from
the interior area in Hong Kong was just the beginning, and that
more interior state-owned enterprise will come here to raise fund
as a result of the rapid growth of economy and the increasing
needs for capital.
</P>
<P>
"This has been and will continue to be a powerful impetus for
Hong Kong to establish itself as the center of capitalization in
the Asia-Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the H shares, there are now also scores of "red
chips", stocks of companies funded by China's interior areas that
are registered and operating in Hong Kong, on the Hong Kong Stock
Market. They account for six to seven percent of the total market
value of all listed stocks.

the buyers have kept joining the lines since early morning but
they are in good order.
</P>
<P>
On June 22, the subway authority in Hong Kong offered a million

return to the embrace of the motherland. All the tickets were sold
out on that day.

BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Over 2.84 million people have
applied to take the national college entrance exam this year,
180,000 more than 1996, and at least one out of every three
applicants will be enrolled by a college or university this autumn.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Education Commission (SEC) said here
today that China's 1,035 colleges and universities plan to enroll
1.01 million freshmen this year. This means that 45,000 more
people than the previous year will be able to go to college.
</P>
<P>
This year's three-day exam will be given from July 6 to 8, and
final results will be available in late July. Those who pass the
exam will be eligible for college admission in August.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the 1997 academic year, which begins in August,
all Chinese college students will be required to pay part of their
college tuition fees, which prior to 1994 were completely covered
by the government.
</P>
<P>
Tuition-free schooling will still be available to students
attending colleges and universities with specialities in
education, agriculture, forestry, public securities and geological
prospecting.
</P>
<P>
Colleges and universities that are authorized to enroll
students from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and among overseas Chinese
gave their entrance exams from June 23 to 25. More than 1,200
students from these regions took the exam. Testing sites were in
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Hong Kong and Macao.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Condemns U.S. pro-Israeli Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today the United States is only
subjecting herself to more global criticism if the Clinton
administration adopts the congressional resolution endorsing the
shift of Israel's capital to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue is a crucial one and a key subject in the
talks between Israel and Palestine for peace in West Asia,
Abdullah told reporters after meeting his Greek counterpart
Theodoros Pangalos who arrived here today for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said being the mediating country, the U.S. should
accept as incumbent upon her to the play the role sincerely,
objectively and impartially.
</P>
<P>
"America should not be seen as being too pro-Israel... although
we know in many matters, the U.S. is indeed bias to the Israelis
and that the American pro-Israeli policy is a strong policy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia would persist in opposing the impending
shift of the Israeli capital from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and would
pressure President Bill Clinton not to endorse the congressional
bill.
</P>
<P>
"We don't see how the shift can bring about anything good, but
instead will only cause a backlash of protests in various forms
especially from the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC). In
fact even non-OIC members understand that it would be improper for
the U.S. to take such an action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the OIC would re-emphasize the protest at its
upcoming summit.

<HEADLINE> Kenya-Zambia Row on Landing Rights Deepens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A protracted dispute over flights
scheduling and Kenya Airways' landing rights in Zambia has
deepened following the failure of the second meeting to resolve
the crisis between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yewondwossen Mengistu, the managing director of
Aero Zambia, has threatened to take the row to the International
Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Mengistu, also the leader of the Zambian negotiation team,
said he had expected to find an agreement that would have
facilitated the sharing of revenue on the disputed flights but
found the Kenyan side had not changed its stance.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Zambian delegation insisted its ground not to
allow Kenya Airways to resume the two extra flights on the
Nairobi-Lusaka route until the matter was resolved.
</P>
<P>
The dispute stems from the cancellation of two Kenya Airways
flights to Lusaka on Mondays and Thursdays and the withdrawal of
landing rights for Kenya's flights by the Zambian authorities.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways is accused of having paralleled its flights to
those of Aero Zambia, Zambia's designated airline.
</P>
<P>
Air travel bilateral agreement between the two countries
allows three frequencies for each country but provides for an
extra frequency if the need arises.
</P>
<P>
Mengistu said his company did not mind Kenya Airway's flying
to Zambia so long as it is not on the days that it has flights.
</P>
<P>
He said his company's demand is that if it has to have flights
on the same day with Kenya Airways, then the two sides share
revenue equally.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Airways was said to have offered to compensate Aero
Zambia with 1,562.50 U.S. Dollars per flight but this was
rejected outright.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Aero Zambia maintained that it could only accept a
minimum compensation of some 3,500 Dollars per flight for Mondays
and Thursdays by the Kenya Airways.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker today, weighed by a hike in Canadian short term interest
rates overnight which sparked selling of the local unit.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished in Sydney at 74.90 US cents,
down from 75.10 at the previous session close.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board meets on Tuesday
while the Federal Reserve holds its policy making meeting on
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Overnight, the Australian dollar dipped to a low of 74.85 US
cents after the surprise move by the Bank of Canada to lift the
bank rate by 25 basis points to 3.5 percent and the target
overnight call range to 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent, from 2.75
percent to 3.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
While many market participants think the Reserve Bank could
ease next week, others believe any rate cut might be delayed until
after the US Federal Reserve conclude its policy meeting.
</P>
<P>
The risk is that the Fed might lift US interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 85.43 yen, up from 85.46 , and at
1.2922 marks from 1.2942.

<HEADLINE> Kohl: Euro Delay to Harm Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
warned the German parliament that delay or failure of the single
European currency, the euro, would cost Germany dearly, and pledged
the on-time launch of euro in 1999.
</P>
<P>
He told the Bundestag, the lower house: "I am certain that ... the
euro will be introduced as planned, punctually on January 1, 1999,
meeting the full Maastricht criteria."
</P>
<P>
Delay or failure of the euro would harm exports, investment and
jobs, said Kohl in his speech.
</P>
<P>
"Those who call for delaying the euro must know that a delay could
end up being forever, we cannot... afford this," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, some politicians, such as Bavaria state premier
Edmund Stoiber, who is a member of the Bavarian sister party of
Kohl's Christian Democratic Uinon (CDU), has urged delaying the
euro if Germany fails to meet the membership criteria demanding
budget deficit under 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and
public debt under 60 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Germany has failed to meet the requirements over recent years
and most experts believed it would fail again this year. In May
1998, the European Union (EU) is to conclude from the 1997 full
data to see which countries qualify for the euro.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Remains Ban on Wildlife Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
maintain the ban on hunting in the country's parks, Kenyan
Tourism and Wildlife Minister Protus Momanyi has said.
</P>
<P>
Momanyi said that lifting of the ban would create a demand for
trade in game products, leading to uncontrolled killing of wild
animals, according to the "Daily Nation" today.
</P>
<P>
"Before the government imposed a ban on hunting, there was
wanton killing of wild animals by poachers. White rhinos were
almost becoming extinct, forcing the government to import some
from South Africa", the Kenyan minister said when receiving the Dutch
Ambassador Ruud Treffers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were 130,000 rhinos in Kenya's parks in early 1960s but
poaching and uncontrolled hunting had reduced the rhino
population to less than 11,000 by the late 1970s, he cited.
</P>
<P>
The population of elephants in the national parks in the
eastern African country now stood at 26,000, up from 20,000
before the ban.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is among the countries who contested a request by some
southern African countries to have the ban on ivory trade lifted
at the recent Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species in Harare, Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> "One Country, Two Systems" Is Long-Term Policy for Hong Kong: Noted Figures (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The policy of "one country, two
systems" is bound to succeed and will remain unchanged for a long
time in Hong Kong, according to local noted figures.
</P>
<P>
With only four days away before Hong Kong returns to China on
July 1, the phrase "one country, two systems" has become one of
the best-known and most-frequently-used one in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Local media described this policy as the "inevitable choice to
realize China's reunification", while many people across the world
praised it for setting an example in solving problems left over
from history through peaceful negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But it is unprecedented in the world history that two different
social systems can co-exist in one sovereign country. Some people
are wondering whether the principle of "one country, two systems"
will remain unchanged for a long time.
</P>
<P>
In answering the question, a dozen noted figures from various
walks of life in Hong Kong expressed confidence and optimism in
recent interviews with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that "one country, two systems" is not an expedient
measure, but a lasting policy decision based on the reality of
Hong Kong and China's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the interior areas, which are now in a
modernization process, need Hong Kong as a unique bridge linking
them with the outside world, while Hong Kong's sustained
prosperity and stability also require interior areas enjoying
long-term stability and scoring sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The economic miracle that Hong Kong has performed over the past
two decades and the tremendous achievements that China's interior
areas have scored since initiating the policy of the reform and
opening up serve as the most convincing fact, they said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang Hin-chi, chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General
Chamber of Commerce, recalled that when the question of Hong
Kong's return to China was first raised in the early 1980s, some
people in Hong Kong and other parts of the world expressed worries
and doubts about Hong Kong's future, arguing that Hong Kong's
economic prosperity would be "ruined" after the handover.
</P>
<P>
"But their doubts and worries were gradually dispelled by the
great concept of 'one country, two systems' put forward by Deng
Xiaoping, and the prospects of Hong Kong began to become
increasingly brighter," he said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the current prosperity of Hong Kong to the hard
work of the Hong Kong people and Hong Kong's unique economic
operational mechanism, as well as the "China factor".

<TEXT>
<P>
Tam Yiu-chung, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of
Trade Unions and member of the Executive Council of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), shared Tsang's opinion.
</P>
<P>
"One important factor contributing to Hong Kong's economic
recovery after a period of adjustment is the backing of the strong
motherland," he said. "If the current situation of stability and
development in the interior areas continues, it will contribute
more to making sure that 'one country, two systems' will remain
unchanged for a long time."
</P>
<P>
Nellie Fong Wong Kut-man, chairman of the Executive Committee
of the Better Hong Kong Foundation, said that as an international
financial, trade, shipping, information and tourism center, Hong
Kong has an effective free economic mechanism. It is this
mechanism that has enabled Hong Kong to become one of the most
appealing places to investors and business people across the
world.
</P>
<P>
She said that retaining the existing systems will not only
ensure Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, but also
build a bridge between China's interior areas and the global
market.
</P>
<P>
"Only by preserving the existing systems will Hong Kong be able
to remain vibrant and competitive," she noted. "A Hong Kong
without vigor or competitiveness would not be what Hong Kong
people want to see and would also be useless to China's interior
areas."
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the central government of the People's Republic of
China, which can manage 1.2 billion people successfully, must have
a better understanding of this than I do," said Fong, who is a
member of the HKSAR Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
Many business people in Hong Kong like to say that the economic
and trade relations between Hong Kong and China's interior areas
are "as close as lips and teeth".
</P>
<P>
"With the backing of China's vast interior areas, Hong Kong has
achieved a fast and successful industrial restructuring," said
Michael Sze, executive director of the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that the need of the interior areas for funds for
economic construction has stimulated the growth of Hong Kong's
financial market, and trade with the interior areas has spurred
the development of Hong Kong's trade-oriented service sector.
</P>
<P>
"The interior areas are the rear for Hong Kong industries, and
have also made plenty of investment in Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that beyond 1997, in accordance with the policy of
"one country, two systems", the economic and trade relations
between China's interior areas and Hong Kong will be further
enhanced, injecting an "enormous impetus" into economic growth of
both regions.

<P>
Eddy S.H. Li, president of the Hong Kong Economic and Trade
Association, shared his view. He said, "The market in the interior
areas will be open wider to Hong Kong, bringing enormous business
opportunities to the city after its return to the motherland."
</P>
<P>
Li also asked the Hong Kong business community to be aware of
the challenges faced by its processing industry in the interior
areas which are readjusting their policy on utilizing foreign
investment and giving overseas businessmen the same treatment as
their counterparts in the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the redoubled effort by the interior areas
to open to the outside world will push Hong Kong companies to more
fierce competition in expanding their business there.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a "high degree of
autonomy" constitute a basis on which the "one country, two
systems" policy will remain unchanged for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has stated that it will act as a
"goalkeeper" for the "one country, two systems, and Hong Kong
people should have a correct understanding of this," said Sze
Chi-qing, another Hong Kong business tycoon.
</P>
<P>
Sze, also an advisor on Hong Kong and SAR affairs, said that in
their speeches, Deng Xiaoping and Chinese leaders of the third
generation have repeatedly emphasized that Hong Kong's current
social and economic systems will remain unchanged, its legal
system will not change by and large, and its status as a free port
and an international trade and financial center will not change
either.
</P>
<P>
This will be beneficial to Hong Kong and the whole of China as
well, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Sze added the "one country, two systems" means that
Hong Kong will maintain its capitalist system, whereas the
interior areas of China will continue to practice the socialist
system."

<TEXT>
<P>
Since "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong" is an unprecedented practice, it is
understandable that some people may have worries.
</P>
<P>
Woo Chia-wei, president of the Hong Kong University of Science
and Technology, said, "As the times are changing, many
unprecedented undertakings can be put into practice in a bold,
prudent and earnest manner, so long as the general public reaches
a consensus. Only this way can the human society advance."
</P>
<P>
On the question of Hong Kong's return to China, "one country,
two systems" is a principle which is acceptable to all sides and
has gone through preparations for a long time," said Woo.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been ruled by an European country several
thousand miles away in the past 156 years, and therefore, many
people in Hong Kong have a "marginal concept", Woo said. So many
people in Hong Kong have accepted "two systems," but are
unfamiliar with "one country".
</P>
<P>
He said, "I don't think the Hong Kong people should doubt
whether the "one country, two systems" will remain unchanged for a
long time. Instead, they should think carefully about whether they
will be able to have a good understanding of the essence of the
'one country, two systems' within a short period of time."
</P>
<P>
Lee Chark-tim, president of Hong Kong Federation of Trade
Unions, pointed out, "Hong Kong people will dispel their worries
as long as they come to understand the principle of 'one country,
two systems', 'Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong' and a high
degree of autonomy, and see with their own eyes that Hong Kong's
social and economic systems and their lifestyles will not change,
and that its existing laws will remain unchanged by and large."
</P>
<P>
"The 'one country, two systems' principle has become the source
of hopes for the Hong Kong people to look into the future," said
Sze Cheung-pang, a member of the National Committee of Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
"We should entirely accept the principle and participate in
implementing it as well," said Sze, an influential businessman in
Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> New Era of Cooperation Between HK with Other Parts of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese expert said here
today that the cooperation between Hong Kong and other parts of
China, especially southern areas, will play an important role in
maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong
after it returns to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Fu Chonglan, director of the Urban Development and Environment
Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said
Hong Kong and its neighboring areas will enter a more prosperous
era after July 1, as a result of their further cooperation in a
wide range of sectors.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, as an international center of finance, trade,
shipping, tourism, and information, will face stronger competition
in the world market, Fu said, and he foresees more advantageous
exchanges between Hong Kong and the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The two-way cooperation in trade and economics, the sciences,
technology, and social welfare programs will continue to develop,
and the central-western area of China will become an investment
hot spot for Hong Kong businessmen, according to Fu.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that technological and agricultural involvement
between Hong Kong and the inland areas will help increase their
competitiveness in farming and hi-tech development in the domestic
and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Fu stresses importance of paying attention to environmental
protection and ecological problems in Hong Kong and its
surrounding areas, while they strengthen cooperations.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official Highly Evaluates Hang Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- "In getting Hong Kong Back,
they (China) have reversed a historic injustice," Reuven Merhav,
a senior Israeli China hand, told The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
He made the comment in an interview with the English newspaper
a few days before China is to resume the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Merhav, who served as director-general of the Israeli Foreign
Ministry, visited China in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Despite predictions of mass flight from Hong Kong, the
population has remained in place and apartment values have gone
up, he said.
</P>
<P>
Merhav said that he believes China will also achieve
reunification with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish community in Hong Kong has increased in size in
recent years and it is estimated that there are 3,000 Jews
residing in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Merhav said that the handover will go far toward hastening
China's emergence as a world economic power. "China has foreign
reserves of about 115 billion U.S. dollars and Hong Kong has
reserves of about 70 billion. Together, that's almost equal to
Japan's," he said.
</P>
<P>
Merhav noted that Hong kong is the engine driving the economic
dynamics of south China.
</P>
<P>
As a management and banking center and transportation hub, Hong
Kong has increasingly shifted production over the years to the
nearby Chinese provinces, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to view the whole region, including south China and
Taiwan, as one economic unit of 150 million people with Hong Kong
at the center," he said.

PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin admitted Thursday the
difficulty of making the two ends of electoral promises and
commitment to Europe meet. Economic projections said that
France's budget deficit this year would stand around 3.7 percent
of its gross domestic product, higher than the 3 percent ceiling
set by its 1997 budget law in accordance with the Maastricht
treaty criteria for joining the euro.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the
Communication Decency Act, a federal law banning Internet messages
judged as "indecent," is unconstitutional. Many users of the
Internet have complained that the law would open the door to an
unacceptable form of censorship.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Lionel Jospin Thursday asked his cabinet
ministers to prepare the 1998 budget law by giving "absolute
priority to the fight for employment and social justice" while
"all respecting the European commitments for entering the economic
and monetary union on the deadline set by the (Maastricht) treaty."
</P>
<P>
-- Paris remains a hub of drug-trafficking and drug-abuse of
France despite strong competition from Marseille known for its
"French Connection" in the 1970s, said specialists attending a
conference of European Cities Against Drug (ECAD) Thursday.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS May Prefer Military Solution to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Military action to oust Sierra
Leone's military junta may be a choice by foreign ministers from
west African countries who began a meeting on Thursday in
Conakry, Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) discussed the deteriorating situation in Sierra
Leone and ways of rectifying it, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The military junta seized power through a coup on May 25 which
overthrew the elected civilian government led by ousted President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The coup has suffered wide condemnation from the international
community. A series of diplomatic talks for a peaceful settlement
of the crisis in Sierra Leone followed unsuccessful military
efforts by the ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG to
restore the toppled legistimate government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, coup leader Major Johnny Paul Koroma expressed his
readiness on Wednesday that he would allow Kabbah, who is
reportedly on exile in Guinea, to return as long as he stopped
"misleading" the international community.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the nation, Koroma also diclosed he would
soon announce the composition of his new government and a
"timetable for a proper return to civil rule".
</P>
<P>
Against the background, ECOWAS foreign ministers held their
first meeting since the May 25 coup to probe ways for settling
the crisis in Sierra Leone, which is a member of the sub-regional
organization.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) reiterated at the meeting
OAU's support to "any method that would restore the legitimate
government in Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
Though no communique was announced after Thursday's meeting,
there seems to be strong likelihood that ECOWAS foreign ministers
may finally recommend military action against the Sierra Leonan
military junta to reinstate Kabbah, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Except Ghana, which was described as a "lone voice" at the
meeting, other members agreed on a military option since
diplomatic moves had not succeeded in forcing Koroma's Armed
Forces Revolutionary Council to step down.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Ghana's deputy foreign minister visited Freetown
with the information that ECOWAS had not agreed to oust by force
the coupists.
</P>
<P>
The visit was reported to give confidence to Koroma's military
government.
</P>
<P>
But at the end of Thursday's ECOWAS foreign ministers meeting,
a source was quoted as saying that the mood at the meeting
indicated an "imminent military intervention".
</P>
<P>
In his first public statement on the May 25 takeover, ECOWAS
Chairman, Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha also called
for immediate steps to restore peace, order and legitimacy in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the meeting, Abacha said if the situation in Sierra
Leone was not carefully managed, it might retard the peace process in
Liberia and threaten the stability of Guinea, both immediate neighbors
of that country.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony the same day to launch a new book in Abuja,
capital of Nigeria, Abacha also stoutly defended Nigeria's
current role in Sierra Leone, saying it is not an interference.
</P>
<P>
Responsibility is placed on Nigeria for ensuring the stability
of the sub-region, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a sub-regional power, Nigeria is the main contributor of ECOMOG
which has been operating in Liberia for some seven years. It also has
a contingent in Freetown for military training mission under an
agreement signed with Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
The leading role of Nigeria in ECOMOG operation in Sierra
Leone has been much criticized by the military authorities of
that country who said the country opposed any foreign
interference of its internal affairs.

GENEVA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament (CD)
approved Thursday the appointment of John Campbell of Australia as
a "Special Coordinator" on the issue of landmines.
</P>
<P>
But the conference still has not adopted a program of work for
this year although the appointment ended in part a deadlock over
what CD should do in this year's session.
</P>
<P>
The appointment, made at a plenary of the second part of the CD
1997 session, followed a consensus among CD members that a special
coordinator should be chosen.
</P>
<P>
A further plenary was set for Friday following requests for
decisions on several other proposed appointments of ad hoc committees
and special coordinators.
</P>
<P>
Campbell, ambassador and permanent representative of Australia
to CD, will explore possibilities for beginning negotiations on an
international ban on anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
He is requested to consult with member delegations and report
to the conference on how to proceed on the topic of landmine
negotiations when it resumes work in August.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Minister Says Mideast Peace Is Dying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz has stressed that the Middle East peace process is "dying"
due to policy of right-wing Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, Beirut's Arabic daily An-Nahar reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz made the statement in a speech addressed Thursday
evening to a forum here under the title of "Lebanon, situation of
the Arab-Israeli peace and its horizon," according to the
largest-circulated conservative newspaper in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is dying, and it not only needs a re-push
but also needs a re-creation," said Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during the time of former Israeli (Labour) Prime
Ministers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres and despite a stalemate
in the peace talks, there was still a feeling that the
circumstances would improve and the peace negotiations would go
forward.
</P>
<P>
But after Netanyahu came to power in May 1996, "the things
changed and a new stage came, that is the stage of destroying the
peace process," the foreign minister added.
</P>
<P>
After taking office, the Israeli hard-line Likud Party leader
immediately imposed his own radical policy, known as the "security
for peace" policy, destroying basis of the peace process under the
formula of "land for peace" advocated by the Labor government,
Boueiz said.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said the U.S. government's policy was characterized by
an "absolute" commitment to Israeli suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel on the one hand and Syria and
Lebanon on the other have been suspended since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, Israel has been occupying a 1,100-square-kilometer
strip of land in South Lebanon, using the so-called "security
zone" to ward off cross-border guerilla attacks on its northern
settlements.
</P>
<P>
The "security zone" is patrolled by 1,500 Israeli troops and by
the South Lebanese Army (SLA), an Israeli-financed 2,500-strong
Christian militia.
</P>
<P>
Israel has demanded that SLA militia be integrated into the
Lebanese army as part of the security arrangements between the
Lebanese and Israeli governments, which will ensure the Israeli
withdrawal from the "security zone."

KAMPALA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is no longer among world's
ten poorest nations, reported the local daily " The New Vision"

The latest World Bank report issued Wednesday was quoted as
saying Uganda's per capita income has risen for the sixth
consecutive year to 240 U.S. Dollars and for the first time in
two decades the country is not among the poorest nations in the
world.

It said Mozambique remain the world's poorest country with a
per capita income of only 80 dollars. The second is Ethiopia with
a per capita income of 100 dollars while Tanzania is with a per

The report praised Uganda for the way it has tried to tackle
corruption and to encourage non-governmental organizations to
deliver social services in areas where it is unable to.

<P>
Corruption is a 'cancer' eating away many poor countries, the
report said.
</P>

According to the report, the key issue is to encourage
competition. It also says that only in a good policy environment will
foreign aid have any impact on growth.

Africa while 12 of the richest 20 are in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka Reduces Property Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Lusaka City Council has
reduced property rate by 50 percent with immediate effect to
attract more investors, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted the council's Public Relations
Manager Daniel Msoka as saying here Tuesday that the council may
reward more tax relief to property owners if the measures to
broaden income succeed.
</P>
<P>
"We have reduced rate from 0.0105 to 0.0050 in a Kwacha with
immediate effect. This means that property owners will pay half
from whatever amount they owe the council," he said.
</P>
<P>
Msoka said property owners are supposed to settle the money
they owe the city council within 14 days of receipt of the
notices. Failure to do so bailiffs will move in.
</P>
<P>
But another local newspaper, Zambia Daily Mail, reported that
the council reduced the rate following wide spread complaints
from business houses and the general public.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Msoka as saying that the reduction will create a
deficit of 3.6 billion Kwacha (about 2.8 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
In order to offset the deficit, the council will soon embark
on a supplementary property roll to catch up with an upswing in
the level of development EEince 1995 when the current main
valuation roll was done.

<HEADLINE> hkhk-Director of Audit Vows to Serve Hong Kong Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 53-year-old Mr. Chan is not only a celebrity but also a
pride of Hong Kong, since he is the first Chinese to be promoted
to the post of Director of Audit, a key post in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As a major commercial hub, Hong Kong has always attached great
importance to auditing, setting up an audit department as early as
in 1844. However, all of Chan's 20 predecessors were foreign
nationals.
</P>
<P>
He would never have dared to dream of his promotion if not for
the return of Hong Kong to its motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I treasure the opportunity of service as Director of Audit. I
have been trying to prove by my work that a Chinese can be a good
leader of the audit department," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Like most principal officials of the current HK government, Mr.
Chan will retain his post, which he assumed in 1995, in the future
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government. "The
return of Hong Kong to the motherland gives me an opportunity to
continue to serve Hong Kong, and I'll try my uttermost to do my
work well", he said.
</P>
<P>
He has a demanding job. It is the responsibility of his
department to ensure that financial and accounting records of
public or semi-public funds comply with commonly-accepted
accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
The department also acts as a watchdog against waste and lack
of efficiency on the part of government departments.
</P>
<P>
Since auditing is meant to find and expose problems, it cannot
avoid offending people, he said. "Ever since I began working for
the Audit Department nearly 30 years ago, I have abided by a set
of ethical standards, that is, to have enterprise, to have moral
integrity and to adhere to principle," he said.
</P>
<P>
An important thing he has done since assuming his current post,
he said, is the hiring of professional consultants to solve
problems that require special knowledge. In the past, some of
these problems had to be left unsolved owing to their complexity
defying a solution.
</P>
<P>
On his plan of work for the HKSAR government, Chan said he will
push for accelerating audit-related legislation and enhance
exchanges with developed countries and the audit departments of
China's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
"Auditing should be done in a more in-depth, extensive and
objective manner so as to save every penny of tax-payers' money
and ensure that the government work with greater efficiency," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Arrests 500 Palestinian Suspects in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces have
arrested 500 Palestinians suspected of having links to radical
organizations in a major crackdown on violence, Israel Radio
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown came after the discovery of a time bomb on the
crowded Tel Aviv beach last week which was believed to be planted
by terrorists. A thief stole the bag containing the bomb, but he
reported to the police when he found out it was actually a
tickling timer bomb.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv police have since heightened security alert along the
beach and other places of entertainment in order to prevent new
violent attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio said that the 500 Palestinian suspects are
believed to be linked to the anti-Israeli Islamic militant
organizations, such as the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
Islamic Jihad and Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Security forces continued to warn the public that the
possibility of new violent attacks still exist, adding they are
fighting a daily struggle to thwart any new attempts to penetrate
by Palestinian suspects.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, Tel Aviv police will increase security
alert along the beach area and other places of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli police have arrested Ahmed Ali Kaabneh, a
Beduin shepherd who was accused of murdering two Israeli girls on
April 24 during a hiking tour in the Wadi Kelt along the
Jerusalem-Jericho highway.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the motive for the murders was nationalistic,
and Kaabneh murdered the girls in an attempt to steal weapons from
the victims who in fact carried none.
</P>
<P>
Following the arrest of Kaabneh, the Council of Jewish
Settlers in the Palestinian territories demanded that all the
Beduin living in the Judean Sesert be removed.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Air Attack at Hezbollah in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli helicopters carried
out an air raid at a guerrilla base of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, in south Lebanon Thursday night, and Hezbollah
sources confirmed this morning that one guerrilla was injured in
the strike.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli helicopters launched the offensive at 11:00
p.m. local time (08:00 GMT) and fired five air-to-surface missiles
at the target on the outskirts of Nabaa Al-Taseh in Iglim
Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, a heights opposite the so-called
"security zone" self-carved by Israel in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Senior security sources in Hezbollah said that Hassan Farah, a
Hezbollah guerrilla, was injured when the military jeep he was
driving in the area was hit by the helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The air raid was accompanied by bombardment of Israeli
artillery at Loueizeh, Ogmatah, and Sejoud in Iglim Al-Toffah,
some 65 kilometers southeast of Beirut, which is often used by
Hezbollah's Muslim fighters as a springboard to launch attacks on
the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in south Lebanon said that Israeli artillery
resumed the shelling this morning at Iglim Al-Toffah and fired a
dozen of 120m and 150m heavy shells.
</P>
<P>
However, local military observers noted that Thursday night's
air raid, the 41st since this year, did not go beyond a limit of
daily exchange of fire between the Lebanese resistance fighters
and the Israeli occupation forces on the last active battlefront
of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Law Professionals Confident about HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They unanimously regard the Basic Law as a cornerstone of the
"one country, two systems" concept and said that it provides a
very pragmatic framework and a favorable environment for the
development of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR).
</P>
<P>
Lau Hon Chuen, a member of the Provisional Legislative Council
(PLS) of the Hong Kong SAR, said that the Basic Law is effective
in implementing "one country, two systems" policy, since it
generously grants a high degree of autonomy for the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Besides, what the Chinese government has done in handling Hong
Kong affairs over recent years is an evidence that it has taken
the Basic Law very seriously, Lau noted.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the drafting of the Basic Law itself was a
successful rehearsal for the smooth implementation of "one
country, two systems" policy, whose curtain will be formally
raised with China's resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
As an example of the unprecedented, arduous and extensive
cooperation between Hong Kong and China's interior area, the Basic
Law drafting did manifest as well as generate the key elements
that the success of the reunification model requires pragmatism,
procedural rationality and democratic communication.
</P>
<P>
After an analysis on amending and retaining the existing laws
in Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic Law, Albert H.Y. Chen,
dean of the Faculty of Law of the University of Hong Kong noted
that in terms of civil and commercial laws, some areas of public
law, or even in the field of human rights, the original laws of
Hong Kong may be considered as just as specified in the Joint
Declaration -- "remaining basically unchanged". He said the Laws
of the Hong Kong SAR will protect the rights and interests of all
individuals and legal persons. Therefore, he added, he fully
confides in the future of Hong's legal system.
</P>
<P>
Elsie Leung, secretary of Justice of the HKSAR, said it is a
period of excitement to witness Hong Kong's return to China and
see a city under British colonial rule turn into the Special
Administrative Region of China.
</P>
<P>
According to Leung, the Chief Executive's Office is racing
against time in making preparations to set up the Hong Kong SAR
and one of the goals in such preparations is aimed to avoid
loopholes in the field of legislation.
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that redoubled, diversified efforts should be
made for the use of the Chinese language in court and in the
application of international human rights law in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth C K Chow, a barrister-at-law of Hong Kong, said that
the courts of Hong Kong SAR are vested with a pivotal role which
will be enshrined in history, namely, to carry forward the
original laws of Hong Kong into the era of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
According to Chow, who is also a member of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong
after its return to the motherland is inseparable from the
preservation of the legal system previously practised in Hong
Kong.
Moreover, he said, in the wake of the successful establishment of
the Court of Final Appeal, the future judicial system of the Hong
Kong SAR will surely be able to aspire to a much better outlook,
and a much better tomorrow.

JOHANNESBURG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Drug abuse was rapidly on

The bureau's official Vince Crous said in the first four
months of this year police confiscated two tons of dagga in
Pretoria, compared with three kilogram in the some period last
year.

He attributed this increase to the opening up of international

HARBIN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of Russian
businessmen shuttling between Russia and Harbin has brought
millions of yuan-worth of sales orders to Harbin, the capital of
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
While most of these businessmen from Russia and other central
Asian countries are dealing in small commodities, their total
purchases in a major local marketplace reached 500 million yuan
last year.
</P>
<P>
The daily transactions of the Harbin Non-Governmental Trade
Market have now reached 1.5 million yuan. The figure was less than
300,000 yuan just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
The market covers an area of 30,000 square meters, and is used
as a sales base by 3,000 independently-operating Chinese
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Local sources say that at least 500 Russian businessmen visit
the market every morning, and as many as 1,000 on Thursdays and
Fridays when an express train makes stopover in the city.
</P>
<P>
Some state-owned firms, foreign-funded enterprises and private
companies have been involved in the market, dealing directly with
the buyers of their goods.
</P>
<P>
Products made in the Republic of Korea, the United States and

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Per Capita GDP to Surpass 3,000 Dollars This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The per capita GDP (gross
domestic product) of residents in Shanghai, China's largest trade
and financial city, will exceed 3,000 US dollars this year,
according to recent statistics.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents the city's great progress in
industrialization, and has attracted the attention of both
economists and government officials.
</P>
<P>
Economists here have been advising the government on ways to
deal with the challenges facing the city's burgeoning economy.
</P>
<P>
"This marks a new starting point for Shanghai's economy, and
new changes will take place in the city's industrial structure and
methods of economic growth," said Lu Deming, director of the
Economic Research Center of Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the output value of the service industry will
increase from today's 42 percent to half of the city's total GDP
by the year of 2000, due to the growth of capital-intensive
industries.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Shanghai market will open even wider, and the
market competition will be tougher than before, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will be built into one of China's modern manufacturing
industry centers, and the city's finance, trade and transportation
industries will also develop rapidly, said Zhang Zhongli, chairman
of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
An international seminar sponsored by the local government and
academic institutions was recently held to discuss the city's GDP
growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
decided to form a high-powered export promotion board in a bid to
give a major thrust to exports, the newspaper National Herald
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Prime minister Inder Kumar Gujral announced the decision on
Thursday at a meeting convened by him in view of the massive slow
down in the country's exports in 1996-97 and a 10 percent decline
in exports in April 1997, the first month of the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
During his interactions with trade and industry
representatives, Gujral said the new board will help resolve the
inter-ministerial problems related to exports.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister took a serious view of the sharp fall in the
exports and took some other on-the-spot decisions on exports.
</P>
<P>
The board, headed by the cabinet secretary, will include
secretaries of the ministries of commerce, finance, textile
industry, surface transport and electronics. Secretary is the
highest ranking civil servant in India.
</P>
<P>
The decision on export promotion board was made in response to
suggestions from Indian exporters that a single window
institutional mechanism should be set up to facilitate the
country's exports.

The new park, which has been met with the enthusiasm of the

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government forces today
continued its hot-pursuit operations in central Mindanao in search
of Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels, who took hostage
some 100 commuters in Kabacan, Cotabato province Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Cotabato quoted military spokesman Noel Detoyato
as saying that the government troops are conducting a no-let-up
operation in Kabacan, Pikit and Carmen towns since MILF rebels
took about 100 hostages early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Later Thursday, the government troops engaged the rebels in a
fierce battle in Kayaga, Kabacan to rescue the hostages, who were
passengers of buses and other vehicles that the MILF flagged down
in the area.
</P>
<P>
Four soldiers, four rebels and two hostages were killed in
Thursday's battle.
</P>
<P>
After the fighting, the MILF announced the postponement of its
peace talks with the government scheduled for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said only 45 hostages managed to escape Thursday
as MILF rebels fled to a nearby forest area.
</P>
<P>
"Some hostages might have escaped the fighting but they did not
manifest their names so we are searching for them to determine if
they're free or still being taken by the rebels," said Detoyato.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Secretary Renato de Villa revealed Thursday
that more troops will be deployed in Central Mindanao to hunt the
hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which rejected a Mindanao peace accord signed by the
government and the Moro National Liberation Front Last September,
is fighting for independence of Mindanao, the Southern
Philippines.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A plan of the ruling United
Front government to raise the prices of gas and petroleum products
with immediate effect suffered a setback on Thursday as the
Congress Party refused to support the move, the Indian Express
said today.
</P>
<P>
Congress Party President Sitaram Kesri held an hour-long
close-door meeting with Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral on the
subject on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Kesri was assisted by the party's vice president Jitendra
Prasada and former External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee.
</P>
<P>
While cautioning Gujral against any immediate increase in the
oil prices, Kesri said it would adversely affect the common man
and his party needs time to study the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to hike the oil prices to reduce the
rising deficit caused by subsidies to gas and petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said the Gujral government has proposed a 6-
to 8-percent gas and diesel price hike to complete the reforms in
the oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Because the ruling United Front government needs outside
support in the parliament from the Congress Party, a panel
comprising Gujral and Kesri was formed in April for both sides to
coordinate on major decision-making.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Switches Topic as Gases Criticism Mounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton tried hard today to shun criticism from his European
allies for failing to set clear targets for his country on cutting
greenhouse gases emissions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 173-nation United Nations Earth Summit, Clinton
switched the topic and spared no efforts in stressing the
importance of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago in Rio de Janeiro, the nations of the world
joined together around a simple but revolutionary proposition:
that today's progress must not come at tomorrow's expense," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Then focusing on the danger of greenhouse gases, he said if
pollution is not controlled, "scientists expect the seas to rise
two feet or more in the next century." That meant 9000 square
miles of Florida, Louisiana and other coastal areas would be
flooded, and 17 percent of Bangladesh lost.
</P>
<P>
The European Union proposes reducing greenhouse gases -- carbon
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- by 15 percent below 1990
levels with a deadline of 2010.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from big industry and Congress, Clinton refused
to commit to targets before December's global warming treaty
negotiations in Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
In order to sooth sore feelings among allies, he promised to
back tighter pollution limits on soot and smog in the United
States, the biggest polluter of the globe.
</P>
<P>
He called on government, university and private sector
scientists to develop new technologies to curb global warming.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that the U.S. will bring to the Kyoto conference in
December strong American commitments to realistic and binding
limits that will significantly reduce its emissions of greenhouse
gases.
</P>
<P>
The week-long summit, dubbed "Earth Summit Plus 5", aimed to
review progress since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
in 1992, when participating countries agreed to seek sustainable
development, or international economic growth with environmental
protection attached.

the areas will become a huge market in need of more than 700
billion US dollars worth of commodities in years up to 2000.
</P>
<P>
All this presents great potentials for further trade and
eocnomic cooperations and exchanges between the inland areas and
Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
An predicts that the growth of trade volume will be accompanied
by the improvement of the commodity mix.
</P>
<P>
Major inland exports to Hong Kong will shift to finished
products and semi-finished products from traditional items such as
food and raw materials, while more technology- and
capital-intensive goods will to the inland areas from Hong Kong,
An noted.
</P>
<P>
The assistant minister also said that large and medium-sized
cities, as well as western and central provinces in the inland
areas are expected to emerge as hot investment spots for Hong Kong
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
And the exchanges in the service sector will anticipate a
boost, An pointed out, adding that the service industry already
accounts for 83 percent of Hong Kong's economy and its further
growth will constitute a positive effect on the development
of the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The inland areas also aspire to do their share to upgrade the
infrastructure in Hong Kong and boost its economy through
contracting projects and labor exports based on the region's
actual demand, An explained.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the management and development of the
inland-financed companies in Hong Kong, An said that they should
abide by as well as be protected by the laws and regulations in
the region. In other words, all enterprises in Hong Kong should
follow the "rule of the games," and inland-financed enterprises
shall have no previliges and shall compete fairly and equally with
all other businesses there.

<HEADLINE> Oldsters Now Outnumber Youngsters in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of people aged 65 or
older in Japan now exceeds for the first time the number of those
aged 14 or younger.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, the number of senior citizens was estimated at 19.54
million, about 15.5 percent of the total population, or about
50,000 more than the 19.49 million children, Japan's Management
and Coordination Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Children under 14 make up 15.46 percent of Japan's population,
the agency said in its monthly population survey.
</P>
<P>
In June last year, there were 990,000 more children than senior
citizens. During the past year, the number of elderly people
increased by 730,000, while the number of children decreased by
310,000.
</P>
<P>
The reversal underlines the fact that Japan's population is
rapidly aging, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The "aging society" trend will continue, it predicted, adding
that by 2020, the number of older people was expected to rise to
22 percent of the total population.
</P>
<P>
In 2005, the proportion of the population aged at least 65 will
double the number aged 14 or younger, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Economic Ties between Inland Area and Hong Kong to Be Further Enhanced after Handover: Official (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Min said that Hong Kong's advantages, such as its role in
the global economy as an entrepot, cannot be replaced by any
inland city. Hong Kong will continue to serve as a showcase for
China's inland areas as well as a bridge linking China with other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
An said thatha stableof Hong Konis reinforceded by the
following three factors:
</P>
<P>
First, all of Hong Kong's current advantages, including its
ideal geographical position, well-facilitated harbor, close
relations with China's inland area, and broad-ranging economic
ties with other countries, will not change as a result of the
forthcoming handover;
</P>
<P>
Second, the Basic Law clearly stipulates that Hong Kong will
continue to keep both its free port status and liberal trade
policies after the handover, and the city enjoys high degree of
self autonomy in terms of executing powers of administration,
legislation and management in the economic areana, all of which has
provided legal protection for long-term stability and prosperity
in Hong Kong;
</P>
<P>
Third, the Beijing-Kowloon Railway which has become operational
lately will further extend Hong Kong's connections with the
central and northern provinces, thus bringing about closer trade
ties between these areas, and further enhancing Hong Kong's
position as an entrepot.
</P>
<P>
An noted that after the handover, trade between China's inland
areas and Hong Kong will be treated as one between a country and
its separate customs region, or regarded as a type of foreign
trade relations. And the economic and trade exchanges between the
two will follow international regulations and norms. As a separate
customs region, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will
maintain and develop economic relations with other nations and
regions under the name of Hong Kong, China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, An said, Moftec has worked out a set of basic
principles and policies regarding the economic and trade ties
between Hong Kong and China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The principles and policies stiputlate that the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region shall automatically determine and
execute trade control in accordance with the law; Hong Kongers who
invest in the inland shall enjoy the same treatment as foreign
investors; their permanent offfices established in the inland area
shall be managed in the same way as those owned by foreign
companies; international norms shall be applied to business
disputes that arise between Hong Kong and inland areas.
</P>
<P>
An said that the concerned departments plan to form a
coordinating system to handle economic and trade relations between
Hong Kong and the inland areas after the handover, so as to
facilitate the information exchange, policy adjustment, and
problem solving between the trade management departments of two
sides.
</P>
<P>
An said that the concerned departments have reached a consensus
on the basic principles and methods to be used by the the two
sides when dealing with trade statistics, protection of
intellectual property rights, and Hong Kong's participation in
multilateral international economic activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the China's inland areas will give full support to
Hong Kong's efforts to implement effective market operation and
apply sound legal market system.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Soldiers Detained for Passing Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Eight Sri Lankan Muslim soldiers
have been detained by military authorities for allegedly supplying
information to the Tamil rebels, according to military sources
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the initial arrest was of one Muslim soldier
on the Jaffna Peninsula, who had earlier been attached to the
intelligence wing of the Tamil rebels.
</P>
<P>
He joined the government forces in 1988 and it is believed that
since then he has been supplying to the rebels information about
military movements.
</P>
<P>
The others were arrested following information gathered after
the first arrest, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A rebel attack on a police station at Valachchenai where 50
policemen were killed and another on the Mullaitivu military camp
last year where about 1,200 soldiers died are investigated on the
basis of information supplied by these soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The sources said they had also given information to the rebels
about the locations of fresh supplies of arms and ammunition, as a
result of which attacks were launched on these locations and large
quantities of arms and ammunition were lost.
</P>
<P>
The on-going "Jaya Sikuru" (Certain Victory) operation had been
severely hampered because of the information passed on to the
rebels by these soldiers, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Population Growth Rate Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of
Brazil's population dropped from 1.93 percent in 1991 to 1.3
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a census taken last year by the Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics (Ibge), the population last
year was 156.8 million.
</P>
<P>
The reduction was mainly the result of a decease in the
reproduction rate of Brazilian women, which was down from 5.4
children per woman in 1965 to 2.7 in 1990, say Ibge experts.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend began at the end of the 1950s, when the
population in Brazil was growing at an average rate of 2.99
percent a year. It reduced to 2.89 percent in the 1960s and 2.48
percent in the 1970s.

<HEADLINE> OSPAAAL Appeals for End to U.S. Embargo to Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Solidarity of
the Peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America (OSPAAAL) today
called on the international community to urge the United States to
end its economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
An OSPAAL document published in Havana said the embargo caused
indignation, made all the more profound by subsequent
modifications by the Helms-Burton Law.
</P>
<P>
The United States' Helms-Burton Act, of March 1996, allows
naturalized U.S. citizens to sue foreign firms or individuals
suspected of profiting from disputed properties in Cuba. It bars
executives of these companies from entering the United States.
</P>
<P>
The act sparked complaints from across the world, especially
the European Union (EU), which insisted the law was a violation of
the free trade principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The EU threatened to complain against the U.S. to the WTO
before the bloc reached agreement with the U.S. in April.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the EU suspended the complaint while the
Clinton administration promised to work with Congress to protect
European companies from the trade sanctions in the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The OSPAAAL warned that the Helms-Burton Act contradicts White
House' policy of defense of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The new anti-Cuban measures forecast bigger sanctions against
those who want to do business with the island. The law hardened
the embargo applied by the United States against Cuba since the
1960s, the OSPAAL said.

RIO DE JANEIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will test fire its
first satellite launch vehicle -- a rocket booster -- next month,
senior space official Hugo Pereria Chaves said.
</P>
<P>
Chaves, director of the Aeronautics and Space Institute, said
the Alcantara launch center in the northeastern state of Maranhao

quoted as saying by media reports published here today.
</P>
<P>
The rocket, capable of lifting payloads of 100 to 350 kilograms
into orbits 250 to 1,000 kilometers above the earth, will be used
to deploy data-gathering remote sensing satellites.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, believed to be the only space-faring nation in Latin
America, has launched several satellites over past years by using
rockets or launch services provided by other countries.

BANGKOK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Office of Atomic Energy
for Peace (OAEP) Thursday concluded a contract with a U.S. company
to build the country's first nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
The 3.3-billion-baht (132 million U.S. dollars) deal was made
by the OAEP with the General Atomic Corporation after months of
delay due to concerns over safety, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, the OAEP insisted that the construction of the reactor
will begin only after Thailand secures a safety analysis report
for the project from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission or a
neutral international nuclear institute.
</P>
<P>
The 10-megawatt nuclear reactor reportedly will be installed in
Nakhon Mayok Province's Ongkharak Nuclear Research Center to
produce radioactive isotopes for research, medical and food
preservation purposes.
</P>
<P>
A nuclear waste treatment facility would also be built in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The design of the whole project will cover a period of two
years under the contract.

JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
foreseen a drop in state-approved foreign investment for the 1997
calendar year from the 1996 figure of 29.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>

dollars in the first five months of the year, a decline of 25.5
percent from a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loan Aids China's Essential Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is providing 830
million US dollars in loans for the two infrastructure projects in
China, according to today's "China Daily."
</P>
<P>
The bank's board approved a 430 million US dollars loan to the
Xiaolangdi Multipurpose Project Second Stage and another 400
million US dollars lending program to the Shanghai Waigaoqiao
Thermal Power Project.
</P>
<P>
The gigantic Xiaolangdi project was designed to provide flood
protection for 103 million people in rural areas, cities and major
industrial areas along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The newly approved credit from the bank will be used for the
construction of a dam and hydroelectric power plant of the river
and further the government's work in water resources schemes.
</P>
<P>
While the Xiaolangdi project will benefit mainly rural
development, the Waigaoqiao project is designed to break the power
bottleneck for Shanghai, China's most important industrial city.
</P>
<P>
The 1.9 billion thermal power project will provide the Shanghai
Municipal Electric Power Co. with two large coal-fired super
critical thermal units for its Waigaoqiao plant, equipped with
performance monitoring systems which will minimize coal
consumption and gradually introduce advanced maintenance
techniques, the paper says.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Re-entry Into Andean Community Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Peru is satisfied over the
negotiations for its re-entry into the Andean Community.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Farah, president of the Peruvian National Society of
Industries, said today that re-entry would be beneficial for the
country.
</P>
<P>
Peru's position had been strengthened in recent years of
negotiations following its decision to withdraw from the community
in 1992, said Farah.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Economy Minister Jorge Camet announced that Peru
would possibly return to the community.
</P>
<P>
If its re-entry is approved, Peru will be allowed to
participate in the Andean Community's negotiations with the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur), the European Union, and other
economic organizations, said Farah.
</P>
<P>
The Andean Community nows groups Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and
Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> 36 Percent of Chinese Urban Families May Buy Cars in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 36 percent of Chinese urban
families might buy cars in three years, the Ministry of Civil
Affairs said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey conducted by the ministry early this
year, 64 percent of these families will choose to buy Chinese-made
cars, most of which are manufactured at foreign-funded plants.
</P>
<P>
As for imported cars, the majority of the respondents said that
the Korean-made Dawoo is the most popular model on the Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
The survey targeted 4,600 citizens in 31 major cities,
representing a total population of 350 million.
</P>
<P>
For Chinese, the most well-known imported car is the Mercedes
Benz, the survey shows. When asked what brands they prefer to buy,
the respondents said their first choice is the Jetta -- the
Chinese version of the German-made Volkswagen. Other favorites
include the Sino-German made Santana, the Sino-French Fukang,
Dawoo, the Sino-US made Cherokee, and the Red Flag.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the first factor Chinese consider when
buying a car is the price, followed by its safety and follow-up
services provided by the dealer.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe there will be some 1.3 to 1.5 million cars
owned by Chinese families by the end of the century. More cars
will be bought by ordinary citizens than for government use.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President: No Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
stressed that his country will never establish diplomatic
relations with Israel unless a just and lasting solution has been
found to the Arab-Israel conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is concerned about the deadlock in the Middle East
peace process," the president said at a banquet last night in
honor of Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Al-Zoubi, who arrived here
on Thursday for a five-day state visit to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said his country is concerned because the Israeli
government has still not carried out the various U.N. resolutions
on the conflict nor the land-for-peace principle agreed upon by
all sides during the Madrid conference in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli occupation of Arab territories is obviously
illegal and constitutes a new form of colonialism and racialism
which are against our constitution," Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to return occupied Arab territories such as
Syria's Golan Heights, southern Lebanon, Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, the president said geographically Syria
and Indonesia are situated far away from each other, "but Syria is
not alien to Indonesia. In 1947, Syria was the third country to
recognize Indonesia's independence and sovereignty," Soeharto
noted.
</P>
<P>
Official sources here said Soeharto and the Syrian prime
minister will hold a 90-minute meeting this morning and then they
will witness the signing of a number of accords between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Worries About Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto has
expressed concern over the great number of teenagers addicted to
opium despite the government's efforts to keep them from drug
abuse.
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt that drug abuse can threaten the existence
of nations, human beings and cultures," the president said
Thursday in his written address on the U.N. resolution declaring
June 26 as the world anti-drug day.
</P>
<P>
Official sources today quoted the president as saying the
government has taken various measures to check drug abuse but the
problem remains.
</P>
<P>
"No nation is currently free from the abuse of these dangerous
drugs. The syndicate of drug trafficking is growing and moving
smartly in all aspects of life," he said, adding that many drug
traffickers have actually been seized and got severe punishment
but the activities continued.
</P>
<P>
"The government is very concerned about the misuse of opium. We
have signed the U.N. convention on the eradication of illegal
psychotropic and narcotic trafficking. We have also have narcotic
and psychotropic laws," he added.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Nations to Obey Official Ceiling on Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- OPEC member nations have promised
to maintain the current official oil production ceiling of 25.03
million barrels a day in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
A communique released here today after a ministerial meeting of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said all
of its 11 members agreed to abide by their individual quotas.
</P>
<P>
OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman said he was confident
that efforts will be made to rein in production.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, some member nations were criticized for their
overproduction. Experts estimated that OPEC's real daily output is
around 27 million barrels, 2 million above its official ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Since early this year, average oil price on the world market
has dropped from 25 U.S. dollars a barrel to the present level of
about 18 dollars a barrel, well below OPEC's target of 21 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Due to sufficient oil reserves in Europe and the competition of
non-OPEC nations, the group's members have no better way to
stabilize oil prices except the strict control of overproduction.
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting, Qatar's Energy and Industry Minister
Abdullah Bin Hamad Al-Attiya was chosen as OPEC's president for
the next six months to replace Libyan Energy Minister Abdalla
Salem El-Badri.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC meeting opened here Wednesday and ended today. The
next meeting will be in Jakarta, Capital of Indonesia, in November.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Foreign Reserves Drop in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's foreign reserves were
posted at 33.3 billion U.S. dollars in May this year, down 4
billion dollars from April, according to the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the figure, made public along with other economic
indicators by the central bank today, was better than expected.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was widely anticipated that the country's foreign
reserves would fall to around 30 billion dollars in May from 37.3
billion dollars in April, as the central bank spent heavily to
defend the baht from attacks by currency speculators.
</P>
<P>
Some company managers said the 33.3 billion dollars in foreign
reserves would mean that the central bank's position is still
strong and can effectively cope with any further attacks on the
currency.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's foreign reserves were at 38.1 billion dollars in
March this year.

<HEADLINE> Nine Wounded at Election Rally in Albania (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were wounded by gunfire
on Thursday during an election rally of the ruling Democratic
Party in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The shooting broke out when President Sali Berisha began to
address a crowd of several hundred, which included a few of his
supporters, in Lushnje, about 80 kilometers south of the capital
Tirana, says an AFP report.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party officials immediately blamed the opposition
for the violence.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the gunfire apparently came from both
sides. Berisha had tried in vain to appeal for calm before he left
the city.
</P>
<P>
However, the shooting did not affect his another rally in
Kavaja, a city to the southwest of Tirana, which is a stronghold
of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have occurred in Albania, especially in the south, as
the Sunday legislative election approaches. The election is
regarded as the last chance to restore peace in this troubled
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Protests broke out against Berisha last March when many people
found they had been cheated of the life savings by a failed
get-rich-quick scheme.
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has
sent observers to Albania to oversee the elections.

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary: Make Alarm Bell A Reminder (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- At the moment when the Hong Kong
handover ceremony starts at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center on July 1, the sky over the motherland will be
resounded with the solemn sound of a bell in Jinghai Temple in
Nanjing where the humiliating "Treaty of Nanking" was drafted
century and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
The bell will sound 155 times to mark the end of 155-year
humiliation sustained by the Chinese people and remind the people
not to forget the past.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 years ago, Britain launched one of the world's
dirtest wars against China and occupied Hong Kong for its opium
trade. China's resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty over
Hong Kong, erasing the last traces of disgrace, means a victory of
justice and human progress.
</P>
<P>
The whole process of settling the Hong Kong issue -- from the
change of attitude on the British part from persisting in the
three unequal treaties to accepting China's plan and the many
events that occurred after 1989 -- involved a stern trial of
national strength. Just as Deng Xiaoping once said, the Hong Kong
issue can be settled mainly because China has developed to become
a strong and trustworthy country in the world.
</P>
<P>
The period from 1840 and 1949 is both a history of humiliation
in which the Chinese suffered untold sufferings from imperialist
aggression and a history of struggle against foreign aggression by
the Chinese people. During the period, from the burning of opium
by Lin Zexu, the battle against British invaders waged by the
people in Sanyuanli in suburban Guangzhou to the eight-year war of
resisting Japanese aggression and the war to resist US aggression
and aid Korea, countless sons and daughters of the Chinese nation
laid down their lives for safeguarding independence of the
motherland, the dignity of the nation and sovereignty of the state.
</P>
<P>
Sounding of the bell is exactly for the purpose of letting the
people engrave in their minds and carry forward the spirit of
sacrifice for the motherland and calling on the Chinese Communist
Party members to become exemplars of the nation and patriotism in
the new historical period.

BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng presided
over a welcoming ceremony at the square to the east of the Great
Hall of the People this morning in honor of Russian Prime Minister
Victor Chernomyrdin, who arrived in Beijing Thursday evening on a
three-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the ceremony were Li's wife Zhu Lin,
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, Head of the Chinese Government Reception
Committee and Minister in Charge of the State Planning Commission

<HEADLINE> Xinhua commentary: Make Alarm Bell A Reminder (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The world is in for a crucial historical period. While
multi-polarization is becoming an irresistible trend, hegemonism
and power politics still dominate the world.
</P>
<P>
China, still in the initial phase of socialism, is focusing on
economic development and carrying on with reform and opening up
while persisting in the four cardinal principles in line with Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, thus greatly boosting its comprehensive national
strength.
</P>
<P>
Still, China is a developing country, falling far behind
developed countries in terms of economic strength. Facing the
reality that some people in the west have never given up their
attempt to contain China and overthrow China's socialism, it is a
long term task to ward off interference by all kinds of forces and
maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity after its returns
and it still requires arduous efforts to settle Macao issue and
Taiwan issue according to the principle of "peaceful reunification
and one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
The sounding of the bell in Jinghai Temple is exactly for the
purpose of alerting the people to danger in time of peace,
stressing the necessity of education in patriotism and socialism
and the importance of enhancing the rallying power of the nation
and making the country powerful and strong by following Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics so as to make China always stand aloft among the
forest of nations in the world.
</P>
<P>
"it is a century's wish to make the country strong and the
people wealthy; the future is bright; may the great cause be
carried forward from generation to generation." This part of the
inscription on the bell in Jinghai Temple is very encouraging. Let
the bell always ring in our minds and encourage us to hold aloft
the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, safeguard independence of the
nation, build a powerful and prosperous country and strengthen
friendship and cooperation with the people in the other parts of
the world so as to make our new constributions to building a just
and reasonable new international order and creating a more
beautiful world.

<HEADLINE> Economic Ties between Inland Area and Hong Kong to be Further Enhanced after Handover: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- After the July 1 handover of Hong
Kong, trade cooperation between China's inland area and Hong Kong
can be extended to "wider fields" within the framework of one
country, said a senior official with China's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec).
</P>
<P>
An Min, assistant minister of Moftec, told Xinhua in a recent
interview that retaining Hong Kong's current kingpin status in the
international trade arena after the handover is in the best
interests of both the motherland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has thus far determined that the
mainstay of its trade policy regarding Hong Kong is maintaining
and enhancing Hong Kong's stance as an international trading,
finance, navigation and information center," he noted.
</P>
<P>
An said that China's opening-up drive in the early 1980s
started a new chapter of trade cooperation between the inland area
and Hong Kong, which are now not only partners in trade but also
in investment and other forms of economic exchange, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the General Administration of
Customs, the total trade volume between the inland area and Hong
Kong last year hit 40.7 billion US dollars, or 15 times the amount
in 1978. Hong Kong is now the biggest export destination and third
biggest trade partner of the inland area.
</P>
<P>
"The trade volume between the inland area and Hong Kong in the
first four months of this year topped 14.1 billion dollars,
keeping its upward trend," An added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hong Kong is the main source of inflowing capital
to the inland area. Between 1979 and 1996, Hong Kong investors
registered a total 160,000 projects in the inland, with an
aggregate contractual investment of 260 billion dollars. Of this
amount, some 99 billion dollars have been used.
</P>
<P>
Projects involving Hong Kong financing and those with
actually-used Hong Kong investment accounted for more than 60
percent of the total in the inland area. "In the first quarter of
this year, an additional 1,720 Hong Kong-funded projects were
registered in the inland area and some 3.593 billion dollars from
Hong Kong investors had been used," An said.
</P>
<P>
An said that the compatibility of the economies in the inland
area and Hong Kong helped to form the mutually-beneficial trade
ties. "After the handover, the trade links will become more
direct, convenient and closer than ever," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises Action on Earth Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- United States President
Bill Clinton told the United Nations Earth Summit today that his
country would take action to deal with climate change, and would
advance sustainable development at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said his country would provide one billion U.S. dollars
in assistance over the next five years to help developing
countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The fund would go to programs that support energy efficiency,
develop alternative energy sources and improve resources
management to promote growth that does not adversely affect the
climate.
</P>
<P>
The president said the U.S. would continue to encourage private
investment that meets environmental standards. The U.S. Overseas
Private Investment Corporation would now require its projects to
adhere to new and strengthened environmental guidelines.
</P>
<P>
At home, Clinton said, the U.S. must unleash more of the
creative power of its people to meet the challenge of climate
change.
</P>
<P>
The United States was working with its auto industry to produce
cars by early next century that would be three times as fuel
efficient as today's models.
</P>
<P>
It would also work with businesses and communities to install
solar panels on one million roofs around the country by 2010 to
help reduce the earth's temperature.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been under attacks at the summit for
refusing to set targets to cut global warming, and for reducing
funds for ecological projects.

<P>
Washington, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Two-time Olympic kayaker
Richard Weiss was drowned in an accident on the White Salmon River
on Wednesday, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Weiss, who finished sixth in the slalom in the Atlanta Games
and 16th at Barcelona, failed to surface Wednesday after he went
over a 15-foot waterfall in the river, south of the town of Trout
Lake.
</P>
<P>
A friend who was kayaking with Weiss tried to find him in the
water, then went for help. A kayak team statement said Weiss was
wearing a life jacket and helmet.
</P>
<P>
Weiss moved to nearby Hood River, Oregon after the 1996
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Originally from Steamboat Springs, Colorado, Weiss, 33, and his
wife Rosi were expecting their first child this fall.
</P>
<P>
The White Salmon is a popular river for kayaking and was
running high because of the spring runoff.
</P>
<P>
Weiss won the slalom Olympic trials last year and was selected
the kayak team's slalom male athlete of the year.
</P>
<P>
He became the first American to medal in men's kayak at a world
championship when he won the silver medal in 1993 in Italy. He was
third overall in the World Cup standings in 1991.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: NZ Budget Triggers Debate on Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Delivering the government
budget each year is a usual business in New Zealand. What makes it
different this year is that the budget was not announced by the
finance minister as in the past, but by the new treasurer, a post
created after the National Party and the New Zealand First party
formed the country's first coalition government late last year.
</P>
<P>
Not only the person who delivered the budget changed, but the
focus of the financial document also shifted. The past National
government put emphasis on increasing budget surplus and paying
off government debt. This year, the budget lays stress on boosting
government spending instead, in the fields of health, education
and social welfare in particular.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the budget in the parliament yesterday, Treasurer
Winston Peters said the budget "shows our commitment to delivering
on the Coalition Agreement promises in health, education,
employment, safer communities, the environment, saving for
retirement and to older New Zealanders."
</P>
<P>
But the cost to keep the promises is an extra spending of 5
billion NZ dollars (3.4 billion U.S. dollars) in the coming three
years and falling government surplus, which has been on the rise
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The budget reported a surplus of 2.4 billion dollars for the
1996/97 year. But the surplus is projected to slip to 1.5 billion
dollars in the coming year and will not recover to the present
level until 1999/2000.
</P>
<P>
The budget seems to contain little to inspire the business
circles, whose confidence has been on the decline since the
formation of the coalition government alongside a slowdown in
economic growth. Business people fear that increased spending on
social welfare, health and education will weaken the government's
financial position and bring about a negative impact on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Describing his budget as "conservative" and "prudent," Peters
tried to allay the concern of the business people by stating that
the government's intention is to stay within the 5 billion dollar
spending limit.
</P>
<P>
The budget has satisfied none of the opposition parties.
Despite more money for health and education, the Labor Party said
the budget "has ignored the wider challenges in the health and
education sectors."
</P>
<P>
The ACT party has criticized the government from the other end,
saying "New Zealand needs a tax cut now." It argues that canceling
tax cuts last year destroyed consumer confidence and so undermined
job growth and caused the present economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
However, Peters maintains his optimism. He predicted that the
economic growth will rebound toward the end of this year and
strengthen in 1998/99. In the year to March 1999, the economy
will grow 4.2 percent, he said in the budget.

<HEADLINE> A-maizing Black Corn Arrives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Two new varieties of black maize,
which were named "Black Pearl" and "Black Guanyin," have been
successfully bred by a Chinese amateur agro-technician in the city
of Liaoyang, Liaoning Province, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
After 10 years of effort, Wang Litian -- a traditional Chinese
painter -- fostered the two variations of maize or corn through
the method of hybridization.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held by the China Land Economy Research Society
(CLERS) on Wednesday, several agricultural professors and
economists in Beijing said the two kinds of black maize, with
better taste and nutritive value than the traditional ear of corn,
will suffice to meet the demands of most people.
</P>
<P>
In addition to niacin and several trace elements such as
calcium, iron and selenium, the two kinds of black maize contain
0.373 grams of lysine per 100 grams, which is 0.123 grams more
than ordinary yellow corn, according to a report by the Nutrition
and Food Hygiene Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of
Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The development of agriculture in some poor and remote areas
should rely on high-quality and improved breeds of crops in
accordance with the market-oriented economy, said Du Runsheng,
former director of the Research Center of Rural Development of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
The two kinds of valuable maize can help farmers in remote
regions of north China and northeast China to extricate themselves
from poverty and promote the development of local rural economies,
said Lin Jingyao, deputy director of the Environment and
Development Committee of the CLERS.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 26 (Xinhua) -- High temperatures in Mexico's
northern states have caused the death of at least 33 persons so
far this summer, according to official counts available today.
</P>
<P>
The highest temperatures registered by now -- 44.6 and 43.6
degrees centigrade -- are those of El Organo and El Altar areas in
the state of Sonora, the National Commission of Water reported.
</P>
<P>
The dry and very hot air in the country's northeast, north and
southeast was caused by high pressure systems on the Pacific Ocean
and the Gulf of Mexico, said the National Meteorological Service.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, Livestock and Rural Development Minister Francisco
Labastida Ochoa said his ministry is ready to give more support to
farmers trying to solve problems caused by the high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
To prevent dehydration, residents in the affected areas have
been instructed to give food and drinks to children under five,
who are known to be the most vulnerable to the heat, said Ochoa.

MADRID, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Spain rallied from behind to upset
fancied Croatia 78-71 for the first surprise in the European
basketball championship in Genora on Thursday .

The win awarded the hosts a place in the second phase as three
top teams in each group advance further.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania and Greece also went through after notching up their
second victories in tough games against France and Russia
respectively,
</P>
<P>
Croatia finished the first half with a four-point advantage,
but Spain turned the table through naturalized American Mike Smith.
</P>
<P>
Despite the defeat, Croatia was almost certain to go through,
as only the bottom team from each group will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Greece started strongly to build up a commanding 39-21 lead
against Russia before Russian Igor Koudelin scored consecutive
three-pointers to narrow the gap to 10 points at the break.

Finally, the Greeks struggled to take the game 74-72.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania was once again led by Arturas Karnisovas in the 94-88

<HEADLINE> Southwest China New Attraction for Hong Kong Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, the fourth
province-level municipality approved by China's National People's
Congress, has become a new attraction for Hong Kong investors.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has had 1.52 billion US dollars in Hong Kong
investment and has approved 1,061 Hong Kong-funded companies,
which account for half of the overseas-backed companies in the
city.
</P>
<P>
The sectors favored by Hong Kong business people are
transportation, food processing, real estate, textiles, chemical
industry and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the largest transit center for Chongqing's foreign
trade, and is the leading buyer of the city's machinery,
instruments, and medical products.
</P>
<P>
Because of the flourishing trade, Hong Kong companies have a
big share of Chongqing's electronics, printing equipment,
ready-to-wear clothing, toys, and food markets.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the increasingly extensive economic ties,
Chongqing, with its natural resources and labor, and Hong Kong,
with its advantages in international trade, should go farther and
form a reciprocal economic relationship, economists say.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing government has worked out a development strategy
for promoting bilateral trade, aimed at extending the market to
Southeast Asia and South Asia via Hong Kong.

<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Bright prospects for foreign trade
development and a more open financial sector in China are
anticipated by senior Chinese officials, today's "China Daily"
reports.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quotes Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation as saying that on the
basis of sharp tariff cuts last year, China will make greater
efforts to bring the general level of its tariff rate to 15
percent by 2000, further reducing non-tariff measures, and open
its service trade market.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that in 2000, China's imports and exports will
total 400 billion US dollars, indicating that in the coming four
years, China will provide the world with a market of nearly 700
billion US dollars and with trade opportunities worth 1,400
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, actual overseas investment in China had hit
over 177 billion US dollars and over 140,000 overseas-funded
ventures had gone into operation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign financial institutions in China will gradually be
granted national status treatment instead of the low tax rate
preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
At present foreign financial institutions, both in number and
business scope, have become an important part of China's financial
system, the paper says.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukrain's Foreign Minister
Hennadi Udovenko today criticized the world's leading
industrialized nations for not honoring their promises to help his
country from the 1986 nuclear disaster at Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
"We are still victims of Chernobyl. We deal with all problems
alone, without any substantial financial assistance," Udovenko
said at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The Ukraine foreign minister is attending the five-day Earth
Summit at the United Nations headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said that the world's industrial giants have been slow
in providing technical advice and financial assistance to
Chernobyl, where a reactor exploded, killing 32 people within
months and sending a radioactive cloud over Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine officials said at the Earth Summit that their country
spends some 1 billion U.S. dollars a year to minimize the impact
of the Chernobyl explosion, the world's worst nuclear accident.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Open UN-Sponsored Cyprus Talks Near New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan will open the forthcoming talks of
the leaders of the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities near New
York, U.N. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
After the opening session, Annan will hand over the presidency
of the talks to his special adviser for Cyprus, Diego Cordovez, a
former Ecuadorean foreign minister, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides, who
heads the Greek Cypriot community, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash will be held at a resort and conference center called
Troutbeck, about 90 miles north of New York.
</P>
<P>
Norway will pick up the bill for the U.N.-sponsored talks
scheduled for July 9-13, a member of the Norwegian mission to the
United Nations said.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the encounter between Clerides and Denktash is
expected to be between 30,000 and 40,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Norway also provided facilities for ground-breaking talks in
Oslo in 1993 between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to contribute to an effort by the
secretary-general to get talks going between the two parties on
Cyprus," the Norwegian official told reporters.

<HEADLINE> US Says It Finds No Laser on Russian Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States today said an
investigation had failed to confirm its suspicion that a Russian
ship fired laser at a Canadian helicopter off the U.S. coast,
injuring a U.S. Navy lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
"There is no physical evidence tying the eye injury of the
American officer to a laser located on the Russian merchant
vessel," said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
He said no laser had been found, but insisted again that the
temporary eye injuries were "consistent with injuries that would
be expected from exposure to a low-level laser, such as a laser
range-finder for example."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. said in May that the Russian fishing ship Kapitan Man
may have illuminated the Canadian military helicopter with a laser
in Puget Sound, off the State of Washington.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said privately last month that the Russian
ship was suspected of spying on U.S. submarines and that the
CH-124 Canadian Maritime Pacific Command helicopter was taking
photographs of the ship in daylight.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government and the ship's captain denied that
a laser was used, and a U.S. Coast Guard search of the Kapitan
Man at Tacoma, Washington, three days after the incident found
no laser device aboard.
</P>
<P>
"We found actually no suggestion that there had been a laser on
board the ship or that the source of the laser, if a laser caused
these injuries, no suggestion that the laser emanated from that
ship," Bacon told reporters.

<HEADLINE> US Experts Urge Clinton to Stop NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Forty-six U.S. foreign policy
experts and former officials today urged President Bill Clinton to
stop expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to Clinton, the group said that NATO
expansion would delay approval of arms-control treaties with
Russia, divide Europe and reduce NATO's military effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Among signatories of the letter are Sam Nunn, ex-chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee; two recent ambassadors to the
Soviet Union, Jack Matlock and Arthur Hartman, and former Central
Intelligence Agency Director Stansfield Turner.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the 16-member NATO will meet in the Spanish
capital of Madrid on July 8-9 to discuss plans to expand the
16-member alliance into Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, Clinton announced U.S. support for Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic to join the alliance, and invitations are
expected to be issued at the Madrid summit.
</P>
<P>
The European members of NATO also expressed their support for
Romania and Slovenia to join.
</P>
<P>
"The current U.S.-led effort to expand NATO is a policy error
of historic proportions," said the anti-expansion letter,
stressing that NATO has no reason to move quickly.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that NATO expansion will decrease allied security
and unsettle European stability," said the letter. "We believe
that NATO expansion is neither necessary nor desirable, and this
ill-conceived policy can and should be put on hold."
</P>
<P>
The letter proposed promoting membership in the European Union
for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, developing NATO's
Partnership for Peace program and concentrating on nuclear weapons
reduction, which it called the main threat to U.S. security.

<HEADLINE> Mackey to Lead 2nd Oklahoma Bombing Trial Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Larry Mackey, the prosecutor
who was instrumental in persuading a federal jury to sentence
Timothy McVeigh to death, will lead the prosecution team for the
second Oklahoma City bombing suspect, Terry Nichols.
</P>
<P>
Mackey, 46, has been a federal prosecutor since 1980.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh was condemned earlier this month on conviction of
murder and conspiracy in the April 19, 1995 Oklahoma bombing that
killed 168.
</P>
<P>
Nichols, 41, faces murder and conspiracy charges and is
expected to be tried this year, although no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno called Mackey an "experienced trial
lawyer" and an "accomplished leader" today in announcing Mackey's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
Mackey was deputy prosecutor in the McVeigh trial. In addition
to the closing argument, he helped lead prosecutor Joseph Hartzler
with trial strategy, jury selection, witness questioning and case
management.
</P>
<P>
Hartzler announced long before the McVeigh trial that he would
handle no other trials connected with the bombing. He has returned
to his job as an assistant U.S. attorney in Springfield, Illinois.
