YOUTH IS TRULY KING IN WISCONSIN SECONDARY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's no secret that Wisconsin's defense has been a
key ingredient in the Badgers reaching the Rose Bowl and posting a
10-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive strength has been a staple for coach Barry Alvarez in
his best years since arriving at Wisconsin in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the emergence of two redshirt-freshman cornerbacks
and a sophomore free safety has allowed the Badgers even more
latitude on that side of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen Mike Echols and Jamar Fletcher, along with sophomore
Jason Doering have helped Wisconsin hold opponents to a NCAA-best
10.2 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been the difference for us,'' Alvarez said. ``They
have allowed us to do some things that we hadn't been able to do in
the past. We've always been pretty good against the run, but we
were just average, at best, in the secondary. These guys have
really come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Doering and Echols each have three interceptions, while Fletcher
leads the team with six picks, including two returned for
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Alvarez said he knows UCLA's diverse offense will present
a stiff challenge to the entire defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA is so balanced that I don't know if we can overplay the
run or the pass,'' Alvarez said. ``They don't have the type of
tendencies we've been able to see and zero in on against some other
people. We're going to have to play them honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Paint it black: Junior running back Ron Dayne wore a black
practice jersey, normally reserved for injured players and those
who are off-limits from contact, for the second consecutive
Coliseum practice.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said Saturday he is not concerned about Dayne's status
for the game and he reiterated that point Sunday, saying Dayne
would wear the jersey all week and would not be involved in
contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try and see if UCLA will cooperate with us on
that,'' Alvarez said, drawing laughs. ``Really, there's no reason
to hit Ron. It would be kind of foolish to hit him this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayne injured his clavicle in the Badgers' regular-season finale
against Penn State and missed the season opener against San Diego
State because of an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Stunt double: Freshman Brooks Bollinger has been playing the
role of Cade McNown during practices, but Alvarez realizes the
difficulty in trying to imitate UCLA's All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't simulate what they're going to see in that game with
NcNown, although Brooks does move around pretty well and I think he
gives us good looks sprinting out of the pocket and running
bootlegs,'' Alvarez said. ``But you really can't simulate it with
the accuracy they're going to see on Friday.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
In what he called ``an attempt to salvage the season,'' NBA
commissioner David Stern met with Billy Hunter, executive director
of the National Basketball Players Association, on Sunday in
Denver. Stern delivered what a league official labeled ``our final
offer'' during a five-hour meeting, the latest effort to end the
180-day lockout.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But with the NBA's Jan. 7 deadline for a settlement approaching,
Hunter deemed the owners' offer not good enough, increasing the
likelihood that the 1998-99 season will be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   The owners made concessions on five key points of their previous
proposal, specifically addressing union concerns about the
shrinking NBA middle class. It was believed by the league that the
proposal would break the negotiating stalemate and put the two
sides on the road to an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Not so.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say we're done _ we've gone as far as we can go,''
said Jeffrey Mishkin, the league's chief legal officer. ``There
will be no more offers. I have been personally part of NBA
negotiations for 20 years, and I have never seen this kind of
intransigence from the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that (breaking the stalemate) was certainly our hope.
We've gone as far as we can go. We've made our final offer, and
we've given them everything we have. And it was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``That leaves us with virtually no hope for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners' proposal addressed several union concerns,
including:
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the percentage of basketball-related income
devoted to player salaries. The owners' proposal Stern mailed to
every NBA player Dec. 17 contained a projection of BRI to be
devoted to salaries, offering 57 percent in the first year of the
deal, 57.1 percent in the second, 55.8 percent in the third, 52
percent in the fourth, 52.5 percent in the fifth and 53 percent in
the sixth. The owners went up to 53 percent in the fourth year,
53.5 percent in the fifth and 54 percent in the final year.
</P>
<P>
   An increased minimum salary. Their previous proposal offered a
$250,000 minimum contract for players with zero to two years of
experience, $350,000 for players with three to five years of
experience, an additional $50,000 per year for players with six to
nine years of experience and a $1 million minimum for players who
have been in the league for 10 or more years. The owners are now
offering a $275,000 minimum for a first-year free agent, $300,000
for a player with two years of experience, $350,000 for a
third-year player and an additional $50,000 for every year
thereafter. The $1 million minimum for players with 10 or more
years of experience remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   Concessions on the rookie scale. The owners have asked for a
three-year rookie-scale contract, with a team option for a fourth
year. The new proposal contains a clause that offers a 25-percent
salary increase for players who have their option picked up for the
fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   An additional exception to the salary cap, designed to increase
the middle class. The previous proposal included a ``middle-class
exception'' that would be available every year of the deal, worth
$1.5 million in the first year, $1.75 million in the second year,
$2 million in the third year and an amount equal to the average
player salary in the final three years of the deal. The owners
agreed to keep the current $1 million exception as well, which can
be used once every two years and allows a team to exceed the salary
cap to sign a player.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the union's 10-percent limitation on contributions to
the escrow fund, designed as a hedge against salary overspending.
The owners were initially asking for the players to contribute an
unlimited percentage but dropped that demand to 15 percent in
subsequent offers. The players have been insisting on no more than
10 percent, and the owners conceded this point.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter and the players, who reportedly conceded unspecified
salary restrictions on players with up to nine years of experience,
apparently still want more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, this was not enough for the union,'' said Stern
of the owners' proposal. ``We advised the union that no further
offers from the NBA would be made.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter feels otherwise, apparently hoping for more negotiations.
However, no talks have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered a comprehensive proposal to the NBA,'' Hunter said.
``The NBA countered our proposal, and we indicated to them that we
were willing to negotiate further, which unfortunately they were
unwilling to do at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the NBA assures there will be no further concessions. The
union's response left many in the league office shaking their
heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot explain it,'' Mishkin said. ``After this proposal,
it's clear that the offer that we made is more than fair to all the
players and, I think, meets the needs that we've heard about. I
cannot explain why it was rejected, but it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made them our final offer, and they've rejected it.
We've done the best we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter will discuss the proposal with the union today. Mishkin
said that after Hunter turned down the offer, he doubted Hunter
would recommend it for a vote of the union rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Mishkin said. ``He (Hunter) has said publicly
that if he and the negotiating committee don't think it's a good
deal, whatever that means, he won't put it to a vote. There's no
reason to think he's changed his mind. But there will be no more
offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Several agents think the two sides are only a couple of issues
apart, the biggest being a so-called franchise-player designation
that would allow teams to offer any player, regardless of
experience, a salary worth 35 percent of the cap.
</P>
<P>
   As the owners' offer stands, only players with a minimum of 10
years of experience would be eligible for the maximum salary
allowable, a seven-year deal worth 35 percent of the salary cap.
Players with less experience _ zero to six years and seven to nine
years _ would be eligible for maximums of 25 percent and 30 percent
of the cap, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Agents are concerned that few 10-year veterans would receive the
highest-paid seven-year deals, so they would like to expand the
number of players eligible for the 35-percent salary slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to give (San Antonio's) Tim Duncan what he's worth
10 years from now?'' said one agent. ``The only guy who would fit
in that (category) is Scottie Pippen, and I'm not sure somebody
would (pay him 35 percent of the cap).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that (the franchise-player designation) would be huge.
I think that would show them (the players) that they protected the
little guy by changing the minimum, they protected the middle class
by adding another exception, and then they protected the superstars
by not limiting it (the 35-percent cap salary) to a 10-year
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for Sunday's meeting weren't finalized until Saturday
night. The league was represented by Stern, deputy commissioner
Russ Granik and special assistant Bob Lanier. The union was
represented by Hunter, president Patrick Ewing and chief outside
lawyer Jeffrey Kessler.

GIBSON IS ONE BIG BADGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At school, on the street, at the mall or anywhere
he's out and about, people never stop marveling at Aaron Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that, according to the experts, he will be a
first-round NFL draft pick this spring. It's his sheer size that
makes that all-important first impression on anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Six feet, seven inches. Three-hundred and seventy-one pounds.
</P>
<P>
   And Gibson, a soft-spoken, introspective sort who only now is
beginning to fulfill his potential as a player, doesn't mind the
attention one bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never gets old,'' Gibson said. ``It never will.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the gawkers are those in the know in football who can't
say enough about Wisconsin's right tackle, who also happens to be
the largest player you will find on any NCAA football roster.
</P>
<P>
   Draft guru Mel Kiper Jr. says Gibson is one of the nation's top
three line prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson also was the nation's only player to be named a finalist
for the Lombardi Award and the Outland Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   He can bench press 475 pounds, squat 745, has a vertical leap of
31.5 inches, can dunk a basketball and can do the splits (he won a
locker-room bet with some teammates a while back).
</P>
<P>
   This past spring, Gibson earned a perfect score of 8.0 from the
National Football Scouting combine, after performing a series of
agility drills and physical tests.
</P>
<P>
   And to think that Gibson, a senior with a 47{-inch waist and
size-19 shoe, has played just three seasons for the Badgers after
being ruled academically ineligible as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, he was playing primarily at tight end for us,''
Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez said. ``But every year he gets
better. People recognized him and he was noted for his size. Now,
he's noted for being a good football player, and that's what's
satisfying to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson also is pleased to be receiving the national attention
that has come his way in 1998, but he knows what a long road it was
to reach this destination.
</P>
<P>
   Recruited out of Decatur Central High in Indianapolis, Gibson
arrived at the Madison campus weighing a whopping 435 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until this year that Gibson began a season weighing
less than 400 pounds, a significant breakthrough in itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were huge ups and downs,'' Gibson said of his early days
at Wisconsin. ``There were a lot of times where I just gave up on
it and said, `Forget it, I'm not doing it anymore.' But people
talked to me here and got me back. It was just a lot of hard
times.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, fast food and poor eating habits in general were
Gibson's undoing. Those days are far behind him, and he says he
feels like he has reached an optimal weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I could use 10 pounds more off, but not too much more
than that,'' Gibson said. ``Any more and I might start losing
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Although these days Gibson looks like he was born to be an
offensive lineman, football didn't used to be a part of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Before a three-inch, 100-pound growth spurt between his freshman
and sophomore years in high school, Gibson's passion was swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Once his size set in, however, swimming was out and he had to
basically adjust to a new existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a really painful experience,'' said Gibson, who has a
14-year-old brother, Adam, who is 6-5, 320 pounds. ``It hurt (to
grow so quickly) but it just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be too simplistic to say Gibson's growth as a football
player just happened, but Alvarez notices a work ethic in Gibson
that should carry him even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch Gibby at practice, he hangs on every word you
say,'' Alvarez said. ``He's like a sponge. He just loves to be
coached, he wants to get better and he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been around someone as physical or as good as he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the praise, Gibson insists he isn't thinking about
the future, specifically the thought of an NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's there, but I don't think about it,'' Gibson said. ``When
the time comes, I'd just like the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   And who's going to tell him no?

BLAND TOBIN MAKES HIS MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was no Gatorade shower, no drench warfare, but only
because there were no idle moments.
</P>
<P>
   And chaos interrupted the obligatory shoulder ride off the
field, a time when traffic was moving in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Cardinals needed the last play of the last game
in their first century of football to sew this one up.
</P>
<P>
   But ain't that Mr. Beige?
</P>
<P>
   Yet, sometime after doing his side shuffle for the media, after
defending the owner and shrugging off any personal implications,
Vince Tobin let loose. He walked through the locker room shaking
hands, and no defense in the world could stop the smile, one that
leaked out of his face and spread to his ears. And the final hug
was not for his clipboard, but for Jamir Miller, who puffed on a
victory cigar.
</P>
<P>
   He'll never admit it, but Tobin crossed a bridge Sunday, a man
invited to the postseason for the first time as head coach. And
while he'll never be compared to Lombardi, he has proved to be just
what he claims to be _ a good football coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince takes a loss harder than any coach I've ever been
around,'' player personnel boss Bob Ferguson said. ``Sometimes he
looks like road kill on the sidelines. Sometimes it takes all of my
comedy background to pull him around on a Monday morning. Vince
really, really deserved this.''
</P>
<P>
   Really, this was all so symbolic, so typical Tobin. A
fourth-and-inches where his first inclination was to go for the
throat, which he should've, only to second-guess himself. A
decision that allowed San Diego to tie the score, adding kerosene
to the fire of speculation. And, finally, a football team whose
well runs deep, deeper than normally associated with the logo.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is Vince Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our spirituality is sustained by him,'' Simeon Rice said.
``Guys digging deep, guys having the confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   A football team showing one distinct side of Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be the perseverance he's shown,'' Pat Tillman
said. ``He took a team that hasn't done (bleep) for so long and he
kept plugging away. Kept plugging away.''
</P>
<P>
   Football coaches can be a matter of taste, and I like mine to
breathe fire, the kind who can motivate cats to bark and pigs to
fly.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a Tobin specialty. And while you're going to get
plenty of armchair ammunition from this guy, a coach who is
prisoner of his sideline indecision, here's the bottom line:
</P>
<P>
   He never wavered from Jake Plummer, the right move in
retrospect, and his patience has been rewarded. He has brought an
element of stability and an element of discipline to the Cardinals,
a team that is among the least penalized in the league. And he's
delivered an element of professionalism, sorely needed post-Buddy
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where I pause and raise a glass to Vince Tobin:
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, with a .500 team, with injuries decimating the
defense and a season slipping away, he designed a makeshift defense
that single-handedly stymied the Saints. A day when he outcoached
Mike Ditka, his former boss in Chicago. A day when Tobin may have
kept a tenuous season alive.
</P>
<P>
   And last Monday, in the wake of an emotional win over the
Saints, some players grumbled that Tobin was acting too glum. What
he was really doing, however, was bringing them back to ground
level, reminding all that 8-7 was fool's gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably be like that (today),'' Corey Chavous said.
``He'll probably be mad at the defense, and he should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Tobin should've done Sunday night: He should've
strutted into the media room and told Arizona it had a winner in
town. He should've worn a T-shirt that read, ``How Ya Like Me
Now?'' He should've brought the mascot with him, offering the bird
to all his critics.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not his style, nor will it ever be. Which is fine,
because on this night, in this season, with this team, there's
nothing wrong with a shade of bland. Not when it takes you to
Dallas. &QL;

BRONCOS' ROMP SHOWS HOW FAR SEAHAWKS HAVE TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Maybe the Seahawks are close to being contenders.
Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The talent-laden roster is richer than a Christmas ham, so the
inclination might be to stay the course. Try again. Better luck
next time.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there will be some who can spin the 8-8 season that
coach Dennis Erickson and his staff coaxed from these high-priced
Seahawks as an indication that things aren't so broke that they
need radical fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Those would be the people who did not see what took place Sunday
in Denver. Those would be the people who did not see a reigning
Super Bowl champion down on its luck rise to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Broncos met the cynics and naysayers head on. The
difference between a winning franchise and a confused franchise was
on display.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the fourth quarter, with the ball on the Seahawk 1-yard
line, John Elway took the snap. The Broncos quarterback had Terrell
Davis directly behind him. The reigning Super Bowl MVP was working
on a 2,000-yard rushing record, and the delirious Mile High Stadium
crowd was begging for Davis to carry the ball, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   But Elway did not hand off to the train of a running back so
aptly named ``T.D.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Elway started to roll to his right. The Seahawk pass
rush was nowhere to be found, so for one crystal clear moment, it
was conceivable that the 38-year-old Elway was going to keep
rolling and take the ball in for the score, all by himself, much to
the delight of the success-drunk crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But Elway did not run. Instead, streaking across the end zone
was No. 84 _ a big man, big hands, big target.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Sharpe was slanting right, his feet pitter-pattering
across the white letter ``O'' in B-R-O-N-C-O-S. Nary a Seahawk
defender was near Sharpe, so naturally Elway the slinger did the
right thing. He side-armed the ball into Sharpe's arms. Touchdown
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Elway pumped his fists. Sharpe did another touchdown dance. And
the formerly 13-0, bound-for-history Broncos were back on track,
crushing the poor souls who stood in their reigning Super Bowl
champion way.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, those poor onlookers were the Seahawks, losers 28-21,
although the final score says nothing of the gross disparity
between them and the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Those poor onlookers were a collection of talented, confused,
proud, embarrassed and hungry Seahawks who refuse to believe that
their .500 season is a true reflection of their talent.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they refused to accept that this same
disappointment will be repeated next season. In 1999, the Hawks
want to party like the Broncos are doing again this season.
</P>
<P>
   If it means a change at the top, then the Seahawk players are
willing to accept that. In fact, they say they would like the
change to come sooner rather than later. Sooner, as in this week.
Sooner, as in Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is going to be a change, let's get it done now,''
Michael Sinclair said, although he was not publicly campaigning for
the firing of his coach. He was merely campaigning for the
direction to be set _ now _ eliminating the months of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks just want to win. In fact, from the sound of their
postseason comments, they are dying to win. They just need some
tools to work through those tough games against Pittsburgh or
Denver. They need some guarantees that there will be no more
implosions against Oakland or Dallas or Kansas City. All those
things happened in '98.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, if the Hawks stumble like they did in 1998, you can bet
that Chad Brown or Shawn Springs is going to go ballistic, without
any worry about whose feelings they hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am embarrassed,'' Springs, the Pro Bowl cornerback, spat out
in loud tones that made it clear he wanted everyone to know his
disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Changes need to be made. You saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Pro Bowl linebacker, agreed. ``I think we are fooling
ourselves. We continue to fall short, so that's not close (to being
contenders).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're close, that means occasionally you're supposed to
land on the other side. A tough game against a winning team, we
find a way to drop it. We always rally late, make it look good, but
we're not making them close.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone had doubts about the difference between a winner and
an underachiever, Sunday's AFC West season finale between the
Broncos and Seahawks was all the proof required to make an informed
judgement.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos were a team full of purpose. They were a team full
of potent weapons, be it Elway or Davis, Sharpe or wide receiver
Rod Smith, who grabbed nine passes for 158 yards, including a
33-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see that team out there, they've done the things they need
to do to get into the playoffs,'' Seahawk receiver Mike Pritchard
said. ``They re-established Terrell Davis. They have the weapons.
They used everybody. Here, I wish we could have done that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard is a former Bronco who knows what it's like to stand
in the Denver locker room and hear coach Mike Shanahan implore his
team to be and play like the winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should hear a Mike Shanahan speech,'' Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Broncos must have heard something. They met the
challenge put forth by their coach to build momentum heading into
the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos could easily be in Miami on Jan. 31, when the Super
Bowl gets under way. They have that kind of force, that kind of
mindset, those kinds of weapons that are deployed to the maximum
without hesitation or confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks don't. At least they did not in 1998, when the
expectations to make the playoffs were hardly unreal.
</P>
<P>
   Word should come soon about whether Erickson and his staff will
be given another chance. Word has to come soon. The Pro Bowlers and
the pricey free agents and the long-time Seahawk veterans are
desperate for the opportunity to make it out of December. Change is
in the air.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty-two yards away awaited a goal that at times has seemed 52
years away.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jacke, who had kicked game-winning field goals on the
final plays of the previous two games, hit the ball soundly with
three seconds left. Moments earlier, he had missed from 42 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Ten horrible years flashed while that ball was in the air. High
ticket prices. Poor public relations. Bad personnel decisions.
Shaky coaching. Poor play. A decade of scorn from a community that
refused to embrace them.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone. During the ball's 52-yard flight, a
long-suffering team and its distant community became one. The Sun
Devil Stadium crowd of 71,670 seemed to be saying what Cardinals
fullback Larry Centers said he was
</P>
<P>
   thinking while watching the ball sail toward the north goal
post:
</P>
<P>
   ``Get there! Get there!''
</P>
<P>
   They're there. Jacke's kick cleared with room to spare, the
clock showed 0:00, and the Cardinals ended the NFL's longest
playoff drought Sunday with their first winning season in Arizona
and a 16-13 win over the San Diego Chargers.
</P>
<P>
   Aeneas Williams, a five-time Pro Bowl cornerback who endured
seven non-winning years, wept as he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Williams, describing the co-existence of the franchise
and the community, said, ``It has been a marriage all along, but
it's like we were sleeping in different rooms. We're all sleeping
in the same room now.''
</P>
<P>
   Centers, who in his ninth season has been around longer than
anyone on the roster, said he was numb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through so many tough years here,'' Centers said.
``Right now, it's hard to let it out. Maybe later tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has changed between the Big Red and its fans,
who for this game surprised even unflappable Bill Bidwill, the
team's owner, with unprecedented support. The Cardinals have come
back and come back, often after having no business having to come
back. This, the biggest game in the Arizona portion of their
history, was an example of it.
</P>
<P>
   But they never quit, and the community took notice. The
Cardinals (9-7) now move on to face the Dallas Cowboys, to whom
they lost twice this season, to open the playoffs Saturday at Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals got there the only way they know how, the hard
way. They took a 13-3 lead into the fourth quarter before the
Chargers (5-11) controlled the ball for 17 plays and used more than
eight minutes while driving for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Then the action got fast and furious. The Chargers got the ball
back, trailing, 13-6, and receiver Ryan Thelwell slipped behind the
Cardinals' secondary for what appeared to be a game-tying touchdown
reception. But the ball bounced off his hands to safety Kwamie
Lassiter for his fourth interception of the game with 4:21
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals put themselves in position to ice the victory,
driving to the Chargers' 25. Facing fourth and inches, with the
two-minute warning to give him time to mull the decision, Cardinals
Coach Vince Tobin went against his better judgment and sent Jacke
onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback sneak is what I wanted to do in the first
place,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke missed right, and the Chargers had the ball at their 32
with 1:55 and one timeout left. The Cardinals' defense had taken
direct hits from the Chargers' rushing game all afternoon, but it
had kept them out of the end zone. And when the Chargers faced
fourth and 19 at the Cardinals' 30 with 22 seconds left after a
third-down sack by Mark Smith, their chances of withstanding this
challenge looked good.
</P>
<P>
   Then quarterback Craig Whelihan found Thelwell open in the end
zone between cornerback Corey Chavous and Lassiter to tie the score
with 16 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Metcalf, who played for the Chargers last season, correctly
anticipated a squib on the ensuing kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few yards shorter and one of the wedge guys would have had
to fall on it,'' Metcalf said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the ball hopped to Metcalf at the 10. There was a huge
seam, and he headed directly north for 46 yards to the Chargers' 44
with seven seconds and one timeout remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I thought I was going to run into the tunnel (beyond
the north end zone),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jake Plummer, who had a tough day against the
league's top-ranked defense, quickly threw a 10-yard pass to Frank
Sanders, who had suffered a twisted knee on the opening play of the
second quarter and thought he was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``They X-rayed it at halftime and it was fine,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals used their final timeout, putting their fate once
again on the foot of Jacke, who was signed this month after Joe
Nedney suffered a season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed that one before just for the TV ratings,'' Jacke said
after making the game-winning kick for the third consecutive week.
``Over the years, I've been better from that distance than shorter
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Bidwill acknowledged that he didn't jump up and down before he
was handed the game ball and ushered through the bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a great thing to have had happen,'' he said.
``Emotion _ there was and there wasn't. It's just a great thing for
the fans and the franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, at last, were inseparable. &QL;

SOME DECENT HISTORY FINALLY COMES ABOUT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Lomas Brown's buddies told him not to go the
graveyard in the desert, home to losing football teams, ones
without hope.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer John Omohundro has heard worse in his 32 years with the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   This was the franchise that had the NFL's highest ticket prices
before it played a game in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   This was the team that lost its franchise quarterback in a
non-contact drill at a night practice. Timm Rosenbach was never the
same after suffering the torn anterior cruciate knee ligament.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cardinals were beating the San Diego Chargers at Sun
Devil Stadium to end the NFL's longest playoff drought, Rosenbach
was in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, running a charter tour boat service.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Tupa, another of the 16 starting quarterbacks the team has
had in Arizona, is punting _ yes, punting _ for New England. At
least, he's still in the league. The same can't be said for Stan
Gelbaugh, Jay Schroeder and Jim McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children waited a whole lifetime for this,'' Omohundro
said. ``They had to eat a whole bunch of dirt in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't describe what it feels like to have had so many years
of frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Omohundro's misery had been shared by many. Benny Greenberg, 72,
has been with the team for 33 years. Assistant trainer Jim
``Machine'' Shearer just completed his 25th season.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Aeneas Williams felt for them, and himself. This is
his first winning season in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried like a baby after the game,'' Williams said. ``I
wasn't afraid to let the tears fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jamir Miller also was emotional.
</P>
<P>
   ``How sweet it is,'' Miller said. ``All eyes are on us. People
can't say the Cardinals are jokes anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin told the team there would be days like Sunday.
He was asked so many times his first few months on the job about
the franchise's wretched past, he came up with a line he repeated
often: ``I'm not interested in historians. I'm interested in
pioneers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up on a farm,'' said Tobin, a native of Burlington
Junction, Mo. ``So I knew what pioneers do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin told that to Brown, his first high-profile free-agent
acquisition, in the winter of 1996. It didn't matter that the
Cardinals had missed the playoffs since 1982 or been without a
winning season since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a lot of flak for coming here,'' said Brown, who was a
seven-time Pro Bowl selection in Detroit. ``A lot of people said I
just went for the money, and I was not interested in winning, but
now we are in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL executives told Bob Ferguson that he was crazy for taking a
Cardinals
</P>
<P>
   personnel job when Tobin was hired nearly three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This team changed coaches every four seasons, it drafted a
kicker in the second round in 1986, it used its first-round pick
the next year on a quarterback (Colorado State's Kelly Stouffer) it
never signed and took running Tony Jeffery instead of Thurman
Thomas in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   How desperate were the Cardinals in 1992? They traded their
first-round pick for wide receiver Randal Hill and followed that up
by taking their next quarterback of the future, Tony Sacca, in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard that stuff that you could never win in Buffalo, in
Seattle with an expansion team,'' Ferguson said. ``I've been there.
You know things change. . . I figured we had everything to gain and
nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing was all the Cardinals had done since moving from the St.
Louis in 1988 except for an 8-8 season in 1994, the year Buddy Ryan
proclaimed the Valley had a winner in town.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jake Plummer is in town. He arrived at the Cardinals
facility two years ago and started leading the team to comeback
wins, nine in his first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This year, first-round pick Andre Wadsworth, nicknamed ``The
Gift,'' by teammate Simeon Rice, joined the team. Rice said
Wadsworth was the gift who would lead the team to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come easily. Eight times, the Cardinals' games were
decided by three points or less, including Sunday's
playoff-clinching win on a 52-yard field goal by Chris Jacke on the
final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season has been incredible,'' vice chairman Tom Guilfoil
said. ``It has been more exciting than the `Cardiac Cardinals' of
the 1970s. The whole season has been scripted in Hollywood.'' &QL;

SEAHAWK PLAYERS SAY SOME GAVE UP IN 8-8 SEASON FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As Shawn Springs left the field at Mile High Stadium
Sunday, the Seahawks' Pro Bowl cornerback issued a warning to
reporters waiting outside the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please do not interview me,'' Springs said. ``I will tell you
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he started by correcting the score.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard had it: Denver Broncos 28, Seahawks 21.
</P>
<P>
   According to Springs, ``That should have been 45-0, Broncos.''
</P>
<P>
   In a season finale where the Seahawks were hoping to make a
statement for next season as well as the future of their embattled
coach, Springs' biting words said a lot about what went wrong in
this game, and in this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stink,'' Springs said. ``Some people quit. Some people
played. It was obvious. You all saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   What most people noticed, especially the 74,057 fans in the
stands, was Terrell Davis running for 178 yards to become the
fourth player in NFL history to have a 2,000-yard rushing season.
Or 38-year-old John Elway looking like 28-year-old John Elway in
passing for 338 yards and four TDs. Or a Denver team that had lost
two straight after winning its first 13 games ironing out any and
all problems heading into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   What Springs and some of his defensive teammates witnessed was a
lack of effort by some of their own teammates that allowed the
Broncos to dominate the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys didn't play hard enough,'' defensive end Phillip Daniels
said. ``I don't think everybody played like they should.
Everybody's got a gap up front and when somebody doesn't play
theirs, that's when big runs happen.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Seahawks wanted to point any fingers. But, as
Springs said, it was there for everyone to see _ especially club
president Bob Whitsitt, who did not make the trip with the team but
is expected to make a decision this week on whether head coach
Dennis Erickson will return next season.
</P>
<P>
   A defense that has been the heart and conscience of this team
all season suddenly coming up heartless at times cannot help
Erickson's case or cause.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the third quarter, strong safety Jay Bellamy was
yelling at rookie middle linebacker DeShone Myles between plays.
Later, Pro Bowl linebacker Chad Brown had to step in to stop
Springs from going after Myles.
</P>
<P>
   What happened Sunday cannot be blamed on one player. But it was
definitely an ugly way to end a season that started with three
straight wins and such lofty expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for Coach E.'s situation, but it wasn't just him.
It was everything,'' Springs said.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, the Seahawks finished 8-8 for the second straight
season and are out of the playoffs for the 10th year in a row _ the
longest postseason drought in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were not blown out of any games, and for the most
part played hard every week _ if not always well. But to fall this
far short of expectations, well, someone must be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the things that plagued us all year came back and
hurt us today,'' quarterback Jon Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   This game got out of control in a hurry. By halftime, the
Broncos led only 14-7. But a closer look at the numbers shows it
was one of the most lop-sided seven-point halftime leads in league
history.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 30 minutes, Elway passed for 220 yards, Kitna for
96. Davis ran for 82 yards, Seattle's Ricky Watters ran for 10. Rod
Smith caught six passes for 121 yards, Joey Galloway three for 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran into a buzzsaw today,'' Erickson said. ``They ran the
ball. They threw the ball. They just seemed to do anything they
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't stop in the second half, despite the Seahawks scoring
two fourth-quarter TDs to close the gap on the scoreboard. The
Broncos rolled up 511 yards, just four shy of their season high.
They held almost a 16-minute bulge in time of possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, they wanted it more than we wanted to stop them,''
Brown said. ``It's disappointing. I'm disappointed in myself. I'm
disappointed in my teammates. It's been a disappointing year. It's
been a disappointing two years. Eight-and-eight again and not in
the playoffs. That's not why I play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sinclair has been through a lot in his eight seasons
with the Seahawks. The Pro Bowl defensive end has survived a couple
of coaching changes _ from Chuck Knox to Tom Flores in 1991 and
from Flores to Erickson in 1995 _ and the ownership switch from Ken
Behring to Paul Allen. Sinclair was there for the 2-14 season in
1992 and the total collapse that was the season-ending 35-9 loss at
Cleveland in Flores' last game in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair said Sunday's season-ending loss was not in the same
class as the one that lost to the Browns in '94. He said the main
thing missing from this collection of talented players is a
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to win, the mindset is going to have to change,''
Sinclair said. ``It's amazing how other guys who used to play here
who are with other teams, they're busting it because they've got a
different mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the difference between saying ``Here we go again,'' and
``No, we're not going there,'' when you fall behind early.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mindset,'' Sinclair said. ``And we have to get away
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   This final chapter in the Seahawks' season of unfulfilled
expectations ends the same way it started. With a few truthful
words from Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed for the City of Seattle,'' he said. ``Some of
us quit. Flat out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the $55 million of Allen's money that was spent to
bring in players the past two years, Springs added, ``I feel
embarrassed for Mr. Allen wasting his money.''

TYSON TIES HIS FORTUNES TO OLD FOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson has allied himself with an old foe in an attempt to
pull his career out of the controversy that has scarred it so
badly.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Tommy Brooks helped plot Evander Holyfield's triumph
over Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   As an assistant to Holyfield's trainer Don Turner, Brooks
searched for and found all the weaknesses that proved to be Tyson's
undoing. As an able enemy, Brooks knows as much about Tyson as
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   If our biggest critics are indeed our greatest allies, then
Tyson has found an important friend. The relationship, the battle,
is just beginning in workout sessions at Phoenix's Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is trying to point out weaknesses to Tyson. For Tyson,
the key is a willingness to learn. To listen. For Tyson, that
always has been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the guys around him have been yes men,'' Brooks said
last week as Tyson trained for his comeback bout against Frans
Botha on Jan. 16 at Las Vegas' MGM Grand. ``He was training them.
That's not the way it's supposed to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   During Tyson's first session in the Brooks regime, the former
heavyweight champion was asked to punch as fast as he could within
30 seconds. Tyson was ordered to do it again. And again. Finally,
he threw up.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he screamed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punch, punch,'' Brooks yelled. ``You can't stop punching in a
fight if you throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Brooks said he is trying to re-instill the
fundamental rigors of a brutal trade once called ``the hurt
business'' by Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take a refresher course, no matter how long you've
been fighting,'' Brooks said. ``Now that he's been beaten twice,
guys aren't intimidated like they used to be. Maybe he needed to
get beat to realize the bad habits he got into.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brooks himself has heard questions with some implied
criticism of his decision to jump from Holyfield to Tyson. Why the
move from a perceived good guy to a self-proclaimed hell-raiser?
Holyfield's staunchest fans grumble about Brooks' lack of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   But for Brooks, the move was about business. It represented a
chance to establish himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kid with eight or 10 fights left,'' said Brooks.
``Holyfield and I will always be tight as far as I'm concerned. But
this is business. I got to look out for my family. I mean, how long
can you be an assistant?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A Tyson counter &QL; 
 &QL; 
There was talk show criticism of Sheriff Joe Arpaio's decision last
week to let Tyson counsel juvenile inmates in the tents and cells
at the Estrella jail complex.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and complain, said Tyson, who generates controversy at
the mere mention of his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all the people who complain about me being here, those
people should come and talk to them,'' he said. ``They're scared to
even look at these kids. They're afraid that they'll rob them.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly . . . &QL; 
 &QL; 
Longtime Valley trainer Willy Borchert is suddenly caught in a
zoning battle to save his west-side gym. He faces a Jan. 7
deadline. Borchert has been training amateurs for 26 years at the
neighborhood gym, which was the first home for ex-World Boxing
Association featherweight champ Louie Espinoza, the first Arizona
fighter with a major title.
</P>
<P>
   Best fighter ever? Burgermeister George Foreman says it is
neither Sugar Ray Robinson nor Muhammad Ali. ``There's never been a
better boxer than Joe Louis,'' Foreman told the BBC. And, yo, actor
Sylvester Stallone, best known for the Rocky series, had this to
say at a recent fund-raiser sponsored by Oscar De la Hoya: ``The
only guy I could fight now is Senator John Glenn.'' &QL;

ATTENTION: ASU SET FOR TOURNAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how fervently they preach the virtues of going to
class, studying hard and being diligent, responsible
student-athletes, college basketball coaches love this time of
year.
</P>
<P>
   Classes and exams are over. Next semester is still an object in
the distance. The players are theirs.
</P>
<P>
   And theirs alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have anything to worry about now except
basketball,'' Arizona State Coach Rob Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans' teams at Mississippi, particularly his later editions,
used this time to utmost advantage. The past three seasons, Ole
Miss was 15-2 in December after the semester break. The pattern
seems to be continuing with the Sun Devils, who play Navy in the
second game of the ASU/Fiesta Bowl Classic tonight at Wells Fargo
Arena following the opener between Alaska-Anchorage and Southern
Methodist at 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The winners meet Tuesday night after the 5:30 consolation game,
and even though Navy is 8-2 and reached the NCAA Tournament last
season, Evans will be very disappointed if ASU doesn't win its own
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After a 2-4 start, ASU has won four in a row, including upsets
of Nevada-Las Vegas and Texas A&AMP;M. The obvious reasons include the
return of freshman Kenny Crandall and senior Mike Batiste. But
Evans sees real progress, not just in games but practice, where he
and the coaches have turned up the intensity dial a few notches.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sun Devils have responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Evans said. ``I see a sense of purpose, of
focus. I told my staff, `These guys really want to learn.' They're
trying to execute, trying to give effort. It just appears to me
it's like, `Boy, this is what the coach has been talking about.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel these guys are getting better. Now is the time
we've got their total attention, and and if they're going to get
better, they're going to get better fundamentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans gave the players what amounted to 2{ days off, and had
them report back for practice Christmas night. On Saturday, they
worked out twice. Batiste called it the best three practices in a
row all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been totally concentrating on things we have to do, and
we're mentally focused,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing a lot of drills like we did at the beginning
of the year,'' freshman Chad Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said the return to fundamentals emphasizes defense and
passing. Marist shot nearly 52 percent in ASU's 85-77 victory
Tuesday, but Evans attributed that to his players ``already having
their bags packed,'' and said the defense has improved over the
past month.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still not where he would like it to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel like we can score,'' Evans said, noting that ASU
shot better than 50 percent (60.4 percent) for the first time
against Marist. ``Our thing is we've got to stop people.''
</P>
<P>
   By Christmas night, everyone was back after going home for the
holidays except point guard Alton Mason, who got hung up returning
from Nebraska and also missed Saturday's practices. Evans said
Mason probably wouldn't start against Navy, ``not as punishment,
but because it wouldn't be fair.'' &QL;

COYOTES' PLAY CREATES AN ALL-STAR COACH  
 SCHOENFELD NO LONGER LIVES IN DOGHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Schoenfeld grabbed his car keys and was heading out the door
to practice Sunday morning when one of his children, sitting at the
breakfast table, stopped the Coyotes coach to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation between Katie Schoenfeld and her father went
something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Great job, Dad. You get to coach in the All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, honey, but I think you're wrong. I don't think that's
correct.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is. The head coaches from the two teams that have the
best winning percentages in each conference will coach in the 49th
annual NHL All-Star Game on Jan. 24 at the Ice Palace in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld and Ken Hitchcock of the Dallas Stars get the nod
from the Western Conference and will coach the North American squad
of U.S. and Canadian players. The question as to which man becomes
the head coach and which becomes the assistant for next month's
game will be determined tonight.
</P>
<P>
   It's simple math. If the Coyotes (20-6-4) beat the Los Angeles
Kings at America West Arena and the Stars (21-5-6) lose at home
against Nashville, Schoenfeld will be designated the head coach.
Under that scenario, Phoenix would have a .742 winning percentage,
Dallas .729.
</P>
<P>
   If both the Coyotes and Stars win tonight, or both teams lose,
Schoenfeld will serve as assistant because Dallas' winning
percentage will be better.
</P>
<P>
   The selections will be announced formally Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I haven't given it any thought because
I didn't think it was a done deal,'' said Schoenfeld, who twice
played in the All-Star Game as a member of the Buffalo Sabres
(1977, 1980) but will make his first appearance as a coach. ``But,
hey, if that's the way it goes down, I like it, because I think
it's more of a recognition for our team. I happen to be the coach,
but it's what the team has accomplished that's going to enable me
to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   And to think, a year ago at this time, rumors were surfacing
that Schoenfeld was on the verge of being canned. After 30 games
last season, the Coyotes were 13-14-3, and Schoenfeld was sporting
a career coaching record of 195-194-57.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember who was calling for his head _ the
media and ``some'' of the fans,'' Coyotes captain Keith Tkachuk
said. ``We had all the confidence in the world in him, but I think
Shoney was put in an unfair situation. The easiest thing to do is
put a coach on the hot seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Richard Burke was so impatient, however, he publicly
vented his anger more than once in Schoenfeld's direction. As
injuries began to take their toll on the club, however, Burke and
General Manager Bobby Smith summoned reporters to a closed-door
meeting and assured them that Schoenfeld's job was safe _ for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
   The rumblings around the organization as the team headed into
training camp this season were that the Coyotes would have to show
a marked improvement through the first 20 games for Schoenfeld to
feel safe. They have, and he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy for everybody, for all of us,'' center Jeremy
Roenick said. ``Shoney went through a little bit of a tough time at
the beginning of the year with the question of whether he was going
to remain coach here all year. But he's worked hard. All the
coaches have. We've come full circle in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, who might end up coaching Tkachuk and Roenick in the
All-Star Game, came to Phoenix a year ago, saying this likely will
be his last coaching stop. If it didn't work out with the Coyotes,
he said, he probably wouldn't get another chance elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Now, who knows? He's got the franchise off to its best start in
its 20-year history. With a win or tie tonight, the team can set a
club record for going undefeated in 12 consecutive home games.
Schoenfeld and the Coyotes are being mentioned as Stanley Cup
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this might be my last opportunity,'' he said. ``How
do I feel about it now? I don't know. I don't dwell on stuff like
that very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like coaching in the All-Star Game. &QL;

READY TO TAKE OFF GLOVES  
 CARDS REMEMBER BITTER DALLAS LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gloves are still hanging in No. 67's locker at the
Cardinals' training facility, awaiting their date with destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to wear them in the game, too,'' Cardinals
offensive guard Chris Dishman said.
</P>
<P>
   The gloves in question are the ones Dishman was wearing on Nov.
15, when the Cardinals dropped a disappointing 35-28 game to the
Dallas Cowboys. The game ended with receiver Rob Moore being
interfered with in the end zone as the game officials chose to
ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Dishman wrote the score on each glove and vowed
to hang them in his locker, forecasting the Cardinals and Cowboys
would meet again in postseason.
</P>
<P>
   They will on Saturday in Texas Stadium, where Arizona hasn't won
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough loss, and I still think about it. There isn't a
day that goes by in the locker room that I don't see those gloves.
They are there for a reason, to remind of a loss that was probably
the toughest I've ever had,'' he said after the Cardinals'
playoff-clinching win Sunday. ``I've been looking forward to this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of great moments when I played at Nebraska, but
this ranks up there with any of them. I was hoping we could turn it
around sometime. We had the lead going, and they were doing the
wave. It reminds me of Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction in the Cardinals' locker room ran the gamut. Some
talked about a third meeting with the Cowboys after two losses,
while others wanted to savor the moment and talk about the date
with Dallas later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned in our last game with them that we can play with
them,'' center Aaron Graham said. ``The first game (38-10 to open
the season) we didn't play well and they gave it to us pretty much,
but the second game showed us we can play with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing, I bet they probably don't want it to come
down to the wire again with us having the ball. If nothing else, we
certainly have a lot more experience than anybody in that situation
now than they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Andre Wadsworth didn't want to visit the past,
preferring to look ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened in the past with Dallas is in the past and
out the window,'' he said. ``It's now just a one-shot deal. We
don't have to worry about what any other team is doing. All I know
is Dallas is in our way to get to our goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how it is in this sport, anyway. They could have beat
us 53-0 twice, but the game still has to be played and anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore thinks the Cardinals have learned much since the November
date with Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that our offense can set a tempo,'' he said.
``In the first two games with Dallas, we never set a tempo
offensively and challenged their defense, which we have to do this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we're more equipped to do it now. We've
made the plays when we've had to, which is the sign of a
developing, maturing team. But we do it the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, the Cardinals don't seem in awe of the
Cowboys, despite the two losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' said safety Tommy Bennett. ``The first game they
got us in the air and ground pretty good. The second game was a
different story. We had a few key turnovers that put points on the
board, but we still had a chance to win in the end, and I think
we'll cross the bridge this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Dallas had a bad year last year and didn't make it to the
playoffs, so I'm sure they will want to prove something, too.'' &QL;

METCALF REDEEMS SLOW SEASON WITH BIG RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals kick returner Eric Metcalf has had a disappointing
season this year, averaging only 6.9 yards on punt returns and 20.8
on kick returns entering Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   But he made one of the biggest plays of the year Sunday when he
returned a kickoff 46 yards, which helped set up Chris Jacke's
52-yard, game-winning field goal as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``They squibbed it pretty deep,'' Metcalf said. ``I don't know
if they were playing for us to do a middle return, that's what you
normally do on a squib. But I know a lot of people thought we were
just going overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy I was able to do that in crunch time. A lot of times
this season I haven't been very excited because I didn't feel I had
really helped the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf plans to have a nice conversation with his father,
Terry, a running back for the Cardinals in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to say, `It's a Metcalf getting them to the
playoffs again.' '' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nowhere to go
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals running back Adrian Murrell had his worst outing of
the season, gaining only 25 yards on 18 carries. On 15 of his 18
carries, he gained a yard or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to give them credit,'' Murrell said of the Chargers.
``They're not ranked Number 1 defensively for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell also was involved in the game's most controversial play.
He was awarded a touchdown on a 4-yard run in the first quarter,
although replays showed he was stopped short of the goal line on
the second-down play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I scored on that one,'' Murrell said. ``But we
would have scored, I guarantee you.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
No Leaf
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, San Diego's interim Coach June Jones
announced that rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf would see some action
in a backup role to Craig Whelihan. But Leaf never left the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``June, I respect him more than anybody,'' Leaf said. ``Whatever
he thinks is best for me and best for this football team is the
best decision-making he could have done. Whatever he was thinking,
it was the right thing I suppose. So leave it at that.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Masters of the close shave
</P>
<P>
   With Sunday's victory, the Cardinals set an NFL record for
winning the most games in a season by three points or less. The
Cardinals were 7-1 this year. The previous record was held by
Denver, which went 6-2 in 1984. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Catching on &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sanders' eight catches, good for 106 yards, gave him 89
for the season, most in the NFC and second in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   After straining his left knee on the opening play of the second
quarter, he thought he was finished for the day.
</P>
<P>
   But like the team, Sanders found a way to come back, making the
reception that put Chris Jacke into range for the final field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was bad,'' Sanders said of his injury. ``It
throbbed all through the second quarter. I wasn't able to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It felt better when he came back after halftime. And better yet
after making the catch to set up Jacke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just been very fortunate to win games like this all
year,'' he said. ``We let teams off after we have them down. We're
exciting to the finish. This year, the maturity of this team has
shown. These are games we didn't finish last year.'' &QL;

LASSITER TIES LEAGUE RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kwamie Lassiter said God was looking out for him on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he did. Then he didn't. Then he did. And then he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes for an NFL defensive back, even on days when his team
clinches its first playoff berth in 16 years and he intercepts four
passes to tie an all-time league record.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cardinals trying to protect a 13-6 lead late in the
fourth quarter, Lassiter and Corey Chavous appeared to be beaten by
Chargers receiver Ryan Thelwell for a possible tying touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have made the play,'' Lassiter said. ``We're paid to
make plays. But he bobbled the ball as Corey was going to hit him,
and it popped into my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it hit Thelwell in the hands, then his knee and then
popped into Lassiter's hands. It was manna from heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the fourth quarter with the Cardinals still protecting
a seven-point lead, it was Lassiter who broke up a possible scoring
pass to Mikhael Ricks near the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him go up and I thought about going up, but I knew Corey
was in front of him, so I just yanked him backwards as hard as I
could and the ball came free,'' Lassiter said, recalling another
moment of glory.
</P>
<P>
   It set up a fourth and 19 at the Cardinals' 20 with 22 seconds
remaining. And for all his previous glory, Lassiter could have been
fitted for goat horns, because the Cardinals were in a zone blitz
with three-deep coverage, and Chargers quarterback Craig Whelihan
found Thelwell behind Lassiter and Chavous for the game-tying
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just snuck one in on us,'' said Lassiter, whose four
interceptions suddenly lost some glitter. ``Whelihan is a good guy.
He throws well but had some bad luck. He threw that one right in
there between us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a `cover 3' and I had guys on both sides of me that
I had to watch. I broke on the ball, but he just squeezed it in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 16 seconds left, did Lassiter think the Cardinals'
destiny would be settled in overtime?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``We still had 16 seconds, and don't
forget we have Jake (Plummer). I have a lot of faith in him and all
my teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'd like to win and blow teams out, but we'll take
wins any way we can get them. I've been here for four years, and
I'm happy for the guys who've been here longer. We've never smelled
the playoffs before.''
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter's first interception was made at Arizona's 30 and led
to a 37-yard Chris Jacke field goal that gave the Cardinals a 10-0
lead. His second came on a last-second desperation pass at the end
of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   His third pick came at the Cardinals' 12 when Whelihan attempted
to go deep to Ricks. Finally, his fourth, with 4:21 remaining, gave
him eight for the season, the most by a Cardinal since Aeneas
Williams had nine in 1994. His season total led the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter has come a long way, considering he lost his starting
job to rookie Pat Tillman before the season and didn't crack the
starting lineup until midseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just happened to be in the right place at the right time
today,'' he said. ``I never got down when I wasn't starting because
I was in on nickel-and-dime coverages and I was on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you allow me to play, I'm going to make plays for you. Me
and Pat are cool, man. We both want to help this team win.''

CLINCHING KICKS ROUTINE FOR JACKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There, on the bottom of the Cardinals' victory pile, the kicker
was getting crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little guy,'' Chris Jacke said. ``It hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he wasn't feeling much pain. As he peeked out from the
bodies on top of him, he saw the message on the scoreboard: ``Wild
Cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke's 52-yard field goal with no time remaining gave the
Cardinals a 16-13 victory over San Diego and ended the NFL's
longest playoff drought at 15 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third winning kick in three weeks. ``He seems to hit
when it really, really matters, not just when it matters,''
quarterback Jake Plummer said. All three of Jacke's winners came on
the final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a (TV) ratings bonanza,'' Jacke said.
</P>
<P>
   His 52-yarder made up for what he called a ``horrible day.''
</P>
<P>
   He missed a 45-yard field goal in the third quarter and a
42-yarder with 1:55 left that would have given the Cardinals a
10-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his kick went wide right, and the Chargers went 68
yards in 10 plays to tie the score at 13 with 16 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 42-yarder, you should be able to make it nine times out of
10,'' Jacke said. ``It's unforgiveable.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Jacke missed his 42-yard attempt, Cardinals Coach Vince
Tobin decided to bypass going for the first down on fourth and 1 at
the Chargers' 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I have second thoughts,'' Tobin said. ``Since he
didn't kick it through, I wished we would have quarterback sneaked,
which is what I wanted to do in the first place. Then, I decided we
were right in the middle of the field. Either way, if we had gotten
the first and 10 or if we had kicked the field goal, the game would
have been over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke got another chance after Eric Metcalf's 46-yard kickoff
return gave the Cardinals possession at San Diego's 44. A 10-yard
pass completion with three seconds left gave him a chance to atone
for his misses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you have to have here, the confidence to bounce
back,'' said Jacke of his 15th career winning kick. ``I went out
there like it was a fresh start.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke has made only one kick longer, a 54-yarder in 1993. Still,
his teammates were confident he would convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's from Green Bay,'' defensive end Simeon Rice said. ``He
knows all about pressure. He knows all about nail-biters.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacke was congratulated in the locker room by Joe Nedney, whose
knee injury is the reason Jacke joined the team a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke won a Super Bowl ring with the Green Bay Packers two years
ago, but was out of work for most of the past two seasons before he
won a tryout over Cole Ford, the former Oakland Raiders' kicker,
after Nedney was injured. &QL;

   That blockbuster trade the Cardinals made with San Diego last
March is looking better all the time.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the Cardinals will get the Chargers'
first-round pick in next year's draft, which will be eighth
overall.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals made sure they got a top-10 pick by beating the
Chargers, 16-13, on Sunday at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers (5-11) finished with the same record as the Detroit
Lions but will draft ahead of them because of a softer schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we made the trade, we wanted to build for the future,''
Cardinals Vice President Bob Ferguson said. ``We didn't know what
pick we'd get from them. I know they're a much better team than
their record.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (9-7) also have their own pick in the first round.
If the draft were held today, that choice would be 19th overall,
the lowest pick among playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the San Diego trade, the Cardinals traded down one spot
in the first round and picked third overall, a choice they used on
Florida State defensive end Andre Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   They also acquired wide receiver Eric Metcalf, linebacker
Patrick Sapp and a 1998 second-round pick, which they used on
Southwestern Louisiana offensive tackle Anthony Clement. &QL;

UA TRIES TO JOIN FOOTBALL'S ELITE  
 WANTS WINNER IN 2 BIG SPORTS

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Arizona was the only NCAA Division I school last
week with two teams in different major sports ranked among the top
10, yet the Wildcats still have one reputation.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, it's a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is No. 5 in the Associated Press football poll. In
basketball, Arizona is ranked No. 8 by AP and No. 1 with its fans.
</P>
<P>
   The national rankings are a sure mark of success for each
program, but the comparison seems to end there. Why?
</P>
<P>
   It's an an intriguing question, one that raises several others.
Above all, it highlights Arizona's football program this week as it
approaches a crossroads Wednesday night in the Holiday Bowl at
Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent is Nebraska, a piece of the rock. An Arizona
victory would be a step toward the elite level that the school's
basketball program has long occupied. With a defeat, it's back to
football anonymity and March Madness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' said Arizona quarterback Ortege Jenkins, who has
also been a reserve guard on the basketball team. ``I think we have
had a great football season, but it's kind of been overshadowed
because of the (1997) national championship and then the Pacific-10
Conference titles in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at a winning football season and a Pac-10
basketball title differently, especially when you win Pac-10 titles
back to back to back.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is reflected at the box office. Basketball games
at Arizona's McKale Center are a guaranteed sellout. Other than a
sellout for the Wildcats' lone football loss to UCLA this season,
the only guarantee at Arizona Stadium was empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   The box office question is a sticky one, especially when it is
asked of football Coach Dick Tomey. He bristles when the two
programs are compared for their attendance figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparison between 13,000 for basketball and
50,000 for football,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A calculator will prove Tomey right every time. Nonetheless, an
Arizona basketball ticket is a precious commodity. A football
ticket is not. The difference between the two is enthusiasm, which
is hard to measure but a factor, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins forecasts a change, at least at the football end of the
scale. In time, he said, Arizona football will generate the kind of
enthusiasm enjoyed by the basketball empire ruled by Lute Olson.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this year, and from this point on, I really believe we
will be a well-balanced school between football and basketball,''
Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona's versatile quarterback also knows his history. Few
schools ever strike that balance. Trivia question: Can you name
Nebraska's five greatest basketball moments? Correct answer: No.
There aren't five.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is a football school, just as surely as North Carolina
is stamped with a basketball reputation. North Carolina has had
some very good football teams, but the school is known for only one
great athlete. And no, Michael Jordan was not a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are at least two schools that have managed to
maintain a high level of success in both football and basketball at
the same time. In the Pac-10, there's UCLA. In the Big Ten, there's
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, Arizona can be looked at like one of those
schools,'' Jenkins said. ``Coach Olson has young guys right now who
are off to a real good start. Basketball just keeps going along at
the same level.
</P>
<P>
   ``In football, we've got a whole lot of young guys who are just
getting started. Coach Tomey and this team is just on the rise now.
We're starting to set a standard.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part, Jenkins said, it is the football team's job to
alter the fans' way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Tucson, people are just used to winning in basketball,''
said the sophomore, who has been sharing the quarterback duties
with junior Keith Smith. ``It's something that's been a pattern for
so many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for as long as I'm here and Keith is here, we're going to
try to set the standard. But doing that, we can let our friends,
younger players and recruits know that something is going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way is to first win 11 games and then hopefully win a
12th against Nebraska. There's really no other way to go about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called tradition, and it's no slam dunk. &QL;

MCALISTER SEES HOLIDAY BOWL AS SHOWCASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Arizona cornerback Chris McAlister sees the Holiday
Bowl game against Nebraska on Wednesday as an important stage on
which to further prove himself to NFL scouts.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister already figures to be the best prospect on the field.
Still, there are lingering doubts that he promises to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some questions about McAlister's willingness and
ability to play against bigger receivers. In the wide-open Pac-10,
there was little opportunity or reason to play a physical game. The
league is about speed and finesse.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska possesses plenty of both, but the Cornhuskers are
defined by a teeth-rattling option attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for people to see the other side of Chris
McAlister,'' said the consensus All-American, who could be among
the first 10 picks in the NFL draft. ``I love the physical side of
football. I love playing run support. In the Pac-10, corners don't
get a chance to do a lot of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``More or less, what people have seen most from me is playing
off natural talent. I've worked hard to improve my strength in the
weight room. Now, we'll see if it's paid off.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Briefly . . .
</P>
<P>
   Arizona running back Kelvin Eafon didn't practice Sunday because
of a slight ankle sprain, which is not expected to sideline him
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Different numbers: For Arizona (11-1), there is motivation in
trying to win its 12th game for the first time. For Nebraska (9-3),
there's the fear of losing a fourth game for the time since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, when asked how he made the Keith
Smith-Ortege Jenkins quarterback rotation work: ``I didn't make it
work. They did.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska Coach Frank Solich, on whether the Wildcats resemble
any team in the Big 12: ``They probably remind me of Kansas State.
They are really a big-play team, which Kansas State was also. The
fact that they're so multidimensional is the big test for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska linebacker Jay Foreman, son of former Minnesota Vikings
great Chuck Foreman, isn't exactly impressed with San Diego's
weather. ``I thought it would be really hot, but it's actually been
pretty cold,'' Foreman said a few days after he left Lincoln, Neb.,
where it was minus-3 degrees. &QL;  &QL;

WILSON FUELS VOLS  
 LEADER HAS LEARNED TO CHANNEL EMO TIONS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden learned a lot about Tennessee's
defense after watching film of the Volunteers' Sept. 19 victory
over Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He saw big plays by Al Wilson, Al Wilson and, well, Al Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The senior linebacker, who forced a school-record three fumbles
and had 12 tackles and a sack, was at the heart of Tennessee's
20-17 overtime win. Although the Seminoles also would beat Florida
down the road, Wilson's effort was memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very, very impressive,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden gets an up-close look at Wilson on Jan. 4, when Tennessee
and Florida State meet in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here because of the team, not because of one
performance,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   True, but the efforts of the 6-foot, 225-pound senior are a big
reason a defense that lost seven starters excelled this season.
</P>
<P>
   After Wilson's performance against Florida, Tennessee linebacker
Raynoch Thompson called it ``the greatest defensive game I've seen
since Warren Sapp in bowl games.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator John Chavis said he doesn't know whether
he's ever coached anyone more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson earned first-team All-America honors despite missing
three games because of a shoulder injury. He was a Butkus Award
semifinalist and finished third on the team in tackles with 77. He
also had three double-digit tackle games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody on the team has respect for him because he plays the
game the way it should be played,'' linebacker Eric Westmoreland
said. ``Even with an injury, he doesn't want to come out. I
remember against Arkansas, he had a groin injury, but stayed in the
game and probably aggravated it even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, he's always in the weight room.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson epitomizes what the Volunteers want from their defense: a
good decision-maker with an impressive combination of size and
speed. If he can get to the quarterback, he will.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's biggest contribution, though, may be his leadership.
Some wondered where Tennessee would go in 1998 without former
quarterback Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an important part of this team, but we knew early on
that other players would have to step up,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer said Wilson ``has been a great
leader for this football team, especially for what we needed this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as emotion . . . Al actually had to channel some of
that and mature because at times he was incredibly vocal and hard
on his teammates,'' Fulmer said. ``It was to the point he could,
instead of being a positive influence, he could be a negative
influence. He's been incredibly good this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland said, ``He's such a high, emotional player. When he
comes on the field, everybody knows he's on the field. He's so
intense. And that brings out the intenseness on the whole defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the huddle, he's the same all year around, every day. He
likes to talk to us, get us going, and I think that's rubbed off on
me and other players. They're getting the attitude where they're
talking more also.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson would have been a high draft pick if he had made himself
eligible for the NFL after his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   As the Volunteers prepare for their national championship game,
they know just how fortunate they are. &QL;

SEMINOLES NEED WAY TO STOP VOLS' MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
 FOES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George DeLeone, the defensive coordinator and associate head
coach at Syracuse, admits he's not getting much sleep while
preparing for an Orange Bowl clash with Florida's nightmarish
offense.
</P>
<P>
   And since he's awake anyway, he often finds himself thinking
about a questionable pass-interference call made against his
defense late in the game that cost his Orangemen a chance to beat
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourth and 10,'' DeLeone said. ``And at home. How about that?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one that will haunt you for the rest of your career.''
</P>
<P>
   But having now seen the rest of the season unfold to find
top-ranked Tennessee in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl against
second-rated Florida State, DeLeone figures Syracuse was just
another piece that fell into place along the Volunteers' way to
their date with destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some intangibles on that team that go beyond the
talent level and the scheme,'' DeLeone said. ``The only way I can
describe it is that they're on a mission. They're feeling that they
can't be beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse isn't the only team that fell victim to Tennessee's
magic this season. The Vols needed four fumbles and overtime to
escape Florida. And only after Arkansas quarterback Clint
Stoerner's dumbfounding fumble with 1:43 to play did the Vols come
back to beat the Razorbacks, 28-24.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at our game, they were beat,'' DeLeone said. ``You
look at Florida, they were beat. You look at Arkansas, they were
beat. And they won all three of those games. I think that says it
all about this Tennessee team right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Beano Cook, a college football analyst for ESPN Radio, couldn't
agree more.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is, Florida State is the better team,'' Cook said.
``But Tennessee will find a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had all the breaks. They got a lucky call against
Syracuse on fourth down, or Syracuse would have gotten it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying is, Florida State is ``supposed'' to win.
That's what the guys in Vegas say, and I believe those guys. They
live better than the rest of us. But I'm not saying that Florida
State is ``going'' to win.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so forget for the moment that Tennessee is apparently
rolling loaded dice. How does a team go about beating the
Volunteers if all the planets are aligned favorably?
</P>
<P>
   DeLeone said it may be harder now than when Syracuse played the
Vols, because they've modified their offense to make it more suited
for Tee Martin than his predecessor, Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key now is to stop the run and keep Tee Martin from
beating you on naked bootlegs and passes out of the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin is a better quarterback than people give him credit
for. He had to adjust his style, and they had to gear their offense
more to play action and the run game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing about them is they've got a bevy of wide
receivers. Peerless Price is going to go down with their great
ones, and when you start listing those guys, it's a pretty
impressive list.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLeone said linebacker Al Wilson is ``the spiritual leader'' of
the Volunteers, but he saved his strongest praise for the Tennessee
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That line has a lot to do with the chemistry and toughness
that define their football team,'' DeLeone said. ``They lost the
best quarterback in the country in Manning, and an NFL running back
in Jamal Lewis, and yet they've been just as productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, you've got to find a way to neutralize that offensive
line, and Florida State's defensive line is their strength. That's
going to be a great match-up to watch.
</P>

   ``Second, you keep Martin in the pocket and make him beat you
from there. Then, gang up on the run and in some shape or another
change up your coverages to confuse their receivers, with added
attention to Peerless Price. &QL; 
``I mean, look at our game. Look at the Florida game. Florida
fumbled four times, three of them inside the 10. After that stuff
keeps happening, you've got to ask yourself: Is this divine
intervention? Or is it just a bunch of guys who refuse to lose?'' &QL;

FLORIDA STATE'S SINGLE LOSS MEANINGLESS, ANALYSTS BE LIEVE 
</HEADLINE>
  FOES-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All right, so there was a blip on the way to Tempe _ a 24-7 loss
to North Carolina State in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like Pearl Harbor,'' ESPN college football analyst
Beano Cook said. ``You never forget it. But that's ancient
history.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Florida State at bowl time, winner of 10 in a row,
confident, poised and ready to take on No. 1 Tennessee (12-0) for
the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage goes to Florida State,'' ESPN analyst Lee Corso
said. ``They've been there, done that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time in the 1990s that Florida State is in a
bowl game with national championship implications. It has won one,
beating Nebraska, 18-16, in the '94 Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Corso admitted Tennessee has an edge at quarterback because of
the versatility of Tee Martin. His counterpart, Marcus Outzen, will
be making only his third career start for the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the Bobby Bowden factor to consider, and
because of that, not many are willing to give a definite nod to
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is 15-3-1 in bowl games at Florida State. His 16 bowl
victories rank second behind Penn State's Joe Paterno, who has 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look over the 20th century, the greatest records are by
FDR, Paterno and Bowden,'' Cook said. ``They don't lose in November
or bowl games.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State defensive coordinator Jeff Snipes said he
likes Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lucky day against those guys,'' Snipes said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second game of the season. Florida State struggled to
beat Texas A&AMP;M, 23-14, the previous week. The Seminoles were on a
47-1 run against Atlantic Coast Conference competition, and North
Carolina State was never perceived as a threat.
</P>
<P>
   But quarterback Chris Weinke was picked off six times, and the
national championship game never looked so distant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was (Weinke's) second start, and we did a good job that
day of confusing him,'' Snipes said. ``We were able to run a lot of
different coverages at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke bounced back to have eight consecutive games without
throwing an interception before he suffered a season-ending neck
injury. But in Outzen's second start, the Seminoles beat Florida,
so the team's not lacking confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers will try their best to confuse Outzen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't matter,'' Snipes said. ``They have a lot of good
athletes down there. Even their third-team quarterback could start
for anyone in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to take anything away from the job Weinke has
done. They have a great supporting cast.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanker Peter Warrick is one of the country's most dangerous
threats, and the Seminoles' defense forced 13 turnovers in their
last four games. But they'll be greatly challenged by Martin and
wide receiver Peerless Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about their offense being powerful and putting
a lot of points on the board,'' Snipes said. ``But the defense also
is in the top 10 every year.'' &QL;

INJURED VOLUNTEERS PLAN TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tennessee may see two of its injured starting defensive linemen
back for the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers Coach Phillip Fulmer said he is pleased with the
progress of tackle Jeff Coleman and end Corey Terry.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman suffered a knee sprain in Tennessee's 24-14 victory over
Mississippi State in the Southeastern Conference championship game.
Terry is nursing a pulled groin.
</P>
<P>
   Both are still being monitored. Fulmer was not ready to say how
much each would play and currently has Coleman listed on the depth
chart behind tackles Billy Ratliff and Ron Green.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers arrived in the Valley on Saturday night and began
workouts at Scottsdale Community College Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Both players participated in light workouts. &QL;  &QL; 
Underdog again
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer doesn't seem the least bit bothered by the decision of
most oddsmakers to make 11-1 Florida State a four-point favorite,
even though Tennessee is 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has responded to those kinds of challenges, and I
would hope that they would respond again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers quarterback Tee Martin believes his teammates aren't
caught up in the underdog issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we're not favored,'' he said. ``People may
think that their defense is better than our defense, or their
offense has more big-play players than our offense has. We don't
focus on that. We look at this as the biggest game of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like everything about this rivalry. The sound of it. The
feel of it. Florida State comes in as a team that's well-respected
across the nation, and we come in as a team that gained respect as
the season went on. That's a good rivalry: a team that has the
respect and a team that has had to work for it.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Taking it slow &QL;  &QL; 
The Volunteers found the sunshine Sunday a welcome relief from
Knoxville, where temperatures have been in the 30s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer kept practice light and plans to begin heavy workouts
midweek to avoid peaking too early. &QL;  &QL; 
Quick hits &QL;  &QL; 
Tennessee and Florida State will be meeting for only the second
time in history. The Seminoles won the first, 10-0, in Knoxville in
1958.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State arrives today. &QL;  &QL;

PATRIOTS SENT FLYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Once again they were left answering the
same old question.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Why were the Patriots flat? Why didn't they come to play Sunday?
Why do they have such peaks and valleys? Why couldn't they get up
for a game against Bill Parcells and the New York Jets, who swept
the season series with a 31-10 pummeling of the Patriots before a
sellout at the Meadowlands on a beautiful day?
</P>
<P>
   The horrific loss, which rivaled only the one Nov. 8 to the
Atlanta Falcons (41-10), cost the Patriots a home playoff game.
Instead of hosting Miami at Foxboro Stadium, they'll be heading to
Jacksonville to face the Jaguars, a team they've handled well over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   But with no momentum to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our asses kicked all over the football field,'' said
receiver Shawn Jefferson. ``Those guys came to play. I have no idea
why we didn't. Teams that eventually go all the way are teams that
can avoid these dips. How we can play so well one week against the
49ers and come in here like this ... a game against a team in your
division ... I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll, the players, the fans _ they all were at a
loss for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who finished the season with a 9-7 record and
placed fourth in the AFC East, entered the game with their usual
array of injuries, the defense minus outside linebacker Todd
Collins, lineman Chris Sullivan, and middle linebacker Ted Johnson,
and the offense without quarterback Drew Bledsoe and wide receiver
Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Zolak started his second straight game and probably last
of the season, and from the outset it was apparent the Jets had his
number and this would not be another miracle game. The Jets put
Zolak in the position of having to play from behind, and his
options became few.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get down in a game early, there are only so many
things you practice other than taking your shots downfield,'' said
Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots never got pressure on Vinny Testaverde, who went 17
for 27 for 179 yards, with four touchdowns and one interception.
The defense allowed the Jets a whopping 13 of 19 (68 percent)
third-down conversions, which helped New York finish the year 12-4
and appear a lock to go far into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough game for the Patriots today,'' said Parcells,
the former Patriots head man. ``But that's a good team, and we
might see them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. It depends on whether the Patriots who beat the Bills,
Dolphins, Steelers, and 49ers the last six games show up in
Jacksonville, or whether it's the team that played the Rams and
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is gone,'' said Jefferson, who caught one of the two
passes completed to wide receivers by Zolak. The other was a
44-yard touchdown pass to rookie Tony Simmons during garbage time
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put this one out of our heads right now because any
lingering effects of this could be deadly,'' said Jefferson. ``For
whatever reason we didn't come to play. Hey, no sense analyzing it
to death. Just move on and know in our hearts that we are a good
team and that we can come back and play well and beat
playoff-caliber teams.''
</P>
<P>
   On a 36-degree day with minimal wind and the sun shining, the
Jets won the toss, received, and scored. They marched from their 10
to the Patriots' 18, with Curtis Martin, who gained 102 yards on 29
carries, making runs of 8 and 17 yards. The Patriots did limit New
York to a 36-yard John Hall field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets got the ball at their 46 after the Patriots were forced
to punt following an intentional grounding penalty on Zolak. They
used the running game again, but on third and 5 from the 14,
Testaverde found Wayne Chrebet for an 8-yard gain. Two plays later,
the Patriots left tight end Kyle Brady wide open for a 4-yard
touchdown pass, his fifth score of the year, three of them against
the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   By early in the second quarter it was 17-0. That came as a
result of a rare fumble by running back Robert Edwards, who coughed
up the ball for the first time in 15 games after being hit by left
tackle Jason Ferguson. The ball was recovered by Ray Mickens at the
Patriots' 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just dropped the ball,'' said Edwards, who was tackled
around the ankles by Ferguson. ``Nobody hit me. That was a surprise
to me too. That's something I have to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   The only glimmer of hope before the half came following that
score when, with 8:56 left, the Patriots started at the 28 and went
on a methodically effective drive that featured an 18-yard run by
Edwards (on which he fumbled but recovered). Zolak even connected
with Derrick Cullors on a third-and-5 for a 15-yard gain to the
Jets' 25.
</P>
<P>
   Desperately needing 6 points, Zolak hit Ben Coates for an
18-yard gain to the 7. But the Patriots could do very little,
getting it down to the 2 on a 7-yard pass to Edwards on third and
goal from the 9. New England was forced to settle for a 19-yard
Adam Vinatieri field goal, making it 17-3 with 3:26 remaining in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots got the ball back with 2:19 remaining in the half,
but a strong opportunity to get back in the game went up in smoke,
starting with a sack for an 8-yard loss by the Jets' Anthony
Pleasant after New England had converted a third-and-6 play to
their 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to block, run, and tackle well to win a game like this
and we didn't do any of it,'' said Carroll. ``We couldn't stop
their running game and we couldn't put the pressure we needed on
their passer to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots went three and out on their opening possession of
the second half and the Jets went 60 yards for a score to make the
outcome all but official.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots left receivers open, but was it the lack of pass
rush that caused this?
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view we didn't rush the passer like we should
have,'' said defensive line coach Ray Hamilton. ``Ron (Lynn,
defensive backs coach) might say his guys didn't cover as well as
they should have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did have defensive end Willie McGinest back, and he
made it through his limited time without reinjuring the groin that
has kept him out of seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just came out flat,'' said McGinest. ``They jumped on us
right away. If anything, I hope this game boosts us. This will show
us that we just can't show up. We have to play hard and take it to
them like they took it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defensive tackle Henry Thomas, who reinjured his right
ankle during the game but is expected to play Sunday, said, ``I
don't have too much to say right now. I don't want to say anything
because I get the feeling we'll be seeing these guys again.''
</P>
<P>
   And after that game, will they be searching for answers again?

PATRIOTS HEADING WRONG WAY WITHOUT PARCELLS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Hmmmm. How does one write about the
plight of your local football team without the appearance of piling
on?
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 31-10 debacle (oh, if it were only as close as the
score sounds) against the hated Jets is only the latest piece of
evidence that the Patriots are going the wrong way. And since we
New Englanders are into blame, let's remind you again that the
blame for what is happening to your football team lies at the feet
of the owner you once loved.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how Bob Kraft has escaped the wrath of Patriot
Nation. John Harrington gets the bleep kicked out of him for losing
Roger Clemens and Mo Vaughn. Just as Haywood Sullivan was harpooned
for losing Carlton Fisk, and Harry Frazee earned infamy for selling
Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Kraft is somehow not held accountable for screwing up
his football team _ a team he plans to move to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft torpedoed the Patriots when he overruled Bill Parcells on
draft day 1996. The big double cross, of which too much already has
been written, set the wheels in motion for Parcells's exit from New
England. And then Kraft put out the spin that Bully Bill was
leaving anyway. He just didn't want to be here.
</P>
<P>
   No. Parcells would have stayed if Kraft would have stayed out of
the way. The Patriots had a rare window of opportunity: They had a
young Super Bowl team on the rise. Parcells would have stayed for
that. But he couldn't live with a double-dealing owner who wanted
to be the star of his team. And now Kraft is the star of a team
that has gone from 11 ... to 10 ... to nine wins since Parcells
left.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game only compounds the embarrassment. The 1996 Super
Bowl Patriots are now a shell of what Parcells left behind. And the
1996 1-15 Jets have become AFC East champs with a 12-4 rec-ord.
Since Tuna left New England, the Patriots are 19-13, the Jets
21-11. And the disparity on display Sunday bordered on abject
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about injuries anymore. And it's not about ``making
plays'' or ``finding ourselves.'' It's about an owner who had our
greatest local coach since Red Auerbach and ran him out of town
because he wanted to play Strat-o-matic football (The Patriots
press guide claims that ``while attending Columbia, (Kraft) also
played `scatback' for the Lions'' _ which must have happened while
Tim Johnson was up to his knees in rice paddies back in 'Nam).
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's defenders, of which there are many (he did, after all,
save the team from going to St. Louis and poured a lot of money
into player payroll) tell us to just ``get over it.'' Bill is gone
and that is that.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But how are we supposed to ``get over it'' when Kraft and
his team can't ``get over it''? The owner is still obsessed with
the Tuna. Why else would he call for a tampering probe after an
innocuous phone call between Parcells and Drew Bledsoe?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Pete Carroll can't get over it. Earlier this year, in a
telling moment of candor when he didn't expect to be quoted,
Carroll said that everything Parcells says is a ``crock.''
Carroll's got to be furious about the unfair comparisons (hey, it's
not Pete's fault that he's no Parcells, Phil Bengtson had to follow
Vince Lombardi in Green Bay).
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot players can't get over it. They keep getting humbled
by the Jets. It's now, 3-1, Jets, since the Tuna bolted for the
Swamps of New Jersey, but if not for a blocked field goal from 29
yards, it would be 4-0. The margins are widening. And most football
experts believe the Patriots have better overall talent.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to overstate the magnitude of Sunday's
butt-whipping. Take a look at time of possession _ 38:51 for the
Jets to 21:09 for the Patriots. New England couldn't manage a first
down until it was 17-0 with seven minutes left in the first half.
It was so bad that Jet fans actually left early and New England's
only touchdown was a Dominique Wilkins-meaningless, garbage-time
score with a minute remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After the loss, Poor Daddy Pete looked like Charlie McCarthy
without Edgar Bergen. What could he say? Hey, we all know it's
tough going to battle without Ted Johnson, Bledsoe, and Terry
Glenn, but this was pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to find out what we're all about again,'' he said.
``We didn't play well. And it looks like there's no energy, no
excitement about your game when you can't stop them. We have to put
a club together that can play playoff-caliber football.''
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly not the muscle-flexing Pete we saw last week
after the Patriots took advantage of a San Francisco team that
forgot to show up in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   Players know. The Jet room is littered with ex-Patriots who
moved to Jersey. Many are still friends with Patriot players. They
talk. They can see what has happened but have to be careful what
they say in public.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ``scatback'' owner, once more ubiquitous and
quoteworthy than Marty Meehan, doesn't say much about his team or
his coach anymore. But this has got to be killing him. The Patriots
are going the wrong way because Bob Kraft couldn't live with the
greatest NFL coach of this generation. The Jets have become what
the Patriots could have been, and New England Patriots fans are the
losers.

THINGS UP IN AIR WITH CARROLL AT CONTROLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ All week Pete Carroll closed his
practice sessions from the prying media's eyes. Sunday you had to
wonder what the hell he was doing behind those closed doors,
spiking their eggnog?
</P>
<P>
   Carroll led his New England Patriots into Giants Stadium Sunday
intent on making a statement about his team and himself. This
morning he has to hope they didn't make one because his
playoff-bound Patriots were destroyed by the New York Parcellses,
31-10, in a game that was far worse than that terrible score would
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   This holiday season the Ghost of Coaches Past continued to haunt
Carroll and the Patriots because once again Parcells and his staff
not only beat them but slapped them silly. Parcells's team
outplayed Carroll's and he outcoached his counterpart and this
time, not even Carroll's players would argue otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill had them ready to go,'' said linebacker Chris Slade.
``The funny thing is, they had nothing to play for, but they came
out ready and we didn't. We got outplayed and outcoached.''
</P>
<P>
   The most alarming proof of the latter was that at the two times
his team should have been most prepared to meet Parcells's
challenge _ at the start of the game and at the opening of the
second half _ it played its worst. In both instances his offense
did nothing and his defense was routed, so whatever plan he
concocted behind those closed doors was utterly bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, the Jets scored on consecutive drives
while controlling the ball for more than 17 minutes (the second
drive dragging on into the second quarter). New England answered
with three plays that netted it 3 yards of offense.
</P>
<P>
   When the third quarter dawned, the same thing happened. The Jets
scored on back-to-back drives while the Patriots' offense produced
7 yards of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Who should get the blame for this? The planner, or the ones who
execute the plan? Both, is probably the right answer, but a week
ago, after a victory over the 49ers, the chief planner made a point
of arguing that ``there's more than one way to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so, but the early returns are in and they indicate maybe
there is only one way to do this because Sunday Carroll's way led
New England to a dismal 31-10 defeat against a guy who does it the
other way.
</P>
<P>
   The other way, of course, is Parcells's way, and thus far it has
accomplished the following over the past two years. Parcells
inherited a team that was 1-15 before he got to New York and it has
gone 21-11 since his arrival. Carroll inherited Parcells's AFC
champions, changed the way things were done and many of the people
who were doing them, and after a 4-0 start against arguably four of
the worst teams in football last season, he has gone 15-13 with
that team.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Patriots have had serious injuries that have
affected their season. What they have not had is serious injuries
every week for the past 28 weeks, yet they are barely a .500 club
over that nearly-two-year stretch. And when it comes to going
head-to-head against Parcells, it has been even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is 1-3 against Parcells but should be 0-4, having won
their first meeting in overtime when a chip-shot 29-yard field goal
for a Jet win was blocked at the end of regulation. Each meeting
has been slightly worse and in none of them has Parcells's team
scored fewer than 24 points. If there is a silver lining to this, I
missed it and so have most of Carroll's charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be a rivalry,'' safety Lawyer Milloy said.
``But game in and game out we play like we do against them. That's
not a rivalry. I don't care what anyone says.''
</P>
<P>
   By game's end, the Jets had controlled the ball for nearly 39
minutes, had converted 68 percent of their third-down situations,
and amassed nearly 100 yards more of total offense. In addition,
were it not for a garbage time touchdown pass to Tony Simmons,
backup quarterback Scott Zolak would have completed only one pass
to a wide receiver all day in a game in which his team was trailing
by 28 points for too much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   How that is possible is difficult to understand but that's true
of about everything that went on Sunday, as even Carroll conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into this game, in our approach, that this was a
playoff atmosphere, a playoff mentality, and we were nowhere near
that,'' he said. ``Our level of play, our inability to stop them on
defense, and our inability to make a first down. We couldn't do
anything today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got what they wanted to get done today and we didn't get
anything done. We really accomplished nothing. There was nothing
that was redeemable today.''
</P>
<P>
   The same was true two weeks ago in St. Louis. The same was true
earlier in the year against Atlanta. The same has been true in too
many of their meetings with Parcells. As Shawn Jefferson said
Sunday, ``Good teams don't have all these ups and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   No they don't. So what are the Patriots as they enter the
playoffs Sunday against Jacksonville? That is anybody's guess, but
safety Willie Clay understood yesterday that whatever they are is
not what they should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the same crap for two years,'' Clay said. ``I'm
shocked and embarrassed that we came down here and played like
this. I don't care who's playing in the game. They dictated
everything to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's a problem. The last two games on the road
have been pathetic and embarrassing. I don't see anything positive
coming out of this. You don't profit when you lose a game like
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been a resilient team but we make it real hard on
ourselves. We make it tough. This is supposed to be like a college
rivalry and to come in here and get dismantled is embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is all it is, Pete Carroll's ways may yet triumph. But
there are whispers now inside his locker room and there are doubts.
More and more, as Parcells's mastery over his former team
continues, questions are asked and criticisms of the regime are
whispered in dark corners.
</P>
<P>
   There has been doubt about how things are being done for quite
some time now on Pete Carroll's team, whether he understands it or
not. The doubters are not just external. They are internal, as
well, and there are far more of them than he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   What happened Sunday only fuels that doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a transformation from my rookie year here,'' Milloy
said. ``I see what we had over there (with the Jets) now. We're
struggling now just to stay alive. It shouldn't be like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it shouldn't.
</P>

   ATLANTA _ The Miami Dolphins need not worry about the Patriots
this week. They have a more difficult task at hand and it has
nothing to do with Buffalo and everything to do with themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins were slaughtered Sunday by the
better-than-you-think Atlanta Falcons, 38-16. It was over in the
first eight minutes, by which time the Falcons had a 21-0 lead.
Atlanta running back Jamal Anderson set a slew of records, the
defense forced six turnovers, and the Dolphins went back home with
plenty of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Jimmy Johnson, the Miami coach, was asked if he
thought there was still hope in the second quarter when Miami,
trailing, 21-0, had a couple of offensive spurts and managed to get
within 21-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   He then said, ``Once it got out of hand, I don't think we played
real hard.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, valuable defensive end Jason Taylor broke
his collarbone in the first quarter and is out for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shellacking, the Dolphins still managed to land a
home game next weekend in the playoffs. That happened because the
Patriots were similarly mauled and because Miami has the edge in
the fifth tie-breaker against Buffalo. According to NFL rules, the
team which has either the best differential against division
opponents or the coach who looks less like Newt Gingrich gets the
home field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't matter,'' sniffed Johnson, ``because if we don't play
a heckuva lot better, we'll be embarrassed again. I'm upset with
myself, with the team, with everything.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the way you want to enter the postseason and Miami,
which six days before had looked terrific against Denver, was
alternately hapless and hopeless. The final stats were utterly
meaningless. The Dolphins managed more first downs, more total
yards, and had the edge in time of possession.
</P>
<P>
   And they were never in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons got an unexpected boost before the game, when
convalescing coach Dan Reeves, who just had bypass surgery, stopped
by the locker room for a 2-3 minute chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pleasant surprise to see him,'' said quarterback
Chris Chandler, who was lifted early after a back injury. ``Maybe
that's why we started the way we did.''
</P>
<P>
   First play from scrimmage: Chandler fakes to Anderson, who draws
everyone from Fulton County. Chandler rolls right, hits O.J.
Santiago, and the big tight end rambles 62 yards for a touchdown.
Twenty-four seconds had elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got fooled early,'' said Miami linebacker Zach Thomas. ``We
paid too much respect to Jamal. We wanted to shut him down early.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Falcons' next possession, it took them a director's-cut
four plays to score. Chandler and Tony Martin combined for a
53-yard completion and then the quarterback and Santiago
collaborated on a 3-yard TD. The game was not even four minutes
old.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler was hurt on the play, however. Kenny Mixon hauled him
down awkwardly resulting in a back strain for the quarterback.
Chandler did not return _ his 3-for-3 for 118 yards should upgrade
his rating _ but is expected to be fine.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons then basically won the game after a switch of
possessions. Dan Marino, hurried and harried all day, threw a ball
into the flat that had Joe Kapp written all over it. Ronnie
Bradford picked it off, returned it 11 yards for a TD, and the
score was 21-0 with eight minutes gone. Miami still had not managed
a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really tough, because we did not challenge them at all,''
said Marino, who was 21 of 36 with one TD and two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   It was 24-6 at the half and Atlanta then put the hammer down in
the third. Recreating their opening scene, the Falcons scored on
their first play, this time a 35-yard pass from Steve DeBerg to
Martin. That followed a Miami fumble. Less than two minutes later,
Anderson rambled 36 yards for a TD after another Miami fumble. Two
plays. Two TDs.
</P>
<P>
   The redoubtable Anderson finished with 103 yards on 18 carries.
He set an NFL record for most carries in a season (410), led the
NFL with most 100-yard games (12), and set club records for rushing
yards (1,846), touchdowns (16), rushing touchdowns (14), and most
consecutive 100-yard games (five).
</P>
<P>
   These guys are good. The Dolphins found that out for themselves
Sunday, and someone else may well get the same awakening two weeks
from now.

JETS' DEFENSE REALLY TAKES TO ITS TASK 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This was pro football's version of total
disarmament. The Jets Sunday took away every weapon the Patriots
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take away their run first,'' said veteran New
York linebacker Mo Lewis, ``and if we could do that, we didn't
think they could move the ball on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets spent the day taking the ball away from the Patriots
with ease, handing it over to their offense, which moved with ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stopping the run and making them throw precision passes was
what we hoped to do, and our players did a good job of that,'' said
Jets linebackers coach Al Groh.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots quarterback Scott Zolak didn't have a chance Sunday
because the Jets defensive coaching staff knew what his strengths,
and weaknesses, were.
</P>
<P>
   They took away two things he likes to do, the deep ball to the
outside and the short crossing pattern to the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   Their feeling was if Zolak could beat them with sideline throws
and slant patterns, good luck to him. But the Jets coaches knew
those patterns are not what Zolak does best.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offense had three plays in the first quarter, when
the Jets controlled the ball for 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter it was just as bad for New England. Twice
they had the ball, and twice they couldn't get a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Leading, 17-3, at the half, the Jets scored on a 17-yard pass to
Dedric Ward in the third quarter, then put together a drive of 8:49
at the end of the third and into the fourth that produced a 24-yard
touchdown to Keyshawn Johnson and put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running game set up our offense,'' said Jets quarterback
Vinny Testaverde. ``A lot of the passes that went well for us came
off play-action. We had a good rhythm going on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Said backup quarterback Glenn Foley from the next locker, ``Our
offense right now is as good as any in the league. We have so many
ways to go with the ball, and our offensive line's pass protection
has been great. I don't know when the last time we gave up a sack
was.'' The line has given up one sack in five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense was different than the last time we played
them,'' said Testaverde, who clearly was cutting the Patriots some
slack. ``They've got the two linebackers (Ted Johnson and Todd
Collins) out, and some other guys are hurt. I think this helped our
running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Martin, who generally plays better as the game goes
along, had 51 yards rushing in the first quarter, giving some
balance to the New York attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like they slid their coverage toward me more this
game than they did in the first one,'' said Johnson, who is as good
as any wide receiver in the game right now. Johnson had another big
game, making drive-sustaining catches, and helping big-time on the
touchdown catches by teammates Kyle Brady and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``On both of those,'' said Johnson, ``they slid the coverage
toward me. I told some of them (defenders) to `keep it up. I enjoy
it. I'm happy that you're spending so much time with me and leaving
the other guys open.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets dominated, driving the ball comfortably for long
periods of time with their effective short-passing game. They were
an incredible 13 for 19 on third-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   They stuffed the Patriot offense by jumping on the pass patterns
that Zolak has had the most luck with.
</P>
<P>
   Twice Robert Edwards made decent runs, and both of them came
after he was stopped at the line of scrimmage and bounced outside.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, spurred on by a huge crowd on a beautiful day, played
with a sense of purpose, closing the regular season by winning 12
of their last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots played like a beaten team. They gained 249 yards on
52 plays, and they got 71 on a run by Sedrick Shaw and 44 on a
touchdown pass from Zolak to Tony Simmons in the final minute for
115 of those yards. That means they gained just 134 yards on the
other 50 plays.
</P>
<P>
   The most chilling quote came from a member of the Jets who was
formerly a Patriot:
</P>
<P>
   ``They said when we left there they wanted a team like San
Francisco. They got it. San Francisco quit last week. They quit
this week.''

</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ What a wonderful thing it is to be a New
York Jet.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fine thing if you're Curtis Martin, who just became one
this year, and it's infinitely better if you're linebacker Mo
Lewis, who is one of 17 players knowing the pain of being a 1-15
Jet under the hapless Rich Kotite two years ago and who is the only
member of the team who ever has participated in a playoff game
while wearing the green and white of the Fabulous Exit 16W Jets.
</P>
<P>
   That was seven years ago, when Mo was a rookie on a team that
got into the playoffs the last day of the season and that didn't
know its metaphorical you-know-what from its metaphorical elbow.
``In '91, it was, like, `Let's just get to the playoffs,'''
recalled Lewis. ``We went to Houston not prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   And lost _ naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the slow descent into football Hades. The Jets went
from bad to worse to something infinitely more undignified _
laughable. ``Around here,'' said one veteran observer of the Exit
16W pigskin scene, ``J-E-T-S used to stand for Just End The
Season.''
</P>
<P>
   And right now it stands for a potential Denver nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team,'' said Lewis, ``has everything to gain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets aren't a team, they're a revival meeting. The Rev. Bill
Parcells has set up his tent here in the Meadowlands. He has 53
guys with the thick necks and the sleek calves hanging on every
word. First he gave them credibility. Then he gave them
respectability. Now he's got them thinking they can win _ win it
all _ but only, of course, if they do exactly what he tells them.
</P>
<P>
   The Exit 16W Jets are not the most talented team in the AFC.
They may not even be the most talented team in the division. But
who can argue that at this point in time they aren't a Super Bowl
threat because they are a frightening team, spelled T-E-A-M?
</P>
<P>
   ``With Bill Parcells, I've learned you don't have to have the
best players at every position,'' pointed out Martin, who gained
102 yards during Sunday's pathetically easy 31-10 Jets victory.
``It's the way he gets you to play as a unit. That's where the
power is. He has a way of bringing out the best in every player.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I understand now more than in past seasons,''
explained 12-year veteran Vinny Testaverde, ``is that in order to
win you've got to have an entire football team. It's not just
offense or defense. It's offense, defense, and special teams.
That's what we've got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game told the world all it really needs to know about
the 1998 Exit 16W Jets. It is an NFL betting axiom that in games
played late in the season, and assuming the teams are supposed to
be somewhat comparable in talent, the edge should go to the team
that needs the game more. In this matchup the Patriots, with a
chance to grab a home playoff game, had a great deal at stake. The
Jets were playing to become the first team in franchise history to
win 12 games. That's nice, but, well, c'mon, it just doesn't
compare as a motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how much he's changed things around,'' said Keyshawn
Johnson, the cocky and very talented wide receiver. ``He had us
believing the game mattered. In the past you might have thought we
had nothing to play for, but here we are, 4-0 in the month of
December.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is not easily impressed. But when the subject is Bill
Parcells, his admiration is boundless. He is, after all, one of
those 1-15 survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``1-15 to 12-4,'' he said. ``In two years? It's ridiculous. It's
crazy. You step back and say, `Damn, what kind of coach is this?
Teams just don't do that. Something is significant about the guy
who is guiding us in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy in question was in a happy mood after watching his team
embarrass a Patriots squad that looked like a last-second
substitution provided by the Hockomock League in lieu of a
legitimate NFL team. ``The only thing I can tell you is that we've
buried all the ghosts,'' Parcells said. ``All the ghosts are buried
now. If you dig 'em up, it's because you want to dig 'em up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' follies are complete ancient history. They stopped
being a farce the day Parcells walked in and let them know that
this was the First Day of the Rest of Their Lives. He let them know
what was tolerable and what wasn't. He gave them a sense of
direction. Now that direction heads toward Miami Jan. 31. The Jets
aren't entering what The Tuna once again referred to as ``the
tournament'' just for the benefit of a resume.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuna is in this to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more things to do,'' he said. ``But I look forward
to it. This is the fun part of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to keep our focus,'' said Martin, ``but that won't
be hard because Coach Parcells has been there before. He knows
exactly how to get us ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets might lose, but it won't be because of lack of proper
preparation. Faith in the leader is no issue here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it before,'' explained Testaverde. ``The best
decision I've made all year was to come to the Jets and play for
Bill Parcells.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' said Martin, ``Coach Parcells is
the best coach ever to coach anything.''
</P>
<P>
   1-15 to 12-4 in two years? Martin might have a point.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ By the second quarter, this game had all
the energy of a baseball exhibition, the drama and the suspense
already long gone with one team, the Jets, so dominant and the
other, the Patriots, so abject.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of respect for the Jets,'' Patriots safety
Lawyer Milloy would say long afterward, when asked why and how such
a trouncing could occur, ``but I think we have too much respect for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always too conservative against them,'' Milloy went on.
``They always have something for us, and whatever we do they seem
to always counter it. But we never seem to do things correctly. And
that's everybody, players, coaches, and everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots could do nothing Sunday _ block, tackle, pass, run,
defend, pressure or, yes, even guess. The Parcells Effect on the
Patriots now seems so pronounced that even when New England tried
to blitz Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde ``every time we went out
there (on a blitz), they either ran the ball the other way or they
got completions on their downs,'' said Milloy.
</P>
<P>
   A knife doesn't move through butter any easier than the Jets'
offense moved through the New England defense. Patriot fans can
talk about Drew Bledsoe all they wish, and what might happen if he
plays Sunday in Jacksonville, but Bledsoe may make little
difference if the defense plays as horribly as it played two weeks
ago in St. Louis or as poorly as it did Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into this game, in our approach, that this was a
playoff atmosphere, a playoff mentality,'' said a shocked Pete
Carroll, the Patriots' coach, ``and this was nowhere near it. We
couldn't do anything. We really accomplished nothing. There was
nothing that was redeemable.''
</P>
<P>
   Milloy cast a cold eye on the wreckage and said all the talk
about New England and the Jets being a ``rivalry'' is ridiculous.
``You want it to be a rivalry, but game in and game out we play the
way we play against them, it's not a rivalry,'' said Milloy. ``I
don't care what anybody says.''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of the game developed immediately. The Patriot
defense could not stop the Jets' offense and then the Patriot
offense would put in a cameo appearance, doing nothing, and the
defense again was led out onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game,'' said New England wide receiver Shawn
Jefferson. ``You know the offense feeds off the defense and the
defense feeds off the offense, but none of us did nothing. No one
fed off anybody ... it was evident.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a sad commentary on the Patriot defense that one of its
best plays of the game _ stopping Testaverde on a third-and-10 on
the Jets' first drive of the game _ came when it had only 10
players on the field. When the Patriots tried the regulation
allotment of players, the Jets and Testaverde made 13 of 18
third-down opportunities, the Achilles' heel of the New England
defense all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tried to blitz Testaverde, said defensive
coordinator Steve Sidwell, ``but basically what happened was when
we tried that in some situations they picked it up. They did a good
job on that.''
</P>
<P>
   What a defense wants to do, Sidwell went on, ``is that you want
to get to third downs, so you have a chance to make a play, but we
didn't get it done. Obviously, we need to be better there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidwell said the defense was off-balance. ``Because of their
passing game, we tried to play some pass defense on early downs,''
he said, ``and obviously that didn't work out because they ran the
ball a lot and had some success on us. We changed our defense so we
did better against the run, but we still never solved it
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets must be given credit for their offense, especially its
balance, ``but we were always off guard,'' said Sidwell. ``When we
tried to pressure them, it really ended up hurting us. They were
picking it up and we also had some opportunities to make some
plays, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Sidwell said, ``This wasn't our finest hour.'' Not
good, especially when the football hours now are very short.

BLEDSOE WILL TRY TO PLAY SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ If physically possible, Drew Bledsoe
will play in Sunday's wild-card playoff game against the
Jacksonville Jaguars at Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, the emergency quarterback in Sunday's 31-10 blowout at
the hands of the New York Jets, will have his broken right index
finger examined Wednesday by a team of doctors at Massachusetts
General Hospital. Every attempt will be made to have Bledsoe fitted
for a splint that will hold the pin in his finger in place well
enough for him to play, according to team sources.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe watched as Scott Zolak went 14 for 31 for 127 yards and
one touchdown, a 44-yard bomb to Tony Simmons near the end of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe huddled with owner Bob Kraft and team officials before
the game to talk about his situation.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to test the finger early this week, get fitted
for a splint, and then attempt a return against the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pete Carroll, asked at his postgame news conference about
the possibility of Bledsoe's return, said, ``There's a chance he'll
play, but we have to find out what Drew's status is early this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had hoped that Bledsoe would be ready for Sunday's
game, but once the team beat the 49ers to gain entry into the
playoffs, it opted not to use him.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has had several X-rays of the finger, and he indicated
late last week that it was showing signs of healing.

JAGUARS LIMP INTO PLAYOFF MATCHUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Sunday may have been the rare case when
losing was good for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   On paper at least, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Patriots' foe
in the first round, are the most beat-up team entering the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars finish their regular season at home Monday night
against the Steelers with nothing to gain, and are hoping to elude
the injury bug that has haunted them all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars already have placed 15 men on injured reserve so far
this season, including six starters.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most important factor for the Patriots before the
game is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Will quarterback Mark Brunell, the heart and soul of the
Jaguars' offense, be ready to face New England?
</P>
<P>
   Brunell has been out for several weeks with a high ankle sprain,
and it is not known if he will be available against New England.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars had to play Jamie Martin, who got hurt, and then
rookie Jonathan Quinn at quarterback, and their high-powered
offense has not been the same.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell told friends last week that he thought he would be ready
for the playoffs, but that was about the same time coach Tom
Coughlin was saying he might be out the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have beaten Jacksonville all three times they have
played. New England won twice during its Super Bowl year in 1996,
including in the AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in one of their best wins of Pete Carroll's tenure,
they upset the Jaguars in Jacksonville, triggering a late winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   When Brunell plays, the Jacksonville offense is explosive.
Running back Fred Taylor has been exceptional, and with Minnesota's
Randy Moss is a candidate to be the NFL's Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars have lost four defensive linemen for the season,
more than any NFL team.

BILLS TUNE UP IN NEW ORLEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Any of the 39,707 fans showing up at the Superdome
Sunday expecting to see Doug Flutie play quarterback for the
Buffalo Bills against the New Orleans Saints were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   With a playoff spot secure, Bills coach Wade Phillips took the
safe way out and rested Flutie, who was nursing a sore leg, and
went back to Rob Johnson, who began the season as the starter
before being sidelined with a rib injury that allowed Flutie to
finally become an NFL star.
</P>
<P>
   But more about that later.
</P>
<P>
   Any fans who showed up at the Superdome Sunday expecting to see
the Saints perform well also were disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   With nothing at stake in a truly meaningless last game of the
regular season, the Saints also took most of the day off,
figuratively and at times literally, as they fell behind, 28-0, in
the first half before showing some signs of life in the final
quarter in what turned into a 45-33 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bills, Sunday was merely a tuneup for this weekend's
wild-card game in the AFC playoffs. The only question the Bills
wanted answered entering the game was who they were going to play.
</P>
<P>
   The win over the Saints, combined with losses by the Patriots
and Dolphins, means the Bills have a Saturday showdown in Miami
against the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   They will face the Dolphins knowing that Johnson, who had not
played since suffering an injury against Indianapolis Oct. 11, can
step back into his starting role if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``After not playing for 12 weeks, it felt good to finally go out
and get some reps,'' said Johnson, who became the starter Wednesday
when Phillips told Flutie he would be sitting out this final dance
of the regular season. ``I felt a little rusty at first, but things
started to come along.''
</P>
<P>
   So they did. Johnson, who was the designated quarterback of the
future for the Bills after signing a five-year, $25 million
contract in the spring, completed 12 of 18 passes for 216 yards and
three touchdowns in guiding the Bills to that 28-0 lead three
minutes into the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Phillips, who received the game ball Sunday after guiding
the Bills from an 0-3 start to a 10-6 season, was more interested
in who didn't play than who did.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Bills knew their playoff fate before the game _ either
a trip to Jacksonville or Miami _ Phillips felt no need to use his
regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me on Wednesday to take a rest this week,'' said
Flutie, who suffered a leg bruise in last week's loss to the Jets.
``That was tough for me to take. I always want to play. But I
understand why he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Flutie out and Phillips going deep into his depth chart on
defense, the Saints came marching back into the game behind the
power of backup quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver.
</P>
<P>
   After starter Kerry Collins was pulled by Saints coach Mike
Ditka following a horrendous (3 of 12 for 23 yards, 1 fumble)
effort, Tolliver fired away for the remainder of what turned into a
3-hour-24-minute marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Tolliver completed 23 of 41 passes for 296 yards and three
touchdowns and added a touch of suspense to the proceedings when he
led the Saints to two touchdowns in the final two minutes, aided by
consecutive onside kick recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to play everybody,'' said Phillips. ``I wanted Rob
to get a chance and he did and he had a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   So did most of the Bills _ at least offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to move on. ``We're down to 12 teams now,'' said
Flutie, making it clear he can't wait to head to Miami. ``And
there's not one team out there that we can't go out and beat.''

PROVIDENCE STUNS PURDUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ Coming off 16 days off after two straight losses,
Providence Sunday entered its biggest game of the season, taking on
No. 9 Purdue, the team expected to win the Big 10 championship.
</P>
<P>
   So what did the Friars do? Pull off a major upset, taking an
87-82 win before 11,288 at the Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Providence caused 27 turnovers, 18 in the first half, and the
Friars attempted 18 more field goals (74-56). Purdue (12-2), which
had an eight-game winning streak halted, made 57.1 percent of its
shots and won the rebounding battle, 43-25. But it couldn't hold on
to the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Providence, which is 7-4 under first-year coach Tim Welsh, was
ahead at every point but two, at 55-54 on a Brian Cardinal jumper
off the wing with 15:50 left, and at 59-58, with Tony Mayfield
connecting on a jumper in the paint with 13:45 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Friars got 22 points from Jamel Thomas, with Erron Maxey
tossing in 15 and Kendrick Moore 14. Purdue also had three scorers
in double figures, led by Greg McQuay's 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their quickness was a big factor, they really got to us,''
said Purdue coach Gene Keady. ``That was the difference in the
game. We were tentative against the press, we didn't attack it, we
didn't take it baseline-to-baseline and score. That's what we want
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We preach it, we work on it every day, we watch tape. Don't
thread the needle, make the easy pass. Bad passes lead to bad
shots. We've got to do a better job of teaching that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a major win for Providence. ``Any time a new staff comes
in, you're rebuilding, and today was one of those blocks that was
huge,'' Welsh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can establish our future and we can establish ourselves
as a quality basketball team. Any time you can beat a Gene Keady
team, that proves we have a chance to be a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh liked that Providence took so many more shots. ``Eighteen
more shots, that's why we won the game,'' he said. ``Good things
happen if you take 18 more shots. You don't have as good a shooting
percentage to win, but you're getting more attempts. It's a key
statistic ... and the turnover ratio was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   After a good start this season, the Friars sputtered, but now
they appear to be back on track. ``If we have high energy on
defense, we're going to play well,'' Welsh said. ``That's the key
to our team. Today we played a complete game. We don't overpower
anybody. We played with feistiness, we played with heart. I liked a
lot of things we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams were tied at 62 on a 3-pointer by Purdue's Alan
Eldridge off the wing with 11:55 left. Providence then built an
8-point lead, 76-68, after a Maxey layup with 6:40 remaining. Corey
Wright's 3-pointer with 3:25 to go put the Friars in front, 81-78.
</P>
<P>
   After getting it to 83-82 on a tip-in by McQuay with 1:03 left,
Purdue's Jaraan Cornell attempted three 3-pointers. He missed them
all, even though he was open, the last with eight seconds left. He
was 0 for 6 on 3-point tries in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Providence played what it calls a ``3-D'' defense to guard
against late 3-pointers. ``We don't want to get caught with any
screens,'' said Welsh. ``We'll give up the inside, but we make sure
to get out to the shooter and contest it and scratch and claw to
get the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than contesting the shot, we kicked around whether or
not to foul, but with 13 seconds left, there's too much time, with
foul shots and things.''

PLAYOFFS CAN ONLY IMPROVE ON DULL SEASON

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NFL's 1998 regular season was as memorable as
a nap.
</P>
<P>
   Name two highlights. Name one. It might have been memorable if
Denver had gone unbeaten. It might have been noteworthy if Terrell
Davis had eclipsed Eric Dickerson's single-season rushing record.
But it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen-ninety-eight produced four intriguing rookies (Randy
Moss, Peyton Manning, Robert Edwards and Fred Taylor), five if you
add Ryan Leaf, because it will certainly be intriguing to see if he
can ruin his career any more than he already has. Otherwise, the
NFL hung its '98 hat on a refugee from Canada and two recycled
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly material for Canton.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, the second season awaits, and there's a half-dozen
intriguing storylines which could produce a great Super Bowl, or at
least an interesting week of speculation and talk.
</P>
<P>
   If Minnesota meets the New York Jets, Miami will host the
Reclamation Bowl featuring Randall Cunningham, who was out of
football two seasons ago, and Vinny Testaverde, who began the
season with a 48-83-1 record as a starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   A Denver-Atlanta matchup would pit John Elway against his former
coach, Dan Reeves. A Dallas-Miami Super Bowl would give Jimmy
Johnson a chance to kick Jerry Jones in the shin.
</P>
<P>
   A showdown between San Francisco and Buffalo would be a
flashback to the early '80s, when Steve Young and Doug Flutie were
starting quarterbacks _ in the USFL.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta-Jacksonville Super Bowl would be a matchup of former
University of Washington quarterbacks, Chris Chandler and Mark
Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   Any number of matchups would showcase former Pacific-10 stars at
quarterback, since there are seven at work in the playoffs. Besides
Chandler and Brunell, there is Troy Aikman (UCLA), Jake Plummer
(Arizona State), John Elway (Stanford), Drew Bledsoe (Washington
State), and Rob Johnson (USC), the Bills' backup to Flutie.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting the field of 12 produces several hot trends as well as
several suspects. Putting the field into perspective, by conference
and the bottom up:
</P>
<P>
   THE NFC
</P>
<P>
   6, Arizona (9-7): Jake Plummer has rallied the Cardinals to wins
in nine of his 26 pro starts. We knew that, of course, because he
had stats like that at ASU. But he also threw more interceptions
than anyone except Peyton Manning. The Cardinals faced only four
teams all season that finished 7-9 or better, and they were 0-5 in
those games.
</P>
<P>
   5, Dallas (10-6): This is an old team that outlasted a sad
division. The Cowboys were 8-0 in the NFC East, 2-6 outside it.
It's a shame one of the NFC East teams must advance.
</P>
<P>
   4, Green Bay (11-5): Somehow, the Packers met only three
playoffs teams coming off a Super Bowl, and they were 1-2 in those
games. The win was against the 49ers, a team they own (five
straight wins and playoff KO's the last three years). Stat that
screams: The Packers running game ranks 12th in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   3, San Francisco (12-4): Despite playing in the anemic NFC West,
the 49ers faced a tough schedule. They met six playoff teams, more
than anyone else in the NFC. They were 2-4 in those games, and both
wins came in September.
</P>
<P>
   2, Atlanta (14-2): The last time Atlanta won a division title
(1980), Jimmy Carter was president, Mt. St. Helen's was erupting,
and the scandal of choice in Washington was Abscam. This is also
only the fourth winning season the Falcons have had since 1980 and
one of those was a 5-4 mark in strike-shortened 1982. And the
Falcons' only playoff win in 20 years came against New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler has been a big part of Atlanta's success, and you
couldn't have predicted it. His career record as a starter coming
in was 35-49, he had lost parts of five seasons to injury, the
Falcons were his sixth team in 11 years, and he had played on only
one winning team _ the 9-7 Colts in his rookie season (1988). His
claim to fame is being a member of the Rams in their final year
here (1994).
</P>
<P>
   1, Minnesota (15-1): Here's another weird stat which points out
the slide of the NFC: The Vikes won all four of their games against
playoff teams, but two were against declining Green Bay, one
against Dallas and the other versus a Brunell-less Jacksonvill7H]

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
TEMPE, Ariz. _ The ball seemed to float through the dry desert air
as if in slow motion as 71,670 fans held their collective breath.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And when the ball finally split the uprights with no time
showing on the scoreboard clock, it was Arizona kicker Chris Jacke
_ not quarterback Jake Plummer _ who was crowned king for a day.
</P>
<P>
   When Jacke's 52-yard field goal gave the Cardinals a 16-13
victory over San Diego on Sunday afternoon, pandemonium erupted at
Sun Devil Stadium. Fans descended from the stands, climbed the
fence that circles the field, overwhelmed security and swarmed the
Cardinals as they tried to leave.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dangerous situation but one that was inevitable because
the victory meant so much to Arizona. With the dramatic win, the
Cardinals won the last wild-card spot in the NFC. They will visit
NFC East rival Dallas on Saturday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (9-7), who blew a seven-point lead in the final
half-minute before Jacke's kick, finished with a winning record for
the first time since 1984 to clinch their first playoff appearance
since the strike-shortened 1982 season and their first ever in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday, the franchise hadn't reached the playoffs in a
legitimate season since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the fans staged such a wild celebration while owner
Bill Bidwill clutched a game ball in the corner of the dressing
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just drained emotionally,'' said Bidwill, who moved the
team from St. Louis in 1988 and is hoping to get a public
referendum for a new stadium in May. ``This win was so important
for the players, coaches, fans _ everyone. We earned this trip to
the playoffs. We didn't back in. We didn't have to depend on
someone else to help us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, I'm going to have three scoops of ice cream to
celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   When they play the Cowboys, who have won 16 of the last 17 times
the teams have met, the Cardinals will have a chance at their first
playoff win since 1947 _ when Bidwill's father owned the team and
it was based in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried like a big baby,'' Cardinals cornerback Aeneas
Williams said. ``I wasn't afraid to let the tears flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've climbed to the mountaintop, and we can see the Dallas
Cowboys. History shows that it's hard to beat any team three
times.''
</P>
<P>
   History shows it's hard for the Cardinals to beat any team.
</P>
<P>
   Their last six wins were by three points or fewer. They came
from behind to win in the fourth quarter six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the Cardiac Cards,'' fullback Larry Centers said. ``We
like to make it exciting for our fans. They pay their hard-earned
dollars to watch us, and we have to make sure they get their
money's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to rain on the Cardinals' parade, but they didn't beat a
team with a winning record. They didn't even beat a team with a
.500 record.
</P>
<P>
   The only team they played that finished over .500 was Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world can continue to doubt us, but the bottom line
is that we're in the playoffs, and it's a great feeling,'' Centers
said. ``It's a brand-new season, and we need to realize the
importance of this game. We have to be meticulous in our
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we haven't been in the playoffs, we don't really know
how we'll react. We'll have to wait and see. But I'm confident that
we'll keep displaying the type of character we've shown this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals struggled on offense Sunday but showed the type of
character that had been missing for years.
</P>
<P>
   Jacke, who left Green Bay over money issues and spent 1{ years
out of football before the Cardinals signed him this month, kicked
field goals of 37 and 36 yards. Running back Adrian Murrell was
credited with a four-yard touchdown, though replays showed he went
down at the one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials knew we were going to get it in on the next
play,'' Center said of the phantom touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   After John Carney kicked his second field goal to cut the
deficit to 13-6, the Chargers appeared to be doomed when Craig
Whelihan's long pass bounced off receiver Ryan Thelwell's hands at
the Arizona seven and was intercepted by safety Kwamie Lassiter.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lassiter's fourth interception of the game, tying an NFL
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals drove to the San Diego 25 with two minutes left,
but Jacke missed a 42-yard field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers got the ball with 1:55 remaining and drove 45
yards. On fourth-and-20 from the Arizona 30, Thelwell earned
redemption with a touchdown catch. Carney's kick tied the score at
13 with 22 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about the coin toss (to begin overtime), but
then I had a feeling that Eric (Metcalf) would put us in great
shape on the return,'' Cardinals receiver Frank Sanders said. ``And
I was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf, who was traded from San Diego to Arizona in the
offseason as part of the deal that allowed the Chargers to draft
quarterback Ryan Leaf, had been a non-factor until his last kickoff
return of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He returned it 46 yards to the San Diego 44.
</P>
<P>
   With seven seconds left, Plummer threw a quick 10-yard pass to
Sanders, who went down immediately calling for a timeout, and Jacke
trotted on for the field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty much straight down the middle,'' Jacke said. ``I
just turned to the sideline, and I was mobbed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone just tuning in might imagine that a horrible new epidemic
is sweeping over Congress, sidelining people with the dread virus
of adultery. But this bug has been around for ages, and no one has
yet devised a cure.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, legal diagnosticians don't even agree on what
adultery is. As usual, the laws vary from state to state _ some
insist that the husband must be unfaithful, others the wife, still
others allow both this option, while a few even demand that both
lovers be married to other people.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most of what's been written about adultery has been
written by men, though history suggests that women have also played
a role.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this uncertainty, many in Washington seem to favor an
uncompromising Old Testament stance developed in the desert, long
before the more sophisticated days in Jerusalem and Babylon, not to
mention the advent of Christian forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   However it's defined, adultery and its lies have generated a
vast folklore of opinion and anecdote in many cultures, an almost
universal body of common law. Herewith a few examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ Alexander Gross
</P>
<P>
   It shall be considered adultery to offer presents to a married
woman, to romp with her, to touch her dress or ornaments, or to sit
with her on a bed.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Code of Manu,'' Hindu law scripture (dated 600 B.C.-300
A.D.)
</P>
<P>
   I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. Come, let
us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves
with loves. For the good man is not at home, he is gone a long
journey.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Book of Proverbs'' (circa 500 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
   When cheated, wife or husband feels the same.
</P>
<P>
   _ Euripides, ``Andromache'' (c. 426 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
   A man may commit adultery with a woman knowing well who she is,
but not of free choice, because he is under the influence of
passion. In that case he is not an unjust man, though he acts
unjustly.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aristotle, ``The Nicomachean Ethics'' (c. 340 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
   Venus likes her thefts to be concealed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tibullus, Roman poet, ``Elegiae'' (c. 25 B.C.)
</P>
<P>
   One should reflect deeply before having relations with married
women. If it works, what do I risk? Is success possible without
taking too many risks? When I have possessed her, what are the
risks for the reputation of either of us?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Jayamangala,'' a 12th-century commentary on the Kama Sutra
by Yashodhara of India.
</P>
<P>
   Aroma had no intention of passively bowing to her fate. She
simply could not accept the idea that her precious romance of the
last 10 nights was all over just because her husband had come home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Li Yu, ``The Prayer Mat of Flesh,'' a Ming Dynasty novel
(1634). (The title refers to the Taoist and Buddhist belief that
sexual indulgence may lead to divine union.)
</P>
<P>
   What was thy cause? Adultery? Thou shalt not die. Die for
adultery! No, the wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly. Does
lecher in my sight. Let copulation thrive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shakespeare, ``King Lear'' (1605-6). (Lear speaking to the
blinded Gloucester.)
</P>
<P>
   He that is robb'd, not knowing what is stolen, Let him not know
it, and he's not robbed at all.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shakespeare, ``Othello'' (1604). (Othello responding to rumors
of his wife's infidelity.)
</P>
<P>
   A mistress should be like a little country retreat near the
town, not to dwell in constantly, but only for a night and away.
</P>
<P>
   _ William Wycherley, ``The Country Wife'' (1675)
</P>
<P>
   Love ceases to be a pleasure, when it ceases to be a secret.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mrs. Aphra Behn, British playwright, ``The Lover's Watch''
(1686)
</P>
<P>
   No man worth having is true to his wife, or can be true to his
wife, or ever was, or ever will be so.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Vanbrugh, British playwright, ``The Relapse'' (1708)
</P>
<P>
   No, I shall have mistresses.
</P>
<P>
   _ George II of England, responding to Queen Caroline's
suggestion on her deathbed that he remarry (1737).
</P>
<P>
   Adultery is an evil only inasmuch as it is a theft; but we do
not steal that which is given to us.
</P>
<P>
   _ Voltaire, ``Philosophical Dictionary'' (1764)
</P>
<P>
   Where there's marriage without love, there will be love without
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Benjamin Franklin, ``Poor Richard's Almanac'' (c. 1790)
</P>
<P>
   It is better to have a prosaic husband and to take a romantic
lover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stendhal, ``De L'Amour'' (1822)
</P>
<P>
   What we call adultery, like what we call heresy, comes as a
natural right.
</P>
<P>
   _ Victor Hugo (1802-1885), ``Pierres''
</P>
<P>
   What men call gallantry, and gods adultery,/Is much more common
where the climate's sultry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lord Byron (1788-1824), ``Don Juan''
</P>
<P>
   To console ourselves for all those things, happily we still have
adultery! Maryland tobacco! And Spanish cigarette paper!
</P>
<P>
   _ Petrus Borel, a French writer, ``Rhapsodies'' (c. 1850)
</P>
<P>
   Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be
faithless, and cannot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oscar Wilde, ``The Picture of Dorian Gray'' (1891)
</P>
<P>
   To permit oneself the joys of adultery, one must be a pious
person.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anatole France, ``Le lys rouge'' (1894)
</P>
<P>
   When one loves in a certain way, even betrayal becomes
unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colette, ```The Innocent Wife'' (1903)
</P>
<P>
   One man's folly is often another man's wife.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helen Rowland, ``Reflections of a Bachelor Girl'' (1909)
</P>
<P>
   Adultery is the application of democracy to love.
</P>
<P>
   _ H.L. Mencken, ``A Book of Burlesques'' (1920)
</P>
<P>
   The psychology of adultery has been falsified by conventional
morals, which assume, in monogamous countries, that attraction to
one person cannot coexist with a serious affection for another.
Everyone knows that this is untrue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bertrand Russell, ``Marriage and Morals'' (1929)
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy is the most difficult and nerve-racking vice that any
man can pursue; it needs an unceasing vigilance and a rare
detachment of spirit. It cannot, like adultery or gluttony, be
practised at spare moments; it is a whole-time job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Somerset Maugham, ``Cakes and Ale'' (1930)
</P>
<P>
   Adultery, sometimes necessary plot material, must not be
explicitly treated, or justified, or presented attractively.
</P>
<P>
   _ An early code to ``govern the making of motion and talking
pictures by the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of
America, Inc.'' (1930)
</P>
<P>
   The Tasmanians, who never committed adultery, are now extinct.
</P>
<P>
   _ Somerset Maugham, ``The Breadwinner'' (1930)
</P>
<P>
   The aura of the theocratic death penalty for adultery still
clings to America, even outside New England, and multiple divorce,
which looks to the European like serial polygamy, is the moral
solution to the problem of the itch. Love comes into it too, of
course, but in Europe we tend to see marital love as an eternity
which encompasses hate and also indifference: when we promise to
love we really mean that we promise to honour a contract.
Americans, seeming to take marriage with not enough seriousness,
are really taking love and sex with too much.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anthony Burgess, ``You've Had Your Time'' (1990)
</P>
<P>
   Adultery is hard on a small town because it can cause sudden
population loss, and usually it's the wrong people who get run out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Garrison Keillor, in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times
(1994)

   WASHINGTON _ In a media-driven age when image so often defines
power, Chief Justice William Rehnquist is an anomaly: a powerful
man whose public image is so fuzzy he can walk the halls and
grounds of the Supreme Court, where he has served for 27 years,
without attracting a tourist's second glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are many imponderables about the impeachment trial
scheduled to start in the Senate in early January, but at least one
predictable result: If the trial of President Clinton indeed goes
forward as something more than a brief formality on the way to a
negotiated resolution, if it becomes the century's final televised
sensation, Rehnquist will emerge from the hide-in-plain-sight
existence of a Supreme Court justice into the glare of the public
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fascinating prospect, not only because this 74-year-old
amateur historian has written a book about two famous Senate
impeachment trials. ``Grand Inquests'' (William Morrow, 1992),
about the trials of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1805 and
President Andrew Johnson in 1868 _ both of which ended in
acquittals _ is belatedly in demand from people scanning for clues
to how the chief justice would conduct the trial of the president.
The book, largely anecdotal in approach, contains no such clues,
although it does display a decided skepticism about politically
driven impeachment, a category that indisputably fits both those
19th-century episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the coincidental fact of the chief justice as impeachment
specialist, or the novel fact of the chief justice on display in
every living room, is the intriguing prospect of watching a man
accustomed to being very much in charge of a very controllable
environment navigate in a realm where normal expectations don't
apply. When Rehnquist announces, as he often does when the red
light at the lawyers' podium comes on, ``Counsel, your time has
expired,'' the lawyer stops speaking, sometimes in mid-syllable,
and sits down. The chief justice, presiding over an impeachment
trial, can be overruled on any point, trivial or profound, by a
vote of 51 senators.
</P>
<P>
   While the Constitution gives the Senate ``the sole power to try
all impeachments,'' the trial is an odd amalgam of law and politics
that would feel distinctly unfamiliar to any federal judge. The 100
jurors, far from being a disinterested panel subject to challenge
for connections to parties in the case, have in many instances
broken bread with the defendant; some are his allies and other have
made their disapproval clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Rules of Evidence, under which much of the material
the House considered during its impeachment debate would be
excluded as hearsay, do not apply. The standard of proof _ ``beyond
a reasonable doubt'' in any real criminal trial _ is not specified.
The chief justice may rule on questions of evidence and procedure,
but at the end of the day a majority of the Senate has the final
word.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial itself is a curiosity, so is the role the
Constitution gives the chief justice. It is not really judicial at
all. The chief justice serves as presiding officer of the Senate, a
surrogate for the vice president, who presides over any
non-presidential impeachment trial but would have a conflict of
interest when the president is on trial. There is no expectation
that a vice president is even a lawyer, let alone a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because the language of law permeates the proceeding, it may
be impossible to separate William Rehnquist the chief justice from
William Rehnquist the surrogate presiding officer. In any event,
this is a man accustomed to command, and it is hard to imagine him
in the role of potted plant if the Senate overrides a procedural
ruling that he thinks is necessary or important for consistency or
regularity. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, who presided over the
only other presidential impeachment trial, that of Andrew Johnson,
threatened more than once to walk out if the Senate did not accept
an evidentiary ruling, and the Senate blinked; the trial could not
go on without him.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is which William Rehnquist will be on display.
There is a segment of the public that will forever see him as a
one-dimensional, law-and-order Nixonian (he served as an assistant
attorney general before his Supreme Court appointment by President
Richard Nixon in 1971) who embodies many of their concerns about
the direction of the court. He is a polarizing figure who drew 33
negative votes in the Senate after a testy confirmation hearing in
1986, when President Ronald Reagan elevated him from associate
justice to chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Rehnquist has not so much modulated his conservative
views as he has stood fast while the entire spectrum, political as
well as judicial, shifted to the right. It is not easy to portray
him as an extremist when Clinton signed a habeas corpus bill in
1996 that adopted Rehnquist's long-held position in favor of
reducing state prisoners' access to federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Although in the courtroom, Rehnquist can often appear the stern
task master, he has a dry wit and avid outside interests ranging
from poker to art (he absented himself from one of Reagan's State
of the Union speeches because it conflicted with a painting class
he was taking) to Gilbert and Sullivan operettas.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, he remodeled his basic black robe, adding four
gold stripes on each sleeve to copy the Lord Chancellor's costume
in a local production of ``Iolanthe.'' In addition to three
published books of history, he is the author of an unpublished
mystery novel.
</P>
<P>
   If his presence is indeed required in the Capitol, a few hundred
yards across First Street from the Supreme Court building, it is a
near certainty that the work of the court will go on with little
disruption. The chief justice is a fast writer and highly efficient
manager of his time and others'. Not one to agonize over hard
decisions, he takes the view that a second or third try rarely adds
much of value to the initial assessment of a question or a case.
The justices' weekly closed-door conferences, to discuss new and
pending cases, move along with dispatch, with conversation cut
quite short and details and disagreements left to be expressed
later in writing.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the chief justice had back surgery and
missed a conference, the job of presiding fell to John Paul
Stevens, the senior associate justice. It was the first time in
recent memory that the conference lasted through lunch.

   WASHINGTON _ In a media-driven age when image so often defines
power, Chief Justice William Rehnquist is an anomaly: a powerful
man whose public image is so fuzzy he can walk the halls and
grounds of the Supreme Court, where he has served for 27 years,
without attracting a tourist's second glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are many imponderables about the impeachment trial
scheduled to start in the Senate in early January, but at least one
predictable result: If the trial of President Clinton indeed goes
forward as something more than a brief formality on the way to a
negotiated resolution, if it becomes the century's final televised
sensation, Rehnquist will emerge from the hide-in-plain-sight
existence of a Supreme Court justice into the glare of the public

<P>
   High-school teachers are abuzz with reports that Latin, long
given up for dead, is actually showing a pulse. But the more
remarkable news in language circles may really be that millions of
American teen-agers continue to study French, despite _ and let's
be gentle about this _ the fading significance of France and the
French language.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that according to the most recent surveys, nearly 1 out
of every 4 American students who learn a foreign language in middle
school and high school still chooses French, a language spoken
fluently by only about 1 out of every 50 people on the planet. By
contrast, 1 percent of American teen-agers study Chinese or
Japanese, which combined are spoken by 20 percent of the world's
people.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as French has effectively ceded to English its
longtime standing as the first language of diplomacy, among other
crowns. So is French being taught out of proportion to its role in
the family of nations and the global economy?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brecht thinks so. He is the director of a group called
the National Council of Organizations of Less Commonly Taught
Languages, which represents anyone teaching languages other than
English, French, Spanish and German. He comes down particularly
hard on French (studied by 22 percent of teen-agers) and German (6
percent), saying he can think of no good reason to push them on so
many American students at the expense of Russian or Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only answer that makes sense, besides the fact that those
are the languages available, is that they are just so deeply
embedded in our cultural traditions,'' said Brecht. ``It becomes a
cultural argument, not a logical argument, and that's not an
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Brecht, a professor of Russian at the University of Maryland,
said it makes sense for Americans to know Spanish, which is ``our
second language'' and which two out of three teen-agers learn. So
too the languages of Asia and Russia because their actions have
social and economic consequences for the United States. Yet only
0.3 percent study Russian, 0.17 percent take Cantonese and Mandarin
and 0.77 percent Japanese, according to the American Council on the
Teaching of Foreign Languages.
</P>
<P>
   For the nation's middle and high schools, the reasons for
offering French are often quite basic. One is tradition: America's
love affair with French can be traced to 18th-century Southern
colonists, whose classical education included the language. Though
the world may have changed since then, a school's attempt to
broaden its language palette can be difficult, with the teachers
and time needed to offer Russian or Chinese or Arabic _ harder and
longer to master than French or Spanish _ in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year, Lake Forest High School in Felton, Del., a
small town near Dover, is offering Japanese to 10 students. But to
squeeze it into the curriculum _ to meet their language
requirement, roughly half the students take Spanish, the other half
French _ the class is given after school, via satellite from the
University of Georgia. The program costs $5,000, and the principal,
Michael Carr, said that the district could not have afforded it
without a federal grant.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, more than a few Francophiles who are
appalled at any suggestion that the importance of French is
declining. After all, French is necessary for translating the later
works of Voltaire, or even the earlier works of Celine Dion, a
French Canadian. And how would one know the difference between coq
au vin (chicken in wine sauce) and un joli coco (a stinker)?
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of French can be found even in traditionally
unfriendly places.
</P>
<P>
   A British official at the United Nations, who insisted on
anonymity so he would not be seen as a defender of the French, said
that French can occasionally be useful. ``If you want to impress
your girlfriend,'' he said, ``have a bit of French pillow talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding out another olive branch, he added, ``I don't think you
should necessarily be hard nosed, saying you should only learn a
language that is going to further your business interests. People
need an education to be enlightened, and French is part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But French has limited practicality, he conceded. ``I have
enough trouble in a cab in New York,'' he said. ``There, Urdu might
be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so for those traveling to Quebec, where French is a
necessity and the use of English is restricted on signs, or for
those interested in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Arenson, a ninth grader at the Fieldston School in the
Bronx, is in her third year of French, which she believes will help
her in becoming a ballerina. ``The steps that are done, they were
named in France, because that is sort of where ballet took hold,''
said Morgan, 14. ``We do little stories in French class. Someone
was throwing something and the book used the word jeter. I thought,
`Oh, I know what that is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Wilder, an 11th grader at the Kent School in Litchfield
County, Conn., could have chosen German, Spanish, Japanese or
Latin. While most of her classmates selected Spanish, she picked
French.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been told that French was the language of the
diplomats,'' she said, ``and that all high-powered people, such as
Madeleine Albright, spoke it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is in the area of diplomacy that French has suffered some
of its bitterest losses. While some in France continue to swat away
Americanized phrases like le stress and disque-jockey that have
slipped through their borders, delegates of former French colonies
from Africa and Southeast Asia are increasingly choosing to
communicate in English rather than French at official conclaves.
</P>
<P>
   And at the United Nations in 1996 the French lost a very public
battle to keep Kofi Annan of Ghana from succeeding Boutros
Boutros-Ghali as secretary-general. The French had objected because
Annan speaks French with an English accent.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps telling that Boutros-Ghali, an Egyptian who speaks
excellent French, is now secretary-general of La Francophonie in
Paris, which, he says, is seeking to ``promote solidarity'' among
52 nations that share French as a first, second or, in the case of
Egypt, third language.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother tongue is Arabic,'' Boutros-Ghali said, ``I write in
Arabic, dream in Arabic and have disputes with my wife in Arabic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But among the different languages,'' he added, ``I believe
French has a certain weight.''

   WASHINGTON _ Long after Americans stopped husbanding gasoline
and keeping the speedometer at 55, policy-makers here clung to a
national maximum speed limit, arguing that it saved lives. But that
limit, an artifact of the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo that was very
unpopular after the price of gasoline dropped, was eliminated three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Every state except Hawaii has since raised its highway speed
limit in what has become an unofficial test of the long-held belief
that speed kills. Three years into the test, the answer is still
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deaths from motor vehicle accidents is about the
same; 41,967 in 1997, 41,907 in 1996 and 41,798 in 1995. When
expressed as the number of deaths per million miles driven, the
death rate is actually down slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The data offer a Rohrshach test that is open to interpretation.
A recent opinion article in The Wall Street Journal by a journalist
and muscle-car enthusiast, Eric Peters, suggested that federal
officials liked the 55 mph limit because it gave the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration power over the states. Roads,
Peters supposed, were safer at faster speeds because a higher limit
reduced variations in speeds.
</P>
<P>
   But several traffic safety experts said they knew of no data
that would support Peters' argument. In fact, there is a dearth of
data on how posted limits affect speeds.
</P>
<P>
   These are only a few of the uncertainties of federal
traffic-safety statistics. For example, some statistics measure the
deaths on roads posted at 55 or 60 mph against those posted at 65
or higher. Others measure whether the overall number of miles of
road posted at 65 is growing and whether the overall number of
miles posted at 55 or 60 is declining. The agency does not keep
track of casualty figures for a single stretch of road when its
limit rose to 70 from 55.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tried to keep track of a single stretch of road, starting
in January 1996, when highway speeds reverted to a daytime 70 mph
and 60 at night. A study produced by the Texas Transportation
Institute, a state agency, found that by March 1997 there were 9
percent more crashes on rural, multi-lane undivided highways; 33
percent more on rural, two-lane state highways and U.S.-numbered
routes. But the report failed to find a significant increase in
fatalities on these and most Interstate highways.
</P>
<P>
   The finding runs counter to the predictions of most traffic
engineers, who say crashes at higher speeds are likely to be more
severe. The study's researchers said the sample size might be too
small to capture an increase in deaths, which are less common than
accidents that involve non-fatal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA told Congress in a report in February that states that
increased their limits in 1996 recorded about 350 more Interstate
fatalities than before, a jump of about 9 percent. The agency said
the increase in fatalities was smaller than the estimated change
after 1987, when Congress enabled states to raise the limit on
rural Interstates to 65 from 55.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have done even better in terms of the overall numbers
had the speed-limit increases not been as pervasive,'' said Philip
Recht, deputy administrator of the NHTSA, referring to the
reduction in fatalities. ``The simple fact that the total number of
fatalities remained the same or even dipped in any year does not
tell you what the impact of the speed limit increases is.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the deadliest roads _ rural two-lane blacktops with
sharp curves and no shoulders _ were not affected by the end of the
national speed limit, in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   Another data point, which could yield a variety of
interpretations, comes from Canada. Speed limits there, which are
set by the individual provinces, are essentially unchanged,
although vehicle registrations and drivers have approximately
doubled in 20 years, according to Derek Sweet, director of road
safety at Transport Canada, a government agency. But deaths
declined by about half, he said. Last year they were 3,064, down
from 3,082 in 1996 and 3,347 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complex business,'' Sweet said. ``It's really difficult
to attribute it to any single element, with the exception of
seat-belt wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Transport Canada sponsored a study that said ``it cannot be
decisively concluded that changing the posted speed limit will
result in a change in collisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In this country, experts say drunken driving is declining, more
cars have air bags and the use of seat belts is rising, although it
still lags Canada's level. George Black, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board, added another reason for fewer deaths:
an increase in the number of ambulances with advanced life-support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when Black was a highway safety official in
Georgia, he said, ``they put you in a former hearse driven by a
person who liked to drive fast; he took you to the hospital and
hung around waiting to see if you died or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But changes in the limits can have unexpected effects, he said.
In 1974, when the 55 mph limit started, Georgia took some roads
that were posted for 60 miles an hour in daytime and 50 at night,
and converted them to 55 at all times. Most fatal accidents happen
at night, he said, and raising the night-time limit to 55 should
have produced more deaths, but it led to fewer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason may not have been the limit at all, he said, but
related changes. ``During this period of time, gas lines were out,
gas prices were up and sometimes you had a choice of whether you're
going to buy gas or buy a case of beer and stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question is enforcement. A vigorously enforced 65-mile
limit could cut speeds more than an indifferently enforced 55-mile
limit, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, which in May became the 48th state to raise the
speed limit, the penalty for exceeding the 65-mile limit by 5 miles
an hour is $154 _ if you are caught.

130 YEARS LATER, DUELING WITH JEFFERSON DAVIS' HEIRS

<P>
   The words, spoken by a Mississippi congressman during the peak
of the Reagan era, first to a gathering of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans and later to a magazine that extols the virtues of the
Confederacy, hardly have the sound of mainstream politics:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a lot of the fundamental principles that
Jefferson Davis believed in are very important to people across the
country, and they apply to the Republican Party,'' the congressman
told Southern Partisan magazine in 1984. He added that the
Republican agenda ``from tax policy, to foreign policy, from
individual rights to neighborhood security are things that
Jefferson Davis and his people believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the impeachment of President Clinton moves inexorably to
the Senate, those statements by Trent Lott, who is now the majority
leader of the Senate, serve as a reminder of a striking link
between the impeachment of Clinton and the only other presidential
impeachment, that of Andrew Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Both played out on a sharp regional fault line. For Johnson, the
divide reflected the aftermath of the Civil War. The issues
surrounding Clinton's statements under oath about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky have nothing to do with North and South, but
they come at a time when conservative Southerners hold virtually
all of the Republican leadership positions in Congress. Southerners
have also been the prime advocates of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The revulsion over Clinton's conduct crosses both sides of the
aisle, and Southerners have no monopoly on the sentiment that if
Clinton lied under oath, he should be removed from office. Still,
these two cases of presidential impeachment, 130 years apart, show
how potent the regional political divide can be.
</P>
<P>
   Last week when New York Gov. George Pataki decried the
``horrible blunders'' of Republicans in Washington, he was
referring, whether consciously or not, to a congressional
delegation as dominated by angry Southerners as the Republicans of
Johnson's era were dominated by vengeful Northerners intent on
punishing the defeated South through Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been surprised that there's been so little discussion of
how much this whole process has been driven by the Southernization
of the Republican Party,'' said Dan Carter, a historian at Emory
University in Atlanta. ``Maybe it's like the purloined letter: It's
sitting there on the shelf right in front of you, so you don't see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Southerner as Johnson was, has his harshest critics
in his native South, where the values that inflame conservatives
are most intense. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found
support for impeachment higher in the South than in any other part
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the Congress that ended with the president's impeachment, the
Republicans in the House had a speaker, Newt Gingrich, from
Georgia; a majority leader, Dick Armey, from Texas, and a majority
whip, Tom DeLay, from Texas. The Senate's majority leader, Lott,
won his job by defeating the other senator from Mississippi, Thad
Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich stepped down, Bob Livingston of Louisiana was
designated to succeed him. Impeachment's first and most vocal
proponent has been Bob Barr of Georgia, and the possibility of
censure was ruled out as an option by DeLay, who stepped into the
leadership vacuum left by Gingrich's decision to step down.
Livingston has since announced his own resignation after
acknowledging extramarital infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a Texan, began his tenure
amid furious controversy when it was revealed that Sens. Jesse
Helms and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina met with David Sentelle
of North Carolina, Helms' protege and the conservative judge who
heads the appellate panel that appointed Starr, before Starr was
named.
</P>
<P>
   The only non-Southern Republican who has played a major role in
the House has been Henry Hyde of Illinois, the chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee. But Hyde has always voted like a
Southerner, with a 100 percent rating by the Christian Coalition
and a legislative career most identified with his support of a ban
on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Historians, though, tend to see more differences than
similarities between the two impeachments.
</P>
<P>
   Carter of Emory notes that Johnson's impeachment revolved around
profound national issues, with House Republicans bitterly opposing
the president's lenient approach to the South's re-entry to the
Union and his relative indifference to the rights of 3.5 million
newly emancipated blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to denigrate perjury as an issue,'' Carter said,
``but I think you have to keep your eye on the triviality of the
issues here compared to those of 1868.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Eric Foner, the Columbia University historian, said
both efforts grew out of deeply held animus toward the president
with impeachment a vehicle for much broader divisions. But
Johnson's impeachment reflected profound political differences, he
said. Clinton has largely adopted many of the conservative
positions of those who detest him, Foner said. And he noted that
the regional divide now is less North and South and more the
burgeoning suburbs of the South and West versus the older areas of
the Northeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said a more revealing comparison than Johnson's
impeachment was the Democratic Party of the 1850s. ``It became so
totally dominated by Southerners, it led the South to disaster,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is a risk for Republicans now as they fly in the
face of public opinion is something many politicians are pondering.
</P>
<P>
   Many Southerners revel in the South's new-found Republicanism.
One T-shirt shows the Confederate battle flag in the form of a
Republican elephant with the words ``Lincoln's Worst Nightmare!''
The back features the flags of the Southern states and the words
``A States Rights Republican Majority From Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans worry about appearing too Southern. Some
see the likely election of Dennis Hastert of Illinois as the next
speaker as an attempt, at least in part, to provide more balance
for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, regional passions need not be faulty ones. Historians
generally think that impeaching Johnson may have been a mistake,
but the so-called radical Republicans were correct in their outrage
over his policies. Today's Republicans may be proved right for
their outrage toward Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the current cast of Southern Republicans can lead
the GOP to long-term majority status is another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can sell the Republicans as the party of
Jefferson Davis and have a viable national party,'' said Merle
Black, an Emory political scientist.

the GOP to long-term majority status is another question.

WHY WAS AIDS ALMOST UNNOTICED FOR DECADES?

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The earliest confirmed case of
infection with HIV-1, the virus that causes most AIDS cases around
the world, is in a blood sample taken from an African man in 1959,
in what was then the Belgian Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, DNA analysts at the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center in New York, comparing that sample with others and
calculating mutation rates, estimated that the killer virus came
into existence sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, what happened? Where did it go? How could
the virus, which is now threatening to kill a quarter of some
African countries, have gone virtually unnoticed for 20 years _ and
then emerged in America, decimating gay men and hemophiliacs in the
1980s and starting on a ruthless march of conquest around the
world?
</P>
<P>
   Was it a failure of medical detection? Racist indifference to
Africa by the West? Something in the rapidly mutating virus itself?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is: No one knows for sure. But there are pretty
good theories.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the epidemic is a jigsaw puzzle of helpful and
unhelpful facts, disproven former ``facts'' and a lot of notions,
both scientific and paranoid. Each new fact sweeps big chunks of
the puzzle onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, it's probably the most geopolitically
touchy disease since porphyria drove England's 18th-century kings
mad. It makes the bubonic plague look politically correct. Everyone
hates rats and fleas, but AIDS can't be discussed without talking
about matters at the core of human nature, desire or habit: sex,
blood, homosexuality, heroin-shooting, walking skeletons, brain
viruses, even monkey-eating.
</P>
<P>
   The most paranoid theory _ that the disease was created in a
U.S. Army germ warfare lab built in Maryland in 1977 _ was exposed
as KGB propaganda first published in 1985. This latest DNA
analysis, performed last February, demonstrates that the disease
long predates the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists have long thought that the HIV virus came from
African monkeys. Several varieties of SIV (simian immunodeficiency
virus) have existed harmlessly, probably for thousands of years, in
green monkeys, mangabeys and baboons, but not in Asian or South
American monkeys. Monkeys are eaten in the central African rain
forest, and raw monkey brain is said to be a delicacy in parts of
Zaire, just as it is in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that the virus jumped to humans who had eaten
or butchered monkeys, or had been bitten by monkeys. That could
have happened any time _ or many times _ in the last 10,000 years.
It probably happened at least three times, because HIV-2, the
weaker strain prevalent in Guinea-Bissau, is closely related to the
SIV in local mangabeys. The same is true for HIV-O, a rare strain
found in Cameroon. Neither is genetically close to HIV-1, the
virulent strain that has been killing people from central Africa to
San Francisco to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   But HIV-1 didn't necessarily jump to humans as a killer. Some
scientists believe a weak early form was caught by European
colonists as early as 1900, and one scientist blames it for an
outbreak of PCP pneumonia, which is associated with AIDS, in
Danzig, Germany, in 1939. Others are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, probably west of Lake Victoria, and sometime,
possibly in the 1940s, HIV-1 mutated inside a human host into an
attacker of T-cells and rapid destroyer of immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   It must have spread very slowly at first, in rural areas. It
certainly was not killing large numbers of Africans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the disease had been widespread in the 1950s and 1960s,
there were enough experienced clinicians in Africa to have noticed
something like that going on,'' said Dr. Anne Buve, an
epidemiologist with the Institute for Tropical Medicine in Antwerp,
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Some time in the 1960s or 1970s, said Dr. Peter Piot, a former
researcher in Zaire who is now the executive director of UNAIDS in
Geneva, the virus probably moved out of Zaire's rural areas to the
cities, and then spread from the continent.
</P>
<P>
   It may have gone to Haiti with the French-speaking Haitians who
filled up Zaire's civil service after the Belgians fled in 1960. It
may have gone straight to America, perhaps with the Peace Corps. It
may have gone to Cuba with soldiers returning from northern Angola.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it ultimately came to public attention because it
somehow got into a population vastly different from central
Africa's. The gay communities in San Francisco and New York were
small and insular. Anal sex and promiscuity sped the virus through
them. Gay Americans were also well educated, well served by doctors
and well organized in a civil rights struggle. When mysterious
deaths began to hit, they noticed immediately and shouted loudly.
Within five years of the late 1970s, when fears focused on rumors
of ``gay cancer,'' the disease had a name and its virus had been
found. Books and TV movies followed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Africa, AIDS was making steady progress, but with
less public attention. As early as 1981, doctors in Paris and
Brussels diagnosed it among wealthy Zaireans treated in Europe. By
1983, doctors from the Institute for Tropical Medicine and the
Centers for Disease Control were hunting it in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   As Mirko Grmek's ``History of AIDS'' (Princeton University
Press, 1990) describes a 1985 conference on African AIDS, only a
few cases had been confirmed in Africa. ``Belgian and French
physicians attending the meeting insisted a true epidemic was under
way,'' Grmek wrote. ``The representatives of affected countries
took offense and insisted on denying the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Another quirk: most of the first hard-hit countries were
Francophone, to which the British and U.S. press pay less
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, more facts turned up. A Danish surgeon who died in 1977,
apparently of AIDS, had worked in rural Zaire from 1972 to 1975. An
increase in Kaposi's sarcoma dating to mid-century was recalled.
More aggressive Kaposi's hit Zambia and Uganda in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers traveled through remote western Uganda in 1985
to study ``slim disease,'' which appeared in the early 1980s, they
brought new AIDS-test kits, and all 29 ``slim'' victims proved
HIV-positive. A 1987 study by Piot of 454 blood samples frozen
after a 1976 Ebola virus outbreak in Zaire found five HIV-positive
ones.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS migrated out along truck routes, hitting hardest in border
towns where truckers wait for days to clear customs. It was also
still mutating; _ there are now 10 subgroups of HIV-1, all fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new question is stumping scientists: Why is AIDS hitting
eastern and southern Africa so much harder than it did the area
where it originated? Among pregnant women visiting clinics in
Kinshasa, the capital of Congo, and nearby Yaounde, Cameroon,
infection rates reached a plateau that was below 10 percent. But in
eastern and southern African cities from Kampala, Uganda, to
Richard's Bay, South Africa, they have hit 30 percent and are still
rising.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why. The virus may have mutated. Southern Africans
may have less resistant genes. There may be something in sexual
habits, venereal disease rates, circumcision practices.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out exactly where it all started, some scientists say,
is less important. ``People have become pretty pragmatic,'' Buve
said. ``They are asking, `Do we need to know? Let's rather look at
the future.' ''

THE STALEMATE LIVES ON AFTER THE BOMBING
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's predicament with Iraq is painfully familiar
to anyone who was ever a kid and tried the line, ``If you don't
stop that, I'm gonna hit you.'' Ideally, the adversary backed down.
But sometimes he didn't, leaving you no choice but to smack him.
And then, if he was still at it, you had a problem. Either you went
at him again, this time for keeps, or you backed down.
</P>
<P>
   These are games Middle Eastern leaders know exceedingly well,
and play with devilish effect.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, that is not how the administration is painting its
predicament in the wake of the 70-hour bombing of Saddam Hussein's
Iraq. In a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday, National
Security Adviser Samuel Berger declared outright victory: ``For
Saddam, 1998 was the year to break out of the box he has been in,
the year to end containment. He has failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger's logic was that the policy of containment rested on four
pillars: economic sanctions, United Nations inspections, the
credible use of force and ``diplomacy to sustain an international
consensus in pursuit of this goal.'' When Saddam tried to shake one
pillar, the inspection system, he effectively challenged them all.
So if the United States failed to respond with force, ``there would
be no deterrence against future aggression, because the threat of
force would no longer be credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Berger declared, Saddam had been shown he could not shake
off containment. Therefore, the United States had achieved its
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Berger marshaled considerable arguments in support of this
contention, from a list of damage done by the bombing, to the
interesting claim that international sanctions have benefited the
Iraqi people, because under the policy of allowing Iraq to trade
oil directly for food, the people were getting food, and not tanks,
for their oil.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with these arguments is that the threat of force _
like threatening to smack a pesky kid, or building a nuclear
deterrent _ works best so long as it remains a threat. If used, it
had best be used decisively, or the pest may prove far harder to
dislodge the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of damage to Saddam's military and civil
structures is not clear yet, and it is possible that the dictator
is reeling from a lucky punch, or that his opponents now see more
clearly the advantages of an Iraq without Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   But the information from Washington and Baghdad suggests that
Saddam is still firmly in place. As a result, two other pillars of
the U.S. containment policy _ U.N. inspections and international
consensus _ are wobbling. Saddam has left no doubt that he will not
let U.N. arms inspectors back in easily, while the growing
resistance from Russia, China and, to a lesser degree, France will
make it harder for America to sustain the full range of economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we showed that we were prepared to use force, but we
didn't show that we figured out how to use force as part of a
larger strategy,'' said Richard Haass, director of foreign policy
studies at the Brookings Institution. ``We haven't lost sanctions,
but the 70 hours of strikes clearly will lead to a further erosion
of support for sanctions. I think we can keep the bulk of sanctions
_ the ban on military imports, international control on revenues _
but increasingly Iraq can export whatever it wants, and import much
of what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if we add it up, by using force without apparent purpose,
it's hard to argue that the U.S. has gained over the last two
weeks. We've lost ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake, Haass argued, was not in the use of force, in which
the United States had no choice, but in trying to play it safe in
choosing a strike limited in time and scope. The short-term
advantage was that by defining a limited goal, in this case
punishment, the administration was certain of success. The very
fact of launching a strike achieved the stated goal.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage is that the United States is now left with a
new range of problems, all of them unsavory.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam keeps the door closed to inspectors from the U.N.
Special Commission, or Unscom, the United States will either have
to agree to a different and less intrusive form of inspections, or
it will have to bash Saddam again. Weakening Unscom would almost
certainly prompt Saddam to test his new limits. If the United
States does opt for force, the attack is certain to be even less
popular than the last one, and Washington will be under heavy
pressure to set more ambitious goals _ a palpable blow to Iraq's
arms program, or a firm agreement from Saddam to allow
unconditional inspections, or his fall.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Russia, China and France, supported by much of the Third
World, would be likely to generate pressure at the U.N. Security
Council for a loosening of sanctions, which Washington is not
likely to withstand. That, in turn, would tempt Saddam to seek ways
of creating more friction in the crumbling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Saddam also narrows his options every time he
challenges the United States. The fact that he did not immediately
take reporters to sites of U.S. bomb attacks suggest they must have
been effective. And if Unscom is not allowed to inspect suspicious
sites, the United States will have more incentive, and
justifcation, to bomb them.
</P>
<P>
   As Berger put it, Saddam ``has learned that what cannot be
inspected can, in many cases, be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   A second consequence of the raids is that the United States has
finally begun talking openly of ousting Saddam. In the past, the
common wisdom was that toppling him in the absence of a viable
opposition would create a dangerous power vacuum in a pivotal part
of the Middle East, in which ethnic and religious factions and
neighboring states would inevitably fall at each others' throats.
But as Saddam resists every attempt to curb his ambitions,
overthrowing him may come to be seen as the lesser evil.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Berger conceded that air attacks weren't enough
to dislodge Saddam, and that the United States was not now prepared
to pay the high cost of the required military operation d, nor of
the occupation that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact that Saddam can foment discord in the Security
Council and anti-U.S. sentiments in the Arab world has not meant
that he is making new friends or allies. Quite the contrary: All
the disputes over Saddam have been about how to make him behave,
not about the fact of his misbehavior, and the consensus among
experts on the Middle East is that leaders the world over, from
Europe to the Middle East, would now breathe a deep sigh of relief
if he were toppled.
</P>
<P>
   So the standoff continues, with the latest clash generating only
more unknowns. As a dictator, Saddam probably measures success in
terms of the confrontations he has withstood and the democratic
leaders he has outlasted.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he finds it heartening at times to tick off the names
and fates of Western leaders who have challenged him: George Bush,
defeated. Margaret Thatcher, defeated. Francois Mitterrand, dead.
Bill Clinton, impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States can also find solace in precedent. ``We
know from experience that when people struggling for freedom gain
the moral and material support of the American people, they usually
prevail in the end,'' Berger declared. ``Change will come to Iraq,
at a time and in a manner that we can influence but not predict.''

<P>
   Berger marshaled considerable arguments in support of this
contention, from a list of damage done by the bombing, to the
interesting claim that international sanctions have benefited the
Iraqi people, because under the policy of allowing Iraq to trade
oil directly for food, the people were getting food, and not tanks,
for their oil.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with these arguments is that the threat of force _
like threatening to smack a pesky kid, or building a nuclear
deterrent _ works best so long as it remains a threat. If used, it
had best be used decisively, or the pest may prove far harder to
dislodge the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of damage to Saddam's military and civil
structures is not clear yet, and it is possible that the dictator
is reeling from a lucky punch, or that his opponents now see more
clearly the advantages of an Iraq without Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   But the information from Washington and Baghdad suggests that
Saddam is still firmly in place. As a result, two other pillars of
the U.S. containment policy _ U.N. inspections and international
consensus _ are wobbling. Saddam has left no doubt that he will not
let U.N. arms inspectors back in easily, while the growing
resistance from Russia, China and, to a lesser degree, France will
make it harder for America to sustain the full range of economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we showed that we were prepared to use force, but we
didn't show that we figured out how to use force as part of a
larger strategy,'' said Richard Haass, director of foreign policy
studies at the Brookings Institution. ``We haven't lost sanctions,
but the 70 hours of strikes clearly will lead to a further erosion
of support for sanctions. I think we can keep the bulk of sanctions
_ the ban on military imports, international control on revenues _
but increasingly Iraq can export whatever it wants, and import much
of what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if we add it up, by using force without apparent purpose,
it's hard to argue that the U.S. has gained over the last two
weeks. We've lost ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The mistake, Haass argued, was not in the use of force, in which
the United States had no choice, but in trying to play it safe in
choosing a strike limited in time and scope. The short-term
advantage was that by defining a limited goal, in this case
punishment, the administration was certain of success. The very
fact of launching a strike achieved the stated goal.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage is that the United States is now left with a
new range of problems, all of them unsavory.
</P>
<P>
   If Saddam keeps the door closed to inspectors from the U.N.
Special Commission, or Unscom, the United States will either have
to agree to a different and less intrusive form of inspections, or
it will have to bash Saddam again. Weakening Unscom would almost
certainly prompt Saddam to test his new limits. If the United
States does opt for force, the attack is certain to be even less
popular than the last one, and Washington will be under heavy
pressure to set more ambitious goals _ a palpable blow to Iraq's
arms program, or a firm agreement from Saddam to allow
unconditional inspections, or his fall.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Russia, China and France, supported by much of the Third
World, would be likely to generate pressure at the U.N. Security
Council for a loosening of sanctions, which Washington is not
likely to withstand. That, in turn, would tempt Saddam to seek ways
of creating more friction in the crumbling coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Saddam also narrows his options every time he
challenges the United States. The fact that he did not immediately
take reporters to sites of U.S. bomb attacks suggest they must have
been effective. And if Unscom is not allowed to inspect suspicious
sites, the United States will have more incentive, and
justification, to bomb them.
</P>
<P>
   As Berger put it, Saddam ``has learned that what cannot be
inspected can, in many cases, be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   A second consequence of the raids is that the United States has
finally begun talking openly of ousting Saddam. In the past, the
common wisdom was that toppling him in the absence of a viable
opposition would create a dangerous power vacuum in a pivotal part
of the Middle East, in which ethnic and religious factions and
neighboring states would inevitably fall at each others' throats.
But as Saddam resists every attempt to curb his ambitions,
overthrowing him may come to be seen as the lesser evil.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Berger conceded that air attacks weren't enough
to dislodge Saddam, and that the United States was not now prepared
to pay the high cost of the required military operation d, nor of
the occupation that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact that Saddam can foment discord in the Security
Council and anti-U.S. sentiments in the Arab world has not meant
that he is making new friends or allies. Quite the contrary: All
the disputes over Saddam have been about how to make him behave,
not about the fact of his misbehavior, and the consensus among
experts on the Middle East is that leaders the world over, from
Europe to the Middle East, would now breathe a deep sigh of relief
if he were toppled.
</P>
<P>
   So the standoff continues, with the latest clash generating only
more unknowns. As a dictator, Saddam probably measures success in
terms of the confrontations he has withstood and the democratic
leaders he has outlasted.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he finds it heartening at times to tick off the names
and fates of Western leaders who have challenged him: George Bush,
defeated. Margaret Thatcher, defeated. Francois Mitterrand, dead.
Bill Clinton, impeached.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States can also find solace in precedent. ``We
know from experience that when people struggling for freedom gain
the moral and material support of the American people, they usually
prevail in the end,'' Berger declared. ``Change will come to Iraq,
at a time and in a manner that we can influence but not predict.''

<P>
   U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf are vaccinated against deadly
germs. So are FBI agents who are probing a growing number of
biological incidents. So are some White House officials.
</P>
<P>
   Protections against living weapons are new to the military and
security of the United States, and they raise troubling questions.
</P>
<P>
   Is this prudence or paranoia? Should everyone be vaccinated? How
real is the threat? Aren't deadly germs nearly impossible for
attackers to use without hurting themselves? Isn't this threat just
another bogeyman, like so many before?
</P>
<P>
   Germ weapons, though around for centuries, have played no
significant role in modern warfare and terrorism. Skeptics point to
this history and say that biological strikes of any consequence are
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Washington from President Clinton on down are
taking the issue very seriously, with thousands of people and
billions of dollars in motion to address the germ threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, this is going to hurt us,'' said Robert Blitzer,
who recently left the FBI after directing its section on domestic
terrorism. ``There's no question in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a yearlong inquiry by The New York Times revealed
trends that suggest the era of germ tranquility may indeed be
ending:
</P>
<P>
   _ Uprooted weapon scientists from Iraq, Russia and South Africa
are hunting for new jobs and spreading germ secrets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Radical states with reputations for supporting terror, such as
Iran and Libya, are seeking germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, are increasingly
interested in pestilential germs. Some boast openly of being able
to kill foes with deadly plagues.
</P>
<P>
   Today, officials in Washington stress that they know of no
imminent danger, even while acknowledging the limitations of
intelligence. Most agree that the threat, while low, is growing.
</P>
<P>
   The defenses that Washington is quietly erecting, officials say,
are akin to the insurance that homeowners take out against floods
and earthquakes. The odds may be small, this argument goes, but
precautions are warranted since conditions are changing and damage
could be great.
</P>
<P>
   R. James Woolsey, director of Central Intelligence from 1993 to
1995, is among the former officials who are worried. Germ
terrorism, he said in an interview, is ``the single most dangerous
threat to our national security in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Germ weapons can be hard to make and use, contrary to myth and
claim. It took the United States decades to master the art before
renouncing such arms in 1969. In the early 1990s, Aum Shinrikyo, a
Japanese cult, launched at least nine germ attacks in Tokyo that
were meant to kill millions. But the strikes produced no known
injuries or deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous to the attacker as well as the attacked if successful,
germ weapons are considered most practical when used far from the
aggressor's homeland; intervening land and sea establish what
amounts to a quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   The main appeal of such weapons is that they are incredibly
cheap compared to chemical and atomic arms. Yet pound for pound,
germ weapons rival nuclear ones for maiming and killing, and some
biological agents are considered superior in that regard; in theory
they can annihilate many millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, they surpass their nuclear kin as an instrument of
fright and disruption: Once sown, infections can spread
unpredictably, since they are alive. Experts especially worry about
smallpox, which is highly contagious and seen as particularly
dangerous since few people are now immunized against its ravages.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say the threat is low is not to minimize its potential,''
said Neil Gallagher, assistant director for national security at
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the secrets of germ warfare are increasingly up for grabs
as weapon scientists from countries that made biological arsenals
hunt for new jobs. The nomads are from Iraq (starting in 1991 after
Persian Gulf war), Russia (starting in 1992 after the Soviet
collapse) and South Africa (starting in 1994 as apartheid fell
apart). Russia alone has many thousands of former germ warriors
increasingly cold, poor and hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Legitimate science also heightens the risk. The global war
against infectious disease has produced more than 1,500 germ banks
that tend to trade freely in deadly microbes.
</P>
<P>
   Future strides could make matters even worse. Experts agree that
research into the genetic foundations of life, an approach that
promises to cure many diseases, might, in evil hands, one day
produce weapons that work against only certain races or ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult but not impossible,'' said Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, a Nobel laureate in biology who advises Washington on
germ warfare. More unsettling, he added, is that traditional
killers seem to be a growing danger right now; he called them ``a
monster in the back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at least 17 nations are suspected of having or trying to
acquire germ weapons. Perhaps they want to deter foes. The wild
card is that some (Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria) are
also considered architects of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Libya worked hard to join the germ club. In 1994, it sought to
hire scientists fleeing South Africa's crumbling program, including
its head, Dr. Wouter Basson. That move, officials say, was foiled
by diplomatic pressure from Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
   However, Libya may have succeeded in hiring (or perhaps hiding
and employing for Baghdad) Dr. Amir Medidi, a top scientist of
Iraq's germ effort, U.N. inspectors revealed.

   Terrorists themselves seem increasingly drawn to germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden, the renegade Saudi millionaire known for his
bitter hatred of America, is investigating them, U.S. officials
say. Whether his work has resulted in secret laboratories or usable
arms, no one in Washington seems to know or is willing to say.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Asad al-Tamimi, an Islamic radical, has been vocal. Early
this year Al-Balad, a Jordanian newspaper, quoted him as saying
that ``jihad'' had at last discovered how to win the holy war _
lethal germs.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly, growing interest abroad is shared by domestic
radicals and militia groups at home. Catalogs catering to them
carry ads for such books as ``Guide to Germ Warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wayne Harris, an Ohioan with a history of hate-group
affiliations, was arrested in 1995 for having bought plague
bacteria from a germ bank under false pretenses. A registered
microbiologist, he now says the microbes were strictly for
defensive purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are groups all over the world after this kind of
stuff,'' Harris said, his blue eyes icy. ``You're not going to stop
germ warfare. The only thing to do is defend yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence experts say knowing the truth is hard. Spies and
satellites are only marginally helpful for ferreting out biological
gear as small as kitchen cookware that is easy to hide and whose
purpose can be peaceful (unlike the nuclear arms, bombers, ships,
missiles and factories that dominated the Cold War). Even hundreds
of arms inspectors in Iraq, who probed that nation for seven years,
ended up with as many questions as answers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the attention focused on germ warfare has already
helped give rise to germ hoaxes, and experts worry that serious
concern might give way to complacency. This year, the FBI is
fighting a wave of false anthrax threats in letters mailed to
abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials note that Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, mastermind of
the 1993 New York World Trade Center blast, which killed six people
and injured more than 1,000, claimed that his goal was to have one
tower fall into the other and kill a quarter million people _ more
than died in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   A top former official disclosed that Yousef, when arrested in
1995, was found to have been studying not only chemical but
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   John Gannon, chairman of the National Intelligence Council of
the CIA, last month told a Stanford University meeting that the
danger of germ and chemical devastation is rising.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that terrorists and foes with such weapons are growing
in number and that the increasingly lethal agents they are
developing ``have the potential to cause massive casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are struggling to tighten commerce in germs
both at home and abroad. President Clinton himself recently raised
the issue at Camp David with Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, who has begun a program to restrict germ sales.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, Washington is expanding cooperative programs meant to
keep former germ warriors in place doing peaceful research.
</P>
<P>
   In NATO, Washington is arguing that the Atlantic alliance should
take the lead in a global fight to stop terrorists from getting or
using germ weaponry. .
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. military is vaccinating all troops against
anthrax, which causes high fevers and death, and has begun a $322
million program to build stockpiles of 18 other vaccines, including
one against smallpox. Recently, Congress approved $51 million to
start building domestic stockpiles of medicines and antibiotics,
especially for police, fire and health workers.
</P>
<P>
   Physical security at key federal buildings is being enhanced to
foil terrorists who might try to spread deadly germs and chemicals
through the air. The steps include ventilation improvements so a
gentle breeze blows outward whenever a door or window is opened. In
theory, this so-called positive pressure will automatically sweep
away dangerous agents.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, federal officials are holding seminars in
the nation's top 120 cities to train emergency personnel.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, intelligence agencies are struggling to monitor
terrorists more closely. The FBI's nightmare is talented loners,
who are difficult to track.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is weighing whether to ask the president to
authorize appointment of a military commander who could plan and
direct operations to defend the continental United States in the
event of germ chaos, a step beyond the civil defenses of the early
Cold War. No such commander's post now exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within minutes of an event, people are going to turn to us,''
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre told a meeting of military
officials in explaining the need for homeland defense. ``It could
get crazy very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, there has been little public debate over the risks and
benefits of such actions, partly because the many responses to the
germ threat have been both quiet, to avoid frightening Americans,
and piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   But that may change as echoes of bomb shelters start to
reverberate and as Washington scans the horizon to better judge the
danger in the years and decades ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Tension is sure to rise between the need for protection and
``rights to privacy, something that we hold very dear,'' Defense
Secretary William Cohen recently told the Council on Foreign
Relations. That kind of friction, he added, will force ``unpleasant
choices'' in the near future. ``We haven't really faced up to it
yet.''

anthrax, which causes high fevers and death, and has begun a $322
million program to build stockpiles of 18 other vaccines, including
one against smallpox. Recently, Congress approved $51 million to
start building domestic stockpiles of medicines and antibiotics,
especially for police, fire and health workers.
</P>
<P>
   Physical security at key federal buildings is being enhanced to
foil terrorists who might try to spread deadly germs and chemicals
through the air. The steps include ventilation improvements so a
gentle breeze blows outward whenever a door or window is opened. In
theory, this so-called positive pressure will automatically sweep
away dangerous agents.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, federal officials are holding seminars in
the nation's top 120 cities to train emergency personnel.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, intelligence agencies are struggling to monitor
terrorists more closely. The FBI's nightmare is talented loners,
who are difficult to track.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is weighing whether to ask the president to
authorize appointment of a military commander who could plan and
direct operations to defend the continental United States in the
event of germ chaos, a step beyond the civil defenses of the early
Cold War. No such commander's post now exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within minutes of an event, people are going to turn to us,''
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre told a meeting of military
officials in explaining the need for homeland defense. ``It could
get crazy very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, there has been little public debate over the risks and
benefits of such actions, partly because the many responses to the
germ threat have been both quiet, to avoid frightening Americans,
and piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   But that may change as echoes of bomb shelters start to
reverberate and as Washington scans the horizon to better judge the
danger in the years and decades ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Tension is sure to rise between the need for protection and
``rights to privacy, something that we hold very dear,'' Defense
Secretary William Cohen recently told the Council on Foreign
Relations. That kind of friction, he added, will force ``unpleasant
choices'' in the near future. ``We haven't really faced up to it
yet.''

   The International Time Capsule Society has a few things it would
like you to know about your contribution to this millennium's
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have long held a canine enthusiasm for burying
objects of value for later discovery, they lack a sense of
``stewardship,'' according to one of the society's founders, Knute
Berger. Of the tens of thousands of time capsules already buried
across the United States, most will be lost, destroyed or otherwise
prevented from passing on their legacy, Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   One rule is not to tell too many people _ or too few, for that
matter. In Westport, Fla., for example, the first headmaster of an
elementary school buried a commemorative capsule in 1947 and left a
note specifying its content and the year of its intended
disinterment, 1997. But the headmaster neglected to denote its
location.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilkinsburg, Pa., a church capsule was carefully concealed
from vandals and remains concealed from everyone else, too, after a
century. People have been known to uncover one container while
trying to bury another.
</P>
<P>
   A box meant to commemorate the 1960 opening of a general store
in Walnut Creek, Calif., was planted in a four-foot concrete
pedestal with a brass plaque announcing both its contents
(prognostications of the future by town citizens) and its opening
(November 2000). Last July the entire structure was removed by
vandals with sledgehammers.
</P>
<P>
   Time capsules must be interred with an eye to the distant
future, of course. Local scholars attended the 1995 excavation of a
century-old capsule in New Zealand with interest because it held
historical papers. But all they found was muddy water and a button.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, even the rocket scientists at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology remain at a loss as to how to
disinter a capsule buried on campus in 1889 that somehow wound up
beneath their cyclotron (which was constructed in the 1930s).
</P>
<P>
   It's also dangerous to trust in the wisdom of future
generations. In Orlando, the opening of a hundred-year-old
courthouse cornerstone was so eagerly anticipated this year that
the city planned to raze the building and replace it with a museum
in which the contents of the capsule could be exhibited. When the
courthouse was demolished, though, the smallish copper box in the
cornerstone was apparently dumped in a landfill along with the rest
of the debris.
</P>
<P>
   At least now there's expert advice at the time capsule society
at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, which houses the enormous
``Crypt of Civilization.'' Its creator, Thornwell Jacobs,
considered 1940 as a midpoint in recorded history, so the crypt was
built then and will be opened in 8113. The society will register
anyone's capsule by location, date and contents.
</P>
<P>
   The Westinghouse Time Capsule from the 1939 World's Fair in
Flushing Meadows, N.Y., officially introduced the concept of a time
capsule. The actual term was coined by a publicist for Westinghouse
Electric (another possibility was ``Time Bomb''). The
torpedo-shaped cylinder measures some 7 feet in length and 8 inches
in diameter. Among the contents are microfilm (of newspapers and
books, including ``Gone With the Wind''), newsreels (including
Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose and a Miami fashion show), examples of
the day's technology (including coal and asbestos, the ``miracle
fabric'') and representations of daily life (photographs of a poker
game and a 1938 baseball rule book). They are all loaded by weight
and fragility and fashionably topped by a Lilly Dache hat.
</P>
<P>
   (An updated version was planted after the 1965 World's Fair:
Time Capsule II was buried exactly 10 feet north of the original
and contains such wonders as a transistor radio, a Polaroid camera
and a bikini.)
</P>
<P>
   Its creators, who planned its excavation for the year 6939,
distributed 3,650 copies of a ``Book of Record'' to sites around
the world, from the Library of Congress (which apparently can't
seem to locate its two copies) to the Great Monastery Library in
Tibet. The book aspires to preserve the English language with
pronunciation charts, diagrams and an updated Rosetta Stone, as
well as messages to the future from Albert Einstein and Thomas
Mann, among others. They protected the capsule with layers of
waterproof batting and built a 50-foot-deep ``Immortal Well'' to
contain it.
</P>
<P>
   The book's prologue refers humbly enough to the site of the
capsule's placement: ``New York will certainly be an attractive
place for archaeologists 5,000 years from now, as are the sites of
ancient Athens, Rome and Troy in our own time.''

SPRING TURNS TO WINTER IN BEIJING

 (Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Three months ago, Wang Youcai was feeling optimistic
about the prospects of the China Democratic Party, a fledgling
group he had helped to found and hoped to register as China's first
opposition party. ``I think the likelihood I'll be re-arrested is
very small,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, after swift trials, Wang, 32, and two other
organizers, Xu Wenli and Qin Yong, were sentenced to more than a
decade each in prison for ``subverting state power.'' And in a
speech, President Jiang Zemin proclaimed that challenges to
Communist rule would be ``annihilated in the early stages.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprising thing is that all this came at the end of a year
when China's rigid political system had seemed to be relaxing its
grip. So the verdicts sent ebullient hopes that China was poised
for change crashing to the ground _ and not just for the dissidents
but for the many Western leaders who have flocked to Beijing in the
past year, applauding China for progress on human rights and legal
reform.
</P>
<P>
   How had their optimism been so far off base? Where their
calculations overly simplistic, or terribly wrong?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many signs in 1998 suggested that China's leaders were
ready for a dose of political reform: Jiang discussed Tibet and the
Tiananmen massacre with President Clinton during an hour of live
television. China said it would sign the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights. Chinese officials played host to Mary
Robinson, the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   But in their optimism, many people overestimated the
significance of such events, overlooking the obvious: That China
remains a one-party state, with the rule of the Communist Party
written into its constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were all important steps, but I think they were
misinterpreted by dissidents and by many in the outside world,''
said Andrew Nathan, a professor of political science at Columbia
University in New York. ``They decided that initiations for change
could come from outside rather than inside the Communist Party. But
that was never true.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Clinton visit in June seemed remarkably open, and
dissidents like Wang thought that the time was ripe to propose an
alternative party. A few months later, initial attempts to register
the party in two provinces were not immediately squashed. So the
members felt further emboldened.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the China Democratic Party never even came close to
registering _ no closer than hearing from a few local officials
that if its members could show things like an official meeting
place and a list of members, they were free to turn in an
application.
</P>
<P>
   But for activists who had previously landed in jail for their
democratic leanings, it seemed like progress, even though no one
knew for sure just why China's leaders had turned cordial. Was it
all a show for the West, and particularly for Ms. Robinson, whose
visit was just weeks away? Or was there genuine debate about
political reform among the top leadership? The optimists chose to
act on the chance that the opening was real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially around August and September there seemed to be a
thaw,'' said Chen Zhonghe, a Democratic Party member in Wuhan.
``And some had the belief that Jiang Zemin might offer a different
approach. That turned out to be an illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments and visiting dignitaries tuned in to the
liberalizing signals as well, and they too found their hopes
raised. Journalists proclaimed a Beijing spring. Lawyers from
England, Germany and the United States came to assist China's much
publicized quest for ``rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   But many of these Westerners have little experience in China.
And they have not spent much time with the older generation of men
who run China. Following their own democratic interests, they have
focused instead on the younger, more progressive, often
Western-trained officials and academics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with homeowners. Hillary Rodham Clinton visited a
groundbreaking women's legal aid center. It was easy to leave with
optimistic impressions. Now the trials are reminders that, although
China is undoubtedly moving toward a bit more openness, the
direction is not necessarily toward Western democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Western lawyers who recently took part in freewheeling law
forums here said they were shocked that the dissidents were not
even accorded lawyers or open trials, as are guaranteed by Chinese
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear a lot about China moving towards `rule of law,' which
we tend to conflate with democracy or a multi-party system,'' said
Sharon Hom, a law professor and expert on China at the City
University of New York. ``We assume they go hand in hand, but
that's not true in China. Rule of law in China is to promote
economic development and modernization. When push comes to shove,
it does not include political development.''
</P>
<P>
   Many China scholars say they hope, at best, for incremental
change. ``I think there's enough ferment that will cause boundaries
on political discourse to be slowly expanded outward,'' said
Stanley Lubman, a consulting professor at Stanford University Law
School. ``The Chinese leadership, however, has never indicated how
much loss of control it will tolerate.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Dec. 27, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.

<P>
   _ Moved in `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REHNQUIST-REVIEW (Washington) _ If there is a full-blown
Senate trial of President Clinton, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
will emerge from the hide-in-plain-sight existence of the Supreme
Court into the glare of the public spotlight. This raises the the
intriguing prospect of watching a man accustomed to being very much
in charge of a very controllable environment navigate in a realm
where normal expectations don't apply. By Linda Greenhouse. WITH
PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SOUTH-REVIEW (Undated) _ The impeachments of Presidents
Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, 130 years apart, both show how
potent the North-South divide can be. With Johnson, it reflected
the aftermath of the Civil War. With Clinton, it comes at a time
when conservative Southerners hold virtually all of the Republican
leadership positions in Congress. Southerners have also been the
prime advocates of impeachment. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   ADULTERY-REVIEW (Undated) _ However it's defined, adultery and
its lies have generated a vast folklore of opinion and anecdote in
many cultures, an almost universal body of common law. A look at
some examples.
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH-LANGUAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Millions of American students
still study French, despite the fading significance of France and
its language. French has ceded to English its longtime standing as
the first language of diplomacy. It has fewer speakers worldwide
than many other languages. So is French being taught out of
proportion to its role in the family of nations and the global
economy? By Jacques Steinber. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   TIME-CAPSULES-REVIEW (Undated) _ While Americans have long held
a canine enthusiasm for burying objects of value for later
discovery, they lack a sense of ``stewardship,'' according to the
International Time Capsule Society. Of the tens of thousands of
time capsules already buried across the United States, most will
probably be lost, destroyed or otherwise prevented from passing on
their legacy. By Caitlin Lovinger.
</P>
<P>
   SPEED-LIMITS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Almost every state has raised
its highway speed limit in what has become an unofficial test of
the long-held belief that speed kills. Three years into the test,
the answer is still unclear. By Matthew Wald.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.

   AIDS-BEGINNINGS-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Research indicates that
the AIDS virus came into existence in the 1940s or '50s in Africa.
If that's the case, what happened? Where did it go? How could the
virus, which now threatens to kill a quarter of Africa, have gone
virtually unnoticed for decades _ and then emerged in America,
decimating gays and hemophiliacs in the 1980s and starting on a
ruthless march around the world? By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GERM-WARFARE-REVIEW (Undated) _ U.S. officials from President
Clinton on down are taking the threat of germ warfare very
seriously, with thousands of people and billions of dollars in
motion to address it. Is this prudence or paranoia? By William J.
Broad and Judith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.S.-REVIEW (Undated) _ After the U.S. bombing of Iraq, the
stalemate continues. The U.S. has used one of the pillars of its
containment policy _ the threat of force _ but not used it
thoroughly. And the other pillars of U.S. policy toward Iraq are
now wobbling. By Serge Schmemann.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DISSIDENTS-REVIEW (Beijing) _ China's recent crackdowns on
dissidents came at the end of a year when China's rigid political
system had seemed to be relaxing its grip, and dashed hopes that
China was poised for change. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Dec. 27, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.

<P>
   _ Moved in `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REHNQUIST-REVIEW (Washington) _ If there is a full-blown
Senate trial of President Clinton, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
will emerge from the hide-in-plain-sight existence of the Supreme
Court into the glare of the public spotlight. This raises the the
intriguing prospect of watching a man accustomed to being very much
in charge of a very controllable environment navigate in a realm
where normal expectations don't apply. By Linda Greenhouse. WITH
PHOTO.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SOUTH-REVIEW (Undated) _ The impeachments of Presidents
Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, 130 years apart, both show how
potent the North-South divide can be. With Johnson, it reflected
the aftermath of the Civil War. With Clinton, it comes at a time
when conservative Southerners hold virtually all of the Republican
leadership positions in Congress. Southerners have also been the
prime advocates of impeachment. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   ADULTERY-REVIEW (Undated) _ However it's defined, adultery and
its lies have generated a vast folklore of opinion and anecdote in
many cultures, an almost universal body of common law. A look at
some examples.
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH-LANGUAGE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Millions of American students
still study French, despite the fading significance of France and
its language. French has ceded to English its longtime standing as
the first language of diplomacy. It has fewer speakers worldwide
than many other languages. So is French being taught out of
proportion to its role in the family of nations and the global
economy? By Jacques Steinber. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   TIME-CAPSULES-REVIEW (Undated) _ While Americans have long held
a canine enthusiasm for burying objects of value for later
discovery, they lack a sense of ``stewardship,'' according to the
International Time Capsule Society. Of the tens of thousands of
time capsules already buried across the United States, most will
probably be lost, destroyed or otherwise prevented from passing on
their legacy. By Caitlin Lovinger.
</P>
<P>
   SPEED-LIMITS-REVIEW (Washington) _ Almost every state has raised
its highway speed limit in what has become an unofficial test of
the long-held belief that speed kills. Three years into the test,
the answer is still unclear. By Matthew Wald.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.

THINGS WILL HAPPEN IN 1999, THOUGH MAYBE NOT THIS STUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I would like to meet the prognosticator who, a year ago,
predicted Bill Clinton would be impeached by now for lying about
sex with a White House intern. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The certain non-existence of such a prescient person is proof of
how astonishingly difficult the prediction business is. Well, wait.
The prediction task itself is easy. You just predict stuff. But
getting it right. Ah, that's where the trouble comes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And yet I am not cowed by the seeming impossibility of the job.
Rather, it quickens my pulse, just as another Bill's pulse was
quickened by the sight of a certain Monica's thong underwear. Or,
anyway, something like that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So do not speak to me of how utterly unbelievable some of my
predictions are for 1999. If reality is going to behave in this
utterly contemptible, over-the-top, out-of-control, run-amok way,
those of us in the prognostication business will simply have to go
some to keep up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With that as a wandering, distracted caveat, here is what to
look for in the coming year, one that has three 9s in it, which
means certainly something or other _ if not the opposite: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Al Gore will announce two things: 1) He's going to run for
vice president again _ if anyone will have him. 2) He's started to
wear thong underwear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The Dow Jones Industrial Average will end 1999 at 6.12. Six of
the 6.12 points will be represented by the funeral sector, kept
busy scraping up investors from Wall Street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chicago Cubs and the Kansas City Royals will battle in the
World Series, which the New York Yankees will win. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Hillary Rodham Clinton will be impeached for lying about an
affair with Al Gore that began when he playfully showed her his
thong underwear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Monica Lewinsky will be elected to the Senate from California
to replace Sen. Barbara Boxer, who will be impeached for lying
about an affair with Al Gore that began. . .well, you know. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Pilgrims from around the world will flock to Vernon, Texas,
birthplace of Ken Starr, after word gets out that a simple
housewife there has started seeing a mysterious image of Starr on
the local water tower at night. On some nights, she claims, she has
seen the image cry real tears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Rep. J. Dennis Hastert's term as Speaker of the House will
last four days, after which he will quit in anger over political
enemies purposefully mispronouncing his last name by starting it
with the letter ``B.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Madonna will announce she is leaving the study of Jewish
mysticism to study Al Gore. Her infatuation with him began. . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ At the end of the year Richard Nixon will still be dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists will announce they finally have arrived at the
so-called Grand Unified Theory of Everything. Oddly enough, it will
have something to do with unpopular vegetables, Vince Foster and
the Texas School Book Depository. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Saddam Hussein will leave power in Iraq and take a job as
understudy to TV talk show host Jerry Springer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The race for the Republican presidential nomination will be
thrown into chaos when all potential candidates drop out. Within a
week, the Draft Ken Starr movement will be judged unstoppable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The Internet will shut down when it's discovered that the Y2K
problem can't be solved without first solving the little-known
Y1.99K problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Can you say King Charles without laughing? Me either. Still. .
. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   History, the Polls Say, Is In the Eye of the Beholder
</P>
<P>
   Scholars called President Clinton's impeachment historic, but
judging by what people told pollsters, the public cared more about
the weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Pew Research Center sampled public opinion before, during
and after the House impeachment vote. About 34 percent of those
queried said they followed the impeachment drama ``very closely'' _
compared to 39 percent who cared that much about the weather.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptical journalists raised their eyebrows, noting that the
participants in the long-running Pew survey said they found the
1996 presidential election more compelling than the death of Diana,
Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   _ By FELICITY BARRINGER &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Babies, Texas Style  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Improved fertility treatments and a growing demand from
infertile couples has created a global surge in multiple births _
triplets or more _ from 1,034 in 1971 to 4,973 in 1995 in the
United States alone. The latest case was the birth last week of
octuplets to a Houston woman. It started doctors worrying anew
about the ethical issues raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a victory,'' said Dr. Benjamin Younger of the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine. ``A lot of these kids
survive but, unfortunately, they survive with major handicaps.''
</P>
<P>
   The infants, born to Nkem Chukwu, a Nigerian-born American
citizen, maintained a fragile hold on life at week's end.

   Feed Up in Israel  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lifting his hand in the air, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu voted to bring down his own government two years early,
sheepishly joining an overwhelming majority vote by a fed-up
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, the Likud prime minister, had depended on a
right-wing coalition that fell apart after he signed the
land-for-security peace plan at the White House in October.
Although he won back some on the right by freezing compliance with
the plan due to what he called multiple Palestinian violations, his
government had become irreparably dysfunctional.

</P>
<P>
   Catching a Smuggler
</P>
<P>
   A subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. pleaded guilty to
federal criminal charges and admitted that it had helped a
smuggling ring funnel millions of cigarettes into Canada in the
mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The guilty plea, by RJR's Northern Brands International unit,
marked the first time that a tobacco company had been convicted of
complicity in the shadowy world of international cigarette
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the smuggling helped the company get around
high Canadian taxes meant to discourage cigarette smoking, and
critics said the conviction could undercut the industry's efforts
to block an increase in cigarette taxes in the United States.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Balloonists' Saga
</P>
<P>
   Christmas found three of the world's greatest balloonists down
in the Pacific Ocean, half way to their goal of circling the Earth
non-stop. In at least 22 previous attempts at global
circumnavigation, no balloonist had ever come this close to
success.
</P>
<P>
   The 160-foot-high ICO Global Challenge ended its voyage when it
hit a low-pressure system over the ocean. Still, its crew _ Richard
Branson, Per Lindstrand and Steve Fossett _ will be accorded a
special place in ballooning archives. They managed not only to
avoid all the countries where hostile governments would have forced
them down but fought their way through storms, uncooperative winds
and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry to have let people down,'' Branson said, speaking
to his London headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   _ By MALCOLM W. BROWNE
</P>
<P>
   Relief for Angina
</P>
<P>
   One injection of an experimental drug directly into the heart
through a small incision in the chest has greatly relieved, even
eliminated, the chest pain of angina that standard drugs and bypass
surgery had failed to control, according to preliminary findings
from two continuing studies in the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   One drug is gene therapy to produce a protein called vegF, for
vascular endothelial growth factor. The other drug is a protein
called FGF-1, for fibroblast growth factor.
</P>
<P>
   Independent experts urged caution for a number of reasons. One
is the small numbers _ about 25 patients have been tested so far.
Another is uncertainty about the duration of benefit because the
first patient was treated only 10 months ago. A third is that for
ethical reasons no patient could receive a placebo as a scientific
control to allow more rigorous comparison.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A League of Their Own
</P>
<P>
   As the National Basketball Association moves toward a January
deadline meant to jumpstart the season or cancel it, the American
Basketball League simply ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ABL, a rival of the NBA-backed Women's National
Basketball Association, had built up teams with gold medalists from
the 1996 Olympics and handed out six-figure salaries to their
stars, it could not attract the corporate funds and television
deals necessary for survival. A third of the way through its third
season, it said it will file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV exposure is critical to sponsors, licensees and
investors,'' said ABL co-founder Gary Cavalli in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear that, although we had the best product, we
could not find enough people willing to confront the NBA and give
us the major sponsorships and TV contracts we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Vaccine for Lyme Disease
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration cautiously approved the
marketing of a Lyme disease vaccine for the first time last week.
It is intended for those who live or work in grassy or wooded areas
where ticks infected with the Lyme bacteria abound.
</P>
<P>
   Optimal protection requires three injections spaced over a year,
but effectiveness is 78 percent and those vaccinated still must
guard against ticks. Approval was only for people 15 to 70 years
old.

guard against ticks. Approval was only for people 15 to 70 years
old.

   Tanks for Nothing
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of gas stations and thousands more school districts,
fire departments and trash collectors that store fuel in
potentially leaky underground tanks face fines of up to $11,000 a
day unless they shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline, set 10 years ago by the Environmental Protection
Agency, was to give owners of the tanks time to replace them or fix
them so they would not leak fuel into the underground water supply.

<P>
   Seagram's $10.4 billion acquisition of the entertainment giant
Polygram from Philips is the biggest merger in the history of
popular music, resulting in the world's largest record company. But
with the new year, nearly 200 rock bands will be dropped along with
some 3,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will either restructure or dissolve major record
labels like Geffen, A&AMP;M, Island and Mercury, affecting Sting,
Hanson, Sheryl Crow, U2, Elton John and Aerosmith, among others.
The transition will be hardest for the more than 100 middle-level
acts like Aimee Mann, Girls Against Boys and Cowboy Junkies, who
are waiting until next month or February to discover whether they
will still have a record contract.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have already suffered have been up-and-coming bands
like MxPx, Cold and Swirl, where promotions have stopped while
record-label employees await word on their own fate.

   A Standoff Over Bananas &QL;

<P>
   A tip to holiday party-givers: If you are planning on serving
pecorino Romano cheese, stock up now. Same thing goes for those who
just can't make it through the next few months without another
gold-nibbed Mont Blanc pen.
</P>
<P>
   Those goodies are on the Clinton administration hit list in the
latest move in the banana wars. When it comes to the rules for
importing and exporting bananas, Europeans can't seem to go along
to get along. It's gotten so nasty of late that President Clinton
told Europe that unless it complies with a World Trade Organization
ruling to open its banana market, he will slap 100 percent tariffs
on $500 million in European goods, perhaps as soon as February.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one of his economic aides put it the other day, ``You can
kiss that pecorino goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, is to force the Europeans to comply with
the ruling, which makes the banana issue a test of the world's new
dispute settlement system for trade.
</P>
<P>
   But like most post-Cold War conflicts, this one is a lot more
complicated than it appears. Latin American and Carribbean nations
that produce bananas have enormous swaths of their economies at
stake. And it means a lot to Dole Food Co. and Chiquita Brands,
which insist that Washington must stand up for its overseas
interests. Only cynics would suggest that it helps that Carl
Lindner, who controls Chiquita, is known as a generous donor to
both parties. _ By DAVID E. SANGER

   Good Times Foil a Genre
</P>
<P>
   Oh, where have all the trench coats gone?
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, there were communists under every bed, and
America and the Soviet Union were always within one scrap of
microfilm _ hidden in, say, a priceless sculpture or the heel of
shoe _ of blowing each other to Technicolor smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   And writers of spy thrillers were whispering all the way to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cold War is deader than a double agent gunned down in a
frigid Moscow back alley, and while the world can still be a
decidedly treacherous place _ think of Iraq or Kosovo, or Capitol
Hill _ the espionage novel is whimpering out in the cold. Today's
conflicts, one publisher said, just aren't as sexy as ``the good
old Americans against the communists.''
</P>
<P>
   Tales by the likes of John le Carre, Frederick Forsyth and Ken
Follett, which once staked out the best-seller lists for months at
a time, now make, at best, fleeting appearances.
</P>
<P>
   What's a self-respecting spy author to do? Go into politics?
Start a talk show? No, they're just yanking off the trench coats
and slipping into something a little more, well, millennial. Or so
they hope.
</P>
<P>
   Forsyth, noted for ``The Odessa File,'' has changed both
publishing house and agent (``literary,'' not ``secret,'' that is)
and written a sequel to the 1910 novel ``The Phantom of the Opera''
called ``The Phantom of Manhattan.'' It has something to do with
cleaning fish in Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   Follett's latest is ``The Hammer of Eden,'' populated by aging
hippie eco-terrorists. And le Carre's next book, ``Single &AMP;
Single,'' promises heavy breathing and sinister doings in the world
of international finance. (It begins with the execution of the
ultimate 1990s villain: a lawyer.)
</P>
<P>
   So is the Cold War literary history? Maybe someday it will come
back as nostalgia. ``You have to wait,'' said Charles McCarry, a
novelist and former officer of the CIA, ``for the Cold War to be
quaint as a little Napoleonic war.''
</P>

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Dec. 19,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

<P>
   &UR; CIRCUMNAVIGATION &LR;  By Steve Lattimore. Houghton Mifflin, $12.
The author's first collection of short stories is populated by
disaffected Californians stuck with menial jobs, empty lives and
dead-end relationships. In 1997 the New York Times reviewer Scott
Bradfield called this a ``funny, moving book'' that in its best
moments is ``about the various jangled ways in which broken
families manage to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SLAVES IN THE FAMILY &LR;  By Edward Ball. Ballantine, $15.95.
Searching for the descendants of slaves owned by his ancestors in
South Carolina, the author confronts his heritage and the moral
consequences of slavery. His account, which won a National Book
Award last year, took him across America and to Africa, and
involved extensive interviews and research. ``There is much to
admire in Ball's very willingness to challenge the generations of
silence in his white family and to search out black kin whose
reactions he had every reason to fear,'' Drew Gilpin Faust wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TO 'JOY MY FREEDOM: SOUTHERN BLACK WOMEN'S LIVES AND LABORS
AFTER THE CIVIL WAR &LR;  By Tera W. Hunter. Harvard University, $15.95.
A history professor explores the valuable political and social role
played by black women after Emancipation. In 1997 the same reviewer
called this a ``celebration of struggle and resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COCKROACH BASKETBALL LEAGUE &LR;  By Charley Rosen. Seven
Stories, $13.95. This hymn to minor-league basketball follows a
team of misfits and whining wannabes as they ply their trade in the
shadow of the big time. The result is ``a racily entertaining
novel'' that ``skillfully induces the reader to join `the
Brotherhood of the Sacred Hoop,''' Michael Anderson wrote in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGE ELIOT: A LIFE &LR;  By Rosemary Ashton. Penguin, $15.95. This
revisionist biography combines the social context of Eliot's
fiction and a detailed analysis of her novels. ``Ashton is a
serious, persistent scholar, and the picture she gives of Eliot's
intellectual and emotional life is convincing,'' William S.
Peterson wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANE AUSTEN: A LIFE &LR;  By David Nokes. University of California,
$19.95. This reveals how the novelist wielded irony and razor-sharp
observation as weapons to skewer the constraining society in which
she lived. In 1997 the reviewer Claude Rawson praised the author
for leaning heavily on Austen's letters, which ``are wonderfully
revealing, especially strong on the texture of relationships and
the tang of social encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRINCE OF PEACE &LR;  By James Carroll. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin,
$13. This densely plotted novel tells the parallel tales of an
American priest who gets caught up in the anti-Vietnam War movement
and what is portrayed as the metamorphosis of the Roman Catholic
Church in the United States into a cynically run corporation. ``The
stories are nearly irresistible,'' Webster Schott wrote in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASPHALT NATION: HOW THE AUTOMOBILE TOOK OVER AMERICA, AND HOW
WE CAN TAKE IT BACK &LR;  By Jane Holtz Kay. University of California,
$16.95. In this cranky polemic, an architecture critic describes
how unchecked motorized sprawl is threatening the nation's cities
and towns, its economy and its health. She ``largely succeeds in
proving that it is possible to get where we are going without
destroying where we live,'' Kenneth T. Jackson wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EATING CHINESE FOOD NAKED &LR;  By Mei Ng. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $14. Ruby Lee is a restless college graduate whose
protective love for her mother draws her back to her father's
laundry in Queens. Last year the reviewer Lynn Karpen called this
an ``affecting first novel'' that ``conveys the complexities of
family life with vibrant color and luminosity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOBBY REX'S GREATEST HIT &LR;  By Marianne Gingher. Louisiana State
University, $14.95. It's 1961 in Greensboro, N.C., and Pally
Thompson is about to marry a man who wants to know how far she went
with a local country-music crooner whose hit song is all about his
romance with her. This ``richly detailed, often charming first
novel ... lovingly evokes Pally's journey from innocence to
maturity in a town where gossip flourishes and ambitions fade,''
Ellen Pall wrote in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITIZEN SOLDIERS: THE U.S. ARMY FROM THE NORMANDY BEACHES TO
THE BULGE TO THE SURRENDER OF GERMANY. JUNE 7, 1944-MAY 7, 1945 &LR;  By
Stephen E. Ambrose. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $16. In this
sequel to ``D-Day,'' the author's 1994 best seller about the
Normandy landing, he once again uses the experiences of ordinary
soldiers to recreate the bloody, often nameless battles that led to
the Nazi defeat. ```Citizen Soldiers' is an unforgettable testament
to the World War II generation,'' Carlo D'Este wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GOD'S SNAKE &LR;  By Irini Spanidou. Vintage International, $13. A
girl chronicles her anguished coming of age in Greece in the 1950s
as the daughter of an inflexible military officer who treats her as
if she were one of his recruits. This first novel ``freshly evokes
the beauties and terrors of childhood,'' Nicholas Bromell wrote in
1986.

JAMES VAN DER BEEK: A TEEN IDOL PLAYS FOR RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes a color slide of James Van Der Beek with Amy Smart in a
scene from ``Varsity Blues.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's not easy to be 21 and stuck in high school.
 &HT;    James Van Der Beek knows, because he has to shed five years
daily for his role as 16-year-old Dawson Leery on the hit WB
series, ``Dawson's Creek.''
 &HT;    ``The first step in finding Dawson is shaving to get that
sensitive, peach-faced look,'' the actor says. ``If we film for too
long, I have to shave again and again.''
 &HT;    The sensitive, peach-faced look seems to work, though, because
teen-age female viewers have been drawn to Van Der Beek as if he
were the small-screen version of Leonardo DiCaprio.
 &HT;    Which is particularly amusing, he says, because during his
real-life high-school years girls generally ignored him.
 &HT;    ``I never really fit in,'' Van Der Beek says over breakfast at
New York's Regency Hotel. ``I mean, who really feels like they fit
in in high school?
 &HT;    ``I laugh that Dawson has all these female fans,'' he adds,
``because I was just as big of a dork in high school, and nobody
had a crush on me.''
 &HT;    It's safe to say that those days are history. Recently Van Der
Beek was asked to leave a store ``because I created a scene.'' Even
on the road he isn't safe.
 &HT;    ``I'll be driving and I'll hear a shriek, like a muffled shriek
of pain,'' he says. ``Then I'll turn around, and it will be this
minivan filled with teen-age girls. I don't know who's driving _ I
just hope it's not their mom going, `We're going to get him! He's
turning into the gas station!'''
 &HT;    While filming his new movie, ``Varsity Blues,'' a football drama
which was shot last year in Austin, Texas, he couldn't even go out
to eat without being mobbed.
 &HT;    ``At one point, I was in a restaurant and it just got out of
hand,'' Van Der Beek says, sighing. ``I was freaked out by it, so I
snuck out the back and went back to the hotel.
 &HT;    ``My life is so different now,'' he adds, ``but I guess it's
just an adjustment. My daily routine has changed _ but I'm not
complaining, because fame has been 90 percent great and only 10
percent bad.''
 &HT;    The good part includes his first starring movie role. ``Varsity
Blues,'' opening Jan. 15, casts Van Der Beek as a high-school jock
who tangles with a surly, win-at-any-cost coach (Jon Voight).
 &HT;    Helmets and shoulder pads weren't new to Van Der Beek.
 &HT;    ``In junior high school I played football,'' he says, ``but I
got a concussion.''
 &HT;    In fact, it was while recovering from that injury that he got
into acting.
 &HT;    ``I was so bored that I tried out for a local community play,''
he recalls, ``and landed the role of Danny Zuko in `Grease.'''
 &HT;    Don't come to ``Varsity Blues'' expecting a sensitive,
Dawsonesque athlete, the actor warns.
 &HT;    ``We hired real high-school football players who played my
teammates on this movie,'' Van Der Beek says. ``These guys were
pretty unimpressed by my sensitive portrayal of Dawson Leery. They
had no qualms about kicking my a-- on a field or in a bar.''
 &HT;    And Van Der Beek had no qualms about kicking right back.
 &HT;    ``I liked that this character had an edge,'' he says. ``I keep
getting movie scripts where I would play the sensitive guy. It's
like Hollywood is saying, `Get that kid who plays Dawson. He does
that well.'
 &HT;    ``Well, I want to do something a little different.''
 &HT;    To accentuate the difference, he dyed his hair dark brown and
hit the gym to put on 15 pounds of muscle.
 &HT;    ``I knew I would have to do something drastically different to
make sure girls weren't like, `Oh, it's Dawson on the football
field,''' he says.
 &HT;    It remains to be seen whether they'll care. Van Der Beek
experienced their ardor firsthand at a recent promotional meeting
with fans at a Seattle convention center. About 1,000 people were
expected, but more than 5,000 showed up and stormed the stage.
 &HT;    ``They had to literally whisk me away, with security guards
yanking me out of the building,'' Van Der Beek marvels. ``We had to
send an empty limo off as a decoy. Then I had to run to the bottom
of the building, where I was taken away by a police car.''
 &HT;    Still, he thinks it's worth it.
 &HT;    ``Absolutely,'' he says without hesitation. ``I can't go to the
mall, but I get to work with Jon Voight. I never want to sound like
some whiny guy going, `Oh, I'm so famous now I can't stand it.'''
 &HT;    Actually, he adds, Voight helped him learn how to deal with his
fame.
 &HT;    ``The person who put things in perspective for me was Jon
Voight, who said, `You have the power to make people very happy by
doing something very simple. You're in a position where you can
give people little gifts that will make them smile,''' Van Der Beek
recalls. ``He's right.''
 &HT;    The actor still remembers where he came from, because it was
only a few years ago that he was back in Cheshire, Conn., growing
up as the eldest of three children of a telecommunications account
manager and a gymnastics-studio owner.
 &HT;    School wasn't always easy. Van Der Beek struggled with dyslexia,
but still managed to win an academic scholarship and become a
National Honor Society member, a student proctor and a choir
member.
 &HT;    And a teen actor. After ``Grease,'' the aspiring thespian found
an agent, who helped him get cast in an Off-Broadway play, and soon
such television movies as ``Angus'' and ``I Love You, I Love You,''
which co-starred a then-unknown Claire Danes.
 &HT;    As an English major at Drew University in Madison, N.J., Van Der
Beek took off afternoons to audition in New York. His college
career ended, however, when one of those auditions led him to
Dawson Leery.
 &HT;    ``When I signed on to be Dawson, I thought I was going to be on
a critically acclaimed show that nobody watched,'' he says.
 &HT;    It didn't work out that way. But Van Der Beek insists that he
still doesn't feel like a star. His biggest extravagance to date
has been a new truck, and he avoids the Hollywood party scene _
which isn't hard, since he spends most of his time on the
``Dawson's Creek'' set in Wilmington, N.C.
 &HT;    And playing Dawson hasn't helped him do better with girls, he
reports, though he admits to having a steady girlfriend. Still, he
says, if anything his success has made romance even more difficult.
 &HT;    ``Now I have a tendency to question motivations,'' the actor
says. ``Why is a girl talking to me? Does she want me or Dawson?''
 &HT;    Nowadays, the teen-age girls who aren't speculating about his
off-camera romantic life are probably speculating about Dawson's
on-camera affairs of the heart. As any self-respecting teen-ager
can tell you, the character is torn between the mysterious Jen,
played by Michelle Williams, and his sweet childhood friend Joey,
played by fellow teen phenom Katie Holmes.
 &HT;    Fans want Dawson and Joey to get together once and for all,
which Van Der Beek wouldn't mind.
 &HT;    ``If they can make it as interesting as when they're not
together, then sure,'' he says. ``I think the audience wants it.
But the audience also doesn't want it _ everyone loves the
anticipation of letting them get together.''
 &HT;    Speaking of anticipation, ``Dawson's Creek'' fans have one
particular question they're buzzing about: Will Dawson ever lose
his virginity?
 &HT;    Van Der Beek hems and haws.
 &HT;    ``Um,'' he says, laughing, ``I guarantee you it will probably
happen during sweeps. That's all I know.''

BRENDA BLETHYN, THE BIG VOICE OF `LITTLE VOICE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
NIRDI RELIS in New York at 212-499-3333, or by fax at

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 Includes a color slide of Brenda Blethyn in a scene from ``Little
Voice.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``Brenda who?''
 &HT;    That's what a lot of people thought when Brenda Blethyn's name
was announced as a nominee for the 1996 Academy Award as Best
Actress.
 &HT;    Despite critical acclaim for her performance in Mike Leigh's
family drama ``Secrets &AMP; Lies,'' the little-known stage actress
couldn't believe it, either.
 &HT;    ``Oh, it was a dream,'' Blethyn says. ``Frankly, I was
overwhelmed at having won the Golden Globe. That suited me just
fine, and I didn't need anything else.
 &HT;    ``To get the Oscar nomination as well, that was wonderful.''
 &HT;    Then there was Oscar night, as Cuba Gooding Jr. prepared to name
the winner.
 &HT;    ``I didn't expect at any time to win, except for that 30 seconds
when he was standing there with that envelope,'' the actress
recalls. ``I embarrassed myself for three days for even having had
that thought.''
 &HT;    Blethyn lets loose a husky, loud howl of laughter, a sound heard
often during a conversation with her at a Manhattan hotel. Truth be
told, she probably hasn't stopped laughing since ``Secrets &AMP;
Lies,'' which made her suddenly an in-demand actress, both in her
native England and in Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``It's been a wonderful time,'' she says. ``I'm happy. The Oscar
nomination changed my life.
 &HT;    ``I love theater and TV and radio, too'' she adds, ``but I've
been concentrating on films now. I'd only made three films when I
did `Secrets &AMP; Lies,' so I'm still a novice in the film world.''
 &HT;    Blethyn's latest film, ``Little Voice,'' based on Jim
Cartwright's play, ``The Rise and Fall of Little Voice,'' stars
Jane Horrocks _ for whom the play was written _ as Little Voice, or
L.V. for short. She's a painfully shy young woman with an uncanny
knack for perfectly mimicking such singing legends as Judy Garland
and Shirley Bassey.
 &HT;    Blethyn plays Mari, L.V.'s horribly self-absorbed and ill-garbed
mother, with Michael Caine as Ray Say, a low-rent talent agent
who's also Mari's slimy boyfriend. Say and Mari envision pots of
gold and a ticket out of their working-class English town, if only
they can prod the excruciatingly withdrawn L.V. into singing in
public.
 &HT;    As played by Blethyn, Mari is a soused, would-be sexpot, all
gaudy makeup, cruel wit and tacky clothes. There's no better Mari
moment than the one in which she dances and sings along to ``Disco
Inferno.''
 &HT;    In short, Mari is even less elegant than Blethyn's workaday
``Secrets &AMP; Lies'' role, neither of whom resembles the real-life
actress, chic in a stylish, dark-gray pantsuit.
 &HT;    ``I normally play sympathetic characters, so Mari was a nice
change of pace,'' Blethyn says. ``Our craft is to make you believe
we are these people. I mean, Mari is so far removed from me that it
was joyful.
 &HT;    ``She's not particularly likable,'' the actress adds, ``and we
enjoy not liking her. There was a bit of a temptation, because of
that, to round her edges, to make her more likable.''
 &HT;    Blethyn shakes her head and purses her lips.
 &HT;    ``I thought that it would have been so patronizing to Mari and
to the audience to do that,'' she says. ``So I went for broke.
 &HT;    ``When I watched the movie,'' she adds, ``I found Mari funny,
then not so funny. Then I didn't like her very much. But ultimately
I felt some kind of compassion for her.''
 &HT;    Blethyn counted Horrocks among her friends even before making
``Little Voice.'' She considers Horrocks ``fantastic'' in the film,
and is even more enthusiastic about Caine, with whom she shares
most of her biggest scenes.
 &HT;    ``He's a peach, just wonderful,'' Blethyn says, her face
lighting up. ``My first day, I was nervous about working with him,
but he put that to rest in an instant.
 &HT;    ``My first scene with him was leaping on him and kissing him! He
kept saying I was doing it wrong.''
 &HT;    Since her ``Secrets''-fueled rise to prominence, Blethyn has
made several movies, including the little-seen ``Music from Another
Room'' (1998), a recent cable drama entitled ``Girls Night''
(1998), the upcoming romance/thriller ``Night Train,'' with John
Hurt, and ``Daddy and Them,'' a comedy about a dysfunctional
family.
 &HT;    Blethyn sounds particularly enthusiastic about ``Daddy,''
written and directed by Billy Bob Thornton, who also co-stars in
the ensemble film.
 &HT;    ``I play an Englishwoman who marries into this family,'' Blethyn
says. ``I actually marry Jim Varney. He is one of the funniest men
I've ever had a conversation with.
 &HT;    ``Andy Griffith plays Daddy, and he's wonderful,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``I went in on my days off just to see him work.
We shot it in Arkansas, and everything on every menu there is
deep-fried, and everyone says `deep-fried' as `deep frah-eyed.'''
 &HT;    Blethyn, who lives in London with her longtime boyfriend,
Michael Mayhew, an artistic director at the National Theatre,
doesn't even try to deny that she's savoring her time in the
spotlight.
 &HT;    ``I worked for 10 years before I went to drama school,'' she
says, smiling. ``I worked in an office as a secretary. I had a good
job and made a good wage.
 &HT;    ``As it happened, I'd tried acting with an amateur acting
company and found that I absolutely loved it. People kept saying,
`Hey, you're not bad at this.'
 &HT;    ``I never thought I could do it professionally, and I kept
putting it off and putting it off,'' the actress recalls. ``Then I
thought, `Here I am, 27. If I don't try, I'll spend the rest of my
life regretting it.'
 &HT;    ``I didn't tell anybody, so nobody would laugh at me.''
 &HT;    Nobody laughed. Blethyn went on to join the prestigious National
Theatre, where she performed in numerous plays, then turned up in
British TV productions and in the films ``The Witches'' (1990) _ in
which Horrocks also appeared _ and ``A River Runs Through It''
(1992). Then came ``Secrets &AMP; Lies,'' and the rest is ... well,
some sort of history, anyway.
 &HT;    ``I've never been out of work, ever,'' Blethyn says. ``And,
after I decided to have a go at acting, I never doubted I could
make a living at that.
 &HT;    ``My ambitions have never been much further than what I've
accomplished, if you know what I mean,'' she says. ``If you get the
chance to do what you hope to do, then you're fortunate.
 &HT;    ``But I never, ever thought I'd be on a stage in Hollywood,
never, ever thought I'd be at the Oscars. Those were not my
ambitions.
 &HT;    ``So I'm happy,'' she says, beaming. ``I was happy when I worked
in an office, I was happy at the National Theatre and I'm happy
now.''
 &HT;    The question is, what would it take to make Blethyn even
happier?
 &HT;    ``I'd love to get one of those really glamorous roles, with
fantastic costumes, a bit haute couture,'' Blethynsays, laughing
that laugh again. ``They always ask me to be so dowdy. I try not to
take that too personally.''

 Includes a color slide of Emily Watson in a scene from ``Hilary and
Jackie.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    You can't judge by appearances.
 &HT;    Emily Watson, for example, is a very grown-up actress, well into
her 30s. But she has the flawless skin, luminous blue eyes and
cherubic features to pass for a teenager _ not a bad thing in a
business that places a premium on youth.
 &HT;    ``I guess there are advantages to looking the way I do,'' she
says, grinning. ``I suppose it promotes career longevity. Also it
keeps you from getting too self-important, because people don't
always take you seriously.''
 &HT;    Watson's air of adolescent innocence added edge to her 1996 film
debut, ``Breaking the Waves.'' She got an Academy Award nomination
for her portrayal of a tortured wife who embarks on a series of
degrading sexual liaisons to please her dying husband.
 &HT;    Not exactly date-movie stuff, and her latest film, ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' is arguably even more harrowing. Watson plays cellist
Jacqueline du Pre, the real-life star who was cut down in her late
20s by multiple sclerosis, the crippling nerve disease which
finally claimed her life in 1987 at age 42.
 &HT;    ``I first heard the story of Jacqueline du Pre from the
director, Anand Tucker, at a lunch in London,'' Watson recalls. ``I
knew he was going to do a low-budget film, but I went straight to a
telephone afterwards, called my agent and said, `I have to be in
this.'
 &HT;    ``It wasn't a career decision,'' she says. ``It was just an
emotional reaction that I couldn't ignore.''
 &HT;    Part of Watson's fascination with du Pre was the debilitating
effect that fame had on her even before she was stricken with MS.
 &HT;    ``Jackie became sort of an overnight celebrity while she was
still in her teens,'' Watson says. ``It was a life of planes, hotel
rooms and performing. It sort of ate her up.''
 &HT;    Watson faced two daunting challenges _ learning to play the
cello and portraying the ravages of MS. The cello came first, and
she practiced until her fingers bled.
 &HT;    ``I had studied cello for a few months as a teenager,'' the
actress says, ``but my playing was rubbish, really. So I spent
three months holed up in a rehearsal room, doing hours of practice.
 &HT;    ``I was working in a building where a lot of real musicians,
some of them very famous, came to rehearse,'' Watson adds with a
laugh. ``I'd come out of my room and they'd be like, `Who was that
woman murdering the Elgar Concerto?'
 &HT;    ``I remember that once my teacher was on the phone to somebody
while I was practicing. This person said to her, `What is that
horrible noise?' It was like, `If that's a new student, get rid of
them.'''
 &HT;    You won't hear her playing in the film, but Watson did manage to
duplicate du Pre's distinctive style.
 &HT;    ``I was able to mime the playback with a real freedom,'' she
says. ``I wanted to get that sense of abandon that Jackie had when
she played _ she was like this passionate, wild cat. Actually the
cello is a very sexy instrument, and she put her whole body, every
fiber of her being, into playing it. It was magnetic.''
 &HT;    Even more important, arguably, was that Watson accurately
portray the crippling effects of multiple sclerosis.
 &HT;    ``I spent a lot of time with doctors and MS patients,'' Watson
says. ``I felt a great responsibility to really try to get as close
as I could to what MS is really like. I kept a couple of walking
sticks and a wheelchair in the room where I was rehearsing the
cello. When I wasn't playing, I was working on what it's like to
lose control of your body.''
 &HT;    ``Hilary and Jackie,'' based on ``A Genius in the Family,'' the
biography by Jackie's older sister Hilary and her brother Piers du
Pre, focuses on the close relationship between the two sisters,
both of whom were musicians.
 &HT;    While Hilary (Australian actress Rachel Griffiths) originally
showed great promise as a flutist, it was Jackie who became an
international success. Meanwhile her sister married British
conductor Kiffer Finzi, had two children and lived a quiet life in
a rural English town.
 &HT;    The three _ Hilary, Jackie and Kiffer _ form an odd sort of
triangle in the film, as in a sense do Hilary, Jackie and Jackie's
career, and even Hilary, Jackie and Hilary's might-have-been
career.
 &HT;    Watson can identify with the basic situation, she says. Her own
older sister, like Hilary, lives a quiet existence in an American
college town.
 &HT;    ``She's married to a professor at Cornell and has a baby,''
Watson says, ``so she's raising a family while I'm off around the
world, acting in movies.''
 &HT;    Watson herself is married to British actor Jack Waters, and
admits that her own artistic life puts certain strains on the
marriage.
 &HT;    ``There are moments when I can understand how Jackie felt about
hotel rooms and time zones,'' Watson says. ``I think, in that
respect, her life is a cautionary tale for anyone who's flirting
with fame.
 &HT;    ``I always try to tell myself that I'm coping marvelously,'' she
adds. ``But it's not always easy to maintain a relationship by
telephone. Believe me, we have massive phone bills, because we
speak about three times a day when we're away from each other.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes I think it may be better for him if I'm away while
I'm in a film,'' Watson continues. ``I'm a royal pain to live with
when I'm working. I'm very focused on my character, and I'm always
exhausted. In fact, the other day a photographer posed me on the
bed for a publicity shot and I feel asleep.''
 &HT;    Watson has good reason to be tired. Seizing her moment in the
wake of ``Breaking the Waves,'' she has hurled herself into a
series of movies, including appearing opposite Daniel Day-Lewis in
``The Boxer'' (1998), with Christian Bale in the upcoming
``Metroland'' and for director Tim Robbins in ``The Cradle Will
Rock.'' Currently she's in Ireland, on the set of ``Angela's
Ashes.''
 &HT;    There's renewed Oscar buzz surrounding Watson's performance in
``Hilary and Jackie,'' but the actress says that the crowning honor
has already come her way.
 &HT;    ``After we finished filming, I tried to put out of my mind
whether I had done justice to it all,'' she says. ``Then I got back
home to London and there was a message on my answering machine from
Hilary, who had just seen the film. She simply said, `Emily, you
were Jackie.'
 &HT;    ``And I just burst into a flood of tears. It was such a relief
to know that she felt that.''

`MAGGIE WINTERS': A MATTER OF FAITH

 Includes a color slide of Faith Ford in a scene from ``Maggie
Winters.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1998 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Times change, and so do people.
</P>
<P>
   When Faith Ford made the jump from the lightning-paced newsroom
on ``Murphy Brown'' to the sleepy small town of ``Maggie Winters,''
her fictional world became ostensibly more simple but her character
became much smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie, Ford's character, had been voted ``most likely to
succeed'' in high school, but divorce sends her reeling out of
Chicago and back to her tiny hometown of Shelbyville, Ind., where
she tends to be a step or two ahead of those around her.
</P>
<P>
   Ford can identify with Maggie's disorientation. Last year, she
was a supporting player on the long-running ``Murphy Brown.'' Now
she's starring in her own sitcom. And, like Maggie, she's recently
divorced _ from actor Robert Nottingham in 1997 _ though she's also
recently married, to writer/personal trainer Campion Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing in her dressing room in jeans and a powder-blue
turtleneck sweater, Ford looks back cheerfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``To everyone else, this might seem like an intense year,'' she
admits, ``but it's intense in a positive way. So I'm up for
positive intensity, because I've had enough of the other kind of
intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly no one would have begrudged Ford a while off with her
new husband _ they wed only a few weeks before she began
``Maggie's'' full season. But the combination of the quality of the
script and her sense of connectedness to the character sold her on
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, she says, she decided to ``just jump right into this
and not brood and overanalyze, which is something I'm classically
known for doing. I thought, `This is one time I'm not going to
overthink this.'''
</P>
<P>
   She does have second thoughts, she admits. She rarely gets time
to rest in her dressing room, she says _ indeed, it's three months
since the clocks were turned back, and her VCR is still an hour
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can always look back,'' Ford says with a shrug.
``Maybe it's not good to have that much time off, for me, because I
have a tendency to be an Earth girl, to really, really like that
other side that is not about acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wasn't raised that way,'' she adds. ``My mother worked
my whole life. So it's so much a part of who I am that I think the
healthiest thing for me is not to have more than a couple of months
without employment.''
</P>
<P>
   The series is barely half a season old, but the performers
already have firm grasps on their characters, as evidenced by an
afternoon's rehearsal on the set.
</P>
<P>
   Tom (Brian Haley), the former high-school football star now
relegated to tending bar and reliving his past glories, has _
thanks to Maggie's meddling _ been evicted from his apartment. Lisa
(Alex Kapp Horner), Maggie's long-suffering friend whose search for
love takes her to all the wrong places, is experiencing belated _
and, to both parties involved, bewildering _ hormonal interest
toward Tom, as Robin (Jenny Robertson), their happily married and
extremely procreative pal, looks on with concern.
</P>
<P>
   The debate this afternoon is just how Lisa should approach Tom
after he has made an impassioned speech about losing his apartment,
given that Lisa herself is supposed to be somewhat ambivalent about
her attraction to Tom.
</P>
<P>
   The first runthrough, a generically sympathetic hug, conveys
little, while the second, a fierce, full-body jump into his arms,
is considered over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson suggests something in-between, demonstrating an
embrace that melts into caressing Haley's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a good actress,'' Haley says with a grin, and for a few
moments all three actresses take turns hugging and fondling him.
Horner rips off Haley's baseball cap and runs her fingers through
his hair, and the actor blushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens every time I have to do a romantic scene _ I'm
uncomfortable,'' Horner admits.
</P>
<P>
   Haley suggests that he be oblivious to Horner's advances, more
consumed with the loss of his apartment. Horner suggests that she
realize midembrace what she's doing and then yank herself away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loves me,'' Haley muses, ``but I'm in my netherworld, so
it doesn't register with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which,'' Horner adds, ``is the only reason I'm attracted to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson then suggests that Horner play the scene closer to
Haley from the outset, so that Lisa ``folds into him'' more
realistically before letting herself go. Haley offers to sit on the
sofa arm next to Horner, giving her easier access to him, and
Horner comes up with the idea of a friendly back massage that gets
out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a hug, but it's very sensual,'' she observes.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who as Maggie rouses Lisa out of her reverie, has another
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could lift your hands off him,'' she says, demonstrating a
mingling of distaste and embarrassment in the gesture. ``We had
hugs like that on `Murphy Brown' a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   They try it, and it looks to be a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels funnier,'' Haley says.
</P>
<P>
   Such collaborative rehearsals on ``Maggie'' are the norm, Ford
says, inspired by her experience on ``Murphy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think after doing that for so long, I could go into a
situation where someone says, `OK, now you would do this and do
that,''' she says. ``They're open to your input in forming these
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford says that, while Maggie will continue to grow and be
successful in her work, the divorce will remain a key element of
the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to always have damage under there,'' the actress
says. ``What real people do is they just put it away for a while.
That's what Maggie does. She's complex without being too
neurotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she adds, the series depends on Maggie not resolving
her conflicts entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for one minute she's got it all together, then you don't
care anymore,'' Ford says. ``She's a person who doesn't settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford remains in contact with her former colleague, ``Murphy
Brown'' star Candice Bergen, from whom she's received some advice
about headlining a series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to her, `I just do the best job I can and then I let it
go,''' Ford recalls, ``and she said, `No, you can't let it go,
because you have a hit.' She keeps me very uplifted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ford is headed for the real town of
Shelbyville. She's been invited to be the grand marshal for its
annual parade, a prospect which excites the actress, a small-town
girl herself who believes that television has something to learn
from the Shelbyvilles of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole chunk of this land that's been completely
unexplored and is so interesting to me,'' she says. ``They have
real lives and real problems, but they don't dwell on them the way
they do in the city. They don't go to therapy over them _ they just
do what they have to do and move forward, and life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is considerably different from the Hollywood world that
Ford herself inhabits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I feel fortunate with my success,'' she says. ``But
again, sometimes you look back and think, `God, what would it have
been like if I'd taken a more simple road in my life?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what that would have been like,'' the actress
adds. ``Maybe I would've been bored, I don't know. But I guess it
takes a simple person to lead a simple life, and I guess I was just
never that simple.''

 &HT;    Holiday doings at the Tiger firehouse
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIGER, Ga. _ My favorite holiday party wasn't the cocktail
reception with the reindeer ice sculpture we attended in Atlanta.
It wasn't the candle-bedecked dinner that ended in flamed pudding
drama.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Christmas potluck supper at the Tiger firehouse.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I were lucky to be included. Not just everybody
gets invited. But our farm is just down the road from the
firehouse, and many of the 18 volunteer firemen are our neighbors.
What was so amazing about this year's party is no sooner had fire
Chief Mike Hopkins said the blessing, then the alarm sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The action was quite something to behold.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody hollered, ``It's an in-house, three alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   The firemen jumped up from the tables without taking even a
bite. Without putting even a hot roll in their pockets or taking
along a single cookie. They hurled themselves into the truck in
less than three minutes. Plates filled to the brim with homemade
casseroles were left untouched on the poinsettia print tablecloths.
</P>
<P>
   Our dinner tables, set right beside Tiger's newest sleek red
fire engine, trembled a little as the huge engines started to roar.
The red candles flickered as sirens on trucks only a few feet away
started to blare. I stopped up my ears.
</P>
<P>
   Lo and behold, the large steel doors rolled up in a grand
rippling sound, ending with staccato clanks, like an off-key
Hallelujah chorus. Lights flashed. I wanted to stand up and cheer.
But I could tell it wasn't the right thing to do. Doing your duty
is an everyday thing in Tiger. It's what's expected. Not even on
holidays is duty a big deal. I know that because my husband, John,
was born in the small mountain town. He has that salt-of-the earth
approach that tends to the basics even when frills beckon.
</P>
<P>
   The old timers around me kept right on eating their sweet
potatoes. I was too stunned to pick up my fork.
</P>
<P>
   The doors closed and the conversation buzzed on _ though each
table had several empty places. The sirens were a distant scream by
the time I took a sip of my hot cider. One of my neighbors tapped
me on the shoulder to point out the hand-crocheted ornaments on the
Christmas tree beside the huge wheel that holds the fire hoses. The
desserts beckoned _ German chocolate cake and banana pudding.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, I asked my friend, John Ruth, who's been a
volunteer fireman for seven or eight years, what time he got back
the night of the party. ``A little after 10,'' he said. ``It was a
trailer, burned pretty bad _ but nobody was hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   How many alarms for Tiger this year, I asked Ruth. ``That was
number 180,'' he replied, a count that includes auto accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The firemen, ranging in age from 18 to 70, get no pay, of
course. They are required to put in a minimum of 60 hours training
a year, but nobody keeps track of how many total hours they spend.
That's not the point. The point is why they do it. Most give a
single reason. They just like to give something back to the
community. Admirable, yes, but I had the feeling there's more. At
least for Ruth. He's approaching 70 now, but a stranger would never
guess it. He has a childlike sparkle in his eyes and the energy
level of a teen-ager. When he talks about fire fighting, he exudes
the excitement of a kid playing with a shiny new fire truck under a
Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   What is it, really, I said, that makes you love this?
``Action,'' he replied. ``If you don't like action, you don't want
to be a fireman.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Who's watching whom on TV?
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We spent the last half of this century watching TV.
In the century to come, television will watch us.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, we're already there. In 1999, cable companies, using
digital set-top boxes, will be able to selectively target both
programs and ads not only to individual households but also
uniquely to each TV set in that household. The fare will be based
on viewers' watching and buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials we see depend on which programs we select. In
the future, software can insert customized commercials in ways that
are cloaked to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   A cable outlet could then cull lists of high net worth retirees
and match those names to its subscriber base. Only those people
would then see ads for, say, a financial product. Or only the
dog-owners, similarly identified by their credit card purchases,
would see dog food commercials.
</P>
<P>
   A monograph posted on the web by the ``Addressable Advertising
Coalition'' explains what's about to happen:
</P>
<P>
   ``Technological advancements in cable systems, direct broadcast
satellites and the coming telephone company video operations offer
the promise of even further micro-targeting of ad messages. Digital
telecasting offers message targeting to the individual residence.''
</P>
<P>
   Money is an issue. As the coalition's paper notes, cable
operators have regarded ad revenues ``to be peripheral rather than
a core business, because advertising revenue per home, per year is
$25.97 vs. $428.05 per home, per year in subscriber revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy is also an issue _ one that the industry paper
skirts, noting merely that ``addressability ... can be transparent
to the consumer unless the consumer wants to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Government regulators permit the cable industry to gather data
on customers. Operators can collect and aggregate information on
individuals if they have ``prior written or electronic consent of
the subscriber,'' as the Federal Communications Commission puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agency's rules, that data can then be disclosed to
outsiders ``if such disclosure is necessary to render, or conduct a
legitimate business activity related to cable television or other
service(s) provided to the subscriber.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable lawyers argue their legal road is already paved. Web
publishers, using ``cookies,'' keep abreast of what users do on
their sites and where they go when they leave. Local telephone
companies mine data from call records. They then use those records
in their direct marketing campaigns and make them available to
cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just taking it up another level,'' Cynthia Brumfeld, a
senior analyst at Paul Kagan Associates Inc., told the trade
publication Interactive Week. ``(American Express) already knows
everything you buy and Amazon knows what you read. It's just having
all of these things funneling through one centralized place.''
</P>
<P>
   In small towns, where newspapers often print lists of most local
happenings, privacy has long been a relative matter. Now the same
criteria are about to be extended to the global village. Before
that occurs, it would be wise to be sure we're standing on sound
legal and ethical feet.

 &HT;    College admission law has mixed results
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A Texas law touted as a colorblind way to lure
more black and Hispanic students to in-state colleges produced
uneven results at the state's major universities and did not pack
the punch some lawmakers had expected.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said, however, that it's too soon to judge
whether Texas' effort to trump affirmative action in college
admissions is working. Many students, parents and counselors were
unaware of the 1997 law, which required state universities this
fall to admit residents graduating in the top 10 percent of their
high school class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story that's unfolding, and it would be difficult to
predict the end when we're just beginning,'' said University of
Texas Admissions Director Bruce Walker. But for UT, at least, ``the
top 10 percent law is heading the train in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Policymakers expected the state's most selective schools, namely
UT and Texas A&AMP;M University, to get the biggest bang out of the
law. They were among the few schools that previously rejected some
top 10 percent students. But a look at applications and enrollments
of students in the top 10 percent at those schools _ and two others
_ show mixed results and no apparent patterns:
</P>
<P>
   _UT gained applications from students in all racial groups in
the top 10 percent this fall and enrolled more from each group this
year than last year.
</P>
<P>
   _Texas A&AMP;M got fewer applications from top 10 percent students
across the board. Even so, it managed to enroll more Hispanic
students in the top 10 percent than it had the last two years. A&AMP;M
also enrolled more whites in the top 10 percent than in 1997 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   _Texas Tech University in Lubbock got fewer applications this
fall from Asian, black and white students in the top 10 percent.
But more Hispanics applied and got in.
</P>
<P>
   _The University of Houston, which already automatically admitted
students in the top 10 percent, got more applications from
top-ranked students and enrolled slightly more from each racial
group.
</P>
<P>
   Walker and other officials suggested it would take time for
Texans to become familiar with the law, which is being watched by
other states, including California, where affirmative action also
is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Texas lawmakers saw the law as a way to combat enrollment drops
of African Americans and Hispanics, two groups historically
underrepresented in Texas colleges. The declines in 1997 came after
the federal Hopwood ruling ended racial considerations in
admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Because of segregation in Texas high schools, lawmakers argued
that the law would give students in schools dominated by blacks and
Hispanics a shot at enrolling at the most selective schools. Test
scores would not be considered, another advantage for blacks and
Hispanics because they generally score lower on standardized tests
than whites and Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have so far is very inconclusive,'' said David
Montejano, who directs UT's Center for Mexican American Studies and
helped craft the law. ``The 10 percent plan is a framework from
which to work. What it does is shift the emphasis away from
admissions to recruitment. The key is the application rate.''
</P>
<P>
   In comparing the University of Texas and Texas A&AMP;M, UT attracts
more Asian and Hispanic applicants in the top 10 percent, while
Texas A&AMP;M draws more blacks and whites.
</P>
<P>
   At UT, 58 percent of Asians in the top 10 percent statewide
applied this fall, compared with 30 percent of Hispanics, 23
percent of whites and 14 percent of African Americans. While all of
those application percentages were higher than 1997 levels, they
were slightly lower than in 1996, the last year affirmative action
could be used.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Hispanic students who benefitted from the law was Eric
Saenz, who wanted to attend UT but had a low college entrance exam
score. His father, Benito Saenz, said the 10 percent law was a
``godsend'' for Eric, who ranked in the top 10 percent of his class
at La Joya High School in Hildago County. He was admitted to UT and
is majoring in kinesiology.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas A&AMP;M, 15 percent of all Texas black students in the top
10 percent applied, along with 29 percent of whites, 23 percent of
Hispanics and 16 percent of Asians. All of those percentages were
below the 1996 and 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such varied results, the Legislature should not
tinker with the law, said its author, state Rep. Irma Rangel,
D-Kingsville, chairwoman of the House Higher Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   She has been discouraged to learn that many students and
counselors in Texas didn't know about the law. ``How can we
implement a law when the independent school districts don't know
about it?'' Rangel asked.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent talk to about 300 high school students she
discovered only a handful had even heard of the law. ``I was very
depressed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said Texas A&AMP;M did not attract more minority applicants
because it did not do enough outreach. But William Perry, A&AMP;M's
executive associate provost, said the school worked hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm not so sure is how much of an overall effort was made
on the part of state government and the (Texas Higher Education)
Coordinating Board to do some sort of heavy-duty marketing and
public relations campaign,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said if she proposes any change, ``it probably will be
some directive to our universities and the Coordinating Board to
not keep this matter a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   But some lawmakers are said to be mulling changes to stiffen
academic requirements because of concerns that some students in the
top 10 percent will take easy classes and not end up succeeding in
college.
</P>
<P>
   Average scores on the Scholastic Assessment Test, or SAT, of top
10 students were down a few points at UT and Texas A&AMP;M but up at
Tech. Montejano said the differences were not statistically
significant.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine Garza, deputy director of admissions at UT, said he
believes the credentials of top 10 percent students is high. He had
concerns about the capabilities of only 10 such students out of
4,607 who applied to UT this fall. Five of the 10 chose not to
enroll.
</P>
<P>
   Dartinya Harris, a Pflugerville High School graduate who won an
alumni-sponsored minority scholarship to attend UT, said adding
academic requirements sounded like a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to a school with a curriculum that's not that
challenging, you can be in the top 10 percent and it doesn't really
say much,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Lansdowne, an Austin parent, agreed. Her daughter,
Katherine, had a 3.6 grade point average on a scale of 4.0 and 20
honors courses at the LBJ Science Academy, but did not rank in the
top 10. Katherine was denied regular admission to UT, was put on a
waiting list and ended up getting in a few days before classes
began. She dropped out in frustration after a billing snafu shut
her out of her classes.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Lansdowne said she supports diversity but thinks the law
penalizes some highly capable students, including minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Academy director Daniel Gohl said he is discussing the problem
with UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have students who get into some of the most highly
selective schools in the country, but they can't get into UT,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said she would fight any attempts to add more academic
requirements to the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guarantees an admission,'' she said. ``The students have
to make or break themselves.''

 &HT;    Get tips on healthy eating for holidays
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The holidays give new meaning to the thought of being
fat and happy.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe you'd be happier still if you knew a way to eliminate
the fat and keep the happiness. You've already made it through the
first part of the holidays, but New Year's celebrations loom. You
may already have developed some bad eating habits that make those
pants you got for Christmas a little on the tight side.
</P>
<P>
   Let's turn to the Web today to get some help fighting the battle
of the holiday bulge.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at a site called Holiday Survival Guide, where
you'll get a daily diet tip at
http://healthyideas.com/holiday/tip/. Don't look for miracle cures
here. Instead, you'll find sensible advice.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you'll learn most of us get the lion's share of
our calories from the evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   So smart dieters try to increase what they eat at breakfast and
lunch and cut back on the food consumed in the evening. Besides
helping with your diet, you'll probably sleep better, too.
</P>
<P>
   This page has an added feature you'll appreciate. You'll find
some holiday recipes that have just the right festive touch but
that also are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, some of the traditional New Year's food in the South is
both good for you and just flat-out good. So stock up on those
turnip greens and buy some extra black-eyed peas this year.
</P>
<P>
   Our next Web site is from a hospital, and you'll find that
hospitals are doing their best these days to keep you from becoming
an overnight guest.
</P>
<P>
   This hospital is located in Akron, Ohio, but _ operating on the
theory that folks in Akron eat just about as you do _ I'm going to
recommend you drop in on a page called Health Tips from Your
Hospital _ Holidays at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.agmc.org/health4.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with stress
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the reasons this is a good thing to do. For
one, there's more here than just diet tips.
</P>
<P>
   While you'll find advice about eating and overeating, you'll
also find out about some other holiday health hazards, including
one you've likely mentioned to a friend in the last day or so:
stress.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most joyous time of the year, but it's also one of
the busiest. And stress and overeating go hand-in-hand for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   So take a holistic approach to controlling your eating and your
health. You'll find, for instance, ways to simplify your holiday
tasks and to take the classical medical approach of triage _
handling the most critical and worthwhile tasks and postponing or
eliminating others _ with your life in general.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that everything, when it comes to your health, is
connected. Add in the fact that each person has unique dietary
needs and quirks, and you'll see why you need an entire Web full of
information to make rational decisions about eating, at this time
or any other time.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of the next site called: Sympatico:
HealthyWay: Diet &AMP; Nutrition Directory at
</P>
<P>
   http://www1.sympatico.ca
/Contents/Health/DIRECTORY/B3-C06-01.html.
</P>
<P>
   This is simply a collection of links that can take you to sites
dealing with everything from caffeine to cholesterol to health and
fitness for children. That way, using this page, you can customize
the health information you get based on your own lifestyle.

 &HT;    The last word on a scary economy
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Only once every 1,000 years does a scribe get a chance
to remark upon life at the turn of a millennium. The rollover of
all digits in a date is an event rarer than the election of a sane
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So starting next week, I no longer will be writing strictly
about economic issues. Instead, I'll be spending a year pondering
the dawn of a new age. But allow me to squeeze in three last words
on our economy:
</P>
<P>
   It worries me.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, I have been hearing economists say that all would
be right with the nation if only we could defeat inflation, balance
the federal budget, boost stock prices and push the unemployment
rate below 5 percent. So here we are.
</P>
<P>
   We have achieved a level of prosperity that previous generations
could not have imagined. In the early part of the century, many of
our grandparents had to stuff cardboard into their shoes when the
soles wore out. Our parents lived in 1,200-square-foot houses and
went to movie theaters in July to enjoy a bit of air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Today the typical new home has nearly 2,200 square feet and is
packed with appliances and comforts. We now have the highest rate
of homeownership in history, and more vehicles than people in this
country. We live longer, eat better and buy more than any
generation ever. Even poor Americans look rich relative to the
average person in Haiti, Honduras or other countries just a short
distance from our borders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the richer we get, the more we want and the less satisfied
we seem. Our mountains of track shoes, computer games, golf clubs
and coffee makers can't quell our urge to spend more. Millions of
Americans have convinced themselves that unless both parents work
50-hour weeks, their families won't ``survive.''
</P>
<P>
   This shopping compulsion, which some economists are calling
``affluenza,'' is driving us to spend more than we earn. The U.S.
household savings rate, which was nearly 6 percent of income as
recently as 1993, has officially vanished. The Commerce Department
reported that in November, purchases of goods and services exceeded
disposable income. Rising incomes allowed the savings rate to nudge
up to a pitiful 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Frantic spending normally happens only after a war or
depression, when consumers rush to satisfy pent-up demands for
basic goods. But we have been enjoying 94 consecutive months of
strong growth and vigorous consumer spending. We should now be
moving into a period of heavy saving for rainy days. But we aren't
saving nearly as much as we were during the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   Warning signs
</P>
<P>
   This consumer frenzy is making us more and more vulnerable to
future economic downturns. When this growth bubble finally bursts,
we'll have scant savings to see us through for the short term. Not
only are we failing to prepare for a recession, we are not saving
for our retirement years. Long after our VCRs have been thrown into
the landfill, we will still be alive, needing medicine and food.
Will we then expect our children to support us?
</P>
<P>
   As a nation, we have achieved most of our economic objectives,
from running a federal budget surplus to vastly improving our
manufacturing productivity. But as individuals, we are failing to
reach sensible goals, such as paying off bills, investing for
retirement, saving for the next generation's education and spending
more time with loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Unless we can find a cure for our affluenza, we may end up with
very full landfills and very empty lives in our older years.

<P>
   ``Who's up for Monopoly?'' my husband called out one afternoon
during the recent holidays. Two sons rallied to the challenge; the
third was out with friends.
</P>
<P>
   They only made about two laps around the board, though, before
one son left with a friend to go to a movie, and the other son
received a phone call and also left to meet up with friends.
</P>
<P>
   My husband sat there sadly, his ``Get Out of Jail Free'' card in
his hand. I walked over and handed him a ``You Inherit $100'' card.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feel better?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   I must confess that during the holidays I hold a personal grudge
against Norman Rockwell. When he captured forever the idyllic scene
of happy, loving family gathered around a table of bounty, beatific
smiles on each cleanly scrubbed and angelic face, he put thousands
of mothers into therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Right up there with him in my book are Hallmark commercials, the
Waltons and all women's magazines. Don't even mention Martha
Stewart. What I wouldn't give to have a fully loaded glue gun and
an hour alone with her.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we see the magazine covers, the television ads and
the greeting cards, and that blankety-blank Rockwell image starts
circling around in our heads. First thing you know, we're up to our
elbows in glitter, ribbon, cookie dough and turkey gizzards trying
to re-create ``The Perfect Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure magnifies when the first child goes off to college
and returns for the holidays. Never mind that when he was growing
up, you only cooked one or two meals a week and lunch was a
grab-as-you-can affair. Suddenly you feel compelled to whip up
steaming hot, nutritious meals at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   One turn is all I have in me. It's a sad thing when, after only
a couple of days at home, your child begins to reminisce fondly
about the dorm food at college.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a strange holiday season for us. The children are
gathered around, and yet they aren't. A friend of mine experienced
this over Thanksgiving. For days ahead she busied herself gathering
the ingredients for a wonderful meal, setting out cornucopias and
festive autumn wreaths. She bought candles for the table and dug
out the real cloth napkins. Her expectations for the Rockwell
Thanksgiving were sky-high.
</P>
<P>
   When the kids all came home the day before Thanksgiving, she was
ready. She sat attentively at the breakfast table waiting to hear
all their news, but they slept in late, grumbled grouchily when
they did get up, slurped down some coffee and then left to meet
friends. At lunch they arrived in shifts, grabbing a sandwich,
scooping up a handful of chips and waving a ``Later'' as they
headed back out the door.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Thanksgiving meal came, she was totally
disheartened. Her idyllic family holiday had gone south, along with
all the men in her family, who were on a hunting expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was OK that they had other plans,'' she told me later. ``I
didn't begrudge them that. It's just that I set myself up for
something that just isn't realistic for how we live our life. Why
do we do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Why, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   As my husband and I gathered up the abandoned Monopoly game that
afternoon, we realized our lives, too, had reached a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   We no longer are the center of our children's universe. They
have friends, activities, plans. And almost none of it involves us.
Unless, of course, they need money. Then we give them a handful of
slightly crumpled, orange $500 bills and hope we never have to use
that ``Get Out of Jail Free'' card.

   ATLANTA _ So you wanna party like it's 1999? Well, there are
lots of folks willing to help you do just that. As millennium fever
sweeps the planet and the Internet, you can check the Web to find
out just how big the party is going to be and how you can join in.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwide Observatory of the Year 2000
</P>
<P>
   (http://www.tour-eiffel.fr/teiffel/an2000uk/) is updated almost
daily and provides users with every millennium-related event from
the scientific to the just plain fun going on around the world. The
interactive forums allow you to send an electronic New Year's card,
talk about the Y2K problem or vote for the most remarkable people
of the last two millenniums. So far, it's a pretty interesting list
that includes Ghandi, Einstein, John Lennon and Kurt Cobain, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you always wanted to know about the millennium and
then some can be found at Countdown 2000
(http://www.countdown2000.com). Organized by topics such as
``Celebrations'' and ``Doomsday News'' (killer asteroids and so
forth), and including an online souvenir shop, Countdown2000 pretty
much contains everything you need to know to celebrate and fear the
coming century.
</P>
<P>
   At Everything2000 (http://www.everything2000.com), you'll find
trivia that's big on celebrating, surveys and the more festive
aspects of the millennium. Here you'll find countdown calendars,
screen savers, surveys and feature stories on how the world is
getting ready for the big day, plus a little sorely needed
millennium humor. The category is a little thin right now and
invites users to send in their own Year 2000 jokes and stories. The
site also boasts the best list of places to go and things to see on
Dec. 31, 1999, in the United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium has also provided an excellent excuse for
everyone to make lists of nearly everything that's happened in the
last 100 or 1,000 years. Fiftythings (http://www.fiftythings.com)
offers lists of cultural, environmental, musical and ordinary
things worth saving in the next millennium. The lists change every
month and include everything from bicycles to cats to the Lilith
Fair. A particular favorite is the list of jokes with the
explanation ``you gotta keep a sense of humor in the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic Online takes a very realistic look at what
the world will be like in the 21st century at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.nationalgeographic.com/features/2000/index.html. The
site's ongoing millennium coverage looks back on the century's
great explorers and inventors and takes a look ahead to the
problems of population and hunger facing the planet in the next 100
years. The National Geographic site is an educational and welcome
relief from the gloom and doom millennium sites populating the Web.

 &HT;    Trying to keep cool in a flurry of runny noses
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ This column is not for the squeamish. It's
ugly and it's personal. It's about runny noses. Everybody in the
eighth grade seems to have one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Schuett, (Shniff! Shluup!), I need to blow my nose
(Shluunk!).'' Understatement of the year, I'm thinking. This kid
doesn't need Kleenex, he needs a bucket. I tell him to go to the
restroom and not to come back until he's emptied his sinuses.
</P>
<P>
   What is it with kids and runny noses? When I was in the first
grade, I sat next to a boy named Arthur. He was infatuated with me
and used to send love notes and mushy valentines. I was afraid to
touch them because Arthur's nose remained in a state of chronic
drip. It dripped on his desk work, hopelessly smearing his ovals
and slants, it ran down the front of his clothes when he forgot to
wipe it on his sleeve, and in the winter when he showed up with a
muffler wound around his face - Uck!
</P>
<P>
   In second grade Arthur and I were in a play together - I was
Anna, and he was Olaf of the Fjords. We ate fish and sat with our
parents in front of the stove to keep warm. At a tender moment in
one particularly moving scene, Olaf was supposed to take my hand
and reassure me that we would survive the blizzard. Of
</P>
<P>
   course, it wasn't the blowing snow and howling wind I was
worried about. I was
</P>
<P>
   going nuts about touching Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   During rehearsals when the magic moment arrived, I was unable to
bring myself
</P>
<P>
   to do it - to take Arthur's hand. The teacher threatened to give
my part to Phyllis if I didn't shape up. I hated Phyllis. Talk
about a rock and a hard place. I loved the idea of being Anna, but
not to Arthur's Olaf. I went home and whined to my mother who in
turn had a talk with my teacher, Miss Jude. The next day at
rehearsal Miss Jude explained to the cast that since the play took
place in a cold country, my character would be wearing gloves. Man!
How do you spell R-E-L-I-E-F?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I'm a fine one to talk. I was born with sinuses like
sewers and allergies to everything including my first boyfriend's
hair tonic.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning as I stood at the side door ready to leave for
elementary school, my mother would run through her 3-H checklist:
hair clips, homework, handkerchief (a big one of my father's that
she pinned to the front of my dress). Without my ``mop'' as the
family jokingly referred to it, I was unfit for socialization.
Once, I lost it on the way to school and the teacher caught me
wiping my nose on my petticoat. I was mortified.
</P>
<P>
   One of the serious drawbacks of a nose like mine is that air
cannot be taken in through it. All of my life I've been a
mouth-breather except once in a hotel
</P>
<P>
   room in Los Angeles. It was such a tremendous breakthrough that
I woke up my
</P>
<P>
   husband to share the moment. ``Kiss me!'' I insisted, wanting to
demonstrate that
</P>
<P>
   I could kiss and breathe at the same time rather than having to
break off mid-buss to gasp for air. His glassy-eyed stare suggested
he wasn't nearly as thrilled as I had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can breathe through my nose. Kiss me!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You woke me up at 4 o'clock in the morning to tell me you can
breathe through your nose?'' Insensitive lout. I guessed the
honeymoon was over.
</P>
<P>
   This morning I came to school prepared with a roll of paper
towels to stem the flow. Fifteen eighth graders sit facing me.
Fourteen of them are in varying stages of upper respiratory
infections. In between the snuffles, snorts, and raucous fits of
coughing, I'm trying to explain the workings of a 3-point,
5-paragraph essay. I tell them I feel like I'm trying to teach
writing in a pneumonia ward. They hack on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget it,'' I say, finally. ``Everybody except Dan grab a
paper towel and go out into the hall and blow.'' Quite a tableau.
Fourteen kids lined up blowing their noses and snorting like bull
elephants. But it was an exercise in futility. Five minutes later
we had to do it all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Winter has just begun, I'm thinking to myself, and already we're
only getting five minutes to the blow. At this rate we'll be
finishing our essays in summer school.

 &HT;    Gift of driving skill is a loving present
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Christmas Day, I was reminded that often our best
gifts are those we give away.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Detroit auto show, I won a Skip Barber
Performance Driving School session. Having been an instructor for
the organization, I saw no reason to take advantage of the prize,
so I passed it along to my friend Norma Jean.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Jean is not a bad driver. Fact is, I always considered her
a good one, but like many women _ through constant ``friendly
driving tips'' from her husband _ she lacked confidence in her
ability.
</P>
<P>
   An impromptu lesson about how anti-lock brakes function _ in the
middle of busy Peachtree Industrial Boulevard during a driving
rainstorm _ was the final straw for Norma Jean and her husband's
driving relationship.
</P>
<P>
   She cried, ``Fine, if you think I need driving lessons, I'll get
them _ but not from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the need was created for my gift. Norma Jean picked
Barber's Lime Rock, Conn., school. Aside from her husband's
``helpfulness,'' she had other reasons for attending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretly, I always wanted to be a race-car driver, but more
importantly I wanted to be a good, safe, street driver. As the
daughter of a trucker, I felt that I had been raised on the rules
of the road and the basics of how to survive in case of a mistake,
but I knew I lacked real confidence in my ability. I also had
something to prove to the `king of the road.'''
</P>
<P>
   Norma Jean learned a lot at Skip Barber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came away realizing that in my California driver's ed class,
I learned how to pass a test, not how to drive a car. I now know
that what we typically know about driving, we learn through our own
personal mistakes or failures. The best part of this school was
that I was allowed to learn without the price of failure. I came
away knowing the three basic elements of driving deal with load
transfer of the contact patch (tire's grip), a vehicle's stored
energy (for every action there is a reaction) and most importantly
that there are three ways to control a car _ the brake, the
throttle and the steering wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Her instructor took her for a ride in a Dodge Viper, where he
only used the throttle and the steering wheel. ``It made me aware
that not only are some cars more than average drivers can handle,
and that my desire to be a race-car driver was unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Next they put the class through skid control in a Dodge Dakota
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never experienced a skid before. I still don't like the
sensation, but I now know that I can deal with one should it
happen. Overall, they taught me my limits behind a steering wheel.
While I know now that I will never be a racer, I came away knowing
that I really am a good driver ... but I learned there is always
room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving is like any other skill; you have to work your way up to
a level of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Jean concluded, ``Being prepared behind a steering wheel
is more than just a gift of love, it can be a gift of life.''
</P>
<P>
   She planned on giving a course to her teen-age son and persuaded
her sister to give her 50-year-old brother-in-law and 30-year-old
son a performance driving school session as their Christmas gift
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Happy holidays and drive safely.

 &HT;    Brakes let you know before they go bad
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week, we began discussing brakes. This week,
let's look at one of the more common questions I hear about them.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How do I know when I need brakes?
</P>
<P>
   A:Your car gives you a couple of ``I need brakes'' warning signs
before they get to the dangerous point and can't stop the car
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   One is the brake pedal will travel farther toward the floor
before it bottoms and the vehicle stops. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Every time you apply the brakes and the brake pads and shoes
contact the rotors and drums, a little bit of brake lining material
is worn away. To compensate for the wear, it takes more fluid to
fill the hydraulic cylinder down at the wheel and push the piston
against the brake pad. Consequently, you have to push farther to
make the car stop.
</P>
<P>
   Check the brake fluid level in the master cylinder (usually a
white plastic container with black caps under the hood, in front of
the steering wheel). If the fluid is low in one or both of the
sections and there are no leaks in the system, it is a pretty good
indication your brake pads and or shoes are worn.
</P>
<P>
   Another way brakes tell you they need to be replaced is the
little chirping sound from the brake wear indicator.
</P>
<P>
   This device is actually a piece of soft metal attached to the
brake pad. As the pads wear down, the metal contacts the rotor and
starts chirping while the car is rolling. Its job is to warn the
driver the brakes are at the wear limit. When you apply the brakes,
the noise should diminish.
</P>
<P>
   If the brake pad continues to wear, the noise will escalate to a
scraping/squealing and eventually a metallic grinding, meaning the
lining material is completely worn off and the metal part of the
pad is eating into the rotor. This is a dangerous condition and an
expensive repair.
</P>
<P>
   Design and simple physics do 65 to 75 percent of a car's braking
by the front brakes. The average car will wear out about two sets
of front brake pads to one set of rear shoes, as long as the system
is functioning properly and you don't drive with the emergency
brake applied.
</P>
<P>
   Rear brakes should be inspected when the front brakes are
replaced, but plan on replacing them between the second and third
set of front brakes. Rear drum brakes have no wear indicators, so
you won't hear an audible signal when they are getting low.
However, the brake pedal will push down farther with worn rear
brakes, as with the fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Rear drum brakes have self-adjusters that are either actuated
when the car is backed up and brakes are applied or when the
emergency brake is used. Misadjusted rear brakes will also cause a
low pedal.
</P>
<P>
   The front brakes don't need adjusting. It is accomplished
hydraulically and by design in the disc brake caliper.
</P>
<P>
   With the typical stop-and-go metro driving, the life of the
average front brake pads is about 25,000 to 30,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   A clarification on emissions testing
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999 tag season, all odd-year 1993 and older vehicles
requiring emission testing must go to an ``all vehicles welcome''
test station.
</P>
<P>
   However, tests this month on some 1993 vehicles may vary because
of differences in equipment. After Jan. 1, all 1993 and older
vehicles must undergo dynometer tests.

 &HT;    Visions of fast-food, paintball, and learning between goal posts
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Having made the unforgivable mistake of trying to
take New Road from Valley Mills Drive to Franklin Avenue on an
early pre-Christmas evening, I had time to ponder the future.
</P>
<P>
   I had time because the traffic was backed up almost from Waco
Drive to Valley Mills, partly because the traffic signals are timed
to give maximum mobility to people on Franklin and Waco Drive. This
gives those on New Road almost none. It took five traffic-light
changes to traverse two blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The super store/restaurant explosion at New Road and Franklin
has initiated a traffic crush only seen in Waco for Big 12
Saturdays and Harley dismounts. And it's just begun. The location
already has a Super Wal-Mart, Super Kmart, Lowe's, McDonalds,
T.G.I.Fridays, Chick-Fil-A, Outback Steakhouse and a strip center
featuring Petsmart-Service Merchandise. Soon it will have a Luby's,
Der Weinerschnitzel, Jack in the Box and a Chevron convenience
store. Add to these the recent arrival of two16-screen theaters in
the Franklin corridor and you've got a grilled gridlock sandwich,
with only minimal access to comb the new and growing Wal-Mart hive.
</P>
<P>
   With Franklin Avenue designed, as a Trib story explained, ``for
truckers, not shoppers,'' you've got developments in full gallop
without the means to manage the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But Franklin-New Road isn't the only example. In Waco schools,
we have a commitment to spend $13 million over 20 years for a new
stadium although the district isn't sure how it will pay for other
crucial classroom needs.
</P>
<P>
   And with the City of Waco we've got a crumbling recreation
infrastucture _ a dead Lions Park Pool most prominent _ leaving
children out in the street.
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to imagine the consequences of all of these. To be
honest, I can't bear to look . . .

 &HT;    New chip from AMD seen as threat to Intel
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is the hegemony of Intel's Pentium processors coming
to an end? The December issue of PC Gamer thinks so. Check out why
in a provocative article about Advanced Micro Devices' new chip,
which the magazine calls Intel's David. AMD's new chip is called
K6-2, and what makes it special is its 3DNOW instruction set. The
magazine says 3DNOW greatly accelerates the chip's ability to run
graphics _ especially 3-D graphics. In other words, games played on
computer using this chip will be screamers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also offers scores of reviews on new games. One in
particular is about the latest Indiana Jones game by LucasArts. The
magazine says Lara Croft of ``Tomb Raider'' better move over _ this
game is exciting and action-packed.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Cyberflix's latest release, ``Redjack, Revenge of the
Brethren,'' is getting good reviews, including one in The New York
Times. This computer CD is a role-playing game based on a story
line about pirates in the Caribbean. The object of the game is to
figure out who killed the great fallen pirate, avenge his death,
steal all the gold and run off with the girl. Available for both
PCs and Macs, ``Redjack'' retails for $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new trend in computer CDs in which companies are
linking games with hands-on toys or controls. The latest example is
Hasbro Interactive's ``Star Wars Millennium Falcon CD-ROM
Playset.'' This game comes with a hand-control playset that snaps
onto the computer keyboard. Available only for Windows 95 PCs, it
retails for $49.95.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a great place to research a medical condition. A
good place to start is Medscape. This Web site includes 7,000
articles on medical research. There's also a free link to something
called Medline, which has more than 8.4 million abstracts from
3,800 medical journals. You'll find Medscape at
http://www.medscape.com.

 &HT;    World Book Discoveries DVD brings French accent to history
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ IBM has entered the field of DVD-ROMs with World Book
Discoveries, a massive encyclopedia devoted to the student of
history and, more or less incidentally, to the student of Gallic
software design.
</P>
<P>
   Once again we encounter those wildly creative Frenchmen in whose
designs form rises like a helium balloon above the American
concepts of function.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries is, of course, huge; it covers the contents of five
normal CD-ROMs, in which form it is also available. Being
French-designed, it is of course also beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   As I have remarked in the past, the French software designers
march to the beat of a different drum, and Discoveries presents the
beats of a great many drums, some of them so loud you can scarcely
hear the narration, but that, you will find, isn't really important
because the narration is superficial and usually is repeated in the
text.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries is very, very big on sound, most of it signifying
nothing. In the sections on the creation of the universe, for
instance, there is a lot of eerie space music. Discussions of great
battles are accompanied by screaming, yelling and clashing of
spears, and screens on the rise of mammals on earth give rise to
disembodied grunts and snarls.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is undeniably atmospheric, but if you spend very
long at a given screen it can become annoying.
</P>
<P>
   The unifying feature of French design, of course, is
disunification, at least by the standards of U.S. software design.
If you have spent much time with encyclopedic software, you become
used to certain general traits.
</P>
<P>
   Hot spots on a screen are identified by text in a different
color, or by the cursor changing shape as it passes over the spot.
The French scoff at such consistency in the same way a Cordon Bleu
chef would sneer at an underdone sauce.
</P>
<P>
   If you consider the organization of Discoveries in layers, the
top layer is a corridor, or gallery, in which you move down an
ill-lit, portentous hall with back-lit illustrations along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Each is a portal into an era. This, certainly, is a very nice
conceit. It works pretty well, too, but below that upper layer
things seem to get somewhat unsteady.
</P>
<P>
   I could try to explain the more detailed methods of navigation
through this giant CD-ROM, but it would only confuse you because it
certainly confuses me.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering Discoveries
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say Discoveries is truly an adventure; you never
know what you will discover next. The basic keys _ other than
trying to memorize the little manual _ are the sometimes
hard-to-see menus at the top of the screen. These have menus within
menus within menus that will generally get you where you want to go
within a given era.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries is aimed for the most part, it would appear, at the
grade- and middle-school level. There are, for instance, five
references to Albert Einstein, who is usually represented by a
photo showing him sticking his tongue out at the viewer. All of
these assure the reader that Einstein was one of the greatest
scientists who ever lived, the man who postulated the theory of
relativity and turned upside down our notions of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   If you need any notion of what his theories amounted to, you'll
have to go elsewhere. I could find no mention anywhere, for
instance, of the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   You may come upon a full-screen picture, very nicely rendered,
of the Trojan Horse, and see little Trojans lowering themselves out
of its belly.
</P>
<P>
   Barely discernible over the lowering orchestral music, a woman
intones: ``Troy, in the time of the legendary heroes: The Trojan
horse.'' If you never heard this story, you may well wonder what is
going on here.
</P>
<P>
   You may well wonder for a long time, because there is no text.
Annoyed, you click on Search and search for Trojan. You find
several references, including one to the picture of the Trojan
Horse. There is, as far as I could tell, no text discussing the
Trojan Horse.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling these Frenchmen may be akin to the least desirable end
of the horse, you return to the picture, and idly passing the
cursor over a part of it and letting it rest, you see it turns into
a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   If you turn it into a microphone at the gate of Troy, you get
the beginning of the legend. If you accidentally hit the mike at
the horse's underbelly, you get the middle of it first.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean World Book Discoveries is a wash? Absolutely
not. The information it contains should be more than enough for any
lower-grade project, and is presented in often unique and useful
ways.
</P>
<P>
   It is ravishingly beautiful. It is entertaining. The student can
lift not only all the text and all the art and copy it into a word
processor, but the sound can be copied, too.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it is an opportunity to see the concepts of
organization the way Inspector Clouseau understood them. And, to be
sure, I suspect French software designers get a few giggles out of
Microsoft Encarta, too.

 &HT;    Careful tweaking can enhance dial-up Net connection
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There you sit, still finding wrapping paper scraps
under the couch, happy but mentally breathless after all the
holiday rush. And there's still New Year's ahead, so you can't
quite sit still.
</P>
<P>
   You have a brand-new computer, fully equipped with enough RAM
memory to run a respectable space program and with the fastest
analog modem money can buy. But dang _ using the Web is still like
running in mud, you had time to fix a turkey sandwich while the
last Web page loaded. Your cable company does not yet offer cable
modems in your area, despite the fliers that come in the mail
promising high-speed salvation soon. ISDN connections and ADSL seem
sort of excessive for a person such as yourself.
</P>
<P>
   You suspect that if your phone lines were just a little better,
you could move along faster. Maybe the 56k bps modem isn't fast
enough, but there's probably a little bit of speed left in it, if
you just knew how to tweak all the settings to get the most speed.
</P>
<P>
   So today we'll look at ways to get more from what you already
have and speed up your Internet connection. Truth is, none of this
stuff is foolproof, but maybe it will help. We'll cover a lot of
ground in a small amount of space, but maybe some of these
suggestions will start you off in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the software on your computer. Most experts
agree that the default settings for connection to the Internet _
Windows 98 and 95 use a system called Dial Up Networking, called
DUN _ can be changed on many computers to create a better and
faster connection. But messing with these settings, unless you have
a propeller on top of your beanie hat, is really confusing and can
make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, if you are serious about changing these DUN
settings, you need to spend $15 on a little program called
TweakDUN. If you've read this column for a while, you can probably
count the commercial programs that I've recommended on one hand. I
don't do this very often, but I've used this program for a while
and I'm convinced it's a good one. You can order it from its makers
by going to this address on the Web _
http://www.pattersondesigns.com/tweakdun/.
</P>
<P>
   I won't go into a lot of detail because I want to save a bit of
space to talk about your telephone line and what you can do if it
has problems. But let me offer one last bit of advice. If your
modem is already connecting in the 40k bps range and up, I would
follow some of the best tech advice available: Leave things alone;
you're already doing better than 80 percent of all dial-up modem
users.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble down the line
</P>
<P>
   Now let's look at that telephone line. You have to understand
that it just wasn't made for sending and receiving data. Analog
modems are basically gadgets for tricking the telephone system by
converting the digital computer information into various squawks
and squeaks.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of reasons why a telephone line might not be
adequate. You can start _ if you have problems _ by calling the
telephone company. If there is audible line noise and if the
problem originates outside your home, not in the wiring inside your
home, you might get some free help. As modems have become more
common, and since many phone companies are now in the Internet
business, you may find knowledgeable help.
</P>
<P>
   If the problems are inside your home, then that wiring is your
responsibility. So a lot depends on how much it is worth to you to
fix the problem. If you have line noise you can hear, try finding
the phone junction box where the phone service enters your home.
Most of these boxes have a connection built in for connecting a
phone directly to this box. Do that and listen.
</P>
<P>
   If the line noise is absent at the box, but can be heard at your
phone, you know the problem is somewhere in your wiring.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pay $125 and up to get a professional to fix things if
the problem is in your wiring.
</P>
<P>
   (I'm not going to recommend you rewire your home yourself. I'll
figure that if you are actively considering this, you know enough
already. And if the idea sounds insane to you, then it probably
is.)
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's a start toward speeding things up and perhaps that
will hold you until you can get a cable modem or some other method
of high-speed access.

 &HT;    Bugged by software glitches? New book outlines your rights
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We have laws to help when our Lincoln is a lemon. But
when our Microsoft Windows doesn't work, we have to rely on
toll-free help desks and online advice.
</P>
<P>
   A book called ``Bad Software: What to Do When Software Fails''
brings consumer rights to the Information Age. The book was written
by Cem Kaner and David Pels, both of whom have experience in
software technical support, quality assurance and software law. The
book shows you how to get a refund, fix bugs, find more support
and, occasionally, be compensated for things that quit working as a
result of faulty software.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader calls it a ``how-to book for consumer protection in
the Information Age.''
</P>
<P>
   The book breaks down the steps needed to claim your customer
rights, including how to get a refund quickly; how to decide when
to try and fix it yourself; when to call the help desk; and how to
deal more effectively with the help desk. Should legal action be
necessary, the authors also lay out how to understand and apply
your rights and how to pick a lawyer who knows the industry and can
keep your fees low.
</P>
<P>
   The book retails for about $30. It is available at online
bookstores and at the author's site, which is devoted to helping
customers who have bought bad software. It's at
http://www.badsoftware.com.
</P>
<P>
   Static-free, cord-free
</P>
<P>
   It is a little late for Christmas, but not too late for the
after-Christmas sales. Toshiba has released a line of 25-channel,
900-megahertz cordless phones that claim to virtually eliminate
static.
</P>
<P>
   The phones come with an auto-scanning feature that automatically
changes frequencies when you come across static or interference.
Toshiba's Compandor Plus noise-reduction system further cuts
ambient noise. The line of phones is on the high end of the 900-MHz
spectrum, retailing for between $220 and $250.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba's 25-channel phones are a bit less expensive, retailing
for between $80 and $100. They include handset volume control, a
mute button, a 10-speed number dial and a handset locator page key.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-channel phones have a NiteCall illumination feature that
gives a green glow over the handset, making it easier to dial in
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-channel model also offers Call Protect, which scrambles
calls so eavesdroppers using scanners or randomly stumbling across
your frequency hear only gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   With a digital answering machine, the 25-channel phone sells for
between $190 and $230.
</P>
<P>
   On-board satellite
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has enhanced its dashboard satellite system for
1999. Three years old, OnStar is now available in 31 GM models and
is standard equipment in Cadillac's Escalade, the upscale
sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   OnStar uses the Global Positioning satellite network and
cellular technology to connect the vehicle to the OnStar support
center for 24-hour help with emergency service and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   The OnStar system on the Cadillac Escapade is a three-button pad
built into the overhead console. The driver can speak, hands-free,
into a microphone built into the headliner. The OnStar center
offers directions, diagnostics, information about the nearest
hotels, restaurants and other points of interest. One button is
reserved for emergencies; a third ends calls to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held hotbed
</P>
<P>
   The hand-held computer market surged this year. The 3Com Palm
Pilot is still the market giant, with a 75 percent share, but the
number of models on the market grew from 44 to 62. Of those, half
are Windows CE-supported, according to Intelect ASW, a marketing
services company in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Pilots are also the least expensive. Prices ranged from
$287 to $360 in 1998. Windows CE devices, which are Windows
95-compatible, ranged from $685 to $550.
</P>
<P>
   The top Windows CE brands were Casio, Philips and
Hewlett-Packard.

 &HT;    Get tips on healthy eating for holidays
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The holidays give new meaning to the thought of being
fat and happy.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe you'd be happier still if you knew a way to eliminate
the fat and keep the happiness. You've already made it through the
first part of the holidays, but New Year's celebrations loom. You
may already have developed some bad eating habits that make those
pants you got for Christmas a little on the tight side.
</P>
<P>
   Let's turn to the Web today to get some help fighting the battle
of the holiday bulge.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start at a site called Holiday Survival Guide, where
you'll get a daily diet tip at
http://healthyideas.com/holiday/tip/. Don't look for miracle cures
here. Instead, you'll find sensible advice.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you'll learn most of us get the lion's share of
our calories from the evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   So smart dieters try to increase what they eat at breakfast and
lunch and cut back on the food consumed in the evening. Besides
helping with your diet, you'll probably sleep better, too.
</P>
<P>
   This page has an added feature you'll appreciate. You'll find
some holiday recipes that have just the right festive touch but
that also are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, some of the traditional New Year's food in the South is
both good for you and just flat-out good. So stock up on those
turnip greens and buy some extra black-eyed peas this year.
</P>
<P>
   Our next Web site is from a hospital, and you'll find that
hospitals are doing their best these days to keep you from becoming
an overnight guest.
</P>
<P>
   This hospital is located in Akron, Ohio, but _ operating on the
theory that folks in Akron eat just about as you do _ I'm going to
recommend you drop in on a page called Health Tips from Your
Hospital _ Holidays at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.agmc.org/health4.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with stress
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the reasons this is a good thing to do. For
one, there's more here than just diet tips.
</P>
<P>
   While you'll find advice about eating and overeating, you'll
also find out about some other holiday health hazards, including
one you've likely mentioned to a friend in the last day or so:
stress.
</P>
<P>
   This is the most joyous time of the year, but it's also one of
the busiest. And stress and overeating go hand-in-hand for some
people.
</P>
<P>
   So take a holistic approach to controlling your eating and your
health. You'll find, for instance, ways to simplify your holiday
tasks and to take the classical medical approach of triage _
handling the most critical and worthwhile tasks and postponing or
eliminating others _ with your life in general.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that everything, when it comes to your health, is
connected. Add in the fact that each person has unique dietary
needs and quirks, and you'll see why you need an entire Web full of
information to make rational decisions about eating, at this time
or any other time.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of the next site called: Sympatico:
HealthyWay: Diet &AMP; Nutrition Directory at
</P>
<P>
   http://www1.sympatico.ca
/Contents/Health/DIRECTORY/B3-C06-01.html.
</P>
<P>
   This is simply a collection of links that can take you to sites
dealing with everything from caffeine to cholesterol to health and
fitness for children. That way, using this page, you can customize
the health information you get based on your own lifestyle.

   ATLANTA _ So you wanna party like it's 1999? Well, there are
lots of folks willing to help you do just that. As millennium fever
sweeps the planet and the Internet, you can check the Web to find
out just how big the party is going to be and how you can join in.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwide Observatory of the Year 2000
</P>
<P>
   (http://www.tour-eiffel.fr/teiffel/an2000uk/) is updated almost
daily and provides users with every millennium-related event from
the scientific to the just plain fun going on around the world. The
interactive forums allow you to send an electronic New Year's card,
talk about the Y2K problem or vote for the most remarkable people
of the last two millenniums. So far, it's a pretty interesting list
that includes Ghandi, Einstein, John Lennon and Kurt Cobain, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you always wanted to know about the millennium and
then some can be found at Countdown 2000
(http://www.countdown2000.com). Organized by topics such as
``Celebrations'' and ``Doomsday News'' (killer asteroids and so
forth), and including an online souvenir shop, Countdown2000 pretty
much contains everything you need to know to celebrate and fear the
coming century.
</P>
<P>
   At Everything2000 (http://www.everything2000.com), you'll find
trivia that's big on celebrating, surveys and the more festive
aspects of the millennium. Here you'll find countdown calendars,
screen savers, surveys and feature stories on how the world is
getting ready for the big day, plus a little sorely needed
millennium humor. The category is a little thin right now and
invites users to send in their own Year 2000 jokes and stories. The
site also boasts the best list of places to go and things to see on
Dec. 31, 1999, in the United States and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium has also provided an excellent excuse for
everyone to make lists of nearly everything that's happened in the
last 100 or 1,000 years. Fiftythings (http://www.fiftythings.com)
offers lists of cultural, environmental, musical and ordinary
things worth saving in the next millennium. The lists change every
month and include everything from bicycles to cats to the Lilith
Fair. A particular favorite is the list of jokes with the
explanation ``you gotta keep a sense of humor in the next
millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic Online takes a very realistic look at what
the world will be like in the 21st century at
</P>
<P>
   http://www.nationalgeographic.com/features/2000/index.html. The
site's ongoing millennium coverage looks back on the century's
great explorers and inventors and takes a look ahead to the
problems of population and hunger facing the planet in the next 100
years. The National Geographic site is an educational and welcome
relief from the gloom and doom millennium sites populating the Web.

 &HT;    Gift of driving skill is a loving present
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Christmas Day, I was reminded that often our best
gifts are those we give away.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Detroit auto show, I won a Skip Barber
Performance Driving School session. Having been an instructor for
the organization, I saw no reason to take advantage of the prize,
so I passed it along to my friend Norma Jean.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Jean is not a bad driver. Fact is, I always considered her
a good one, but like many women _ through constant ``friendly
driving tips'' from her husband _ she lacked confidence in her
ability.
</P>
<P>
   An impromptu lesson about how anti-lock brakes function _ in the
middle of busy Peachtree Industrial Boulevard during a driving
rainstorm _ was the final straw for Norma Jean and her husband's
driving relationship.
</P>
<P>
   She cried, ``Fine, if you think I need driving lessons, I'll get
them _ but not from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the need was created for my gift. Norma Jean picked
Barber's Lime Rock, Conn., school. Aside from her husband's
``helpfulness,'' she had other reasons for attending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretly, I always wanted to be a race-car driver, but more
importantly I wanted to be a good, safe, street driver. As the
daughter of a trucker, I felt that I had been raised on the rules
of the road and the basics of how to survive in case of a mistake,
but I knew I lacked real confidence in my ability. I also had
something to prove to the `king of the road.'''
</P>
<P>
   Norma Jean learned a lot at Skip Barber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came away realizing that in my California driver's ed class,
I learned how to pass a test, not how to drive a car. I now know
that what we typically know about driving, we learn through our own
personal mistakes or failures. The best part of this school was
that I was allowed to learn without the price of failure. I came
away knowing the three basic elements of driving deal with load
transfer of the contact patch (tire's grip), a vehicle's stored
energy (for every action there is a reaction) and most importantly
that there are three ways to control a car _ the brake, the
throttle and the steering wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Her instructor took her for a ride in a Dodge Viper, where he
only used the throttle and the steering wheel. ``It made me aware
that not only are some cars more than average drivers can handle,
and that my desire to be a race-car driver was unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Next they put the class through skid control in a Dodge Dakota
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never experienced a skid before. I still don't like the
sensation, but I now know that I can deal with one should it
happen. Overall, they taught me my limits behind a steering wheel.
While I know now that I will never be a racer, I came away knowing
that I really am a good driver ... but I learned there is always
room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving is like any other skill; you have to work your way up to
a level of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Jean concluded, ``Being prepared behind a steering wheel
is more than just a gift of love, it can be a gift of life.''
</P>
<P>
   She planned on giving a course to her teen-age son and persuaded
her sister to give her 50-year-old brother-in-law and 30-year-old
son a performance driving school session as their Christmas gift
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Happy holidays and drive safely.

 &HT;    New chip from AMD seen as threat to Intel
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is the hegemony of Intel's Pentium processors coming
to an end? The December issue of PC Gamer thinks so. Check out why
in a provocative article about Advanced Micro Devices' new chip,
which the magazine calls Intel's David. AMD's new chip is called
K6-2, and what makes it special is its 3DNOW instruction set. The
magazine says 3DNOW greatly accelerates the chip's ability to run
graphics _ especially 3-D graphics. In other words, games played on
computer using this chip will be screamers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also offers scores of reviews on new games. One in
particular is about the latest Indiana Jones game by LucasArts. The
magazine says Lara Croft of ``Tomb Raider'' better move over _ this
game is exciting and action-packed.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Cyberflix's latest release, ``Redjack, Revenge of the
Brethren,'' is getting good reviews, including one in The New York
Times. This computer CD is a role-playing game based on a story
line about pirates in the Caribbean. The object of the game is to
figure out who killed the great fallen pirate, avenge his death,
steal all the gold and run off with the girl. Available for both
PCs and Macs, ``Redjack'' retails for $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   There's a new trend in computer CDs in which companies are
linking games with hands-on toys or controls. The latest example is
Hasbro Interactive's ``Star Wars Millennium Falcon CD-ROM
Playset.'' This game comes with a hand-control playset that snaps
onto the computer keyboard. Available only for Windows 95 PCs, it
retails for $49.95.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is a great place to research a medical condition. A
good place to start is Medscape. This Web site includes 7,000
articles on medical research. There's also a free link to something
called Medline, which has more than 8.4 million abstracts from
3,800 medical journals. You'll find Medscape at
http://www.medscape.com.

 &HT;    Careful tweaking can enhance dial-up Net connection
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There you sit, still finding wrapping paper scraps
under the couch, happy but mentally breathless after all the
holiday rush. And there's still New Year's ahead, so you can't
quite sit still.
</P>
<P>
   You have a brand-new computer, fully equipped with enough RAM
memory to run a respectable space program and with the fastest
analog modem money can buy. But dang _ using the Web is still like
running in mud, you had time to fix a turkey sandwich while the
last Web page loaded. Your cable company does not yet offer cable
modems in your area, despite the fliers that come in the mail
promising high-speed salvation soon. ISDN connections and ADSL seem
sort of excessive for a person such as yourself.
</P>
<P>
   You suspect that if your phone lines were just a little better,
you could move along faster. Maybe the 56k bps modem isn't fast
enough, but there's probably a little bit of speed left in it, if
you just knew how to tweak all the settings to get the most speed.
</P>
<P>
   So today we'll look at ways to get more from what you already
have and speed up your Internet connection. Truth is, none of this
stuff is foolproof, but maybe it will help. We'll cover a lot of
ground in a small amount of space, but maybe some of these
suggestions will start you off in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the software on your computer. Most experts
agree that the default settings for connection to the Internet _
Windows 98 and 95 use a system called Dial Up Networking, called
DUN _ can be changed on many computers to create a better and
faster connection. But messing with these settings, unless you have
a propeller on top of your beanie hat, is really confusing and can
make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, if you are serious about changing these DUN
settings, you need to spend $15 on a little program called
TweakDUN. If you've read this column for a while, you can probably
count the commercial programs that I've recommended on one hand. I
don't do this very often, but I've used this program for a while
and I'm convinced it's a good one. You can order it from its makers
by going to this address on the Web _
http://www.pattersondesigns.com/tweakdun/.
</P>
<P>
   I won't go into a lot of detail because I want to save a bit of
space to talk about your telephone line and what you can do if it
has problems. But let me offer one last bit of advice. If your
modem is already connecting in the 40k bps range and up, I would
follow some of the best tech advice available: Leave things alone;
you're already doing better than 80 percent of all dial-up modem
users.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble down the line
</P>
<P>
   Now let's look at that telephone line. You have to understand
that it just wasn't made for sending and receiving data. Analog
modems are basically gadgets for tricking the telephone system by
converting the digital computer information into various squawks
and squeaks.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of reasons why a telephone line might not be
adequate. You can start _ if you have problems _ by calling the
telephone company. If there is audible line noise and if the
problem originates outside your home, not in the wiring inside your
home, you might get some free help. As modems have become more
common, and since many phone companies are now in the Internet
business, you may find knowledgeable help.
</P>
<P>
   If the problems are inside your home, then that wiring is your
responsibility. So a lot depends on how much it is worth to you to
fix the problem. If you have line noise you can hear, try finding
the phone junction box where the phone service enters your home.
Most of these boxes have a connection built in for connecting a
phone directly to this box. Do that and listen.
</P>
<P>
   If the line noise is absent at the box, but can be heard at your
phone, you know the problem is somewhere in your wiring.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pay $125 and up to get a professional to fix things if
the problem is in your wiring.
</P>
<P>
   (I'm not going to recommend you rewire your home yourself. I'll
figure that if you are actively considering this, you know enough
already. And if the idea sounds insane to you, then it probably
is.)
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's a start toward speeding things up and perhaps that
will hold you until you can get a cable modem or some other method
of high-speed access.

 &HT;    Bugged by software glitches? New book outlines your rights
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We have laws to help when our Lincoln is a lemon. But
when our Microsoft Windows doesn't work, we have to rely on
toll-free help desks and online advice.
</P>
<P>
   A book called ``Bad Software: What to Do When Software Fails''
brings consumer rights to the Information Age. The book was written
by Cem Kaner and David Pels, both of whom have experience in
software technical support, quality assurance and software law. The
book shows you how to get a refund, fix bugs, find more support
and, occasionally, be compensated for things that quit working as a
result of faulty software.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader calls it a ``how-to book for consumer protection in
the Information Age.''
</P>
<P>
   The book breaks down the steps needed to claim your customer
rights, including how to get a refund quickly; how to decide when
to try and fix it yourself; when to call the help desk; and how to
deal more effectively with the help desk. Should legal action be
necessary, the authors also lay out how to understand and apply
your rights and how to pick a lawyer who knows the industry and can
keep your fees low.
</P>
<P>
   The book retails for about $30. It is available at online
bookstores and at the author's site, which is devoted to helping
customers who have bought bad software. It's at
http://www.badsoftware.com.
</P>
<P>
   Static-free, cord-free
</P>
<P>
   It is a little late for Christmas, but not too late for the
after-Christmas sales. Toshiba has released a line of 25-channel,
900-megahertz cordless phones that claim to virtually eliminate
static.
</P>
<P>
   The phones come with an auto-scanning feature that automatically
changes frequencies when you come across static or interference.
Toshiba's Compandor Plus noise-reduction system further cuts
ambient noise. The line of phones is on the high end of the 900-MHz
spectrum, retailing for between $220 and $250.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba's 25-channel phones are a bit less expensive, retailing
for between $80 and $100. They include handset volume control, a
mute button, a 10-speed number dial and a handset locator page key.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-channel phones have a NiteCall illumination feature that
gives a green glow over the handset, making it easier to dial in
the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-channel model also offers Call Protect, which scrambles
calls so eavesdroppers using scanners or randomly stumbling across
your frequency hear only gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   With a digital answering machine, the 25-channel phone sells for
between $190 and $230.
</P>
<P>
   On-board satellite
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has enhanced its dashboard satellite system for
1999. Three years old, OnStar is now available in 31 GM models and
is standard equipment in Cadillac's Escalade, the upscale
sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   OnStar uses the Global Positioning satellite network and
cellular technology to connect the vehicle to the OnStar support
center for 24-hour help with emergency service and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   The OnStar system on the Cadillac Escapade is a three-button pad
built into the overhead console. The driver can speak, hands-free,
into a microphone built into the headliner. The OnStar center
offers directions, diagnostics, information about the nearest
hotels, restaurants and other points of interest. One button is
reserved for emergencies; a third ends calls to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-held hotbed
</P>
<P>
   The hand-held computer market surged this year. The 3Com Palm
Pilot is still the market giant, with a 75 percent share, but the
number of models on the market grew from 44 to 62. Of those, half
are Windows CE-supported, according to Intelect ASW, a marketing
services company in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Pilots are also the least expensive. Prices ranged from
$287 to $360 in 1998. Windows CE devices, which are Windows
95-compatible, ranged from $685 to $550.
</P>
<P>
   The top Windows CE brands were Casio, Philips and
Hewlett-Packard.

 &HT;    Brakes let you know before they go bad
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Last week, we began discussing brakes. This week,
let's look at one of the more common questions I hear about them.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How do I know when I need brakes?
</P>
<P>
   A:Your car gives you a couple of ``I need brakes'' warning signs
before they get to the dangerous point and can't stop the car
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   One is the brake pedal will travel farther toward the floor
before it bottoms and the vehicle stops. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Every time you apply the brakes and the brake pads and shoes
contact the rotors and drums, a little bit of brake lining material
is worn away. To compensate for the wear, it takes more fluid to
fill the hydraulic cylinder down at the wheel and push the piston
against the brake pad. Consequently, you have to push farther to
make the car stop.
</P>
<P>
   Check the brake fluid level in the master cylinder (usually a
white plastic container with black caps under the hood, in front of
the steering wheel). If the fluid is low in one or both of the
sections and there are no leaks in the system, it is a pretty good
indication your brake pads and or shoes are worn.
</P>
<P>
   Another way brakes tell you they need to be replaced is the
little chirping sound from the brake wear indicator.
</P>
<P>
   This device is actually a piece of soft metal attached to the
brake pad. As the pads wear down, the metal contacts the rotor and
starts chirping while the car is rolling. Its job is to warn the
driver the brakes are at the wear limit. When you apply the brakes,
the noise should diminish.
</P>
<P>
   If the brake pad continues to wear, the noise will escalate to a
scraping/squealing and eventually a metallic grinding, meaning the
lining material is completely worn off and the metal part of the
pad is eating into the rotor. This is a dangerous condition and an
expensive repair.
</P>
<P>
   Design and simple physics do 65 to 75 percent of a car's braking
by the front brakes. The average car will wear out about two sets
of front brake pads to one set of rear shoes, as long as the system
is functioning properly and you don't drive with the emergency
brake applied.
</P>
<P>
   Rear brakes should be inspected when the front brakes are
replaced, but plan on replacing them between the second and third
set of front brakes. Rear drum brakes have no wear indicators, so
you won't hear an audible signal when they are getting low.
However, the brake pedal will push down farther with worn rear
brakes, as with the fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Rear drum brakes have self-adjusters that are either actuated
when the car is backed up and brakes are applied or when the
emergency brake is used. Misadjusted rear brakes will also cause a
low pedal.
</P>
<P>
   The front brakes don't need adjusting. It is accomplished
hydraulically and by design in the disc brake caliper.
</P>
<P>
   With the typical stop-and-go metro driving, the life of the
average front brake pads is about 25,000 to 30,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   A clarification on emissions testing
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999 tag season, all odd-year 1993 and older vehicles
requiring emission testing must go to an ``all vehicles welcome''
test station.
</P>
<P>
   However, tests this month on some 1993 vehicles may vary because
of differences in equipment. After Jan. 1, all 1993 and older
vehicles must undergo dynometer tests.
</P>

 &HT;    New wives and husbands' ex-spouses find ways to blend families
peacefully
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Watch Regina Arnold and Julie Thompson and you'd
think they were old high school classmates, maybe even cousins.
They were partners in scuba diving classes and homeroom moms
together. They use the same pediatrician. The affection and respect
they have for each other is something reserved for best friends.
</P>
<P>
   That's an extraordinary relationship when you consider Regina
was married to Jim Thompson, who is now Julie's husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, 'You must be sisters.' I'll say, 'No, we just
married the same guy,'' says Thompson. They both laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship is much smoother than the one at the start of
the new movie ``Stepmom,'' in which Susan Sarandon plays Jackie,
whose ex-husband marries Isabel, a vain, ambitious fashion
photographer played by Julia Roberts. It's a bumpy ride for Jackie,
who can't cope with the idea of Isabel becoming her kids' stepmom.
It gets more complicated when Jackie is stricken with cancer and
Isabel struggles in her new role as stepmom.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold and Thompson are proof that moms and stepmoms can
co-exist when they share a child. The mothers say they get along
great because their priority is 14-year-old Jhett, a son Arnold had
with Jim.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for Beth McQueen and Debbie Foulkes. They
co-parent 10-year-old Gillian, Debbie's daughter by Dennis McQueen,
who is now married to Beth.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of relationships are powerful to children,'' says
Anna Gonzalez-Sorensen, an Austin family and marital counselor who
also is part of a blended family. She has three grown children by a
previous marriage and her husband Don has two. ``They become a
model for getting along.''
</P>
<P>
   It's crucial to the relationship between a mother and the
stepmom to have the biological parents get along. ``If Jim and
Regina did not have a good communicative relationship, my
relationship with Regina would not be possible,'' says Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold says it has helped that she and Thompson respect each
other's role in raising Jhett. ``I thought ahead about a lot of
things before dissolving my marriage to Jim, like the fact that
there would be another woman called a stepmom. Over time, we've
learned how each other feels. We have walked in each other's
shoes,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has two other children, 3-year-old Tanner and
18-month-old Jarett, with husband Jim. Arnold has two other
children, 4-year-old Olivia and 2-year-old Madeline with her
husband, Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   In this extended family, as both women describe it, there is no
bad-mouthing by any of the parents. ``We've also put our egos and
jealousies aside,'' says Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   They've known each other a decade now and describe their
relationships with words such as ``special'' and ``comfortable''
and ``open.'' Thompson even calls Arnold one of her best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh there are always differences, like in most families, but we
talk it out,'' says Thompson. ``There is nothing I can't talk to
Regina about.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has been cordial since the beginning, when
Thompson began dating Arnold's ex-husband. ``Jim would talk to me
about the women he was dating. He said Julie was the one and that
she was a keeper. So, I already knew Julie was a nice person. Jim
would also counsel me about the men I was dating,'' says Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Thompson and Arnold's relationship grew closer.
Today, they spend a lot of time together, as do their children. The
families do Easter brunch at the Thompsons every year. Every Dec.
23, the two families get together to exchange gifts and have
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez-Sorensen says the more that divorced families blend,
the less traumatic it is for the children. ``The children are
better off,'' she says. ``From what they see, they learn
forgiveness and good will. They build a community. No one is
deprived of their mothers and fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't hate the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Foulkes and McQueen also started on the right foot. Foulkes'
ex-husband, Dennis, came to her and told her he was in love with
Beth. ``I was pleased for him,'' says Foulkes. ``He said a lot of
good things about Beth. He said she was a Christian. I got to know
Beth for six months before they got married. In that time I was
convinced that Beth had a genuine interest in my daughter's
well-being. I respect that. She's also a very caring person and
helps her church and volunteers in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth McQueen doesn't distinguish between 10-year-old Gillian and
her children, 3-year-old Madeline and 11-month-old Meredith, with
Dennis. They are expecting a third child in April. ``They are all
my children,'' says McQueen. ``Gillian even calls me mommy. She
calls Debbie mom,'' says McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen says she and Foulkes began to bond more when she started
having children. ``I think she was glad that Gillian was becoming a
big sister. Our relationship grew, and I attribute a lot of that to
Debbie being easygoing and flexible,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The two couples don't pay much attention to the divorce decree
that says the McQueens are allowed to keep Gillian one weekday and
every other weekend. The girl now stays overnight with the McQueens
twice during the week and every other weekend. When there is a
scheduling conflict, they work it out.
</P>
<P>
   Foulkes and her ex-husband also have a civil relationship, which
helps everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez-Sorensen says the peace must be a big benefit to
Dennis. ``He has a relief that these two women are getting along
and he's not in the middle. He's a happier person for his kids and
his marriage,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Foulkes has not remarried so there is not another man in the mix
making decisions about Gillian. She and the McQueens have come to
major decisions about the girl's life. Gillian was baptized in the
Catholic faith with Foulkes' blessing. Beth is the godmother.
Gillian also attends a Catholic school, and the two families split
the tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez-Sorensen realizes that making a blended family a happy
one is a challenge. She advises adults to resolve their feelings
between each other first. ``Then, get rid of the blaming and free
each other to go on with your lives,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A mother and stepmother sometimes have to talk out their
feelings, even if it means going to a counselor. ``The biggest
things they have to do is get their egos out of the way and
remember that a child's mental health and welfare should be their
priority,'' she says.

 &HT;    World Book Discoveries DVD brings French accent to history
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ IBM has entered the field of DVD-ROMs with World Book
Discoveries, a massive encyclopedia devoted to the student of
history and, more or less incidentally, to the student of Gallic
software design.
</P>
<P>
   Once again we encounter those wildly creative Frenchmen in whose
designs form rises like a helium balloon above the American
concepts of function.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries is, of course, huge; it covers the contents of five
normal CD-ROMs, in which form it is also available. Being
French-designed, it is of course also beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   As I have remarked in the past, the French software designers
march to the beat of a different drum, and Discoveries presents the
beats of a great many drums, some of them so loud you can scarcely
hear the narration, but that, you will find, isn't really important
because the narration is superficial and usually is repeated in the
text.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries is very, very big on sound, most of it signifying
nothing. In the sections on the creation of the universe, for
instance, there is a lot of eerie space music. Discussions of great
battles are accompanied by screaming, yelling and clashing of
spears, and screens on the rise of mammals on earth give rise to
disembodied grunts and snarls.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is undeniably atmospheric, but if you spend very
long at a given screen it can become annoying.
</P>
<P>
   The unifying feature of French design, of course, is
disunification, at least by the standards of U.S. software design.
If you have spent much time with encyclopedic software, you become
used to certain general traits.
</P>
<P>
   Hot spots on a screen are identified by text in a different
color, or by the cursor changing shape as it passes over the spot.
The French scoff at such consistency in the same way a Cordon Bleu
chef would sneer at an underdone sauce.
</P>
<P>
   If you consider the organization of Discoveries in layers, the
top layer is a corridor, or gallery, in which you move down an
ill-lit, portentous hall with back-lit illustrations along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Each is a portal into an era. This, certainly, is a very nice
conceit. It works pretty well, too, but below that upper layer
things seem to get somewhat unsteady.
</P>
<P>
   I could try to explain the more detailed methods of navigation
through this giant CD-ROM, but it would only confuse you because it
certainly confuses me.
</P>
<P>
   Discovering Discoveries
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say Discoveries is truly an adventure; you never
know what you will discover next. The basic keys _ other than
trying to memorize the little manual _ are the sometimes
hard-to-see menus at the top of the screen. These have menus within
menus within menus that will generally get you where you want to go
within a given era.
</P>
<P>
   Discoveries is aimed for the most part, it would appear, at the
grade- and middle-school level. There are, for instance, five
references to Albert Einstein, who is usually represented by a
photo showing him sticking his tongue out at the viewer. All of
these assure the reader that Einstein was one of the greatest
scientists who ever lived, the man who postulated the theory of
relativity and turned upside down our notions of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   If you need any notion of what his theories amounted to, you'll
have to go elsewhere. I could find no mention anywhere, for
instance, of the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   You may come upon a full-screen picture, very nicely rendered,
of the Trojan Horse, and see little Trojans lowering themselves out
of its belly.
</P>
<P>
   Barely discernible over the lowering orchestral music, a woman
intones: ``Troy, in the time of the legendary heroes: The Trojan
horse.'' If you never heard this story, you may well wonder what is
going on here.
</P>
<P>
   You may well wonder for a long time, because there is no text.
Annoyed, you click on Search and search for Trojan. You find
several references, including one to the picture of the Trojan
Horse. There is, as far as I could tell, no text discussing the
Trojan Horse.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling these Frenchmen may be akin to the least desirable end
of the horse, you return to the picture, and idly passing the
cursor over a part of it and letting it rest, you see it turns into
a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   If you turn it into a microphone at the gate of Troy, you get
the beginning of the legend. If you accidentally hit the mike at
the horse's underbelly, you get the middle of it first.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean World Book Discoveries is a wash? Absolutely
not. The information it contains should be more than enough for any
lower-grade project, and is presented in often unique and useful
ways.
</P>
<P>
   It is ravishingly beautiful. It is entertaining. The student can
lift not only all the text and all the art and copy it into a word
processor, but the sound can be copied, too.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it is an opportunity to see the concepts of
organization the way Inspector Clouseau understood them. And, to be
sure, I suspect French software designers get a few giggles out of
Microsoft Encarta, too.

 &HT;    Craig Page has all the right moves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ For all the places he's lived and all the
``places'' he's been, Georgia Tech center Craig Page has shown what
he can do when he stays put.
</P>
<P>
   For one of the few times in his life, Page hasn't gone anywhere
for a while. He is a fixture at Georgia Tech, an anchor on the
offensive line. He has played 34 consecutive games since switching
from the defensive line. In that time, he has gone from an
uncertainty to All-American.
</P>
<P>
   After an outstanding season, Page started reeling in the awards:
First, it was the Jacobs Award, as the ACC's top blocker, then
first team All-American honors by the Football Writers Association,
followed by being a finalist for the Outland Trophy, being named
second-team All-American by ``Football News,'' and earning first
team All-ACC.
</P>
<P>
   That last award was the only one he had set out to achieve at
the beginning of the season, wanting to live up to being named
preseason All-ACC. This time three years ago, he was hoping someday
to be honored only as Georgia Tech's top lineman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember my first football banquet, watching (former
center Michael) Cheever winning offensive lineman of the year,''
Page said. ``I thought, `Wouldn't it be great to win that some
day?'''
</P>
<P>
   About that time, in Jan., 1996, Page was just getting used to
the ideas of being a Yellow Jacket and an offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Tech had recruited him out of Jupiter (Fla.) High as a defensive
lineman. Coach George O'Leary, then the defensive coordinator, had
offered Page a scholarship, but had to withdraw it, he said Sunday,
when then-coach Bill Lewis ``wanted to go in another direction.''
Page decided to attend Louisville instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Lewis was wanting to wait on a recruit he had coming in
the next weekend,'' Page said. ``I told him I wasn't going to sit
around here and wait. I didn't like that very much. When I talked
to Coach Lewis he seemed aloof. He didn't seem concerned about me a
whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Page's redshirt year, coach Howard Schnellenberger
left for Oklahoma, so a big reason for Page's being there was gone.
</P>
<P>
   By then, O'Leary had taken over as Tech coach. Page was curious
to see if he was still interested. O'Leary was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still had some hard feelings for Tech,'' Page said.
</P>
<P>
   But he respected O'Leary and wanted to get to a better football
program.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was only fitting that Page move from one college. He'd
done the same in high school _ at Niceville (Fla.) High for his
first two years, Jupiter for his last two.
</P>
<P>
   As the youngest of four children, Page spent his childhood
moving from one Air Force base to another.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in the Langley (Va.) Air Force base hospital, and
has also lived in Kansas, Germany, Alabama, Texas, Alaska and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in Texas and had been there a couple of years, he
came up to me and said, `Dad are we getting ready to leave
again?''' his dad, Warren Page, said. ``I thought he'd had a
(problem) with a kid down the street. But that wasn't it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same kid who learned to salmon fish and snow ski in Alaska
had become acquainted with Southern football.
</P>
<P>
   His high school coaches had told him colleges would want him as
an offensive lineman, but Page was determined to stay on defense.
</P>
<P>
   He transferred to Tech as a defensive lineman and that's where
he played on the scout team. But by November '95, Page had changed
his mind. Cheever was graduating and Page hadn't seen any action in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to play,'' Page said. ``It was difficult at
first. I was playing with older guys and I didn't want to let them
down, be the weak spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Strength was one area where Page had always excelled, and he
remains one of Tech's strongest players. It was technique where he
had to do most of his learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember in high school watching the offensive line mess
up and thinking, `How hard can it be?''' he said. ``When I moved
over I realized it's not easy. It took patience. It took time.'' As
the latest in a line of 10 All-American centers at Tech, Page's
picture will hang in the hall leading to the locker room. A
permanent gesture for the guy who's always been on the move.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his next move maybe to the NFL.

 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to know how to send a pizza to Texas from New Jersey.
Someone on my list wants a pizza from Lenny's on Chestnut Street in
Ridgewood. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   _M. Rogers
</P>
<P>
   A: Here is the preferred packing method from Kay Welch, owner of
Mailboxes Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap the cooked pizza in plastic and bubble wrap. Enclose it in
a Styrofoam cooler with a small amount of dry ice. Pad with packing
peanuts and overnight the box. The overnight charge on a 10-pound
box will be expensive. Trick will be to find someone on the New
Jersey end to do this. Is there an area college? Can you sweet-talk
Lenny into helping you? Keep me posted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you the one with a recipe for making ornaments out of
dung? _Pat G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not exactly. Just the recipe for making centerpieces out of
cow patties. Guess you could just poke a hole for a ribbon hanger
near the top and call it an ornament. Here is the method from Pat
Beach of CalPat Ranch: Flatten patties by rubbing them on concrete.
Soak in a mixture of Elmer's Glue and water (half and half). Let
dry thoroughly (two days or so should do it). Lacquer or paint the
patties.Q: I am looking for a Nat ``King'' Cole album of Christmas
songs in Spanish. I have tried everywhere I know of. _Dot G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Closest I came was ``Cole Espanol, Vol. 2'' which can be
ordered by area record stores. Sorry, no yuletide tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 86-year-old grandfather gave me a very old velvet painting
that has been hanging in his living room ever since I can remember.
This painting means a lot to me. The only problem is there is a cut
in the painting about six inches long and I am afraid it will get
worse. I was hoping you could help me find somebody who repairs
these or has any suggestions on what I should do. This is something
that will stay with my family forever. _Joey Gutierrez
</P>
<P>
   A: You are not the only one to have a painting in need of a
little dry dock work. Supporting the velvet with additional fabric
backing may be what the piece needs. For your files, call the
American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works
at (202) 452-9545 and ask for a free copy of ``Guidelines for
Selecting a Conservator.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the political situation of the country right now,
you would be doing a great public service if you were to publish
the e-mail addresses of all national congressmen and senators. I
have tried to find Sen. Gramm's e-mail address to no avail. As
elected representatives of our government, you would think they
would want to make it as easy as possible to communicate with their
constituents. I understand the polls show the majority of the
American people are against impeachment, but the general consensus
is that our representatives are ignoring our voice. _Hector Cadena
</P>
<P>
   A: Sen. Gramm only has a fax number, a snail-mail address and a
telephone number. No e-mail. No kidding. Call Project Vote Smart at
(800) 622-SMART or visit www.vote-smart.org for the names and
addresses of representatives in any state.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a member of a local high school's National Honor
Society. As impossible as it may sound, I would like to get Troy
Aikman to be our guest speaker at next year's induction ceremony.
Is there any way you could help me contact him or his
representative? _J.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Requests must be made in writing on official letterhead _
maybe school letterhead. Send it to P.O. Box 630227, Irving,
75063-0227 or fax it to (972) 506-9005. No. 8 is prohibited from
autograph sessions and does not make public speeches. Hope he says
yes to your invitation.Q: Do the Heisman winner and his school both
get a trophy, or is there just one trophy? _R.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Two trophies _ one for the winner and one for the school. The
trophy is a statue originally made by sculptor Frank Eliscu. His
model? New York University tailback Ed Smith, a former high school
buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son is the best man at his best friend's wedding. He wants
to do it right. What is expected? _C.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: A best man helps complete a groom's responsibilities. In days
of yore he guarded the couple from marauders _ of particular
importance if the groom had absconded with a bride. Here's a duty
list _ many are enumerated in Emily Post's ``Etiquette.''
Pre-wedding: Organize a groomsmen party, make a rehearsal dinner
toast, get the groom to the ceremony _ sober, in one piece.
Ceremony: Hold the bride's ring, stand with the groom, give the
groom's donation to the celebrant, sign the marriage certificate as
a witness. Reception: Mingle with guests, trouble-shoot on behalf
of the groom's family, make a toast, dance with the bride, help the
groom change clothes, return groom's wedding clothes. Honeymoon:
Arrange for transportation from reception, make sure groom has

Year's Eve, the tuxedo _ with cummerbund, braces (suspenders) and

 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to know how to send a pizza to Texas from New Jersey.
Someone on my list wants a pizza from Lenny's on Chestnut Street in
Ridgewood. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   _M. Rogers
</P>
<P>
   A: Here is the preferred packing method from Kay Welch, owner of
Mailboxes Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap the cooked pizza in plastic and bubble wrap. Enclose it in
a Styrofoam cooler with a small amount of dry ice. Pad with packing
peanuts and overnight the box. The overnight charge on a 10-pound
box will be expensive. Trick will be to find someone on the New
Jersey end to do this. Is there an area college? Can you sweet-talk
Lenny into helping you? Keep me posted.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you the one with a recipe for making ornaments out of
dung? _Pat G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not exactly. Just the recipe for making centerpieces out of
cow patties. Guess you could just poke a hole for a ribbon hanger
near the top and call it an ornament. Here is the method from Pat
Beach of CalPat Ranch: Flatten patties by rubbing them on concrete.
Soak in a mixture of Elmer's Glue and water (half and half). Let
dry thoroughly (two days or so should do it). Lacquer or paint the
patties.Q: I am looking for a Nat ``King'' Cole album of Christmas
songs in Spanish. I have tried everywhere I know of. _Dot G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Closest I came was ``Cole Espanol, Vol. 2'' which can be
ordered by area record stores. Sorry, no yuletide tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 86-year-old grandfather gave me a very old velvet painting
that has been hanging in his living room ever since I can remember.
This painting means a lot to me. The only problem is there is a cut
in the painting about six inches long and I am afraid it will get
worse. I was hoping you could help me find somebody who repairs
these or has any suggestions on what I should do. This is something
that will stay with my family forever. _Joey Gutierrez
</P>
<P>
   A: You are not the only one to have a painting in need of a
little dry dock work. Supporting the velvet with additional fabric
backing may be what the piece needs. For your files, call the
American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works
at (202) 452-9545 and ask for a free copy of ``Guidelines for
Selecting a Conservator.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the political situation of the country right now,
you would be doing a great public service if you were to publish
the e-mail addresses of all national congressmen and senators. I
have tried to find Sen. Gramm's e-mail address to no avail. As
elected representatives of our government, you would think they
would want to make it as easy as possible to communicate with their
constituents. I understand the polls show the majority of the
American people are against impeachment, but the general consensus
is that our representatives are ignoring our voice. _Hector Cadena
</P>
<P>
   A: Sen. Gramm only has a fax number, a snail-mail address and a
telephone number. No e-mail. No kidding. Call Project Vote Smart at
(800) 622-SMART or visit www.vote-smart.org for the names and
addresses of representatives in any state.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a member of a local high school's National Honor
Society. As impossible as it may sound, I would like to get Troy
Aikman to be our guest speaker at next year's induction ceremony.
Is there any way you could help me contact him or his
representative? _J.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Requests must be made in writing on official letterhead _
maybe school letterhead. Send it to P.O. Box 630227, Irving,
75063-0227 or fax it to (972) 506-9005. No. 8 is prohibited from
autograph sessions and does not make public speeches. Hope he says
yes to your invitation.Q: Do the Heisman winner and his school both
get a trophy, or is there just one trophy? _R.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Two trophies _ one for the winner and one for the school. The
trophy is a statue originally made by sculptor Frank Eliscu. His
model? New York University tailback Ed Smith, a former high school
buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son is the best man at his best friend's wedding. He wants
to do it right. What is expected? _C.F.
</P>
<P>
   A: A best man helps complete a groom's responsibilities. In days
of yore he guarded the couple from marauders _ of particular
importance if the groom had absconded with a bride. Here's a duty
list _ many are enumerated in Emily Post's ``Etiquette.''
Pre-wedding: Organize a groomsmen party, make a rehearsal dinner
toast, get the groom to the ceremony _ sober, in one piece.
Ceremony: Hold the bride's ring, stand with the groom, give the
groom's donation to the celebrant, sign the marriage certificate as
a witness. Reception: Mingle with guests, trouble-shoot on behalf
of the groom's family, make a toast, dance with the bride, help the
groom change clothes, return groom's wedding clothes. Honeymoon:
Arrange for transportation from reception, make sure groom has
tickets and itinerary. And, oh yes _ give the couple a wedding
present and have a great time!Q: Have you been told to have your
dryer cleaned? Not just the lint screen. I was given a dryer (used)
and a fire started due to lint buildup below the laundry screen. It
is my mission to advise people to clean dryers once a year. _A.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: General Electric customer service agrees dryer screen ducts
should be cleaned regularly. News to me. Thanks! Disconnect dryer
power. Remove the screen and use the vacuum cleaner hose to remove
lint.Q: A lady said her 70-year-old mother came to the United
States five years ago. She mentioned her mother's Social Security

 &HT;    JOURNAL: MISSILE COMPONENTS AND IRAQI RESILIENCE LEGACIES OF
TRIP TO IRAQ
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (k) Commentary

<P>
   BAGHDAD _ I'll be coming home from Iraq with a charred and
twisted piece of U.S. federal property.
</P>
<P>
   It's a flat, grooved ring about three inches across. I found it
in a deep muddy crater where a cruise missile had landed a couple
hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This scrap is just a minuscule portion of the more than 400
missiles that slammed into this country over four days this month.
Maybe it's the part I paid for with my tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It will remind me of how strange it feels to stand in the rubble
of someone's house, or by somebody's grimy hospital bed, and ask
him what he thinks about the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, they say that they were in bed or walking down the
street when the missile hit. They say that America is evil and will
some day be vanquished. What else can they say?
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot American journalists here and Iraqis generally
feel that they can talk to the American people through us.
</P>
<P>
   Only two people refused to talk to me. One eventually opened up
and we shook hands. The other was headed to pray at a mosque. He
warned his fellow worshipers that we were trying to figure out
their prayer time so we could bomb them. His friends apologized to
us for his rudeness.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are a lot of infuriating things about working in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   People know the government line and generally toe it
vociferously. Just in case they might not, the Ministry of Culture
and Information tries to assign ``guides'' to each of us. You can
get away from them, but most of our drivers are also part of the
network and, if they are not, you could get them in trouble by
ordering them any place too risky.
</P>
<P>
   Our hotel, the Al Rasheed, is watched at all hours by men in
blazers who stand in the lobby and parking lot. During the
bombings, I twice needed special permission before they would open
the gates and let me leave the building.
</P>
<P>
   And, the government of Iraq has not always been a gracious host.
Remember the ``human shields'' of the Gulf War?
</P>
<P>
   But, if America were attacked, would we let a bunch of people
from the attacking country, many of them with satellite telephones
that can call home easily, wander around and assess the damage to
targets?
</P>
<P>
   And, I wonder how we would treat our enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a family invited me to dinner even as so-called ``smart''
bombs rumbled in the distance. They offered to let me sleep there
if my hotel lost power.
</P>
<P>
   A bride and groom took time to tell a group of us why they would
get married amid all of this. Then, they invited us to the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   I made the 11-hour car trip from Amman, Jordan to Baghdad with a
couple of other reporters and a wealthy Iraqi businessman. He
offered his contacts and advice to smooth our border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Noticing that we had brought three cases of Pepsi Cola, known to
be popular with Iraqi border authorities, he gave us an approving
fatherly grin, ``Ahh, Pepsi. That is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road, he asked us why Americans were attacking Iraq and
surmised for himself that they want to control the Persian Gulf. As
for Saddam Hussein, Iraqis could not oust him even if they wanted
to, he said. And, ``they don't want to,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He had decided to return to his family because, he explained,
Iraqis would rather die together than separately.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, we were crossing the barren Iraqi desert, lined
with patches of short brush and the occasional large picture of
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jordanian driver of our big GMC slapped a cassette into
the tape deck, pop singer Meredith Brooks opened our travels in
beleaguered Iraq with the line, ``I hate the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   We did not know that the casualties would be relatively low and
that these cruise missiles could demolish one building while barely
scarring the one next door.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I never felt in danger during the attacks. Watching the
explosions from my hotel window or with crowds on the sidewalk,
they always seemed isolated, even when shock waves blew my hair
back.
</P>
<P>
   I just tried to follow the Iraqis' lead. In good times, they
live under a severely restrictive regime and crippling economic
sanctions. In the bad times, they have all that and missile
attacks, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, in helplessness or resilience, they go on buying their ice
cream, playing billiards, getting married and treating their guests
well.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Iraqis were busy buying Christmas trees. I have
this missile part I found. After all, it brought me here. Maybe it
will make me think about the Iraqis even after I leave them behind
in the desert.

   At the time, we were crossing the barren Iraqi desert, lined
with patches of short brush and the occasional large picture of
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jordanian driver of our big GMC slapped a cassette into
the tape deck, pop singer Meredith Brooks opened our travels in
beleaguered Iraq with the line, ``I hate the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   We did not know that the casualties would be relatively low and
that these cruise missiles could demolish one building while barely
scarring the one next door.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I never felt in danger during the attacks. Watching the
explosions from my hotel window or with crowds on the sidewalk,
they always seemed isolated, even when shock waves blew my hair
back.
</P>
<P>
   I just tried to follow the Iraqis' lead. In good times, they
live under a severely restrictive regime and crippling economic
sanctions. In the bad times, they have all that and missile
attacks, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, in helplessness or resilience, they go on buying their ice
cream, playing billiards, getting married and treating their guests
well.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Iraqis were busy buying Christmas trees. I have
this missile part I found. After all, it brought me here. Maybe it
will make me think about the Iraqis even after I leave them behind
in the desert.

IN 1998, STORIES OF MAJOR MERGERS DOMINATED THE NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By any measure, corporate mergers and acquisitions dominated
business news in 1998. An eye-popping $4.98 trillion worth of deals
were logged by Securities Data Co. by last week. That was triple
the $1.6 trillion record set in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of deals, 11,002 as of Dec. 23, may fall short of the
11,156 record of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But their scale, topped by the $86.4 billion joining of Mobil
Corp. and Exxon Corp., is changing the national and global business
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG; a parade of banking linkups
led by Citicorp's merger with Travelers Group Inc.; America Online
Inc.'s bid for Netscape Corp.: The list is long.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest plays involved telecommunications, with
nuptials announced between AT&AMP;T Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc.;
MCI Communications Corp. and WorldCom; Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE
Corp.; and a three-way combo of SBC Communications Inc., Pacific
Telesis Group, and Ameritech Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs were in store and antitrust issues abounded. But profits
drove the deals. ``I have no interest in being the largest company
in the Fortune 500,'' Mobil chairman Lucio Noto said in announcing
the Mobil-Exxon deal. ``Revenues mean nothing to me. What counts is
profit and what counts is the return that we together can generate
for our shareholders, and that's what this marriage is about.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Market madness &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets worldwide were shaken to their roots as
Russia's economy collapsed and Brazil's threatened to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on top of Asia's financial problems, these setbacks sent
the Dow Jones industrial average down 20 percent between July 17
and the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge stopped only after three consecutive cuts in
short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board. With
investor confidence restored, the market recovered _ and then,
ignoring political turmoil and war against Iraq, kept on climbing
to close at 9217.99 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The impacts of those global problems reached far. Teradyne
Corp., Eaton Corp., and PRI Automation Inc. were among dozens of
Massachusetts semiconductor industry suppliers that laid off
workers. Boston-based mutual funds scaled back plans to enter the
Japanese market. BankBoston Corp. closed its offices in Japan, the
Philippines, Taiwan, and India _ but said it fared well in Brazil,
where customers sought safety in US banks.
</P>
<P>
   Economists warned of more rocky times, however. Japan has been
slow to carry out banking reforms; Brazil's setbacks are likely to
dampen the entire Latin American economy; and no early solution is
in sight for Russia's deepening woes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Compaq-Digital deal &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Digital Equipment Corp., never able to fully recover after it
missed out on the desktop computer revolution, called it quits and
sold out in January to rival Compaq Computer Corp. for $9.15
billion _ a record sum for the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   Digital had long been the flagship of the Massachusetts
high-technology industry, its early days under founder Ken Olsen in
an old mill in Maynard, Mass. a legend. After years of losses,
Digital was making thin profits but still faced a fight for
survival.
</P>
<P>
   With the merger came 17,000 layoffs or retirements, equal to
about one-third of Digital's total payroll. Most rank-and-file
workers got 39 weeks pay. Chairman and chief executive Robert B.
Palmer got a $18.45 million severance package.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts also lost other computer-industry leaders in 1998.
Two of them went to Ascend Communications Inc. of Alameda, Calif. _
Cascade Communications Corp. of Westford, which makes high-speed
data communications equipment, sold for $3.7 billion in stock, and
Stratus Computer Inc. of Marlborough, a leader in fault-tolerant
computers, sold in an $843 million stock swap. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Power switch &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No major business in Massachusetts underwent as dramatic a
change this year as electric utilities. The stage was set by a
state deregulation law that took effect March 1, ending monopoly
control of power supplies and delivering an immediate 10 percent
discount on consumers' electric bills.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying out their part of the scheme, the major utilities _ the
New England Electric System, parent of the Massachusetts Electric
Co., and Commonwealth Energy Systems Inc. _ sold their generating
assets to companies who now must price the output of those plants
competitively.
</P>
<P>
   Sithe Industries, the US subsidiary of a French company, paid
$536 million for BEC Energy's oil- and gas-fired power plants,
while Entergy Corp. of Louisiana picked up BEC's Pilgrim nuclear
plant in Plymouth for $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals paled, though, next to the consolidation that
followed. BEC, declaring that it wants to triple its customer base
to 2 million by the end of 2000, made its first move by buying
Commonwealth Energy's electric distribution system. BEC paid $950
million.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, New England Electric System announced the sale of
all its transmission and distribution assets, including a customer
base of more than 1 million in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New
Hampshire, to National Grid System Ltd., the primary provider of
electric transmission in England and Wales. The price: $3.2 billion
in cash. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Changing of the guard &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 76-year history, Raytheon Co. reached
outside to hire a new president, chairman, and chief executive,
Daniel P. Burnham, 52, formerly vice president of another major
aerospace company, AlliedSignal Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As the fifth person to lead Raytheon, Burnham succeeds Dennis J.
Picard, 66, who retired.
</P>
<P>
   The two are considered a study in contrasts. The tight-lipped
Picard rose through the company's engineering and production ranks
and, as chief executive since 1991, oversaw acquisitions that made
Raytheon the third-largest US defense company.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, a Midwesterner who has performed in amateur rodeos and
likes fast cars, aims to foster a more open culture in which
employees will be encouraged to take part in productivity and
quality control.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham is seen as a management and finance specialist _ skills
Raytheon needs to deal with its growth. Arriving in midsummer,
Burnham's first high-profile task was an October announcement that
14,000 jobs, or 16 percent of the work force, would be cut by the
end of 1999. The move will leave Raytheon with 115,000 employees,
15,000 of them in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the round of layoffs as necessary to keep Raytheon
competitive, Burnham told the Globe: ``We hope and believe it's the
last one like this.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Revolutionary razor &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every seven years or so, Gillette Co. introduces a
``revolutionary'' new product to sustain sales and profits. The
latest big offering from the Boston-based giant is the Mach3,
billed as the world's first three-blade razor.
</P>
<P>
   Representing a $1 billion investment for Gillette, the Mach3 hit
the shelves of US retailers over the summer to much marketing
fanfare.

THE YEAR OF SOUNDTRACKS, MOTHERS, AND OTHER PHENOMENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's really interesting about pop is the culture that goes
with it: the big trends and fringe quirks that are inspired by and
define the music in such a tightly-woven dance that one can hardly
say which came first: the song or the craze.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Year of the Soundtrack. Where once crooning over the
credits to a movie qualified as a smarmy honor reserved for
middle-of-the-road mainstays along the lines of Helen Reddy or
Kenny Rogers, 1998 saw everyone from Puff Daddy to Elvis Costello,
Busta Rhymes to Bjork hop on board the Hollywood cash cow. In July,
nearly half of the albums on the Billboard Top 20 were soundtracks.
A cynic might suggest that the influx of powerful, multimedia
parent corporations that rule the entertainment industry had
something to do with the rampant bedding down of recording artists
and moviemakers . . . or perhaps the music-loving public was simply
ravenous for mediocre sampler CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the marriage of singers and screen spanned formats
large and small. Pop songs were all over television, too, as a
tidal wave of teen-oriented dramas like ``Dawson's Creek'' and
``Felicity'' wooed young viewers with tunes as modern and appealing
as the adorably bewildered characters whose lives they serenaded.
Listeners-viewers flocked to record stores as faithfully as they
glued themselves to the TV. Paula Cole's CD ``This Fire'' caught
fire _ a full year after its release _ after the single ``I Don't
Want to Wait'' was featured on ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   But rock is by no means the exclusive domain of the youth
culture, and as loyal fans notched one more year, artists too,
transposed the fruits of maturity into the language of music. It
was the Year of the Mother in rock, when no lesser goddesses than
Madonna (``Ray of Light''), Liz Phair (``whitechocolatespaceegg''),
and Lauryn Hill (``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'') released
remarkable albums that demonstrated en masse (individual mavericks
like Chrissie Hynde and Kim Gordon have been quietly doing it for
years) that rocking the baby and rocking the world are not mutually
exclusive endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Hill, it was, quite simply, the Year of Lauryn Hill.
Her soulful, spiritual, thoroughly clear-eyed re-vision of hip-hop
restored the thrill to a genre that had grown as lusterless as it
had prominent. And it was the only record everyone on the planet
(except for The New Yorker's Hilton Als, but don't get me started .
. .) agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Hole, Beck, Smashing Pumpkins, and R.E.M., it was the
Year of Never Having to Say You're Sorry. All of them released
albums that took sharp left turns, delivered unanticipated sounds,
challenged our perceptions of who they are. These artists
challenged the very notion of how we define pop stardom.
Unfulfilled expectations allowed an often extraordinary collection
of music _ the Pumpkins' ``Adore'' _ to languish. R.E.M.'s
post-Bill Berry, three-piece effort, ``Up,'' inspired reactions
that ranged from reverence to utter disdain, a phenomenon in itself
that suggests the record is undeniably important. Beck hightailed
it out of the Grammy-winning manic mode and booked himself on a
quiet little magical mystery tour (``Mutations''), while Courtney
Love and company foiled would-be arbiters of hard rock-chic by
releasing ``Celebrity Skin,'' arguably the best pop album of the
year. To them we say, touche.
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse (and we say the former; bring on the pain!),
it was the Year of the Loser. Elliot Smith and Lucinda Williams
released two of the finest evocations of misery to come around in
years. Smith's ``XO'' and Williams's ``Car Wheels on a Gravel
Road'' were not only gorgeous, smart, and true, but therapeutic.
Either you thrilled to be in such fabulously distraught company, or
wound up feeling that much better about your own comparatively
paltry losses in love.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the movie that planted the bad seed for a City of
Angels revival, but for better or worse (the latter; take it from a
native) it was the Year of Los Angeles. Malibu, perfect skin, and
waitress-actresses dotted the landscape of Hole's album, dredging
up the golden myth one presumed had died long ago in the throes of
smog and strip malls, race riots, and polluted beaches. Shawn
Mullins immortalized the place, where privileged kids in artsy
homes got to hang out with Bob Seger and Sonny and Cher, in his
huge hit ``Lullabye.'' To top it off, Marilyn Manson moved to
Laurel Canyon _ ground zero for the California Dream, rock 'n' roll
style. Balmy nights, good parties, famous neighbors, endless
summer. Who can blame him? It's seductive as a pop song.

BEAN COUNTERS ARE CHOKING THE FUN OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An alarming year. There's no other way to describe which way the
wind blew in the pop-music business in '98. Artists often took a
back seat to accountants. Wall Street giant SFX bought out every
independent promoter in sight and talked about an increase in
corporate sponsorship and ticket prices. The Rolling Stones gouged
consumers with $300 tickets without any charity component. And
liquor titan Seagrams took over PolyGram and started dismantling
subsidiary labels A &AMP; M and Geffen _ two artist-driven companies
with long track records _ and prepared to issue pink slips to more
than 100 bands and a reported 3,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The corporatization of the business took on scary proportions _
and cynicism settled in like a dark cloud. Veterans like Joni
Mitchell and John Mellencamp blasted the industry's selling out to
the stockholder mentality, but was anyone listening? Certainly not
many radio programmers, who were busy carving up little fiefdoms of
narrow-niche formats. And maybe not that many consumers, either,
who were often lulled by the ``Titanic'' soundtrack and lush pop of
Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   It's instructive to look at the Top 10 best-selling albums in
the US this year, according to SoundScan.
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Titanic'' with 9.2 million sales.
</P>
<P>
   2. Dion's ``Let's Talk About Love'' at 7.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. Garth Brooks's ``Sevens,'' 5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. Backstreet Boys' self-titled disc, 5 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. Shania Twain's ``Come On Over,'' 4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. Matchbox 20's ``Yourself or Someone Like You,'' 3.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``City of Angels'' soundtrack, 3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. Will Smith's ``Big Willie Style,'' 3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. Savage Garden's self-titled disc, 3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. Spice Girls' ``Spiceworld,'' 3.3. million.
</P>
<P>
   See anything threatening there? Anything edgy? Anything that
makes you think that rebellion still exists in the increasingly
money-driven music business? Whatever happened to the rock
insurgence of Nirvana and Pearl Jam? That's gone, replaced by
one-hit wonders like Marcy Playground. And even hip-hop, with its
quick-selling acts and quick-hit bravado, often got stuck on macho
chest-thumping, with the exception of the wondrous Lauryn Hill and
her debut disc, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the rich got richer, while the poor _ well, the poor
limped back to clubs, if they were lucky. It was a year of
tremendous uncertainty and transition. If these were the
pre-millennial jitters, then what will happen when the millennium
arrives? Maybe SFX will have taken over the world by then and it
will be a moot point.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so what about the positives? Yes, there were some. The
accountants couldn't dry up all the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost, this was an extraordinary year for live concerts. It
started with the home-run pairing of Bob Dylan and Van Morrison,
who began an avalanche of big-name shows at the FleetCenter. The
Fleet had its busiest year in many moons _ fueled partly by music
agents who steered some acts from the SFX-owned Great Woods to
prove that SFX wasn't going to control everything.
</P>
<P>
   Before the year was through, the Fleet also had Puff Daddy, Eric
Clapton (a disappointing night with an orchestra), Elton John, Page
&AMP; Plant (the most remarkable show yet on their comeback reunion),
Tori Amos (who brought a nightclub-like passion to the new arena),
Van Halen (singer/Boston homey Gary Cherone came through with
flying colors), Yanni, Celine Dion (who opened her national tour
here and sang the ``Titanic'' theme song, ``My Heart Will Go On,''
to thunderous applause), Kiss, Janet Jackson, Barenaked Ladies,
Billy Joel (three sellouts), and Aerosmith (due New Year's Eve).
</P>
<P>
   The summer shed at Great Woods also had its share of winners,
from the Sarah McLachlan-led Lilith Fair, to inspiring dates with
Pearl Jam (the Seattle band was finally back on the road, making up
for lost time) and the Other Ones (the post-Grateful Dead group
with Phil Lesh back in the fold). Also, classic-rocker John Fogerty
nearly blew the roof off with his slashing, swamp-guitar heroics,
then the Allman Brothers left a similar mark in their three shows
of the summer there.
</P>
<P>
   Great Woods had 43 shows _ down from its average of 50 _ but
that was partly because of the increase in indoor concerts and a
wising up of artists who spread their shows elsewhere during the
year. ``It was a 12-month year this year, not just a top-heavy
summer season,'' said Dave Marsden, director of events for Great
Woods and the Don Law Co. ``Some artists recognized that despite
the benefits of playing in the summer, there are good opportunities
to play at other times of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   While classic rock again dominated the shed season, there was
also a trend toward teen idols. Among these were the
scream-inducing Spice Girls and Hanson. Both sold out Great Woods,
suggesting that the teenage market will be tapped more liberally in
the future. Nationally, the rise of ``teen divas'' (in Spin
magazine's words) Monica, Brandy, and Aaliyah supported this trend.
</P>
<P>
   Socially conscious rock didn't have its best year, but many
artists still found their way to Washington, D.C., for the Tibetan
Freedom Concert with Pearl Jam, R.E.M., the Beastie Boys, and
Radiohead. It was nice to see so many bands break through the
corporate haze for a selfless gesture.
</P>
<P>
   More trends arrived in '98. Swing music took off with the Brian
Setzer Orchestra, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and Boston's own Four Piece
Suit during a WFNX-sponsored show at the Hatch Shell. And country
singers started denting the Top 40 pop charts, notably Shania Twain
with ``You're the One'' and Faith Hill with ``That Kiss.'' The new
Nashville was all about such crossover successes, though Garth
Brooks still kept the faith of purists (and kept his ticket prices
down, too).
</P>
<P>
   Other fine shows this year included the techno-rocking Garbage
at Avalon; the sweet-voiced Stevie Nicks and James Taylor at Great
Woods; the willful Wynonna and Bonnie Raitt at Harborlights; the
still-energetic Diana Ross at the South Shore Music Circus in
Cohasset; the Teva Spirit of Unity reggae package with Steel Pulse,
Lucky Dube, Beres Hammond, and others at Harborlights; the solo
appearance of harpist/wunderkind Andreas Vollenweider at Jordan
Hall; and an inspired Nanci Griffth at Ben &AMP; Jerry's Newport Folk
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Although Griffith said later that she's fighting cancer, she
shrugged off any ill effects and gave a vital reminder of why live
concerts at their best still have an intimacy that accountants
can't destroy.

GOOD DAYS FOR DEALING; GM IN A DAZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When, I am often asked, is the best time to buy a car? The best
day in my book is today _ Boxing Day, the day after Christmas, when
hardly a creature is stirring or buying in any auto showroom
anywhere. Next Monday isn't bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   The week between Christmas and New Year is the last week of the
last month of the calendar year. Monthly sales quotas and the
yearly quotas are hanging in the balance, quotas that may determine
bonuses or other emoluments _ such as a trip to Hawaii or some
other grand place. To meet quotas, dealers may be willing to cut
the gross profit margins extra slim.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the dealer may have manufacturer cash incentives to
share with you, maybe on top of a customer rebate. Frequently, the
choice is the dealer's whether to go with the incentive as a
customer rebate or as the dealer's edge to pocket if he can.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that excessive incentives may be the bait to make
you jump for a lousy vehicle that wouldn't otherwise sell. But
everybody seems to be offering something, even on those really good
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, for example, until Jan. 4 offers $800 on the 1999
Tacoma, up to $500 on a '99 Camry with an added tickler of $10 or
$20 for the sales manager. A '98 Camry carries a $750 incentive
plus a potentially bigger bonus for the sales manager. It's up to
the regional sales managers to set the policy on what is offered to
customers, what is apportioned dealers. But no matter who is
offered the bait, the money is still on the table _ if you know
about it. You will always know about customer incentives, but the
dealer spiffs are not widely publicized. Dealers would prefer to
offer you a piece of the dealer incentive and let you think you got
a terrific deal at his expense rather than to tell you up front how
much he has to play with. Well, wouldn't you?
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac, not exactly a luxury leader anymore, is offering
dealer/customer incentives of up to $3,000 on '99 Devilles, $2,000
on Eldorado or Seville, dealer's call on how to apportion. The '98
models command even bigger incentives, $5,000 to $6,000, a clear
case of weak demand generating big rebates. The Cadillac incentives
expire Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, too, is offering luxury model incentives in its
Northeast region, up to $3,250 on '99 Town Cars and Continentals,
$5,000 on '98 models _ through Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai took a different tack, offering $500 on '99 Accents and
$750 on '99 Tiburon and Elantra models until Jan. 4. On '98 models,
the rebates range from $1,500 to $2,000. On top of that, the
dealers are offered bonuses determined by sales volume. In the
East, it could mean an extra $750 to the dealer for each car sold
in excess of a minimum quota; on the West Coast, the dealer
incentives are even more generous.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru, too, is offering $500 to $750 customer or dealer cash on
'99 Legacy, $500 on Impreza. Rebates on '98 models range from $500
to $1,250.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is offering dealer or customer cash (regional sales
manager's choice) of $2,000 on all 1998 models.
</P>
<P>
   Among the customer rebates listed are some interesting
variations on the theme. Ford, for example, offers hefty rebates to
customers who buy alternative fuel or bi-fuel vehicles, cars or
trucks that will stoke up on natural gas or liquid propane. A
Taurus that burns ethanol comes with a $1,000 incentive, and
college graduates who got the sheepskin between Oct. 1, 1996, and
Jan. 5, 1999, are entitled to an extra $400 discount.
</P>

   A regular source of dealer/customer incentives in effect is
Automotive News, a weekly automotive trade paper that lists them
all in the back pages.

<P>
   It has been a very good year for automobile and light truck
sales, but there are still a lot of them unsold, and this week and
next are not exactly prime times to move cars _ which is why the
bait gets so much better. Of course, your absolute best deal these
days is probably a two-year old used car that somebody else leased,
those so-called program cars.

   General Motors, if you haven't been paying attention, opened a
Buick factory in China this week, in typical GM fashion. The
factory is open but not yet ready to function, and, in the process
of the christening (if such a word is applicable in the People's
Republic), Chairman John F. Smith showed clearly what's wrong with
GM: The guy at the helm is unfamiliar with cars.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Smith was to drive the first Buick
off the Shanghai assembly line but couldn't budge it _ he couldn't
find the brake. After popping the hood looking for the parking
brake, Smith was reminded that in Buicks the brake is operated by a
foot pedal.
</P>
<P>
   The factory isn't producing yet, but the opening date had been
set, and so one car had to be finished in order to save face _
whose face, we're not sure. At this point, though, GM would be
better off looking after the other end of the corporate anatomy;
the company is in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Buick plant is to build large cars with $40,000 price tags
as a way of entering the Chinese market _ I am not making this up.
In a country where the car of choice for the affluent is a
bare-bones VW and the transport aspired to by the masses is a
bicycle, how does Chairman Jack figure to justify a $750 million
investment to churn out 100,000 Buick sedans annually? Just how
many Chinese can afford a $40,000 car?
</P>
<P>
   Selling Buicks in this country is getting to be a hard sell. The
state-of-the-art Buick City plant, celebrated not long ago as the
salvation of Michigan, is gonzo. Buick production in '98 is lagging
'97 by more than 60,000 cars as of Dec. 24. How long before the
Chinese-built Buicks start showing up in American showrooms, and
some more domestic plants get phased out as ``inefficient''?
</P>
<P>
   When GM moved A-body production to Mexico, then-Chairman Bob
Stemple stood in front of reporters and swore that Mexicans were
buying them all, but Mexican-built Buicks were sitting in Virginia
showrooms across the river from where he was standing (or should
that be lying?). Mexicans were buying hardly any.
</P>
<P>
   GM has committed to investing $2 billion in China while at home
it has been so cash short that this summer it announced it was
pressing suppliers for additional discounts _ up front, in cash. If
you or I did that, it's called ``kickback'' or ``extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   GM is piling up unfunded pension liability, squeezing suppliers,
squeezing dealers, and scraping to keep a positive cash flow, but
reports have it that the company coffers are far from full. When
the economy goes limp _ as it always does in time _ the noise you
hear may be GM falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Other automakers do not comment on the GM condition, but one
Ford executive, when pressed, ended the conversation with the
statement that Ford was looking forward to making worthwhile
acquisitions of mismanaged companies.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse managed than General Motors, once controlling more
than half the American car market, now selling itself the delusion
that it will ``lean down'' to 24 or 25 percent and the good times
will roll again.

DUMB, DUMBER, AND THEN SOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pop culture was, of course, overshadowed by the chief executive
soap opera, ``As the White House Turns,'' in 1998. Once upon a
time, didn't we look to entertainment for respite from the rigors
of the real world? But this year reality served up the steamiest
morality play of the century, out-watercoolering ``Ally McBeal''
and ``There's Something About Mary'' and spiritual girl Madonna and
her mehndi(CQ) tattoos. It was the tale of an ambitious, Gap-ified
intern who gets duped by a two-faced girlfriend and the married man
she calls ``butthead,'' and we watched, and watched, and watched.
No detail of the incendiary melodrama was too tawdry, from Monica
Lewinsky's ``Melrose Place''-like manipulations to Bill Clinton's
clumsy tries at ``Oprah''-like humility. ``It's like `Fatal
Attraction,' '' Sharon Stone offered. ``Ken Starr is Glenn Close.''
</P>
<P>
   The story went on even longer than ``Titanic,'' the 194-minute
epic that left an indelible imprint on the decade, and not only the
year, winning 11 Oscars and more than a billion dollars worldwide
in theaters. As ``Titanic'' turned 24-year-old club rat Leonardo
DiCaprio into a box-office powerhouse, and made chest-thumping
Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On'' into an overplayed Billboard
smash, it encouraged all of Hollywood's very worst habits: Spend
gushers of money to make even more money, drench the screen in
awesome special effects and they will come, and whatever you do,
don't let the script get too smart.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the American IQ was called into question more than ever
this year. As the country buzzed about presidential semen and a
cigar that wasn't just a cigar, the lowbrow sensibility that has
turned ``South Park'' into a cult TV hit began to drive the box
office. ``There's Something About Mary,'' from ``Dumb and Dumber''
brothers Bobby and Peter Farrelly, rose to No. 1 after eight weeks
in release, grossing more than $175 million. Many critics shed
their PC biases to praise the comedy, which featured It Girl
Cameron Diaz using semen as hair gel. And while Howard Stern waged
battle on ``Saturday Night Live'' on the small screen, ``SNL'' alum
Adam Sandler and his class-clown humor celebrated two hit movies
this year, with ``The Waterboy'' grossing more than $130 million,
the same impressive amount as Jackie Chan's ``Rush Hour'' and
``Lethal Weapon 4.'' The year also saw popular dumbed-down action
movies like ``Armageddon'' and re-movies, including a
butt-joke-filled remake of ``Dr. Dolittle'' and a sequel with the
lazy title ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.'' Re-movies hit
a low as director Gus Van Sant threw away his singular vision to
paste together a shot-by-shot remake of Hitchcock's ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, adult fare like Meryl Streep's ``One True Thing'' and
Oprah Winfrey's heavily promoted ``Beloved'' had only one thing in
common with ``Titanic'': They tanked. ``Bulworth,'' the sly
political satire about an honest politician, earned actor-director
Warren Beatty his best reviews in years, but failed to attract
moviegoers despite its relevance. The adaptation of the bestseller
``Primary Colors'' also bombed, paling beside the juicier
real-world presidential crisis. The only box-office successes with
brains were ``The Truman Show,'' Jim Carrey's first foray outside
his more adolescent oeuvre, and ``Saving Private Ryan,'' a
conventional war-movie reimagined with constant and unromanticized
violence.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, while it was a sixth-grader's world at the movies, the
Nielsen ratings revealed a country channel-surfing in seach of
intelligent life on TV. Sure, there was a boom in crass reality
series like ``Busted on the Job,'' the Linda Tripping of American
TV whereby cameras preserve embarrassing moments for public
consumption. And the networks unveiled a fall season that was
unusually loaded with mediocre dramas like ``L.A. Doctors'' and
what Bill Cosby dubbed ``sexuation comedies.'' And the Viagra jokes
were hard to avoid. But viewers voted with their clicker finger,
leading to the early cancellation of junk like ``The Secret Diary
of Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a vulgarity-based sitcom for those who
embraced ``There's Something About Mary,'' and ``Fantasy Island,''
a remake of the cheesy 1970s series. The more intelligently written
shows _ ``Seinfeld,'' ``Frasier,'' ``ER,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' ``The
X-Files,'' ``Ally McBeal'' _ were the ones that consistently rose
to the top of the ratings, even if many of them were not in top
form. ``Frasier,'' in particular, struggled with its identity this
year as it took over the visible ``Seinfeld'' time slot on Thursday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kelley continued to reign as the small-screen ``king of
the world,'' as his two high-quality lawyer shows from 1997, ``Ally
McBeal'' and ``The Practice,'' gained both critical acclaim and
viewership in 1998. ``The Practice'' took home an Emmy for best
drama, and ``Ally McBeal'' became the most debated show of the
year, with some calling the micro-skirted lawyer a step back for
women and some wondering if bone-thin star Calista Flockhart had an
eating disorder. The ever-shrewd Kelley addressed both issues in
comic bits on the show.
</P>
<P>
   The year in television was also marked by a series of endings,
not least of all an episode of ``60 Minutes'' featuring an onscreen
assisted death by Dr. Kevorkian. The most watched finale was the
last ``Seinfeld,'' an episode that was almost universally disliked
as it made Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, and George pay for their sins of
selfishness by throwing them in a jail cell. Jimmy Smits bid a
touching farewell to ``NYPD Blue,'' ``The Larry Sanders Show'' left
the air with grand wit, ``Murphy Brown'' made a schmaltzy exit, and
Norm Macdonald walked away from ``Saturday Night Live'' with hurt
feelings. ``Ellen,'' the first lesbian sitcom, lost its great
momentum from 1997, devolving into a humorless and forced
half-hour. Instead of bowing out gracefully, a vocal Ellen
DeGeneres blamed the cancellation of her show on homophobia, making
it that much harder for producers with their own gay sitcoms in
mind. But then the witty ``Will &AMP; Grace'' sneaked quietly onto the
fall schedule with two gay characters center stage.
</P>
<P>
   The year also marked the end of network TV as a monopoly, with
cable ratings rising significantly enough to win the Nielsens one
summer week. With some desperation, the networks began shuffling
their top personnel and clinging to hits like ``ER,'' for which NBC
agreed to pay a record $13 million per episode.
</P>
<P>
   What we didn't see an end to on TV: slick ad campaigns. One
starred a little Chihuahua named Gidget who only wanted a bit of
Taco Bell, and another starred a little insect on wheels whose
flower power managed to grab Baby Boomers by the throat (and
wallet).
</P>
<P>
   If Ally McBeal and her dancing baby were sending negative
signals to women, the music industry wasn't tuning in. It was a
spectacular year for female recording artists, some mostly
financially (Shania Twain, Celine Dion) and others creatively.
Grunge rock, once so hot, retreated back to its more appropriate
home on the fringe, as the Lollapalooza tour took the year off and
releases by bands like Pearl Jam had modest sales. Courtney Love
and Hole released ``Celebrity Skin,'' their first new album since
Kurt Cobain's death, but with ``miles and miles of perfect skin''
covering her grief, and a new taste for '70s California rock, Love
was making an almost anti-punk/grunge statement.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, who turned 40 in August (and who is still cultivating
some kind of continental accent), released upon the world the
electronica-inflected ``Ray of Light'' and a new look: This time,
she was the blond spiritual girl, selling her soul with talk of
yoga and Hinduism. Jewel and Alanis Morissette also rode spiritual
enlightenment up the charts, with Jewel casting additional lines to
eternity with a book of poetry called ``A Night Without Armor.''
</P>
<P>
   The album topping the critics' lists this year was ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' a powerful solo album by the former
Fugee that perfectly blends rap, reggae, and soul music together
with Hill's messages of self-respect and love. Liz Phair managed to
equal her classic debut album with ``whitechocolatespaceegg,'' and
country-folk-rocker Lucinda Williams finally broke into the
mainstream with ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,'' a collection of
moving songs about restlessness and yearning. And the
uncompromising Joni Mitchell greeted her recent popularity and
Grammy win with ``Taming the Tiger,'' tearing down the music
industry while she embraced the courage of love.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the fickle club of American celebrity gathered its
new members from movies, TV, and music, like Matt Damon and Ben
Affleck, the ``Good Will Hunting'' Oscar winners also known as
simply MattandBen. The pair won more shiny, happy magazine covers
this year than even Brad Pitt, the one-time box-office dynamo whose
``Meet Joe Black'' met box-office death this fall (Leo beware).
MattandBen were the poster kids of the year, next to Monica
Lewinsky, Ken Starr, and Linda Tripp, who, quivering, delivered
this perverse observation to the public: ``I am you.'' Indeed,
American celebrity may have become more ``Twilight Zone'' than ever
in 1998, as a particularly disturbing image made its way to our
shores in late April: double-murder suspect O. J. Simpson
pretending to stab BBC interviewer Ruby Wax with a banana.

ON THE CONCERT SCENE, THESE WERE THE BEST OF THE LOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As with most years, 1998 was one of contradiction and conflict,
rapture and wretchedness, flotsam and jetsam. The world of pop is,
arguably, more diversified _ or fragmented _ than ever. You've got
electronic music and roots rock. There are glam-metal and soft
soul. There are blues-based jam bands and tightly coiled punk
bands. The octopus that is pop reaches in every direction.
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream, by definition, is whatever is popular, and many
genres were represented in that broad stratum in 1998, from
in-your-face hip-hop to smooth country, from gushy pop crooning to
hard rock. Method Man, Garth Brooks, Mariah Carey, Madonna, Marilyn
Manson, and Metallica _ all bestsellers. Soundtracks, featuring
music from all different genres, proved immensely popular,
indicating the public's preference for a collection including at
least one hit song over an album of 15 or so songs from the same
artist.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the mainstream morphed into something softer,
something like musical comfort food. For fans of rock 'n' roll that
lives closer to the edge, this is not necessarily a bad thing. If
edgy music _ post-punk, post-grunge, alternative, whatever _
connects less with middle America, so be it. Looking back, there
was something weird about arenas packed with youths waving their
fists as Nirvana played. Kurt Cobain said as much. Creativity tends
to flourish outside mainstream confines.
</P>
<P>
   Some observations as diverse as the music:
</P>
<P>
   --Hip-hop to the top. It's clearly the youth music of our time,
the music of suburban white America and of urban black America.
Music with beats and an attacking attitude. Smartly packaged,
gift-wrapped rebellion, with a menacing bass line. If it offends
the elder generation, that's a bonus. So the thinking goes. The
caution flags? We still hear too much rap about gold, guns, money,
women, and cars. We still get the sense it's all about ego puffing.
</P>
<P>
   --Year of the woman. Ah, yes. The phrase is tossed out about
every other year, so why not do it once again, if only to deflate
it while stating the obvious? Women, roughly 51 percent of the
population, make and sell records, too. Have been for a while now.
In '98 we saw the continued prominence of (and a better lineup at)
Lilith Fair; Alanis's overwrought re-emergence; the Whitney &AMP;
Mariah show; Lauryn Hill's zooming past her Fugee brothers; Jewel
making us wince with music and poetry; Courtney Love's full-frontal
attack with Hole; Shirley Manson's commanding presence as the
Garbage girl.
</P>
<P>
   --Country music that isn't. The grizzled old guard has been
drummed off country radio in favor of good-looking young boys (with
hats) and girls (with cleavage). Most new country is middlebrow pop
with a slight twang and a conservative heart. I'd rather go
drinking, fighting, and crying with George Jones or Merle Haggard.
</P>
<P>
   --Increasing demographic fragmentation. No surprise, maybe, but
disheartening just the same. The folks watching Pete Townshend, Bob
Dylan, and Van Morrison are all around the artists' age (give or
take 10 years), and so are the folks going to see Green Day,
Offspring, and Marilyn Manson (give or take five years). It's an
equal shame that the work of the Hall of Famers doesn't interest
the college kids and that the work of the more aggressive young
acts doesn't interest the classic-rock crowd. Of course, there's
also the ticket price: The old guys are asking top dollar and
getting it from upscale boomers.
</P>
<P>
   --Catching it live, in the flesh. Music works magic on a
solitary, individual basis _ you in your car, you at home _ but
there really is added value in a communal experience. Not to get
all hippie-dippy about it, but check yourself amid a rabid crowd
of, say, KISS fans or Mighty Mighty Bosstones fans or Green Day
fans, and you'll feel better about the sea in which you swim. (My
own favorite communal experiences are in the accompanying list.)
</P>
<P>
   --Artist and CD glut. ``Too many people!'' Paul McCartney sang
convincingly, years ago, in the song of the same title. More true
than ever today, Paulie. While the music industry is ruled by
merger-crazed conglomerates _ which you might think would tend to
limit the product released _ the costs of producing CDs has
decreased so dramatically that almost anyone can do it and sell it
over the Internet. And the labels themselves keep hurling CDs at
the proverbial wall. Problem: How much do you want to buy? How much
time do you have to separate wheat from chaff? How much of this
really needs to be heard? When you hear struggling artists complain
about ``suffering for my art,'' you sometimes have to respond that
``maybe your art is just not up to snuff, and that's why you're
struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   --Difficulty in career growth. In part, this is related to the
issue above: There's so much to choose from that many listeners
forget the band that rocked their world last year. Radio is geared
toward hit songs, not artists; people's interest in a given artist
tends to wane more quickly than in the past. Last year's hit band
becomes passe just by virtue of having an ``old'' hit, and
curiosity about what that act is doing next is muted by
restlessness about the next (new) big thing.
</P>
<P>
   --Why we still care. Pop music's only constant is change.
Whether it's the thrill of discovery or the smile-inducing work of
an old friend, our ears are ever piqued for a new take on this old
world _ a beat, a lick, a lyric, something that moves you in a way
you just hadn't quite considered before. Maybe it's Bob Dylan
reinventing himself once again (and for the bettter, for a change),
or Nashville Pussy finding the inexplicable meeting ground of
Motorhead and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Maybe, it's Garbage coming back with
a second album proving the first was no fluke. Maybe it's feeling
the deep sorrow of a Nick Cave song, or plugging into the
everlasting bliss of Cheap Trick playing ``Surrender'' at the
Paradise _ while you sing along, meaning it at the moment: ``We're
all all right! We're all all right! We're all all right!''

ON TV, NO END TO MONICA MANIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the major network news anchors were in Cuba, preparing to
cover the pope's unprecedented visit, when the White House sex
scandal broke on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
   The anchors immediately rushed to Washington, and TV news
organizations haven't been able to take their eyes off the place
since then. If 1997 was the year of Diana, 1998 was the year of
Monica. Television was utterly consumed by the story of President
Clinton's dalliance with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   So, for much of the year, were many viewers. Though poll after
poll showed that many citizens said they were sick of the story,
all-news cable networks such as CNN found that focusing on
Monicagate sent ratings through the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers saw much more of Lewinsky than they heard, however. That
infamous rope-line embrace between her and Clinton was replayed
over and over, but Lewinsky's voice was not heard, except on tape
recordings of her conversations with ex-friend Linda Tripp. She did
not bare her soul on national television (though she is scheduled
to undergo that time-honored rite next month with _ who else? _
Barbara Walters on ABC).
</P>
<P>
   But if Lewinsky wasn't going on television to talk about the
scandal, everyone else was.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal minted a few new talking-head celebrities, such as
Laura Ingraham of MSNBC. Internet gossip Matt Drudge parlayed the
scandal into his own show on Fox News Channel. Former Clinton aides
like Lanny Davis and Dick Morris were ubiquitous on interview shows
like NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' Nighttime talk shows like CNN's
``Larry King Live'' or CNBC's ``Hardball with Chris Matthews''
sometimes appeared to have adopted a policy of ``all Monica, all
the time.'' Logos for the ongoing coverage sprouted on every news
channel: ``White House in Crisis'' on MSNBC, ``Investigating the
President'' on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever there was a major development, television was there
with saturation coverage: Clinton's grudging acknowledgment on Aug.
17 of an ``inappropriate relationship'' with Lewinsky; the release
of the Starr report on Sept. 11; Clinton's videotaped grand-jury
testimony, which aired Sept. 21; Starr's testimony before the House
Judiciary Committee on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the unfolding events were less than telegenic, such
as the unloading of the Starr report from vans on Capitol Hill.
Sometimes, television offered a glimpse into the essence of the
scandal, as when viewers of Clinton's grand-jury testimony saw both
the president's charm and his evasive resort to tortured legalisms.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the explosive revelations lost their impact among
many viewers because of their sheer repetition _ even as the case
built to the first impeachment of a president in 130 years. Like
many another television drama, the Clinton scandal began to feel
like a perpetual rerun.

A VARIETY SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, the runners-up: ``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' ``Happiness,''
``Twilight,'' ``Mrs. Dalloway,'' ``Primary Colors,'' ``American
History X,'' ``High Art,'' ``Hillary and Jackie,'' ``The Spanish
Prisoner,'' ``The Celebration,'' ``He Got Game,'' ``Mother and
Son,'' ``Under the Skin,'' ``Monument Ave.,'' and ``Love and Death
on Long Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, a reservation: I haven't yet seen Terrence Malick's ``The
Thin Red Line,'' about an American rifle company trying to turn
World War II around on Guadalcanal, and advance word is it might be
a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it faces an uphill battle to overtake Steven Spielberg's
``Saving Private Ryan,'' my choice for best film of 1998. Taking
the war movie farther than ever before, Spielberg has never seemed
a more authoritative image-maker. Working on a huge canvas with
almost improvisatory flair, he created a D-Day invasion and other
battle sequences that will serve as benchmarks of their kind. And
his skill was deployed not in the service of thrills, but on the
side of dignity and idealism _ his movie enkindled a reawakening of
the stories of the men who fought the war. It comes at a time when
national events and the national mood badly need a reminder of what
a nation can accomplish when its citizens unite in a cause with a
weight of moral rightness behind it. It reassures us that it's the
electorate, not politicians, that keeps the country going.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to the pleasure principle. ``Shakespeare in Love'' is the
year's most sparkling delight. Tom Stoppard, who wrote the script
with Marc Norman, is to the last third of the century what George
Bernard Shaw was to the first third _ the wittiest writer and the
one with the &QC; 
widest-spanned worldview. Here, he burrows into the Elizabethan era
to imagine the events that went into the writing of ``Romeo and
Juliet.'' It's one of the best backstage comedies ever written,
exhilarating us with its inventiveness and its tongue-in-cheek
humor as Joseph Fiennes's smitten Shakespeare desperately hurtles
through his world.
</P>
<P>
   Just as exhilarating, for different reasons, was Warren Beatty's
``Bulworth.'' In one inspired stroke, it zapped the usual cant
attached to political speechifying and replaced it with bracing
straight talk from a California incumbent with a death wish. Beatty
plays Bulworth as a man feverish with the idea of telling it like
it is after years of gasbagging it through campaign after campaign.
His way of cutting through the usual drivel _ even if only for two
hours, and only in a movie _ deserves the gratitude of a nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' is another surprise. Nominally a study of the
corrosive effects of a bagful of dirty money, it is at heart a
rueful and deeply moving story of the shifting moral ground between
two brothers in a farm town. Bill Paxton has the harder role as the
successful sibling who went to college and has all the advantages,
but ends up being shamed by Billy Bob Thornton's slob who got left
behind _ the ugly-duckling brother exceeds the ``winner'' in
generosity and heart. Because Thornton's role is the more vivid and
sympathetic, he'll figure more prominently in the awards scene, but
both performances are tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The General'' is a gravely beautiful film (in wide-screen
black and white) by John Boorman about an Irish career criminal who
was an antiauthoritarian folk hero, a warm family man to a menage a
trois, and also a dangerous psychopath. Brendan Gleeson, covering
all the bases, is brilliant in the title role, partly because he
has Jon Voight's career cop, the Dublin Ahab, chasing him so
devotedly. Just as gripping is the Russian film ``Brother,'' which
emits the most sizzling energies of any gangster movie this year as
it tells the story of a Russian youth who finds he's a natural at
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' and ``Pleasantville'' refreshingly never
descend to sermonizing as they examine the gulf between TV and
reality. In the first, Jim Carrey has never seemed more appealingly
innocent as Truman, who has no idea that his life has been fodder
for an ongoing TV show, and wants to break out when he discovers
the truth. In ``Pleasantville,'' Tobey Maguire and Reese
Witherspoon are '90s sibs who escape their drab life by magically
inserting themselves into their favorite '50s sitcom, only to find
that its cocooning boundaries start breaking down because of what
they bring with them. Gary Ross's allegorical use of color is
inspired. Joan Allen and William H. Macy, as '50s archetypes whose
lives are shook up, are funny, touching, wistful, superb.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' is an affecting invocation
of expatriate novelist James Jones, less as artist than as father
to an unconventional but loving family. Kris Kristofferson has
never had a richer role, and he plays it beautifully; Leelee
Sobieski is equally good as his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Elizabeth,'' Cate Blanchett plays the daughter of Henry
VIII, whose life was a roller-coaster ride until she emerged
triumphant as the Virgin Queen. In this bold and vivid film,
Shekhar Kapur presents the story of Elizabeth I as a sort of
feminist ``Godfather,'' with its bloody power struggles demanding
the ultimate in nimble-wittedness _ a quality Blanchett's queen
convinces us she possesses in spades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Horse Whisperer'' is perhaps the ultimate Robert Redford
film, presenting him, as ``Jeremiah Johnson'' did, as a loner in
love with the great outdoors. It's a big improvement on the novel,
conveying a feel for its rugged terrain and for slower, deeper
rhythms of life that are the antithesis of so-called civilization.
Redford is one of the few figures Hollywood would allow to get away
with making a film about patience. This labor of love is a
beautiful one.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ``Rushmore'' is the year's most bracingly idiosyncratic
coming-of-age film, not least because it makes the best use yet of
Bill Murray's ability to make us feel a lot going on behind his
deadpan countenance.

GOOD DAYS FOR DEALING; GM IN A DAZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When, I am often asked, is the best time to buy a car? The best
day in my book is today _ Boxing Day, the day after Christmas, when
hardly a creature is stirring or buying in any auto showroom
anywhere. Next Monday isn't bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   The week between Christmas and New Year is the last week of the
last month of the calendar year. Monthly sales quotas and the
yearly quotas are hanging in the balance, quotas that may determine
bonuses or other emoluments _ such as a trip to Hawaii or some
other grand place. To meet quotas, dealers may be willing to cut
the gross profit margins extra slim.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the dealer may have manufacturer cash incentives to
share with you, maybe on top of a customer rebate. Frequently, the
choice is the dealer's whether to go with the incentive as a
customer rebate or as the dealer's edge to pocket if he can.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that excessive incentives may be the bait to make
you jump for a lousy vehicle that wouldn't otherwise sell. But
everybody seems to be offering something, even on those really good
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, for example, until Jan. 4 offers $800 on the 1999
Tacoma, up to $500 on a '99 Camry with an added tickler of $10 or
$20 for the sales manager. A '98 Camry carries a $750 incentive
plus a potentially bigger bonus for the sales manager. It's up to
the regional sales managers to set the policy on what is offered to
customers, what is apportioned dealers. But no matter who is
offered the bait, the money is still on the table _ if you know
about it. You will always know about customer incentives, but the
dealer spiffs are not widely publicized. Dealers would prefer to
offer you a piece of the dealer incentive and let you think you got
a terrific deal at his expense rather than to tell you up front how
much he has to play with. Well, wouldn't you?
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac, not exactly a luxury leader anymore, is offering
dealer/customer incentives of up to $3,000 on '99 Devilles, $2,000
on Eldorado or Seville, dealer's call on how to apportion. The '98
models command even bigger incentives, $5,000 to $6,000, a clear
case of weak demand generating big rebates. The Cadillac incentives
expire Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, too, is offering luxury model incentives in its
Northeast region, up to $3,250 on '99 Town Cars and Continentals,
$5,000 on '98 models _ through Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai took a different tack, offering $500 on '99 Accents and
$750 on '99 Tiburon and Elantra models until Jan. 4. On '98 models,
the rebates range from $1,500 to $2,000. On top of that, the
dealers are offered bonuses determined by sales volume. In the
East, it could mean an extra $750 to the dealer for each car sold
in excess of a minimum quota; on the West Coast, the dealer
incentives are even more generous.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru, too, is offering $500 to $750 customer or dealer cash on
'99 Legacy, $500 on Impreza. Rebates on '98 models range from $500
to $1,250.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan is offering dealer or customer cash (regional sales
manager's choice) of $2,000 on all 1998 models.
</P>
<P>
   Among the customer rebates listed are some interesting
variations on the theme. Ford, for example, offers hefty rebates to
customers who buy alternative fuel or bi-fuel vehicles, cars or
trucks that will stoke up on natural gas or liquid propane. A
Taurus that burns ethanol comes with a $1,000 incentive, and
college graduates who got the sheepskin between Oct. 1, 1996, and
Jan. 5, 1999, are entitled to an extra $400 discount.
</P>
<P>
   A regular source of dealer/customer incentives in effect is
Automotive News, a weekly automotive trade paper that lists them
all in the back pages.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a very good year for automobile and light truck
sales, but there are still a lot of them unsold, and this week and
next are not exactly prime times to move cars _ which is why the
bait gets so much better. Of course, your absolute best deal these
days is probably a two-year old used car that somebody else leased,
those so-called program cars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, if you haven't been paying attention, opened a
Buick factory in China this week, in typical GM fashion. The
factory is open but not yet ready to function, and, in the process
of the christening (if such a word is applicable in the People's
Republic), Chairman John F. Smith showed clearly what's wrong with
GM: The guy at the helm is unfamiliar with cars.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Smith was to drive the first Buick
off the Shanghai assembly line but couldn't budge it _ he couldn't
find the brake. After popping the hood looking for the parking
brake, Smith was reminded that in Buicks the brake is operated by a
foot pedal.
</P>
<P>
   The factory isn't producing yet, but the opening date had been
set, and so one car had to be finished in order to save face _
whose face, we're not sure. At this point, though, GM would be
better off looking after the other end of the corporate anatomy;
the company is in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Buick plant is to build large cars with $40,000 price tags
as a way of entering the Chinese market _ I am not making this up.
In a country where the car of choice for the affluent is a
bare-bones VW and the transport aspired to by the masses is a
bicycle, how does Chairman Jack figure to justify a $750 million
investment to churn out 100,000 Buick sedans annually? Just how
many Chinese can afford a $40,000 car?
</P>
<P>
   Selling Buicks in this country is getting to be a hard sell. The
state-of-the-art Buick City plant, celebrated not long ago as the
salvation of Michigan, is gonzo. Buick production in '98 is lagging
'97 by more than 60,000 cars as of Dec. 24. How long before the
Chinese-built Buicks start showing up in American showrooms, and
some more domestic plants get phased out as ``inefficient''?
</P>
<P>
   When GM moved A-body production to Mexico, then-Chairman Bob
Stemple stood in front of reporters and swore that Mexicans were
buying them all, but Mexican-built Buicks were sitting in Virginia
showrooms across the river from where he was standing (or should
that be lying?). Mexicans were buying hardly any.
</P>
<P>
   GM has committed to investing $2 billion in China while at home
it has been so cash short that this summer it announced it was
pressing suppliers for additional discounts _ up front, in cash. If
you or I did that, it's called ``kickback'' or ``extortion.''
</P>
<P>
   GM is piling up unfunded pension liability, squeezing suppliers,
squeezing dealers, and scraping to keep a positive cash flow, but
reports have it that the company coffers are far from full. When
the economy goes limp _ as it always does in time _ the noise you
hear may be GM falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Other automakers do not comment on the GM condition, but one
Ford executive, when pressed, ended the conversation with the
statement that Ford was looking forward to making worthwhile
acquisitions of mismanaged companies.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse managed than General Motors, once controlling more
than half the American car market, now selling itself the delusion
that it will ``lean down'' to 24 or 25 percent and the good times
will roll again.

`PATRICE' A LONG STAR IN A DARK TV SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A great drama series is addictive in absolutely the worst way,
maybe costing you a friendship or two and definitely leading to a
serious dependency on the evasive joys of voice mail. ``The
Practice,'' David E. Kelley's weightier counterpart to ``Ally
McBeal,'' has developed into the year's most addictive hour of
television, despite its unfortunate Sunday-night time slot. It is,
as the Emmys determined this year, TV's best drama _ if not its
most watched, which, of course, is ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also TV's most independent-minded drama. At networks these
days, multi-episode plot arcs on prime time are frowned upon.
Theoretically, they turn a series into a cult and alienate new
viewers, a notion that was supported by the failure of ``Murder
One,'' the smart Steven Bochco drama that spent its first season on
a single case. And so you can see hourlong shows like ``ER''
compromising their artistic integrity to honor such ``wisdom,''
resolving quickie plots by the end of each episode and
de-emphasizing longer-brewing storylines, which never come to a
head anymore. But with ``The Practice,'' Kelley has simply ignored
the taboo, stringing tense cases over four or more episodes and
then bringing guest characters back later for another round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'' is also beautifully acted _ always important,
but even more so in a show that is about the courtroom as stage.
While ``Ally McBeal'' continues to goof whimsically on our
litigation-crazy culture (especially with the choice casting
addition of the suit-slinging Ling), ``The Practice'' zeroes in on
legal theatricality in the post-Court TV age. The powerful cast is
led by Kelli Williams, Dylan McDermott, and the always awesome
Camryn Manheim.
</P>
<P>
   And ``The Practice'' is the best news about a mostly
disappointing TV year. There was a proliferation of newsmagazines
like ``Dateline'' and reality shows with crude concepts like
``Busted on the Job.'' There were almost 40 new fall sitcoms and
dramas based on some of the thinnest ideas ever brought to the
small screen, from NBC's Bo Derek vehicle, ``Wind on Water,'' to
the mother of all TV missteps, UPN's ``The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfeiffer.'' ``Ellen,'' one of the triumphs of 1997, devolved from a
witty look at lesbian life in a straight culture into a preachy and
sometimes self-pitying bummer. And in 1998 there was a trend of
older, quality shows succumbing to mediocrity, especially
``Frasier,'' which plummeted on the sophistication meter the minute
it ascended to the ``Seinfeld'' slot. Even ``Seinfeld,'' beloved
and great, ended in a massive whimper _ a blazing nine-year
relationship down to smoke and ash.
</P>
<P>
   But the best of 1998 did include a pair of farewells that were
as classy as the last ``Seinfeld'' was tedious. ``The Larry Sanders
Show'' finished off its brilliant six-year run with an hour of
tears, bile, and sly hysterics, the latter thanks to guests David
Duchovny and Jim Carrey. ``Sanders'' and star Garry Shandling kept
the entertainment business honest for a few half-hours every year,
and they'll be missed. And ``NYPD Blue'' gave actor Jimmy Smits a
touching send-off last month, letting his Bobby Simone die slowly
and painfully in a sterile hospital room. Once so tall and strong,
and sure enough to have dodged many a bullet on the job, Simone was
felled in the end by his own human heart. The message: No one can
dodge the hand of fate. The graceful 90-minute goodbye, notable for
keeping Sipowicz's self-involved emotionality at a minimum, was
marred only by an excess of commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the comedy situation became increasingly dicey. With
``Seinfeld'' gone and ``Frasier'' slipping, only ``Friends,''
``Just Shoot Me,'' and sometimes ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and
``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' remained worthwhile. (Episodes of ``Lateline,''
``Maximum Bob,'' and HBO's ``Sex and the City'' were bright spots,
but few in number.) ``Just Shoot Me,'' in particular, matured into
a wonderfully barbed half-hour, with some ace comic delivery by
Wendie Malick and David Spade, and ``Friends'' continued to charm
with witty scripts and superior ensemble acting. Meanwhile, only a
pair of fall sitcoms have shown promise so far: ``Sports Night,''
which is ambitious but overly earnest, and ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' which
has a fresh premise but stars who are less engaging than the
supporting players. (Naturally, thanks to network
self-destructiveness, they are slotted against each other.) The
rest of the lot, from ``Caroline in the City'' to ``Jesse,'' is
pretty, bland, and sleep-inducing.
</P>
<P>
   Cable continued to deluge us with made-for-TV movies, a few of
which were extraordinary. Showtime's ``The Baby Dance'' took a
premise loaded with ``issue movie'' potential _ a wealthy couple
purchasing a poor couple's baby _ and transformed it into a complex
story that explored the emotional depths network movies avoid.
Laura Dern and Stockard Channing were pitch perfect. A&AMP;E also
delivered the goods with an adaptation of ``Tom Jones'' that
approached Henry Fielding differently from the way director Tony
Richardson did in 1963, taking advantage of its six-hour strech to
flesh out the heroic nuances of Tom's randy adventures. HBO came
through with ``Always Outnumbered,'' which featured a coolly
graceful performance by Laurence Fishburne as a heroic ex-convict.
And Showtime deserves a special nod for rescuing ``Lolita'' from
obscurity when it looked as if theatrical distributors were afraid
of it. The movie was buoyed by a wonderfully pained performance
from Jeremy Irons.
</P>
<P>
   Also of note this year: NBC managed to turn ``Merlin'' into
something more than an effects-laden sweeps event, gathering an
impressive cast for some lively Arthurian melodrama. And VH1
continued to make a name for itself as the best music channel,
largely thanks to its rockumentary series, ``Behind the Music.''
The show, loaded with classic clips and choice interviews, has
managed to turn pop phenomenons like John Denver and the Mama and
the Papas into fantastic TV stories.

PROTECT PET FROM UNWISE EATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This may be the perfect moment _ as you wash down your fifth rum
ball with a belt of eggnog _ to talk about ``dietary
indiscretion.'' No, not yours _ your pet's.
</P>
<P>
   Dietary indiscretion is a clinical term, believe it or not, that
describes the propensity of some of our pets to eat things that can
be dangerous and even deadly.
</P>
<P>
   The holidays bring certain cautions. Keep the cats away from
tinsel. (They can swallow it and have intestinal obstructions.)
Keep the dogs away from chocolate. (It's toxic, baker's chocolate
and dark chocolate especially so.) But there are plenty of hidden
dangers, too, that you might not think of.
</P>
<P>
   Mushrooms in the yard, moldy food in the trash, rotting leaves,
socks, even sticks can make your pet incredibly sick.
</P>
<P>
   That's what a &UR;  &LR; Massachusetts couple discovered this month when
their two previously healthy huskies died within hours of each
other. Both had been seen rooting around in the back yard. But what
exactly killed them may never be known. Whatever they ate made them
so sick that bacteria from their digestive tracts crossed over into
the bloodstream. Once that happened, both dogs went into what is
known as ``septic shock,'' in which the body is overwhelmed by
bacteria carried in the blood to all parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas Brum, a veterinarian at Angell Memorial Animal
Hospital in Boston, says lots of seemingly innocuous things around
us can be deadly when dogs ingest them. The sepsis that the huskies
died from is not all that common, but it does happen. There are two
ways for animals to become septic. One is for a stick or some other
sharp instrument to be swallowed and perforate the stomach or
intestinal lining. The other is for something to make the dog so
violently ill with vomiting and diarrhea and to become so
dehydrated that the digestive tract breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs find all kinds of things in the garbage and get into all
kinds of trouble, Brum says. Teriyaki sticks used to skewer meat
are a common source of danger. But mold can be deadly too, Brum
says. Moldy food in the garbage and even moldy leaves can cause the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   All veterinarians who see emergency cases make two points: You
need to be on guard about what your dog or cat gets into; and,
should one suddenly have severe diarrhea or vomiting, get the pet
to the vet right away.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Berg, chairman of the department of clinical sciences
at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, is the man who
scrubs up and operates on pets to remove the strange things they've
eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Berg removes foreign bodies such as beef vertebrae (the bulk and
shape make them very dangerous), sticks, cellophane wrappers that
raw meat comes in, and bulky cloth items such as socks, hand
towels, and even pantyhose. Berg has found rocks, little plastic
toys, nipples from baby bottles, golf balls, and rocks in dogs'
intestines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some dogs are just more prone to chewing and swallowing all
kinds of stuff,'' Berg says. And though dietary indiscretion is not
specific to any breed, young puppies tend to have more of it. ``A
savvy old dog is much less likely to do something like that,'' Berg
says.
</P>
<P>
   Cats often get into what are known as ``linear foreign bodies''
_ tinsel, string, dental floss, cassette tape. Berg warns cat
owners to resist the temptation to pull a string that they see
caught in a pet's mouth. Yanking a thread that runs from a cat's
mouth down into the digestive tract can cut the bowel.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many things to keep out of animals' mouths. But it
is the holiday season, so what can we give them?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jim McKiernan, a veterinarian at the Northside Hospital in
Hooksett, N.H., recommends carrots, plain rice cakes, and popcorn
without the butter as healthy snacks. ``But if you really want to
indulge them,'' McKiernan says, ``do it with love: Toss a ball,
take them for a walk, spend time with them.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: ``Bombs away!'' diplomacy backfires
 &HT;    For release, Dec. 30, 1998.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saddam Hussein is a bad guy. We certainly think so. We like to
think the Iraqi people also think so. But do they?
</P>
<P>
   It can be rationalized that Hussein remains in power the way
Fidel Castro does _ by eliminating his enemies before they have an
opportunity to coalesce.
</P>
<P>
   But there are those remaining who, by our actions, are so
alienated by us that they rally around the very person we see as
their oppressor.
</P>
<P>
   When we bomb Baghdad, we like to say that we are aiming strictly
at military targets, that we have nothing against the Iraqi people.
But we kill them nevertheless because they are in the way of our
incoming.
</P>
<P>
   If they hated Hussein before, they hate us even more now.
</P>
<P>
   The four-decade embargo of Cuba has similar tones. We're not
bombing Havana, but we maintain an economic policy that makes life
rough for the Cuban people. Castro still eats well.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 invasion of Panama by the Bush administration may have
caught us a pock-faced, drug-dealing dictator in Manuel Noriega,
but at least 500 Panamanian civilians were killed in the process;
one Panama organization claims the number to be as high as 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, there are many Panamanians who hate our guts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. foreign policy has a short leash; do what we say, or the
bombs are coming _ and they may fall anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the most recent bombing of Iraq, it was done
unilaterally. It was not by a vote of the Security Council of the
United Nations, although we said we were attacking because Iraq
wasn't honoring its obligation to the UN.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is at a crossroads. With the Soviet Union
broken up, we remain the world superpower. But any nation with
nuclear capability can be just as much a superpower as the U.S.;
just one strike is all they need.
</P>
<P>
   Our continual explanation that we have nothing against these
people and those people, that we're only trying to get rid of the
bad guy on top, rings hollow, particularly when we don't go after
the bad guy on top.
</P>
<P>
   It is painfully apparent that our most modern weapons of
destruction are not as precise as the Department of Defense would
like us to believe. The statistics on direct hits of military
targets are woeful. It is one thing to miss the target, it is
something else to hit innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   How many millions of people have we turned against us by some of
our strong-armed foreign policy, little of it successful? Saddam
Hussein and Fidel Castro still rule. What difference did we really
make in Haiti, in Somaliland, in Libya, in Lebanon?
</P>
<P>
   Also take note that the latest operation against Iraq (not
Hussein, but Iraq; Hussein wasn't targeted) cost the U.S. in excess
of $1 billion. And what was the end result? The most optimistic
report I hear is that it set back Iraq's war machine for a year.
</P>
<P>
   So do we do it again in 1999? Do we have a specific DOD budget
line item for bombing Iraq? Did we really need to do the bombing,
or did we need to nurture the bottom lines of defense contractors?
</P>
<P>
   Could a close look at one of those missiles have had ``Use
Before Dec. 31, 1998'' printed on it?
</P>
<P>
   Is the price of continuing as the self-appointed policemen of
the world getting to be too costly to the U.S., both in dollars and
stature? Perhaps the next Congress, when it gets done with the
Clinton/Lewinsky humiliation, can look into that increasingly
important issue.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Carville in Tel Aviv? Oy vay
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's see how many ways we can find that this is a really bad
idea: Israel's Labor Party has hired James Carville as a political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Carville is the Ragin' Cajun of Democratic _ and more
specifically, Clinton _ politics. He operates in two modes _
``attack'' and ``attack harder.'' Carville is not what you would
call nuanced. He is what you would call lunatic.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politics does not lack for, shall we say, a certain
vigor _ and especially not now, with an election called in hopes it
can tidy up after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's sour
government has flopped.
</P>
<P>
   Even an ordinary Knesset debate can crank up global warming. Add
in the fact that Israel has enough political parties for any two or
three democracies and you have a political system that cannot be
said to want for dispute or provocation.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Carville to Israeli politics is a service along the
lines of carrying gasoline to a fire, as a hedge against it burning
itself out.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a more serious concern as well. The prospect of
political consultants who serve a U.S. administration also serving
a political party abroad is unsettling. The potential is large for
conflicts of interest and for connivance.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the White House has often been too deeply involved in
Israeli politics. The Clinton administration all but campaigned for
Labor in 1996. You can see why. Netanyahu's Likud-led coalition is
one of the balkiest friends peace has ever had, but playing
favorites made Washington suspect with the winners.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Labor Party is moving toward the center in the trendy
``Third Way'' manner of the Democratic Party under Bill Clinton, of
Britain's Labour Party under Tony Blair and of Germany's Social
Democrats under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. (Schroeder's and Tony
Blair's campaign managers have signed on with Labor, too. Is an
international party a-borning?)
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Carville been brought in, but he has in turn
involved former Clinton pollster Stanley Greenberg and media
consultant Robert Shrum.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington political consultant Steve Rabinowitz already
advising Labor chief Ehud Barak, Israel is beginning to look like
Washington East. (Likud has used Republican consultants: same
potential problem.)
</P>
<P>
   There's no great outrage here, at least not yet. Maybe the
internationalization of business and of economies inevitably
produces internationalized politics, too. Still, the muddle of
relationships and loyalties requires skeptical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Remember 1963's Profumo scandal? Party girl Christine Keeler (we
said ``party girl'' back then) was found to be alternately dating
(we said ``dating'' back then) British War Minister John Profumo
and Soviet military attache/KGB agent Yevgeny Ivanov. The affair
led to Ivanov's recall, Profumo's downfall and the collapse of
Harold McMillan's Conservative government.
</P>
<P>
   The problem wasn't that Keeler was having it on with Profumo or
with Invanov but with both. Mr. Carville, meet Miss Keeler.

   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   SUN-POWER (San Francisco) _ If you thought San Francisco's
mega-blackout was bad, just wait until our old friend the sun turns
against us. Its next celestial fit is likely in mid-2000 _ possibly
even next summer _ and could bring continent-sized power outages
and global cell-phone screw-ups that could make the Dec. 8 blackout
look like a burned-out refrigerator light bulb. By KEAY DAVIDSON.
</P>
<P>
   TRUE-DEATH (San Antonio) _ From Mexico City to San Antonio, the
questions gnaw at friends, family and colleagues mourning the early
December murder of the San Antonio Express-News' Mexico City bureau
chief, Philip True. Here is a complete picture of the situation. By
ROBERT RIVARD.
</P>
<P>
   FOG (San Francisco) _ Fog continues to cause a giant mess at
local airports here, causing delays of up three hours. By JIM
HERRON ZAMORA.

city. For all the hassles, gays here have it good, and they know
it.By CAROL NESS.
</P>
<P>
   MARY-DONOHUE (Albany, N.Y.) _ With her marriage in disarray and
her daughter in diapers, 33-year-old Mary Kenney rejected her
matriarchic mother's advice and enrolled in law school here. It was
a critical juncture in the career of the woman now answering to the
name Mary Donohue, who is lieutenant-governor-elect of New York. By
JOHN CAHERA.
</P>
<P>
   COSMETIC-SURGERY (San Francisco) _ In the wake of scores of
deaths around the country linked to cosmetic surgery, several
legislative reforms targeted to the boom in ``rejuvenation''
surgery are being considered in California. State legislators and
medical officials are calling for stricter standards. By ELIZABETH
FERNANDEZ.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL (``i'' category)
</P>
<P>
   DOCTORS-NICARAGUA (Posoltega, Nicaragua) _ In the cool of early
morning at a refugee camp on the outskirts of this farming town,
nurse Ann Souter of California and Dr. David Harris of Minnesota
hurry down a row of roughly built tents. They are providing health
care to dozens of families who lost their homes in the late October
flooding of Hurricane Mitch. By TYCHE HENDRICKS.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   D'ESTE-POETRY (San Francisco) _ The poetry of Jessica d'Este is
not well known outside Britain, the Continent and selected places
on the East Coast, where she recently concluded a speaking tour. It
should be. Her latest book of poetry, ``Wine, Woman and Song,''
offers a feel for the romance of the English language. By Edvins
Beitiks.
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM-POETRY (San Francisco ) _ Up to now, books of poetry on
the Vietnam War were wrapped around separate themes: poems by the
veterans themselves, by Vietnamese, by demonstrators against the
war, by noted poets adding their own voices to the chaos. The
latest anthology, ``From Both Sides Now'' is a combination of all
those. By Edwins Beitiks.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN'S-SOCCER (San Francisco) _ Next July 4, as part of what's
being called ``The Year of the Sportswoman'' in the San Francisco
Bay area, Brandi Chastain could well be playing at Stanford
Stadium. When she's not working as an assistant coach with the
Santa Clara women's soccer team, Chastain is a key member of the
U.S. national squad. And if things break right, she and her
teammates may make the semifinals of the Women's World Cup. By
DWIGHT CHAPIN.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ A reader writes, ``There seems
to be a contradiction in the outlook of fishermen and especially
hunters that I don't understand. (They) say they want to protect
wildlife, then they go out and (kill) something they want to
protect. Makes no sense.'' By TOM STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>
   PRO-FOOTBALL (San Francisco) _ Awards must be given out for the
only two things that make sports watchable: Excellence and
ineptitude. By JOHN CRUMPACKER.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   ARTIST-AWARD (San Francisco) _ San Francisco artist Ruth Asawa,
whose work graces museums and homes around the country, finally
receives the degree she earned 52 years ago but failed to get
because of post-World War II racism. By JULIE CHAO. &QL;
</P>
<P>

   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ What IF they throw a millennium
party, and no one comes? The year 1998, the year of living

1998: A YEAR OF E-MAZING EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What if they throw a millennium party, and no
one comes? What if the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse turn out to
be just parking-control officers on Cushmans? If the power fails at
the turn of the year 2000, how will we know whether it's because of
Y2K or the electric company?
</P>
<P>
   Correct. The power will come back faster if it's knocked out by
Y2K, as the millennium computer bug is known.
</P>
<P>
   The year 1998, the year of living astonishingly, has given
Americans a case of amazement burnout. We cannot be surprised
anymore. And as human beings who naturally seek stability, we fight
surprise at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Man, there have been a lot of turns this year.
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the horrifying things we all have come
to accept: Housewives drive armored vehicles. Yes, the
four-wheel-drive is the new station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Even well-dressed people talk to themselves on the street. They
shout into ever-smaller black boxes, but the technology isn't quite
as good as picking up signals directly in your fillings.
</P>
<P>
   The British are trying to reconquer America by hypnotizing our
children with multicolored creatures with televisions in their
abdomens. Older children already are fixated on overweight British
women with platform shoes and Cockney accents.
</P>
<P>
   Almost forgot. The president of the United States had pathetic
sex with a 21-year-old intern, and tried to wriggle out of it by
redefining sex and the word ``is.''
</P>
<P>
   The American people, always fuzzy on sex and grammar, gave him
record approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were the great president he wants to be, he wouldn't
be satisfied with merely redefining words. He'd create new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1998, how many people ever heard of the word
``perjurious''? In recent months, it's been popping out the mouths
of pundits and politicians as if they were uncuddly Furbys.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needs new words for lying, instead of ``misled,'' which
sounds too much like ``mislaid.''
</P>
<P>
   If Republicans call Clinton's grand jury testimony
``perjurious,'' he should counter by saying he was merely being
``fibacious,'' ``lietudinal'' or ``whopperatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else should make a New Year's resolution never to say
anything like, ``It's not about sex. It's about lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Americans to put the Ten Commandments in the form of
multiple-choice questions.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't a good year for women, and I don't just mean the
feminists that Bill Clinton put through the cognitive dissonance
grinder.
</P>
<P>
   This was the year a male basketball league shut down but stayed
in business, while a women's basketball league kept playing and
went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   I guess you'd call this a case of women hitting the glass
backboard, if backboards weren't glass already.
</P>
<P>
   In other sports and entertainment news, 1998 was the year of the
little blue pill, endorsed by formerly cranky former Sen. Bob Dole.
We haven't heard any endorsements from Elizabeth yet.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is an ad for Viagra in Ladies Home Journal, with the
slogan ``Let the dance begin.'' Call it the Pfizer hustle.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs don't like prescribing Viagra, though, probably because it
can lead to more expensive procedures like prenatal care or, in the
wrong dosages, divorce.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, if anyone told me Bob Dole would be doing
ads for male-potency drugs, while Bill Clinton was unzipping and
getting better ratings than Ronald Reagan, I would have said that
Larry Flynt had taken over the government.
</P>
<P>
   He did. And it's about time someone replaced Kenneth Starr with
a professional pornographer.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is amazing anymore.
</P>
<P>
   This is the year of e-stuff. On top of e-mail, which became
e-evidence in the Microsoft case, we now have e-commerce, e-trading
and e-tailing (as in ``retailing,'' not what private eyes do).
</P>
<P>
   Christmas 1998 was the first big year for e-tailers on the
Internet, as people ordered e-toys, e-books and other e-presents
for their e-children and e-laws.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how will the e-tailers handle e-returns? Will
people have to stand in on-line lines with their e-ceipts?
</P>
<P>
   I don't think this Internet thing has been worked out yet.
</P>
<P>
   As commerce got more virtual, and government got more unreal,
Americans have gotten back to the basics like beer, starchy food
generously infused with fat, and the passive enjoyment of large men
bashing into each other without cries of ``perjurious.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Jets-Bills football game on Dec. 19 got vastly
higher ratings than the historic impeachment vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   You can accuse Americans of apathy, but I say the people showed
good sense. The Jets-Bills game, unlike the Starr-Bill game, hadn't
already been going on for five years, and the outcome wasn't
determined in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, 1998 is the year we had amazement beaten out of us, and
1999 could be a Groundhog Year, except with senators this time.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium, schmillennium. If Y2K shuts down the government, how
will we know?

THINK BEFORE YOU LEAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have heard that there will be no leap year in
the year 2000. Due to some imperfection in the leap-year system,
the century years are skipped. I need to do some system testing
very soon and need confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leapin' Lizard
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LIZARD: Go back to your calculator. Or just take a look at
a calendar. Guess what 2000 is?
</P>
<P>
   Leap years were instituted to keep the calendar honest. It takes
365.2422 days for the Earth to orbit the sun, so you have to make
up for those extra fractions of days every once in a while with a
leap day. It's like when the bank messes up my statement each and
every month, and I have to make an adjustment to my checkbook to
compensate for their stupid mistake.
</P>
<P>
   There's a standard mathematical formula for figuring leap years,
even though it's a bit off. Once upon a time, the head calendar
guys decided there should be 97 leap years for every 400 years,
yielding an average calendar year of 365.2425 days. I know, that
all seems like nit-picking, but even with all those decimal
thingies, the formula is still off by three days every 10,000
years. Imagine how embarrassing that will be for the Daytimer
people, assuming the Earth isn't a smoldering heap of rubble by
then.
</P>
<P>
   We hope the programmers who worked on your software didn't cut
class for the ``Star Trek'' convention the day they taught that in
Math 101.
</P>
<P>
   First, determine if the year is divisible by 4. It's probably a
leap year, but you're not through checking. If it's also divisible
by 100, it's not a leap year. Well, unless, of course, it can also
be divided by 400. You there in the back row, wake up!
</P>
<P>
   There's no real imperfection in the leap-year system, but there
may be in the way your programs were written. But what's the worst
thing that can happen? With all those other undiscovered millennium
bugs contributing to the end of civilization as we know it, we'll
be sitting in caves gnawing on rodent bones by Feb. 29, 2000,
anyway. Save me a tail!
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I must be getting dense. I have deleted and
uninstalled programs, but when I go to the Programs menu, the names
are still there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lasting Reminder
</P>
<P>
   DEAR REMINDER: My guess is the guy who wrote the uninstallation
program is the dense one. A good uninstaller is suppposed to take
care of stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just right-click on the Start button. That brings up a
short menu. Pick Explore, and Windows Explorer opens up to the
hard-to-find spot where all the Start menu stuff lives. In the
right pane, click into the Programs folder. There are all the
sub-menus, looking like sub-folders. Search and destroy the ones
for the stuff you've uninstalled.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there access to past columns? Sometimes I
remember having seen something that may be relevant to a problem
I'm having now, and it would be great to search your past columns
for the answer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Devoted Reader
</P>
<P>
   DEAR READER: You mean you haven't been keeping a scrapbook? I'm
deeply hurt. You might try a Yahoo! search, but my guess is that
all that past wisdom is like so much snail slime washed away by the
spring rain. Gee, that's so poetic!

NOTED ARTIST RECEIVES COLLEGE DEGREE MORE THAN 50 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Wisconsin)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In an art career spanning more than 50 years,
Ruth Asawa has received honorary doctorates and prestigious art
awards. Her work graces museums and homes around the country. Her
sculptures are found throughout downtown San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier this month, she returned to Wisconsin to collect the
bachelor of fine arts diploma she should have earned a half-century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Asawa's academic career was interrupted by the suspicions about
Japanese-Americans that grew from World War II. Asawa was among the
110,000 Japanese-Americans sent to internment camps during the war.
Starting in 1942, she and her family were detained for six months
in Southern California and then for a year in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Asawa, however, was determined to get an education.
</P>
<P>
   By 1943, some internees were allowed to apply to college or get
jobs, as long as they weren't on either coast. Asawa, the fourth of
seven children, said she chose Milwaukee State Teachers College
because, at about $50 a year, ``the tuition was the cheapest.''
</P>
<P>
   She loved her classes _ painting, pottery, weaving,
jewelry-making _ and hoped to become a teacher. At the end of her
third year, in 1946, she went to see an adviser about getting
placed for a practice teaching position, a requirement for becoming
a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they wouldn't place an Asian,'' she said without a
trace of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Asawa shows no hostility toward the school (now the University
of Wisconsin at Milwaukee) that thwarted her teaching career, nor
to the system that put her and her family behind barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to accept everything. If it doesn't happen, you go
in another direction,'' she said. ``I didn't feel the (racial)
tension that we feel now.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is reflected in her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really get involved in ethnic studies too much because
my training was European,'' she said. ``I'm working in a human way
rather than a color way. It's really an effort to find what every
human has in common.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 28 credits shy of her degree, Asawa had no choice but to
leave Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by some friends, she headed to Black Mountain College
in North Carolina, a now-defunct experimental arts college attended
by people who would later become some of the most famous and gifted
modern American artists.
</P>
<P>
   Asawa's classmates included artist Robert Rauschenberg, director
Arthur Penn, composer John Cage and choreographer Merce Cunningham.
As part of her laundry duty at the school, she recalls that she
made artist Willem de Kooning's bed.
</P>
<P>
   She spent three formative years at Black Mountain, which is also
where she met her husband, architect Albert Lanier.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to San Francisco in 1949, and over the next several
decades became a backbone of that city's arts and arts education
community, serving on the San Francisco Arts Commission and the
California Arts Council, and was instrumental in the creation of
the School of the Arts, a public high school in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't walk down a street in San Francisco without someone
coming up and saying (to her), `You once taught me,''' said Susan
Stauter, the school district's artistic director for secondary
schools. ``Everyone from the cop on the street to the lady ringing
the Salvation Army bell.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that without a college degree, Asawa couldn't get a
teaching certificate. And without that important piece of paper, no
district could officially hire her.
</P>
<P>
   She could teach only by volunteering or with outside funding,
such as through a grant. She once had to have a certified teacher
in the room with her for a summer art course, she recalled in an
even tone that is the closest to indignation she can muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody around me says, `Why do you need the degree?''' she
said. ``But without a degree, you can't really teach in this
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, James DePaul became the theater director at the School
of Fine Arts at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   When DePaul visited San Francisco earlier this year to conduct a
workshop at the School of the Arts, he became aware of Asawa's
connection with Milwaukee and decided something needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted Richard Zauft, associate dean of the School of Fine
Arts, who dug up Asawa's transcripts from Milwaukee State Teachers
College, then got her transcripts from Black Mountain College,
which are archived at the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Patching all her credits together, Zauft decided she had enough
for a degree, with one exception. It's another irony Asawa recounts
with a laugh: ``The only class I didn't have that was required was
sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zauft said the diploma she finally got Dec. 19 is bona fide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't an honorary degree; it was a real degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Asawa hopes the significance of the degree will extend beyond
her own teaching career and open doors for other artists, who have
traditionally had difficulty connecting with academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they'll recognize art as equal to the academic
subjects,'' she said.

REV. CHARLES STITH: ON THE SPOT IN TANZANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Stith, well known in Boston, must have figured
he was headed for several years of obscurity when he accepted
President Clinton's offer to become ambassador to the African
nation of Tanzania. All that changed on Aug. 7 when terrorists
bombed the US embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's capital, killing
10 people. The high profile attack put the country and the US role
there in the spotlight in a way in which Stith never could have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 100 days as ambassador, Stith has worked to restore
the morale of the embassy staff. He has also focused attention on
his primary mission: boosting trade and investment in the
impoverished nation. It is a task with which he is familiar. As a
minister of the Union United Methodist Church in the South End and
later as head of the Organization For a New Equality, Stith's has
dedicated his career to improving the economy of America's
low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Globe reporter Charles Stein spoke with Stith by telephone last
week about his first few months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did you accept this post in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   A: The short answer is the president asked me. It is difficult
to say no when the President asks you to serve your country in some
capacity. Beyond that, I saw a real synergy between what he wanted
and what I had been doing. The President wanted to focus foreign
policy in Africa on investment and trade rather than just foreign
aid. It seemed to me the skills I developed in trying to help
undercapitalized communities in the US could also be used to help
undercapitalized countries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there genuine parallels between the two?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are. In both cases it is critical to have access to
capital, it is critical to create confidence in the environment as
a place to invest and it is critical that those involved have a
mindset that approaches development, not as charity, but as an
economic opportunity. You need that mindset if you want to grow in
today's global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tanzania is pretty far afield. Is it realistic to think you
are going to put it on the map of US investors?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have to help put Tanzania on investors' map of
potential opportunities. While the characters who bombed the
embassy meant it for evil, one of the upsides of that horrendous
situation was that there were a lot of people who, because of the
daily news coverage, were in a position to look at Tanzania. They
saw that this is a stable country with a viable democracy. The
bombing was an aberration, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you surprised by the extent of the damage from the
bombing?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I touched down in Dar es Salaam I went immediately to
the site of the embassy. Seeing the devastation I wondered how the
staff had continued to manage and whether they could continue to
manage. Every way I turned the damage was enormous. There was a car
damaged beyond recognition. The house across the street had one
whole side gone. It reminded me of a doll house we had bought for
our daughter Mimi on one of her first Christmases. You could see
every room and all the rubble from where I stood. It was clear that
the despicable human beings who did this meant to maximize the
death zone. Inside the embassy the damage was unbelievable. We
walked into one room full of fallen debris and I was told, ``Sir,
this is your office or what is left of it. Thank God you weren't
here. There is no way you would have survived.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you had to spend a lot of time keeping morale up in the
wake of the bombing?
</P>
<P>
   A: A big part of my responsibility is making sure the morale of
the staff is high. Having said that, one of the things I take a
great deal of pride in is the level of professionalism and
resilience of the staff here. There were outright acts of heroism
in the aftermath of the bombing. But the staff has made it clear
that they don't want this simply to be known as the embassy which
was assaulted by terrorists. They want an embassy that is actively
engaged in furthering the foreign policy objectives of the United
States. We've got real troopers. They do us all proud as Americans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have all the extra security measures you've had to take made
it difficult for you to do your job?
</P>
<P>
   A: Quite frankly, the day the bomb went off in Dar es Salaam,
the job description changed. It was a clear indication the rules of
the game have changed. The security measures we've taken to make us
less vulnerable are not things that can be looked upon as
inconveniences. They are necessities. They are part and parcel of
what you have to deal with representing American interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand you have seen quite a bit of the country since
you arrived. What are your impressions of Tanzania?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is an absolutely beautiful country. It is also huge, the
size of Texas and New Mexico. We took a trip recently from Dar es
Salaam to Arusha, which means we traveled about half the length of
the country. I sat down and calculated that it was the equivalent
of traveling from Boston to Washington DC.
</P>
<P>
   And there is so much diversity. There are pristine beaches on
Zanzibar. In the Tarangire National Park if you wake up before
sunrise you can literally hear the world awaken. You step out of
your tent and as the sun begins to rise you hear birds chirp and
animals rustle in the grass and you see bull elephants jostle.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to see this stuff and not be filled with a
childlike sense of awe. In Mwanza we saw boulders placed so
precisely in formation that it seemed as if the work was done by
angels under the direct supervision of God. It is just
breathtakingly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Arusha, you and your children sat in on a trial of a man
charged with genocide in Rwanda. What was that like?
</P>
<P>
   A: We were there for a sentencing hearing for a man named
Jean-Paul Akeyesu. He was the mayor of a one-horse town in Rwanda
no one would have ever heard of had he not personally supervised
the murder of 2000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was quite dramatic. The man had fired his lawyer and
was representing himself. As he stood up to talk my son leaned over
and whispered, ``Dad, this guy looks so normal.'' I was struck by
the poignancy of what he said. The man was well-dressed. He could
have been a deacon in a church on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   I think it was important for my kids to appreciate that it is
the demons that lurk in the hearts of normal people that cause them
to do some of the very worst things to others. That is why we have
to be eternally vigilant on issues like justice and mercy and make
sure we are all responsible for making the world a more humane and
better place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: The news from Africa is generally so depressing: war,
disease, poverty. Do you ever feel you are in a hopeless situation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer is no. In part that has to do with my disposition.
But there are other reasons to be hopeful. For 30 years Tanzania
has been one of the most stable countries in Africa. The level of
civility is envied by countries throughout the region. It is a
country that is rich in natural resources. The government is
commited to private sector reform. The president, Benjamim Mkapa,
has some decent honest people around him trying to move that agenda
forward. I believe Tanzania is positioned to be the next economic
success story in Africa.

DOMINICAN HURRICANE VICTIMS FEEL HOPE SLIP AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN DE LA MAGUANA, Dominican Republic _ In the dark,
10-year-old Nicholas Cedano can't see the hundreds of people piled
on cots and foam mattresses around him. But he can feel them.
</P>
<P>
   Each night for the past three months, he has drifted to sleep to
cries _ sometimes his own.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, screams pierce the air from an infant whose body
is dotted with a bloody rash. A man who has lost his three children
whimpers.
</P>
<P>
   Stench from the concrete latrines a few feet from the back door
fills the thick air. Mosquitoes whine around Nicholas's face.
</P>
<P>
   The child lies wedged between three brothers and his parents on
a wooden cot. Although it's hot, he wraps his tiny body in a sheet,
hoping the bugs won't bite through.
</P>
<P>
   This has been Nicholas's life since Sept. 22, when Hurricane
Georges swept through the Dominican Republic, killing more people
here than in any Caribbean nation. Then, five weeks later,
Hurricane Mitch wreaked still greater havoc on Honduras and El
Salvador. And aid to this town began to dry up.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Georges, people here say they are forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have us here like animals,'' said Nicholas's mother,
Bertha Sidio Cedono. ``We've been left here to die.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 820 people live cramped in La Escuela de Bellas Artes,
a two-story music school that has been transformed into one of a
half-dozen shelters in this city alone.
</P>
<P>
   No running water flows at this shelter. There is no milk for the
children. No medicine. Rice and cooking oil are issued in weekly
rations.
</P>
<P>
   Some children run around naked and barefoot, mostly because
donated clothes and shoes don't fit.
</P>
<P>
   When the hurricane struck, 120-mile-per-hour winds whipped the
Rio San Juan, a river that splits upstream of Mesopotamia, a
village in San Juan de la Maguana.
</P>
<P>
   That day, the two streams converged into one gigantic raging
body, which swept away bridges in its path. Mudslides that came
from mountains miles away joined with the waters, burying people,
pets, and cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two people have died here and 243 nationwide, according to
Rafael Lopez, a spokesman for the Civil Defense office.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross puts the tally in San Juan de la Maguana at 76,
while many Dominicans believe more than 1,000 people have died
here, their bodies entombed by rocks and mud.
</P>
<P>
   In Mesopotamia, wooden crosses rise from mounds of earth where
corpses were hastily buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight people are buried there,'' said a teenage boy, pointing
to a protrusion in the ground. ``They weren't identified. They just
stuck them in there, buried them like animals.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Warning came late
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many Dominicans accuse the government of purposely undercounting
the dead to stave off criticism that it did not warn people in
time.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the storm, the newly appointed Civil Defense
director, Elpidio Baez, went on national TV and told his country
the eye of the storm would not pass through the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Baez disregarded warnings from the US National Hurricane Center,
saying the center's computers had been wrong before. But as the
storm approached, he appeared again on TV, trembling. His voice
quaking, he told people to head to the nearest shelter.
</P>
<P>
   But for many, the warning came too late. In Mesopotamia, many
people refused to leave their homes as soldiers from the nearby
army station pleaded with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people didn't want to leave,'' said soldier Juan Carlos
Ferrer Polanco. ``They thought if they leave, someone would steal
what little they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Moreta, 68, can't remember much of what happened that
day. He said he was carrying his 3 1/2-year-old grandson and
walking out of his home with two other grandchildren when the river
tore them away from him.
</P>
<P>
   He was treated at a local hospital, where doctors pumped muddy
water from his stomach. When they told him his grandchildren were
swallowed by the water, he didn't want to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're buried somewhere,'' he said. ``I don't know where they
could be. I wish God had taken me instead.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Repairing the damage &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fertile fields that produce rice, beans, and plantains are
the lifeblood of Mesopotamia and many rural Dominican villages.
</P>
<P>
   The fields provide many of the few jobs available for locals. On
a good day, a crop picker might earn $6 _ enough for food. Those
who scrimp are able to buy a pair of shoes for their children every
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Georges destroyed miles of these fields. It wrecked $500 million
worth of crops, said Omar Liriano, spokesman for President Leonel
Fernandez. Total damages, including the loss of 200,000 homes, are
estimated at $3 billion, said Lopez of the Civil Defense office.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid accusations that it is pocketing the money, the
government has turned over most of the international aid _ which
included about $35 million from the United States _ to the Catholic
Church to dispense, Liriano said. Some of that aid has come from
the Dominican community in Massachusetts, a state that saw more
immigrants from the Dominican Republic last year than from any
other country.
</P>
<P>
   Liriano said the government has two main responses to Georges'
damage: build houses for those left homeless and replant crops so
that people will have jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Prefabricated ranch-style wood homes will be constructed
nationwide, he said. In San Juan de la Maguana, fields were cleared
to build 2,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the government has built about three-dozen
temporary homes of pressed wood to house people who are now in
shelters. The structures stand on a barren field, and each is
branded ``Temporary Housing 00001,'' ``Temporary Housing 00002,''
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working as fast as we can. We haven't forgotten them,''
said Teofilo Tejeda Puello, an engineer supervising the project.
``They're not living a desperate life.''
</P>
<P>
   Tejeda blamed the people living in the shelter for the dirty
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They leave garbage in there,'' he said. ``They could control
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Felix Abreu, a contractor, agreed: ``They're supposed to relieve
themselves in the latrine but they go outside, right on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   An army officer standing nearby laughed. Later, the soldier said
what they were saying was ``not true. They're defending the
government because they work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a mile away, outside the back entrance of the shelter,
the ground is muddy. Putrid smells drift from concrete latrines,
and pools of water seem to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look closely,'' a woman said. ``There are worms in there.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, a little girl stands barefoot in an oversized
T-shirt, eating white rice with her fingers. `I don't know what
we'll do'
</P>
<P>
   Each week, every family at this shelter gets a small bar of
soap, a box of bleach for disinfecting the floor, 5 pounds of rice,
and 2 ounces of cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   The first few weeks, they got milk, spaghetti, and beans. Now,
they rely on friends and relatives to bring them food. Otherwise,
many say, they would die from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're giving out the last of what we have,'' said Esperanza
Encarnacion, 38, the music school director who, for the past three
months, has been in charge of giving out food. ``If we don't get
more food, I don't know what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   For deeply religious Dominicans, the answer is often prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, at 3 p.m., the 820 people in the shelter gather
around Madre Sol, a nun from a nearby church. Standing on the tile
floor amid dusty foam mattresses, they clutch plastic rosaries.
</P>
<P>
   In unison, they say the ending of the Hail Mary, ``. . . now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.'' A woman holding an infant places
the baby's fingers on the rosary.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Cedano stands nearby after another troubled night's
sleep, a white plastic rosary dangling around his yellow T-shirt.
Because his school was destroyed in the storm, he stays in the
shelter all day, leaving the family cot only to pray with Madre
Sol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking I want God to make me an obedient boy,'' Nicholas
said. ``I want Him to save us.''

ARE RAINDROPS UNIQUE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is every raindrop unique? How about sleet and hail?
</P>
<P>
   H.K., Chelsea, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First, in verse, a bit about snow flakes, since it's widely
believed that no two are alike.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of the way that they grow
</P>
<P>
   Each frozen white crystal of snow
</P>
<P>
   Is thought in our mind
</P>
<P>
   To be one of a kind
</P>
<P>
   But guess what. It just isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When H-2-0 molecules freeze
</P>
<P>
   Hexagons form with great ease
</P>
<P>
   Like magical wands
</P>
<P>
   Molecular bonds
</P>
<P>
   Form the six-sided shapes snowfall sees
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dendrite flakes, with their six crystal wings,
</P>
<P>
   Are among Nature's beautiful things.
</P>
<P>
   These flakes are unique.
</P>
<P>
   No two can you seek
</P>
<P>
   Just the same in the white winter brings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But at temperatures lower or higher
</P>
<P>
   In air that's more humid, or dryer,
</P>
<P>
   Different shapes grow
</P>
<P>
   Less unique flakes of snow
</P>
<P>
   That arise in much simpler attire.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Needles, and Columns, and Plates.
</P>
<P>
   These flakes have identical mates
</P>
<P>
   Like wheels on a bike
</P>
<P>
   Many flakes look alike
</P>
<P>
   Each type has quite similar traits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in turbulent winds of a storm
</P>
<P>
   With temperatures both cold and warm
</P>
<P>
   And mixed moisture sources
</P>
<P>
   Such varying forces
</P>
<P>
   Cause complex mixed crystals to form.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So while some flakes can look the same
</P>
<P>
   Most are not nearly so tame
</P>
<P>
   They're all based on a `hex'
</P>
<P>
   But they're just as complex
</P>
<P>
   As the Nature from whence they each came.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now raindrops, and sleet, even hail
</P>
<P>
   Are part of a simpler tale
</P>
<P>
   Though they vary in size
</P>
<P>
   Like a bunch of french fries
</P>
<P>
   Each forms the same way without fail.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big drops fall from moist warmer air
</P>
<P>
   Or when smaller drops join, up there.
</P>
<P>
   Hailstones will grow
</P>
<P>
   When strong updrafts blow
</P>
<P>
   A thunderstorm has those to spare.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sleet's just a raindrop that froze
</P>
<P>
   Before it crashed into your nose
</P>
<P>
   Wet rain that falls
</P>
<P>
   And then freezes on walls
</P>
<P>
   Is freezing rain. Traffic it slows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each type of cold precipitation
</P>
<P>
   Has it's own origination

 BOSTON: ... longtime overseer.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the center of the storm over the museum's ethics is Cornelius
C. Vermeule III, the MFA's longtime curator of classical
antiquities who retired in 1996. A scholar world-renowned for his
connoisseurship, and a beloved figure at the MFA and in the local
art world, Vermeule developed a swashbuckling reputation for his
acquisition habits.
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, Vermeule's decisions still preoccupy
lawyers. It was Vermeule who arranged the MFA's questionable
acquisition of the top half of a Heraclean figure the Turkish
government wants reunited with the bottom half that sits in a
Turkish museum. In another case involving the alleged theft of
precious Athenian coins from Turkey, it was Vermeule who had the
MFA authenticate them for the owners, despite evidence they might
be ``hot.''
</P>
<P>
   And like many curators of his generatio, who scoured the world
for prized pieces long before the plundering of ancient grave sites
was officially proscribed, Vermeule continued to buy artifacts as
if the rules had never changed, according to McClellan, the BU
archeologist. By many accounts, Vermeule had virtual autonomy
within the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, with the help of a $30,000 grant from the National
Endowment for the Arts, Vermeule's department published a book
signaling that it was still playing by old rules. The 1993 book,
``Vase Painting in Italy,'' matter-of-factly suggests that three of
the Apulian vases it prizes most highly were newly discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the vases, attributed to the Darius Painter, a name given
by scholars to one of the finest artisans in the Greek civilization
that flourished in Apulia about 2,300 years ago, have been hailed
in one MFA annual report as ``two of the greatest South Italian
vases in America.''
</P>
<P>
   In the museum's book, the MFA's curators wrote: ``Recent years
have seen a host of new vases by the Darius Painter with rare or
unique mythological subjects . . .'' The MFA vases, acquired in
1987, 1989, and 1991, ``are among the most splendid of the new
mythological works,'' according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   The vase acquired in 1991 is jointly owned by the MFA and by
Leon Levy and Shelby White, New York collectors whose collecting
habits have long been controversial.
</P>
<P>
   To archeologists, the language in the book is an unwitting
admission that the MFA knew the prized vases were probably stolen
from grave sites. In his written response to the Globe's questions,
Rogers acknowledged that none of the three vases had any known
owners before the museum acquired them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums like the MFA should know better,'' said David W. J.
Gill, an archeologist at the University of Wales at Swansea and an
international authority on antiquities looting. Plainly, Gill said,
the reference in the book ``means the objects were newly surfaced,
and since they had no declared history, any museum curator should
have been highly suspicious of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill and a colleague, Christopher Chippindale, have done
pioneering research on undocumented antiquities. For example, after
the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibited Levy and White's
classical collection in 1990, a study by the two men disclosed that
of the 230 objects in the show, 217 had no known history before the
collecting couple acquired them.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule and White did not respond to requests for interviews.
The MFA said it would not permit Vermeule's successor, John
Herrmann, to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   White, in a recent article in the International Journal of
Cultural Property, wrote that she and her husband do not buy
artifacts that are stolen from museums or unearthed from ``known''
archeological excavations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the wheat-growing region in Apulia, virtually all of the loot
comes from thousands of ``unknown'' grave sites, sealed tombs of
the Greeks' ancient dead that often contain painted vases of the
type favored by Levy and White and the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for the Italian government to prove the vases
were stolen since there is no documentation to prove they were in
the ground,'' lamented Marina Mazzei, the Italian archeologist in
charge of government efforts to slow the looting in Apulia. ``So
just like so many vases, they magically appear on the market, as if
they came from nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzei, during a visit last spring to the pockmarked wheatfields
with a Globe reporter, said the tombaroli, or tomb robbers, have
taken tens of thousands of vases over the last 15 years, so
brazenly that they often employ mechanical excavators. The dramatic
rise in looting in the early 1980s, Mazzei said, coincided with the
growing popularity of the vases with American and European
collectors and museums.
</P>
<P>
   But with few resources, and vast territory to police, she said,
Italian authorities are almost powerless to stop the looters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, with unemployment so high in southern Italy,
``there is a high level of crime directed at the living. So to many
laymen, stealing from tombs is not considered criminal, because the
tombaroli disturb the dead, and not the living.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized rings of thieves smuggle much of the plunder into
Switzerland, with its lax statutes and reputation as an
international fencing crossroads. There, the plunder is sold to
collectors and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the Italian-Swiss border, in scenic vacation towns
like Lugano and Ascona, antiquities shops are ubiquitous, and some
dealers openly admit that their wares have been recently excavated.
In one shop last spring, a score of Apulian vases, some of museum
quality and bearing prices as high as $40,000, were displayed in
glass cases.
</P>
<P>
   Lying on the floor in a corner was a piece of Roman armor
identified by the shop owner as from the 1st century A.D. It was
still caked in mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from a 100-year-old Italian collection,'' the dealer said
with a smile and a wink.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The inexorable link between generous Italian supply and
insatiable collector demand has long raised questions about what
the principals know, or choose to know, about the origin of the
objects they acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg, a major figure in the antiquities trade, said he
would not ``knowingly buy a piece that's been smuggled.'' In fact,
he argued in an interview that the vast majority of antiquities are
of no use to archeologists and ought to be traded freely like
modern artworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-eight percent of items that are excavated offer no new
or useful information for archeologists. So collectors and museums
should be able to acquire these objects,'' said Eisenberg, whose
views anger many archeologists. Strict laws against export, he
added, force the art market to hide information and, sometimes,
prompt museums to doctor provenance information.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``minor pieces'' that most collectors buy, Eisenberg
said, ``We know they come out illegally. But no one bothers about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the major pieces he has sold, to the MFA and other clients,
he acknowledged: ``There is a likelihood that some material may
have been smuggled. No one knows ultimately where these things come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   The MFA, though it made some of its acquisition records
available to the Globe, refused to disclose the identities of
dealers who have sold classical antiquities to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   But dealers seeking tax deductions often donate artifacts to
curators they sell objects to. The MFA's list of donor-dealers
amounts to a ``who's who'' of dealers, and some collectors, who
have been involved in controversy over the origin of some of their
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   They include London dealer Robin Symes, Demirjian, White and
Levy, and the late Lawrence Fleischman, a major purchaser of
undocumented antiquities whose collection was acquired in 1995 by
the J. Paul Getty Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Two major collectors who face claims by foreign governments
seeking the recovery of artifacts are also among MFA donors:
Maurice Tempelsman, the New York financier and companion to the
late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; and Jonathan H. Kagan, one of the
defendants in Turkey's lawsuit demanding the return of the Athenian
coins.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan has donated numerous undocumented antiquities to the MFA,
including nine ceramic cups from the 7th century B.C. that
McClellan says were probably unearthed from the same tomb complex,
in Latium, the site of an ancient culture near Rome that predated
the Greek colonization of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, D. Lloyd Macdonald, Kagan declined a request
for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the dealers who have sold classical artifacts to the
museum is Robert E. Hecht Jr., a Paris-based antiquities specialist
who was once declared persona non grata by the Italian and Turkish
governments for his alleged role in selling plundered antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht, the Globe reported in April, played a central role in a
$1.8 million sale to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art of a 3d
century B.C. silver trove. Italian authorities have an affidavit
from the professional grave robber who helped unearth the objects
from Morgantina, a Greek city-state in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   During an April telephone interview, Hecht defended the trade in
looted antiquities and ridiculed laws, like Italy's, that seek to
prevent the plundering of grave sites.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA refused to divulge its relationship with Hecht, or even
acknowledge that they had done business with him. But the voluble
Hecht boasted in the interview that in mid-1997 he sold the MFA a
rare silver cup, called a skyphos, at a price reported to exceed
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked where the silver artifact originated, Hecht replied:
``What does it matter?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the MFA's classical acquisitions examined by the
Globe, the skyphos has a listed provenance. The MFA said Hecht told
them the piece was once in an American collection and provided the
museum with a letter from a third party attesting to the fact that
Hecht has had the skyphos since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The museum refused to make the letter public.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is no public evidence the MFA has changed its habits,
other institutions have.
</P>
<P>
   Shestack, who is now the deputy director of the National Gallery
of Art in Washington, said that because of the increased
international and public focus on grave robbing, ``Museums are much
more aware of the consequences of this kind of collecting. They are
much more fastidious.''
</P>
<P>
   But during the seven years he ran the MFA, Shestack conceded,
the museum relied on its dealers for written assurance that the
artifacts the MFA bought were clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal counsel, then, was not as sensitive to these issues.
The dealers often didn't want to tell us anything about the prior
ownership,'' Shestack said. ``The lawyers almost always said that
if a dealer signed a guarantee the work was clean, then everything
was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever said, `We're not going to buy it if it doesn't
have a clear provenance,' '' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Shestack said, the museum did demand a thorough
legal review of the pre-Columbian collection offered to the MFA by
Landon T. Clay, one of its trustees. The review, at an estimated
cost of $30,000, concluded that there was no reason for the MFA not
to take it. Last December, the lawyer who did the review admitted
in an interview that he knew in 1987 that Guatemalan law forbade
export of the artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1986 speech calling for higher ethical standards,
Shestack recalled, ``I cried out for stringent laws that would give
museum directors a reason for not doing the evil thing. So then
when the directors encourage you to acquire certain things, you can
say, `No, I can't. I'll go to jail.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But if there's a gray area in the law, you don't
have an out.'' The gray area, he noted, remains.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Shestack's candid recollection contradicts Rogers, who in
both the Guatemala and classical areas has insisted there has been
nothing amiss in the museum's behavior. Partly, there are legal
reasons for that: The Guatemalan government has just hired New York
attorneys Lawrence M. Kaye and Howard Spiegler, two aggressive
litigators who handle Turkey's claims, to seek restitution of the
pre-Columbian artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the legal threat, some lawyers and art historians say
Rogers has a responsibility to assure its public that the museum's
behavior sets a moral standard for the community it serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MFA needs to make an unambiguous statement that it will no
longer acquire undocumented antiquities,'' said McClellan, the BU
archeologist. ``This is one more opportunity for the MFA to say,
`Our eyes have been opened. We take responsibility for what's
happened. We've done wrong in the past, but we'll now do better.'
But they seem unwilling to say that publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Other museums, most notably the once avaricious Getty, no longer
acquire undocumented antiquities. And the Getty has done so
unambiguously.
</P>
<P>
   Marion True, the Getty's curator of ancient art, who now devotes
much of her time to helping countries in the Mediterranean rim
devise strategies to stop looting, told a conference at Rutgers
University last month that the Getty ceased buying undocumented
antiquities because it was not possible to be certain they were
clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is because of the all-too-common practices among
so-called reputable dealers of forging provenance documents and
signing false statements on warranties,'' she said. The Getty, True
added, chooses to spend money on other projects, ``rather than
continue to struggle through the mire of deception that pervades
the market.''

`POETRY OF VIETNAM' IS AS MUCH HISTORY AS VERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Up to now, books of poetry on the Vietnam War
were wrapped around separate themes: poems by the veterans
themselves, by Vietnamese, by demonstrators against the war, by
noted poets adding their own voices to the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The latest anthology, ``From Both Sides Now: The Poetry of the
Vietnam War and Its Aftermath'' (Scribner, 320 pages, $30) is a
combination of all those _ an even-handed, numbing offering of
poems you're not likely to find anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The book was edited by Philip Mahony, a lieutenant with the New
York police, and a poet who has published two volumes of his own _
``Supreme'' and ``Catching Bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``From Both Sides Now,'' Mahony has compiled an anthology
that includes veterans of the Vietnam War, the voices of Vietnamese
soldiers and refugees, orphans, war widows, and the poetry of Jeff
Miller, one of four students killed by the Ohio National Guard at
Kent State University in May 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony's interest in the Vietnam War was kindled by David
Vancil's 1995 book, ``Homesick Patrol.'' With an eye toward 1998,
the 25th anniversary of the Paris peace talks, Mahony began
arranging poems of Vietnam in chronological order _ ``from the
Buddhist self-immolations of the 1960s to people getting drafted,
people in boot camp, the first experiences of the Vietnam War, the
war dragging on, the bombings, the GI's coming home ... up to the
present day with the Vietnam War memorial. The last chapter _ `Lost
in a Foreign Silence' _ is by Vietnamese poets in this country,
trying to figure out their place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most anthologies are a showcase for poets,'' Mahony said.
``But this is a document about the Vietnam War. The poets are less
important than their message. It reads like a history, start to
finish.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 300 poems in Mahony's anthology, ``and you
can understand every one of them,'' he said. ``Hopefully, this will
have an influence on the overall poetry scene. I had a double-edged
intention in putting this together _ to reawaken interest in the
Vietnam War, and to address the problem of elitism in poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading thousands of poems, Mahony found himself ``having to
reject so many good ones ... I had to pick five out of maybe 100
poems on the Vietnam Memorial. On the other hand, I only found
three on Agent Orange. And it wasn't until a month before I
finished that I found a poem on the Gulf of Tonkin incident.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to pick the poem that affected him most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest poems strike at something that's going on in
your life right then, and Daniel Hoffman writes about this dream of
a little boy in a rice field, burned by napalm. It's his own son in
the dream. I have a 7-year-old son, and when I read that I said,
`Oh, my God.' That poem is so haunting, so sad. I can barely read
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahony, who has been with the New York Police Department for 18
years, said the men and women in his unit ``really don't know how
to react to the book yet. But I think they respect the effort.''

   For those who have touched Vietnam, in any way, ``From Both
Sides Now,'' already in its second printing, brings it back
quickly, quietly, with each turn of the page. Here's a sampling:

QUAYLE TWIST: PERHAPS A RUN AGAINST BUSH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dan Quayle, who was plucked from obscurity by
George Bush in 1988 to become his running mate, is presumed by many
Republicans to have faded from the scene. But the No. 2 man in the
Bush-Quayle administration has another idea: He is plotting a
Republican primary campaign in 2000 that could wind up as Bush vs.
Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the former vice president will be a serious
opponent against the former president's son, Texas Governor George
W. Bush, is tearing apart the tight-knit world of people who call
themselves ``Bushies.'' Many former aides to President Bush, as
well as some former Quayle aides, are signaling that they will back
``W,'' as Bush's son is known.
</P>
<P>
   Even Quayle's longtime chief defender, former press secretary
David Beckwith, said it would be difficult to back Quayle over
Bush. ``I think it is unlikely I would support Quayle'' if Bush
runs, Beckwith said. Similarly, the former Bush White House
political director, Ron Kaufman, said, ``The vast amount of the
Bush team are urging the Texas governor to run.''
</P>
<P>
   But Quayle insists that he is undeterred, even if it means
battling with the Bush family that put him on the national stage in
the first place. ``There will be a number of people in very
uncomfortable positions,'' Quayle said in an interview. ``That's
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said he talked ``obliquely'' with Governor Bush last
month about the potential contest, and said he has stayed in touch
with his ``dear friend,'' former President Bush. Neither
conversation has deterred him from running, Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Quayle recognizes that a Bush-Quayle showdown would raise
questions about his loyalty. ``It will be the media's delight,''
Quayle said. ``You will have a lot of copy. I just have to do what
I know is right for myself and what I believe is right for the
party and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom among Republican insiders in Washington
is that Quayle doesn't have much of a chance. After years of facing
ridicule for everything from his spelling foibles to his attack on
the television character Murphy Brown, Quayle's reputation might be
beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   But Quayle is counting on being underestimated. Some former
aides said the 2000 race will finally give him a chance to define
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quayle's ability to reach into the Bush donor base and Bush
operative world obviously will be hampered by George W.'s
candidacy,'' said a former Quayle chief of staff, William Kristol,
now editor of the Weekly Standard. ``But I have always thought that
Quayle has to run as the Reaganite that he is, and not as a Bushie.
Quayle can't compete for the Bush loyalists, but he can compete for
the Reaganites.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a potentially powerful argument for Quayle. After all,
for all the focus on George W. Bush, the GOP's philosophy is
influenced far more by former President Reagan than by former
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why Michael D. McCurry, a former press
secretary for President Clinton, said recently that he thinks
Quayle might outlast Bush. ``If I were betting right now, and I was
a Republican, I would sort of say Dan Quayle has got a better
chance of getting farther down that road than George W. Bush,''
McCurry said at a University of Virginia forum this month. McCurry
also served as press secretary for the 1988 Democratic vice
presidential nominee, Lloyd Bentsen, who bested Quayle in a famous
debate, but lost the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who is described by aides as almost certain to announce
a White House bid in January or February, insists he will be a new
man as a presidential candidate. As a vice presidential candidate
in 1988, the fresh-faced, little-known Indiana senator ran into
trouble when questions were raised about whether he sought to avoid
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   His vice presidential campaign was put on a tight leash, with
many of his statements drafted by Bush aides and many of his
movements limited to small media markets. He often seemed out of
the loop and uneasy, leading some to compare his manner to that of
a deer staring into the headlights of an oncoming car.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Quayle said he would be in charge and his image
would be different. ``It is totally different running for
president,'' he said. ``When you are No. 2, you only have to be
concerned about No. 1. When you are running for the presidency, it
is your campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's game plan is to turn his insider status inside-out. The
former US representative, senator, and vice president plans to run
as an outsider, perhaps even noting that some of his former Bush
allies are no longer with him. Although he might be dismissed by
the inside-the-Beltway crowd, Quayle remains popular outside
Washington for his social conservatism, particularly among members
of the Christian Coalition and those who oppose abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also opposes abortion, but the Texan has implied he will do
little about it, saying that the courts have spoken. That has led
some Republican social conservatives to call for an attack on Bush
and to look for someone else to support. Bush, meanwhile, has said
he is not certain he wants to put his family through the inevitable
scrutiny of a presidential campaign, a concern that was highlighted
when House speaker-designate Robert Livingston resigned after he
acknowledged extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Quayle, a number of potential GOP presidential
candidates are courting the social conservative vote, including
Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, former Reagan adviser Gary
Bauer, and publisher Steve Forbes, who might finance his own
campaign. Another likely GOP candidate, former Tennessee Goveror
Lamar Alexander, is putting less emphasis on his antiabortion view
and might run to the middle.
</P>
<P>
   It is in every candidate's interests to declare that he will be
one part of a two-man race, and Quayle is no exception. He presumes
he will be battling Bush in the early states of Iowa and New
Hampshire. Quayle, who has spent the last year raising $6 million
for his Campaign America political action committee, has a good
base in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, meanwhile, Quayle is counting on help from
former Governor John H. Sununu, the former Bush chief of staff and
the most prominent former Bush aide likely to support Quayle. Some
Republicans have spread the word that Sununu has a grudge against
George W. Bush, who reportedly delivered the message in 1991 from
his father that Sununu had to resign as chief of staff. Quayle,
however, said reports about the younger Bush's role in Sununu's
ouster were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Sununu ``has been very encouraging of me running for president
in New Hampshire,'' Quayle said. Sununu himself could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Bushies, the best choice for president is George W.
Bush. Andrew Card, who was deputy chief of staff for President
Bush, wonders whether Quayle missed an opportunity by not running
for Indiana governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan Quayle clearly has a base, and he has every right to see
if his base will expand,'' Card said. ``I just think George W. has
a more expandable base.''

1998; RECORD HEAT, EXTREME WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So _ how hot was it?
</P>
<P>
   The hottest in at least 1,200 years, judging from analyses of
deep-sea ice cores, glacier ice, tree rings and historical
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say 1998 will almost certainly wind up as the warmest
in the 100-odd years that consistent weather records have been
kept, in the Northeast as well as worldwide. And suggestive but
less definitive evidence indicates the record would stand up much
further back than that.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just an anomaly: 1997 was the previous record-holder
for average warmth, and the decade of the 90s has been the warmest
on record, perhaps a strong portent of our future if predictions of
global warming hold up.
</P>
<P>
   And like Mark McGuire's adding nine home runs to a record that
had stood for decades, this year's temperatures bested the previous
marks by a wide margin. Worldwide, this year's average temperature
is a full degree Fahrenheit above the average for the past 118
years.
</P>
<P>
   It is the local manifestations of those higher averages that
people really notice, he said, such as the warmest winters on
record in some Northeast cities, or the astonishing run of hot
weather in Texas last summer, when the temperature topped 100 for
60 days _ 29 of them in a row. And early December, in New England
and in other parts of the country, continued the trend with a run
of unprecedented seasonal temperatures; several cities broke
all-time records for December. Recent cooling, especially last
week's bitter cold snap, may temper the month's average somewhat
for the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, however, December is on track to set a record.
``December probably won't come in at quite the same level'' as the
year as a whole, said Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for
Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., but ``we're still over a
quarter of a degree above the previous record.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not sound like much, he said, but ``in previous years,
we broke the record by a few hundredths of a degree, or maybe a
tenth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Northeast _ the six New England states plus New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware _ 1998
will ``most likely end up as the warmest calendar year on record,''
said Keith Eggleston, head of the Northeast Regional Climate
Center, located at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. He says there
is a 96 percent chance that the regional annual record will fall,
based on records dating to 1895 and compiled from more than 100
locations.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``the warmest February on record'' for the area as well,
he said, and this month ``looks like it will be the warmest
December on record.'' January and May also ranked in the top 10
among average monthly temperatures, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Many other weather extremes have been experienced around the
world this year. The flooding of China's Yangtze river in August
left 2,000 dead and 14 million homeless. Hurricane Mitch was the
deadliest _ and the fourth-strongest _ hurricane of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that amazed me about hurricane Mitch,'' said
Trenberth, ``was the amount of rainfall.'' The storm dumped 50 to
70 inches of rain in some places, he said, although firm numbers
are difficult to come by because the storm washed away some rain
gauges. That rain was the equivalent of ``the whole of Boston's
annual rainfall occurring in a few days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those extremes offer a hard lesson about the prospects for
global warming caused by human activities, Trenberth said. ``It's
not just the heat you want to worry about. Heat gives rise to
evaporation, which gives rise to flooding.'' And the changes in
weather patterns that bring flooding to one region often bring
drought to another, he said _ or even one extreme following the
other in the same place. For example, soon after Texas was parched
by a summer heat wave, it was swamped by severe flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Does this rising tide of record-smashing weather add up to a
stronger case for the reality of global warming?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, indeed,'' says Trenberth.
</P>
<P>
   Since the International Panel on Climate Control, a body of
1,500 climate specialists around the world, declared in 1995 that
humans' influence on climate was already discernible, he said,
``the evidence has grown stronger in several respects.''
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, ``the temperatures keep breaking records.'' And
better methods of determining past temperatures are now ``pushing
the temperature records back in time much more reliably,'' showing
how extraordinary the current warming really is.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month at a meeting of the American Geophysical
Union, a team of scientists presented evidence that 1998 will
almost certainly be the warmest year in at least 1,200 years _
contrary to some earlier claims that there was an equally warm
spell in Medieval times, from about the 9th to the 14th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Overpeck, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's paleoclimatology program, said his team used
``natural proxy sources, such as ocean and lake sediments, glacier
ice cores, tree rings, and historical documents'' to reconstruct
past global temperature averages. Their findings ``confirm that the
so-called Medieval Warm Period did not exist in the form of a
globally synchronous period as warm, or warmer, than today,'' he
said, adding that warm weather seen in that period was apparently
only a regional phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The implications are important. This analysis, along with
several other recent efforts, adds to the evidence that the recent
temperature increases cannot be explained by natural climate
variations, and instead are a clear sign of human influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our study of the Medieval Warm Period supports the likelihood
that no known natural phenomenon can explain the record 20th
century warmth,'' Overpeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent study, published last month in the journal
Nature, reached similar conclusions. It compared the outcomes from
computer simulations of global climate done with and without the
inclusion of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere by human
activities _ chiefly deforestation and the burning of fuel. The
researchers concluded that only these human activities can account
for the kinds of changes in climate that are being seen.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wigley of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, head
of the team that did the study, said last week that contrary to the
claims of some scientists who are skeptical that global warming's
influence can be discerned, the study indicates that no other
factor, such as variations in the sun's output, can account for the
climate changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our analysis says that's not possible,'' Wigley said, while
``human activity can explain all of the variation.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that variations in the sun contribute to climate
changes _ perhaps including a slight warming early this century,
when human activities were less a factor _ but ``that's not enough
to explain'' the kinds of changes seen in recent decades, he said.
``Only in the last 30 years, human influence has become the
dominant factor'' in some global climate patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a rather dangerous turning point,'' Wigley said,
where it is now clear that ``already our influences on climate are
actually the most important factor _ but we're turning up the knob
even further.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Prinn, director of the Center for Global Change Science
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is more cautious,
saying that while it is clear that human production of greenhouse
gases will cause some warming, it is too soon to know how much.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Prinn says, even the best climate models ``do not
simulate natural variations very well.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Prinn adds, ``as far as policy is concerned, we cannot
afford to wait until we see'' clear evidence of humanity's impact,
because the impact of today's fuel burning can persist for decades,
possibly even centuries.
</P>
<P>
   If the world is indeed heading toward the kind of warming
predicted by the most dire of the present computer projections,
then the kind of weather we've been seeing will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we should expect every year to break records from now
on. Trenberth points out that we can still expect considerable
variation because of natural cycles, such as El Nino events, which
contributed to the warmth this year and last. With El Nino gone for
now, he said, ``1999 is unlikely to be as warm as 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   And if next year is indeed cooler, he said, ``it's just a little
wiggle in the overall curve. We'll probably be breaking records
again a few years beyond that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Globe bureaus worldwide were asked about the most pressing
international issues for 1999. Here are their reports:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE UNITED STATES &QL; 
Distracted again? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Washington's new year will be dominated by heated talk of
impeachment, officials from the State Department, Pentagon, White
House, and CIA will concentrate on something else: the crises
brewing overseas in the century's final days.
</P>
<P>
   They have plenty to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian financial meltdown; instability in Russia; the
volatile mix of nuclear development and famine in North Korea;
violence between Israelis and Palestinians; killings in Kosovo;
drug-related corruption in Mexico; fighting in Angola and Congo.
Even reliable Western Europe is engaged in a trade fight with the
United States over _ of all things _ bananas.
</P>
<P>
   That there is conflict abroad is nothing new. But these days,
there is only one referee in the game _ the United States _ and
almost everyone agrees that referee is preoccupied with the fallout
of a White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, Bill Clinton has fashioned himself into a
peacemaker in Haiti, Bosnia, Northern Ireland, and the Mideast. But
Mideast peace is in jeopardy, nuclear weapons are proliferating,
and no one knows whether Clinton can give his undivided attention
to lead.
</P>
<P>
   In an ominous sign, Congress this year threw out the old rules
about conducting foreign policy. Even in the divisive atmosphere of
the Vietnam War, lawmakers limited themselves to criticizing
policies, not the president's motivations or personality. A week
ago, though, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, openly
questioned the timing of the attack on Iraq, which coincided with
the House vote on impeachment. &QL; 
_ DAVID L. MARCUS &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE MIDEAST &QL; 
Statehood for Palestine? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tremors of conflict in the Mideast will reverberate next year
around two epicenters: Jerusalem and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the most immediate concern is the coming April
elections. Israel's Parliament this month called for early
elections, effectively toppling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government. The two leading opponents will be the Labor Party's
Ehud Barak and a recently emerged centrist, Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
who seems to have the most momentum now. But Netanyahu, who has
cobbled together a coalition of far-right ideologues and
disenfranchised Russian and North African Jewish immigrants to
Israel, should not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, May 4 looms dangerously on the horizon. It marks
the end of the five-year period agreed upon by Israelis and
Palestinians to resolve the issues surrounding a historic 1993
peace accord. It also marks the day Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has vowed to declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   If Arafat declares statehood, Netanyahu has said he would
consider all previous peace agreements null and void. This
threatens peace throughout the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, Saddam Hussein's fate remains as perplexing as ever. US
and British bombers launched sustained attacks earlier this month
on Iraq to retaliate for Hussein's blocking of UN weapons
inspectors. And Washington has indicated it is beginning a
longer-term strategy to try to topple Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   How to achieve this is the most vexing question in the region.
With Hussein's brutal regime tightening its grip on power amid the
desperate conditions caused by UN sanctions, the possibility of a
military coup seems remote. The United States has a long way to go
if it is trying to foster rebellion either among the Shiite
population in the south of Iraq or among the Kurdish population in
the north. And many analysts warn that even if a rebellion occurs,
its aftermath could leave Iraq torn apart along ethnic lines and
create a geopolitical vacuum that could destabilize the region. &QL; 
_ CHARLES M. SENNOTT &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RUSSIA &QL; 
Yeltsin staggers to term's end &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The loud rock music still thumps, the woozy clients still sway,
and the dozens of inebriated teenagers at the bar still gyrate to
the music in an impromptu striptease.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Hungry Duck, Moscow's most notorious bar, where
tonight and every night, to borrow a phrase, they're going to party
like it's 1999 _ crisis or not.
</P>
<P>
   As a business, the high-flying Duck is an anomaly in Russia
after the Aug. 17 economic collapse. But in a way, the revelers are
symbolic of a country that still has not come to grips with how
serious its problems are. Ask anyone at the Duck, or anywhere in
Russia, and they will tell you that the situation is bad as always,
but manageable.
</P>
<P>
   It is not. Russia faces a budgetary crisis that could make this
year's meltdown look mild. The budget counts on billions in foreign
aid. But no one knows where that money will come from.
</P>
<P>
   By failing to service its domestic debts and allowing the
collapse of its financial system in August, Russia lost whatever
credibility it had with private investors. Russia stands to default
on the $17 billion it owes the International Monetary Fund. That
would doom Russia's already-low credit rating. With no lending and
little investment, it could be years before Russia gets better.
</P>
<P>
   Few parliamentarians, facing election in December, dare to be
perceived as cost-cutters in a nation tired of hardship. If the
government prints more money to pay its bills, hyperinflation may
cause even more social tension than Russia faces today.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow may still be partying. But 1999 could bring on the big
hangover. &QL; 
_ DAVID FILIPOV &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ASIA &QL; 
Seeking an end to the fallout &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half since the collapse of key Asian economies,
financial instability remains the dominant issue in the region that
is home to 60 percent of the world's people. Some investors are
returning to Asia, believing that markets have bottomed out, but
many economists say the worst is not over.
</P>
<P>
   Next year could bring new attempts to prop up markets, like Hong
Kong did with its $15 billion stock-buying effort last August. If
Japan's economy continues to deflate, it could spark a new crisis
for neighboring economies, with China forced to devaluate its
currency. If Hong Kong then drops its currency peg to the US
dollar, pandemonium would strike Asian stock and property markets
and wealth would evaporate.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment doubling last year in the worst-performing
nations, economist Eddy Lee worries the suffering will rise.
``You'll see it in terms of social unrest and instability knocking
onto political unrest,'' he said. Hong Kong and Singapore, with
higher per capita incomes than much of Europe, should adopt
unemployment insurance to cushion the blow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   China has experienced a wave of unrest and has cracked down on
dissent with arrests and trials. Indonesia is struggling with
democratic reforms, which could be scuttled by a return to military
rule or fundamentalism. Malaysia's economy has contracted, and the
government has quashed political dissent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The political fallout of the Asian economic crisis could be
``that autocratic governments that have failed to bring a
democratic mandate will collapse,'' said Robert McKee, chief
economist at Independent Strategy, a London-based global investment
company. &QL; 
_ INDIRA A. R. LAKSHMANAN &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CANADA &QL; 
Unity through diversity &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, 1999 will probably be a year of political
reconstruction as the beleaguered federal government in Ottawa
seeks ways to placate regional demands for more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec's secessionists will be seeking to breathe fresh life
into a movement that took a hard hit at the polls in November's
provincial elections. Although the separatist Parti Quebecois was
returned to power, the margin of victory fell short of the mandate
Premier Lucien Bouchard had sought to pave the way for another vote
on independence.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of gaining a breathing spell, the uneasy
confederation called Canada is feeling other strains. In an odd
alliance, Quebec has joined forces with fiesty western provinces in
demanding that the federal government relinquish control over a
broad array of social programs.
</P>
<P>
   The new rallying cry of Quebec separatists and conservatives in
English Canada is ``social union,'' a vague but passionately felt
notion that Ottawa should continue shoveling tax money to the
provinces, but must stop dictating how that money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard has suggested that ``social union'' may represent the
last, best chance of keeping the French-speaking province within a
unified Canada. But the result might be a Canada so decentralized
as to hardly count as a country.
</P>
<P>
   _ COLIN NICKERSON &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
EUROPE &QL; 
Coming together at last? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   European bankers are bound to be bullish over the century's end,
provided that the implementation of Europe's single currency goes
smoothly and a dictator doesn't continue to cast too broad a shadow
over the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the European Union's 15 members are taking part in the
first phase of European monetary union, the most ambitious
initiative yet to create a united states of Europe. While the euro
will become the dollar of Europe, it will be virtual money in 1999,
not traded on the street but merely reflected in electronic
transactions as it is gradually phased in.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair has his work cut out for him, trying
to convince a wary Britain that the single European currency is a
good idea. Blair will also have to spend time and political capital
in Northern Ireland, to make sure the peace process he has done so
much to foster does not fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   The coming year also will provide a revealing glimpse of
Franco-German relations. The French, who have led the EU with
Germany for the last two decades, worry that the alliance may
weaken because new German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, is so
preoccupied with domestic problems. Especially telling will be the
ability of the French and British to implement a Dec. 4 declaration
that called for a common European defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case for much of this century, the looming
prospect of renewed violence in the Balkans overshadows every
European capital, which must absorb refugees and deal with the one
person held most responsible for perpetual instability in that
region: Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Like Iraq, Kosovo will be on the lips of every European foreign
minister in 1999, and it will leave a bitter taste.

 &QL; 
AFRICA &QL; 
Stopping continental war &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congo's history this century is about carving things up, about
unlimited riches and their pursuit by foreign interests. Europeans
and Americans did it. Now Africans are doing it.
</P>
<P>
   A rebellion that started five months ago against the fledgling
government of Laurent Kabila in the Democratic Republic of Congo
has turned into Africa's first continental war. Seven countries and
at least three foreign rebel groups are fighting in Congo. Another
seven states are poised on the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Seven summits have failed to bring a cease-fire. Washington now
regards the war as unsolvable.
</P>
<P>
   Solving Congo's conflict means untangling antagonistic foreign
concerns. Rwanda's minority Tutsi-led government, which is fighting
alongside the rebels, regards its involvement as a matter of ethnic
survival. Hutu slaughtered nearly 1 million Tutsi in Rwanda in
1994; many of the Congo rebels are Banyamulenge, Tutsi from eastern
Congo who were denied citizenship by both Kabila and his
predecessor, Mobutu Sese Seko. Uganda, the rebels' other main
sponsor, needs an ally in Rwanda to balance the threat it faces
from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   On the government side, Angolan troops are defending Kabila to
prevent Congo's rebels from linking with its own rebels. Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe backed Kabila, too, and secured lucrative
mining contracts for his close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how long Zimbabwe and Angola can prop up
Kabila,'' said Richard Cornwell, an expert in African conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Angola may be getting close to that point. It faces new fighting
back home, where rebels are rekindling a 35-year civil war. Despite
rising domestic instability, Mugabe refuses to support direct talks
between Kabila and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Cornwell says, a cease-fire is the easy part. If
exhaustion and the new year silence the guns, Africa's stability
will depend on the much larger work of reconstructing Congo after
almost 40 years of post-independence plundering.

</P>
<P>
   Will Hugo Chavez's bark be worse than his bite?
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelans will start getting their answer next year, when the
former colonel begins his first year as president of Latin
America's oldest democracy. Chavez tried unsuccessfully to muscle
his way to power in a coup in 1992, but voters this month put him
in charge the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has promised to dissolve the democratically elected
congress to create a new constituent assembly.
</P>
<P>
   His victory is not an isolated case. Last year, Bolivians
elected General Hugo Banzer as president. Banzer, who ruled the
country during a period of political turmoil from 1971 to 1974,
suspended most political activities and replaced civilian
administrators with military officers.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation offered by specialists for the resurgence of
military figures in Latin America is the growing dissatisfaction
among voters with corrupt civilian governments that have failed to
reduce poverty despite years of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Even in countries with seemingly safe civilian democracies, the
economic uncertainty that rippled through the region in 1998 may
continue to haunt governing parties next year.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, Fernando Henrique Cardoso was reelected president in
October but has been unable to get many reforms through congress.
Record-low oil prices have forced Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
to propose the most severe budget in the country's history, just 18
months before presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   But much of Washington's attention next year will be focused on
Panama, where US troops are scheduled to complete their withdrawal
and hand over the Panama Canal by year's end. &QL;

 &QL; 
UNITED NATIONS &QL; 
Fighting nuclear nightmares &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A generation of US policies designed to limit the spread of the
world's deadliest weapons collapsed with breathtaking swiftness
this year, confounding American nonproliferation experts and
raising the unhappy specter that military force may resurface as a
key deterrent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Cold War's end, the United States has combined
high-tech surveillance techniques with traditional diplomacy and
economic pressure to stop nations from acquiring nuclear,
biological, and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But economic sanctions have done little to restrain nuclear
ambitions. In Iraq, 7 1/2 years of foreign occupation by remote
control cameras and UN weapons inspectors came to an end as US
bombers blew up scores of UN cameras and sensors along with the
weapons facilities they were monitoring. President Clinton said he
would rely on force to contain Iraq's weapons development, and the
Pentagon envisions a new role for tactical nuclear bombs to take
out rogue states in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular post-Cold War fix _ critics call it nuclear
bribery _ collapsed in North Korea this year. In exchange for
Pyongyang's commitment to renounce nuclear weapons, the US pledged
to raise $4 billion to build two ``safe'' nuclear power plants in
North Korea. Frustrated by the slow pace of financing and
Washington's refusal to ease economic sanctions, North Korea has
begun to rebuild its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   A cornerstone of US policy since World War II, the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, also suffered a deadly blow. Angry that
the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and China have failed
to get rid of their own nuclear weapons, India announced its entry
into the nuclear club with an underground test. Rival Pakistan
followed suit. &QL;

FINAL PUSH MAY MAKE HOLIDAYS A SUCCESS FOR RETAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A year ago, post-Christmas sales saved the holiday season for
many retailers. The same could hold true for some merchants in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain hunters have always been out in force on the day after
Christmas, and this year should be no exception. With mild weather
slowing pre-Christmas sales of apparel, many merchants have been
slashing prices since early December. Starting this week they'll be
slashing them even more.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor seems to be adding to the post-Christmas rush.
</P>
<P>
   With consumers so squeezed for time, holiday shopping peaks seem
to come later every year. Now it's gotten to the point where a lot
of shopping _ both in the malls and over the Internet _ spills into
the week after Christmas and even into mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberian Outpost, an Internet retailer of computer hardware,
software, and accessories, is one of several merchants praying for
a cold January.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's very cold outside, and you just got a new computer for
Christmas, the chances are you're thinking about buying software
and games,'' said Louise Cooper, vice president of worldwide
marketing. ``January can be a good month for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Why did on-line shopping explode this holiday season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we've all run out of time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A scarcity of time finally outweighed consumers' fear about
using their credit cards to make on-line purchases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   This shortage of time is having an impact on brick-and-mortar
retailers as well.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, Filene's has seen a steady increase in
the sale of gift certificates, something last-minute shoppers can
buy quickly.
</P>
<P>
   And these gift certificates are often redeemed in the week after
Christmas, said Filene's spokeswoman Regina Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   If consumers are shopping later, many also seem to be focused on
value. For much of the year, many opted to stay out of department
stores and shop instead at places such as Wal-Mart or BJ's
Wholesale Club.
</P>
<P>
   In this vein, the most value-conscious of consumers now try to
outwait retailers, hoping they'll cut prices. And if that means
waiting until after Dec. 25, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this post-Christmas activity, plus the shifts in the
way consumers shop, it's too early to predict how the holiday
season will turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Based on income and stock-market gains and the low unemployment
rate, Massachusetts consumers could be expected to spend 5 to 6
percent more than last year, said Sara Johnson, chief regional
economist for Standard &AMP; Poors DRI, a Lexington forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Gear, vice president of the Retailers Association of
Massachusetts, thinks local consumers will be more frugal. Local
sales should rise 3 percent, but that comes after a 7.5 percent
increase last year. ``If we did only the same as last year'' it
would still be a solid season, Gear said.
</P>
<P>
   With consumers finding different ways to spend their holiday
dollars _ on vacations, for instance, as well as on gifts, it's
becoming harder to make generalities about the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sales gains at department stores ``used to be a good barometer
for the season, but it's not necessarily as predictive now,'' said
Daniel A. Archabal, a retail analyst for the Boston office of the
Arthur Andersen consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably warm weather has hurt some apparel merchants, but
part of the problem among these retailers may be from consumers
shopping somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of buying matching ski parkas for the family, they might
buy a digital camera, some home furnishings, or a computer that
costs less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   When his son was younger, Ed Siskin used to buy holiday gifts in
toy stores; now the chief operating officer of BankBoston Retail
Finance Inc. is going to places such as Circuit City looking for
computer games.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why some traditional toy merchants seem to be
struggling this year while many consumer-electronics chains appear
to be headed for a strong holiday.
</P>
<P>
   According to industry figures, sales of video games and related
products should surge 24 percent this year to $6.3 billion, while
toy sales should rise 2 percent to $20.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the good fortune of some consumer-electronics giants
selling video games has to be taken in context.
</P>
<P>
   Several smaller chains closed their doors in the last year, and
their business is migrating to big chains such as Circuit City and
Best Buy Co., Siskin suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Given such changes, the best way to appraise the holidays is to
sort things out between winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   In general, said Siskin, the ``top tier'' of retailers in most
categories is doing well, but the second tier may be falling
behind.
</P>
<P>
   The one true measure of a retailer's holiday performance is
fourth-quarter earnings, which in most cases won't be released
until February or March.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are heavily dependent on apparel, department stores
should have been hit hard by the warm weather that caused them to
slash prices on winter clothing.
</P>
<P>
   All those discounts should squeeze profits.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at Wall Street analysts' earnings estimates for
department stores doesn't reveal any clear pattern, other than that
discounters seem to be outperforming them.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow J.C. Penney Co. have been slashing their
fourth-quarter estimates left and right, but those who track
Federated Department Stores Inc., operator of the Macy's chain,
have been mostly holding steady, said Charles L. Hill, research
director for First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   And even though about half of the 21 analysts who follow the May
Department Stores Co., which operates Filene's, have cut their
estimates in December, May is still expected to see a profit jump
of nearly 9 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
   And according to First Call estimates, Wal-Mart and Dayton
Hudson Corp., known for its Target discount chain, are both on
track to post double-digit profit gains for the fourth quarter.

THE RESOLUTIONS OF '98 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY THE BOSTON GLOBE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So shocking were the president's deeds, so extreme were his
opponents, so furiously did partisan passions roil the public, that
by the end of '98 some of the nation's most eminent leaders were
questioning whether America's experiment with constitutional
democracy was coming undone.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the Clinton scandals. The year was 1798. John Adams was
in the White House and the United States was undergoing an agony of
political turmoil. It was a bitter time, but it produced two of the
most remarkable statements on liberty and limited government in our
history _ the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were sharply divided over a host of issues that year,
none more so than US-French relations. The Federalists, who
controlled the presidency and both houses of Congress, deeply
mistrusted the French revolutionaries and refused to support them
when France went to war with Britain. Republicans led by Thomas
Jefferson (a former minister to France) were sympathetic to the
French cause, which they identified with America's own revolt
against royal abuse two decades earlier. The Jeffersonians
denounced Adams and the Federalists as ``monarchists'' and
``Tories'' _ denunciations echoed by a growing population of
anti-British immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by Washington's neutrality, France began seizing
American vessels. US diplomats in France were snubbed. A scandal
erupted when agents of the French foreign minister, Talleyrand,
demanded a bribe from President Adams's emissaries. Federalists
were outraged; war fever swept the country. There were rumors that
France was planning an invasion _ and that Vice President
Jefferson, whose Republican supporters were violently condemning
the federal government, would join the invaders and overthrow the
Adams administration.
</P>
<P>
   In this superheated atmosphere, Congress and the president
enacted a package of grotesquely unconstitutional laws. The Alien
Enemies Act empowered the president to jail or expel without trial
any foreigner he deemed ``dangerous to the peace.'' The Sedition
Act prohibited all criticism of federal officials made ``with
intent to defame.'' Just seven years after the ratification of the
First Amendment, editors, printers, and politicians were hauled
into court and sent to prison for the crime of opposing the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson and James Madison _ who called the Sedition Act a
``monster that must forever disgrace its parents'' _ resolved to
strike back. Knowing that a Supreme Court fight would lose (the
bench was dominated by Federalists), they decided instead to attack
through the state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Working with allies in Kentucky and Virginia, Jefferson and
Madison arranged for each state's general assembly to adopt a
statement protesting the new laws. Jefferson drafted the Kentucky
resolution, which was passed on Nov. 16, 1798. Madison wrote the
Virginia resolution, which was adopted on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resolved,'' the Kentucky legislature declared in its opening
paragraph, ``that whensoever the General Government assumes
undelegated powers, its acts are unauthoritative, void, and of no
force.'' Supreme authority in America, it argued, was held not by
the federal government but by the people and the states, and
Congress and the President had only those powers clearly delegated
to them by the Constitution. The Alien and Sedition Acts were
intolerable above all because the federal government had no right
to enact them. In the 20th century, the Tenth Amendment has been
largely ignored, but in the Kentucky Resolution, Jefferson quoted
it repeatedly:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true as a general principle, and is also expressly
declared by one of the amendments to the Constitution, that `the
powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor
prohibited to it by the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people.' '' Nothing in the Constitution
gave federal officials any right to interfere with freedom of
speech or the press, or to exercise any jurisdiction over aliens.
``Therefore, the act of Congress passed on the 14th day of July,
1798 . . . is not law, but is altogether void, and of no effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Resolution was also blunt. Congress and the
president, Madison wrote, have only the powers ``enumerated in that
compact (the Constitution); and that in case of a deliberate,
palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers (ital) not
(unital) granted by the said compact, the states . . . have the
right and are duty bound to interpose for arresting the progress of
the evil.''
</P>
<P>
   These resolutions weren't empty theory. They were a forceful
defense of freedom, and a reminder that when governments are
allowed to infringe the liberty of A, it is only a matter of time
before they move on to B's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The friendless alien has indeed been selected as the safest
subject of a first experiment,'' declared the Kentucky resolution,
``but the citizen will soon follow _ or rather has already
followed, for already has a Sedition Act marked him as its prey.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson and Madison were fearful of allowing power to be
concentrated in the central government. They won the battle:
Americans came to hate the Alien and Sedition Acts, and the
Federalists were thrown out in the election of 1800. But did they
win the war? In our day, the federal government has grown
monstrous, strangling Americans' freedom through endless
regulations, restrictions, and taxes. The bicentennial of the
Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions reminds us how much we have lost
_ and points the way to win it back.

WORKAHOLICS OUT OF BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON BASS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Katherine Sanchez lived for her job. By the time she was 32,
Sanchez, who had not gone to college, had worked her way up from
receptionist to office manager of the Oakland branch of a national
elevator service company. She wrote reports, planned meetings,
supervised the secretaries, and was happy to work late when her
bosses needed her.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was, in short, the ideal employee, according to those
who know her: a competent worker who gave her all to the job. But
when her boss suddenly took her title away _ and with it some of
her responsibilities, Sanchez went into an emotional tailspin. She
felt betrayed by people she had once called friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stop crying on the way to work; I felt they had
stripped me of my dignity,'' recalls Sanchez, who finally left her
job a year later and was out of work for three years. ``For nine
months, I didn't go out of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's breakdown may be an extreme example. But in this era
of downsizing, as more men and women feel compelled to work longer
and longer hours, psychologists and workplace consultants say her
experience is part of a growing phenomenon: a culture of highly
competent worker bees who derive almost all their emotional
sustenance from the relationships they build at the workplace and
are devastated when that community doesn't live up to their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Many male executives, of course, have always invested heavily in
their work, often to the point of ignoring their families, until
they become ill, or their wives unexpectedly ask for a divorce.
What's new about this phenomenon, say psychologists and
consultants, is its emergence among women workers and on so many
job levels _ secretaries, bank tellers, computer programmers,
business managers, and professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people, work has become their only source of
connection, of human community,'' says Ilene Philipson, a Berkeley
psychologist who studied this phenomenon among a group of 110
working women, including Sanchez, and reported her findings at a
recent work/family conference in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   None of the women Philipson studied had prior psychiatric
histories; none had even been to a psychotherapist. Most had worked
all their adult lives, in some cases taking time off only for brief
maternity leaves.
</P>
<P>
   These women, Philipson says, were pursuing a work ethic that
companies today encourage. As workplace consultants will tell you,
it is the people who invest most heavily in their jobs _ they are
the first to arrive at work, the last to leave, and they log on to
their computers at home _ who are most often viewed by employers as
MVWs _ most valuable workers.
</P>
<P>
   And it is precisely those workers who feel the most cheated or
betrayed when something goes wrong on the job, psychologists and
human resource managers find. They are also the ones whose
disillusionment can cause their output to plummet or plunge them
into depression and long-term sick leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workaholics are not resilient workers,'' says Rosalind
Barnett, a psychologist at Brandeis and Radcliffe and coauthor of
``He/She Works.'' In several large studies, Barnett has found that
people who occupy multiple roles in the home, community, or
workplace are hardier psychologically than those who invest all
their time and energies in just one role.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men and women can better withstand the vicissitudes of
any one role because they have others to sustain them. So to the
extent that companies encourage a long work-hour culture, they are
defeating themselves,'' Barnett adds.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Ellis has seen this at play in her job as manager of
work/life programs for Sikorsky Aircraft Co., a helicopter
manufacturer in Stratford, Conn. ``The people who feel most cheated
when things don't go right are the ones who put in a lot of time,''
Ellis says. ``They say, `I've given up so much of my life, you at
least owe me a promotion or work that I want to do.' There is often
a huge disconnect in expectations between these workers and the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   In the most extreme cases, a sense of betrayal among troubled
workaholic men can end in violence, with disgruntled workers
shooting former employers and coworkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who react that way are so invested in their work
identity that when they don't have work to bolster their identity,
they hurt themselves or they hurt someone else,'' says Jonas
Goldenberg, who works with troubled employees as part of his job as
a social worker for an employee assistance program that contracts
with Boston area companies. ``But that is the extreme end of a
continuum that includes a great number of people who are invested
in their work to the detriment of involvement with their families
or outside interests.''
</P>
<P>
   A scattering of companies are making a concerted effort to
provide employees with tools to help them better balance their
lives. At Sikorsky Aircraft a few months ago, Ellis ran a ``life
designs'' workshop that prodded employees to examine their lives
and reorganize their priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But many employers are slow to recognize this emerging reality,
she and others say. The hidden cost can be found in the rise in
worker's compensation claims filed because of work-related stress
or depression and in the booming business that outplacement firms
are doing despite a robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons that outplacement businesses are booming is
because many of them spend time building people's egos back up and
letting them know they are not bad people just because they've lost
their jobs,'' says Deborah Swiss, a Boston area management
consultant and author of the book, ``Women Breaking Through.''
``People today have a huge amount of ego invested in their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is where you spend most of your time so for many of us;
the relationships at work tend to take on more emotional meaning
than the ones at home. It's where your heart is,'' says William
Pollack, a psychologist and principal in Spectrum Organizational
Executive Development, a psychological consulting firm in
Brookline. ``So if something bad happens at work, it's like your
spouse has divorced you or your mother and father have abandoned
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Work, of course, can be highly rewarding, even therapeutic, and
many people, particularly professionals who are in control of what
they do, can juggle extremely long hours without putting too many
emotional eggs in the office basket.
</P>
<P>
   But, psychologists say, there is a growing group of workaholics
who are at particular risk: men and women who don't have solid ties
to family, friends, or activities outside of work. For many of
these people, the company has replaced traditional institutions
such as family, church, the Rotary or PTO in fulfilling their needs
for recognition and community.
</P>
<P>
   This shift has been especially dramatic for women, as more and
more enter the paid work force. For many women, work has become the
center of their lives, ``a place of intrigue, gossip, friendships,
and jealousies,'' Philipson says.
</P>
<P>
   It provides an emotional landscape more real than any place
else.
</P>
<P>
   Work filled that need for Katherine Sanchez. A third-generation
Mexican-American whose parents both worked, Sanchez went to work as
soon as she graduated from high school. She took only brief
maternity leaves when she had her two children. After working in a
series of doctors' offices as a receptionist, Sanchez says, she
landed the job with the elevator company in her late 20s and began
working her way up.
</P>
<P>
   This job, Sanchez says, was going to be her ticket to corporate
America. So she gave it her all, routinely working more than 40
hours a week, staying late to finish last-minute assignments, and
filling in for other secretaries who were out sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the more I gave, the better I would look,'' Sanchez,
now 42, recalls. ``I poured myself into my job.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough. After nine years with the company, the
branch manager whom she thought was a friend unexpectedly took away
Sanchez' title two months after she had been given a raise, she
says. Her boss told her she needed to be ``humbled,'' Sanchez says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was devastated,'' says Sanchez, adding that even her divorce
a few years earlier had not hit her as hard. ``I felt dead at work.
I had trusted these people and they betrayed me. To this day, I
have trouble trusting other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez says she was eventually referred to Philipson, who began
seeing her in group therapy and encouraged her to file a workers
compensation claim for work-related stress. She won the claim and
began a disability leave. She never went back to that job.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez now works for herself; she owns a secretarial
transcription service. The pressures to work long hours and please
clients are still there, she says, but she has learned how to
decline a job when it conflicts with her family time (her children
are now 14 and 12). And she has also become active in her
neighborhood, helping the police implement community policing and
improve relations with Hispanic residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been so wrapped up in work I didn't know how to be a
mom,'' Sanchez says. ``But as far as my kids are concerned, we're
all stronger for it. They see how important it is not to make your
job your identity.''

UNFAITHFUL SERVANTS, UNFAITHFUL SELVES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When pornographer Larry Flynt appears to take the moral high
ground by outing politicians for extramarital affairs, we are in a
very strange place indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives' speaker-elect, Republican Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, was only the first victim of Flynt's
campaign to out philandering legislative leaders by offering
informants a $1 million reward. The publisher of Hustler magazine
promises more exposes _ perhaps as many as a dozen _ very soon.
</P>
<P>
   When Livingston abandoned both the imminent speakership and his
seat because he was forced to confess marital infidelities, he put
the sex issue on the table in a way that President Clinton's
dalliance with Monica S. Lewinsky never did. The resignation raised
the possibility that politicians will, by their own estimation,
have to pass the ``adultery test'' to serve.
</P>
<P>
   So changed is the atmosphere that some politicians _ Dan Quayle
among them _ felt compelled last week to boldly proclaim they can
``pass'' the test. So changed, that now reasonable people debate
whether marital fidelity is a requisite for being a good
politician.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot of talk about adultery, but somewhat less
light shed on what we really know about the act that can destroy a
career as well as a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Many people believe that a majority of Americans are unfaithful
during their marriages. But that impression comes from studies
drawn on a less-than-representative sampling.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, not as many people commit adultery as one might think.
In a 1994 University of Chicago study _ considered to be the most
accurate of its kind _ reseachers surveyed a representative sample
of the population by asking more than 3,000 people between the ages
of 18 and 59 about sex. The survey found that 25 percent of all
married men and about 15 percent of married women acknowledged
having an affair at some point in their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The findings differed among the various age groups surveyed.
Some 37 percent of the men born in the decade between 1933 and 1942
had at least one affair, says Edward Laumann, a University of
Chicago sociologist who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Laumann also found that more than 90 percent of the respondents
said an extramarital affair was morally wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``truth'' about adultery: Politicians are more inclined
to infidelity than the rest of us. Laumann's survey found that
``physical vitality, sexual interest, social competence, and social
opportunity are the things that drive sexual expression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians,'' he says, ``are obviously selected for their
social competence, and if their sexual interest is high, the social
opportunity is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Washington and Hollywood are the two US cities with
the most macho culture and desirable, powerful men who are
surrounded by women, says John Gagnon, professor emeritus of
sociology at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, who
also worked on the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Kissinger said power is the greatest aphrodisiac and he
should know,'' Gagnon says.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, those factors may partially explain the
extramarital affairs of President Clinton, Livingston, and a host
of others, known and unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another ``truth'' about adultery that goes against what
many believe: It doesn't make you happy. Adultery is immensely
painful and destructive to those involved; Laumann's study found
that people in multiple-partner relationships had substantially
lower rates of physical and emotional satisfaction, but the
researchers could not determine if the discontent was the cause or
result of the infidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring public views on adultery is not a simple matter.
Although the topic is in the news (now more than ever), it is not
something most of us care to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we disapprove of it, it is not something that most of us
inquire about,'' Gagnon says. ``There is nothing proactive about
it. If it involves your neighbors, your pharmacist, or your doctor,
that is their business and we tend not to bring our moral judgments
about this into the world in which we live.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, the mainstream press went along with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time I was in government, there were stories around,
but they were always in the supermarket tabloids,'' says Thomas H.
Kean, the former Republican governor of New Jersey who left office
in 1990. ``Now, we have the type of atmosphere where Tom Brokaw,
The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Boston Globe feel
they have to print them. And I am not sure the American public
wants to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, there is no indication that the
mainstream press is about to back off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, things are out of hand,'' says Sanford Ungar, dean
of the School of Communications at American University in
Washington. ``I think a whole lot of us would never have gone into
journalism if we thought it was about being on the adultery beat.
But it is like we are bicyclists on a velodrome and we can't stop,
we can only slow down very gradually and, right now, we are racing
at top speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The event that pointed the way to the velodrome was Democratic
presidential hopeful Gary Hart's 1987 challenge to reporters to
follow him around to see if he was having an affair. Some reporters
from the Miami Herald took up the gauntlet, found Donna Rice, and
the former Colorado senator's campaign quickly went south.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, politicians hold their families up as an
example of their fitness for office. It is, says Gagnon, a strategy
employed only here.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in other Western nations have affairs without so much
as blinking an eye. To them, remaining faithful to your spouse is
almost a sign of a stunted life. Consider the example of French
President Francois Mitterand, father to two sons from his marriage
_ and a daughter by his mistress some 20 years earlier. French
voters thought nothing of it.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the flap Jimmy Carter caused in his Playboy magazine
interview in 1976 when he stated that he had committed adultery in
his heart many times? He didn't say he had affairs, just that lust
was no stranger to him _ but it was enough to land him in hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the public has been growing more forgiving it seems, and
has been inclined to forgive Clinton his foibles, indeed,
practically ignore his impeachment, in exchange for the peace and
prosperity that has coincided with his residence in the Oval
Office. Then along came Flynt and Livingston, whose actions seem to
tip the balance back toward the ``adultery test'' standard.
</P>
<P>
   An unabashed Clinton supporter who blames the president's
Republican attackers for initiating this scandal war, Flynt
announced his $1 million bounty in October in a full-page ad in The
Washington Post. He said he wants to expose the hypocrisy of
Washington's movers and shakers, not of ``a freshman congressman or
an unknown from Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Former CIA and FBI agents at an unspecified Washington private
detective firm, working on Flynt's behalf, are tracking down tips
on congressmen who have strayed. The women involved are being asked
to provide affidavits. Flynt said his initial round of suspects is
almost all Republican, including what he described as one ``really,
really big fish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several more who are going to bite the dust before
this is over,'' Flynt said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the White House _ in comments that perhaps
inadvertently gave Flynt's efforts an extra measure of importance _
publicly urged him to stop his pursuit. ``The president despises
the politics of personal destruction that Larry Flynt and others
practice,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said. ``He believes it
should stop.''
</P>
<P>
   But will it? Gagnon believes that it will take someone running
for office and saying, `` `I am qualified for this position because
of these reasons and my family life has nothing to do with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   If not, then, given the current climate, who will want to take
the adultery test?
</P>
<P>
   That type of inquisition ``could lead to the potential of having
very bland people _ or 10-year-old people _ running for office,''
Ungar says.
</P>
<P>
   Kean, who is now president of Drew University in Madison, N.J.,
is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a young honor student in my office last week,'' Kean
said. ``He is going on to an Ivy League graduate school and he said
to me `I always thought of myself as someone who had a future in
government and I don't think that is true anymore.' '' He doesn't
want to choose a career, Kean sensed, in which his every personal
move would be subject to scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not helping the process,'' Kean said, ``and I have a
very strong feeling the future of democracy depends on the people
we get to serve it.''

GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF SPLIT STATUE

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTALYA, Turkey _ The marble stump stands apart at the entrance
of this archeological museum, labeled by the sort of historical
plaque people here have come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   On a kiosk, visitors have scribbled angry graffiti: ``Boston --
Give it back now!'' and ``Stop crime in archeology!'' Tacked up
nearby at the Antalya Museum are more signs explaining the plight
of this lonesome half-statue, whose upper half is nestled in Boston
inside the Museum of Fine Arts, and whose story is one of many in
the international catalog of illegally smuggled works.
</P>
<P>
   According to Turkish officials and other archeological experts,
the two pieces of the ``Weary Herakles'' were not separated in some
ancient war or earthquake. Instead, they say, the top half was
plundered by a group of thieves near an excavation site in southern
Turkey in 1980, smuggled across the border, and, ultimately, sold
to the husband-wife team of American collectors Leon Levy and
Shelby White, who then donated a half-share to the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, it went on display at the New York Metropolitan Museum
of Art in an exhibit called ``Glories of the Past,'' featuring
treasures belonging to Levy and White. That was when it drew
notoriety. That December, Connoisseur magazine published an article
that revealed the startling match of the bottom half several
thousand miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Then yet another split occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Because even as experts began comparing remarkable photographs
of the two halves _ and as Turkish officials were asking a New York
law firm to begin inquiries into the matter _ the collectors and
the MFA were offering a stream of arguments defending their right
to own the marble bust. Today, it is still in their possession,
despite years of legal wrangling, although the man who was curator
of the MFA classical art department at the time it was acquired
admits the pieces are part of a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now clearly recognized that the `Weary Herakles' fits
together to form a complete statue,'' Cornelius C. Vermeule III,
who ran the department for four decades, said in an interview
earlier this month. ``Things wander, turn up in different
collections all over the world. It's the same with the things from
the Parthenon.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a far cry from the position the curator took in 1990,
when the link between the two halves was first suspected.
Confronted with evidence about the bust's origin, Vermeule said in
an interview with The New York Times that year that it was unlikely
the two would match.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many `Weary Herakles','' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   According to archeology experts, that much is true; around 150
A.D., when the disputed statue was most likely made, many artisans
devoted their skills to replicating the Herakles design originated
in the 4th century B.C., by the famous sculptor Lyssipos of Sicyon.
Such duplicates, which would have been bath or theater decorations
in their day, often turn up in excavation sites in southern Turkey,
and they are not, at least by comparison, extraordinarily rare.
</P>
<P>
   But they do belong to Turkey, according to Turkish officials,
who say Turkish laws and the US agreement to comply with the UNESCO
treaty require the top half be returned.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Turkish officials spent several years wrangling
with the American owners over whether the pieces were truly of the
same statue. Vermeule insisted down to every detail that they were
different, even claiming he could spot a separate belly button on
each. Finally, in 1992, Cultural Minister Enzin Ozgen decided to
settle the matter by sending a plaster cast of the Turkish half of
the statue to the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   Under the close watch of scholars _ and attorneys _ the plaster
cast was fitted. Thomas Hoving, former director of the
Metropolitan, said it ``fit like a hand to glove.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like having a bunch of fingerprints plastered all over
the place,'' Hoving said in an interview earlier this month. ``It
is so clear. There's no mistaking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that concrete evidence, however, the MFA and White and
Levy resisted cooperating, Ozgen said. Now, their argument is that
although the pieces do match, the top half was acquired some other
way besides illegal smuggling. Malcolm Rogers, the MFA's director,
issued a statement that ``the MFA believes that the `Weary
Herakles' was legally and properly acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has refused repeated Globe requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule also now says the top half, on display at the MFA,
could have been excavated ``any time since the Italian
Renaissance.'' Turkish law protects only artifacts smuggled out
after 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Laws aside, Ozgen says he has been rebuffed not only by the MFA
but also by Levy and White, despite several offers to reunite the
statue and share the whole.
</P>
<P>
   In one exchange, an elderly Turkish archeologist, Jale Inan, was
so distraught over the statue that she planned a hunger strike on
the steps of the MFA, Ozgen said. When White heard about the plan,
she called Ozgen at home, furious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `If you ever dare to conduct a hunger strike in
front of the museum, I will have all the Armenians demonstrate
against Turkey in front of the consulate,' '' Ozgen said.
</P>
<P>
   The hunger strike was canceled. In the years since, Turkey has
kept up negotiations with the MFA, Levy, and White, despite
Turkey's increasing tendency to file lawsuits against suspected
owners of illegal plunder. Even now, according to the attorney for
Turkey, Lawrence M. Kaye, ``Hopefully, the matter will be resolved
out of court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if not,'' he said, ``the Republic will institute
appropriate proceedings to recover it.''

   BOSTON _ Helping patients laugh can be a great way to help them
heal.
</P>
<P>
   It also can be a great way for doctors to get in trouble in
these days of micro-managed medicine, political correctness, and a
love-to-litigate society. Just how much trouble became clear last
summer when a patient at New England Medical Center who lost 300
pounds sued a physician she says placed a rubber pig nose on her to
advertise the weight-loss program.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is why doctors are likely to applaud the spirit, if
not the specifics, of Robin Williams's movie ``Patch Adams,''
according to a collection of Boston health care providers who saw
the movie. It tells the true story of a misfit medical student who
a generation ago risked his career by promoting the then-unheard-of
notion that humor is a key to healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humor is a form of engagement, of empathy, it's endearing,''
said Dr. Gene Beresin, who runs the child and adolescent
psychiatric residency program at Massachusetts General and McLean
hospitals. ``I use humor to make fun of the system, like Robin
Williams did when he put on a Pinocchio nose, then said that the
hospital would take care of all of that patient's health bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deeb Salem, chief of medicine at New England Medical Center,
also is a big believer in making his patients laugh, but the pig
nose lawsuit has made him wary about when, how and by whom it is
used: ``I truly believe humor has a place in medicine, but great
care has to be given today because of being afraid not to offend
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more basic principle, whether it's humor or anything else,
is to ask after every contact with a patient, `Have I done what I
can to make them feel better after I've talked to them than they
did before?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Delbanco has devoted much of his career to getting his
fellow practitioners to ask that question. But he's convinced the
new movie is likelier to set back than advance the discussion. ``I
think it will promote negative stereotypes of doctors and make
patients who already are frightened enough even more frightened of
the medical establishment,'' says Delbanco, the chief of general
and primary care medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mark of a real sense of humor is the ability to laugh at
oneself, but Robin Williams in this film laughed at everybody but
himself. He laughed at mentally ill patients, he laughed at fat
black nurses and snotty Southern doctors and many of his peers.
That's the way to sell movies but not to move the world forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of medicine was a much different place in the late
1960s and early 70s, when the real-life Adams was attending the
Medical College of Virginia. He'd been inspired to become a doctor
when he was institutionalized for depression as a teenager, but
medical school convinced him that doctors were spending too much
time treating their patients's diseases and too little getting to
know them as people.
</P>
<P>
   His remedy: dress up in a gorilla suit, don a red nose, fill a
patient's room full of balloons or their bathtub full of noodles,
and do whatever else it took to get a guffaw and, more important,
to connect emotionally with whomever he was treating. All of which
was a hit with many patients, but not with his conservative school
in that more conservative era.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to today, when doctors face decidedly different
challenges. On the one hand, our tightly-managed approach to
medicine often works against such sensitivity by giving doctors
less time to spend with patients even as today's political
correctness makes them worried about offending anyone and even
getting sued. At the same time, tuning in to patients' emotional,
psychological and spiritual needs is talked about more, taught more
and practiced more, both because health care providers understand
its importance and because they know it's an effective way to
compete for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch's red nose is a metaphor for making a human connection,
and that does happen today. Is it something you can teach? It is
something you can encourage but I don't think you can teach it,''
says Terry Schraeder, a former medical reporter for WCVB-Channel 5
who is now a fourth-year student at Tufts Medical School, where the
real Adams delivered an inspirational lecture two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sort of essence of human connection that certain
doctors have . . . Most doctors don't have a red bulb on the end of
their nose and buttons on their jacket, but when they go in and
touch a patient's child, or talk to the patient, the interaction is
so human. It's honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Chunhan Zhu, who practices acupuncture and Chinese herbal
medicine in Newton, says that sort of human interaction has always
been a cornerstone of complementary medicine. ``Some doctors may
not like this movie,'' he adds, ``but from my point of view this
movie makes sense for someone practicing holistic or alternative
medicine . . . A healer uses unlimited methods to make patients
healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herb Levine, emeritus chairman of cardiology at New England
Medical Center and a physician noted for his human touch, says
conventional medicine places much more premium on patient
communication than it did when he trained in the late 1950s. But it
still has a long way to go in applying the lessons Patch Adams is
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch's message is such an important one that it's OK that it
is conveyed with hyperbole,'' Levine adds. ``There's not enough
humor today on the wards and at the bedside. It's a very effective
tool.''

 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was just a year ago that the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts turned aside a public demand from the government of Guatemala
to return scores of pre-Columbian artifacts that had been looted
from ancient Mayan grave sites in that country.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the museum argued that the artifacts entered the
United States legally between 1974 and 1981 _ before the MFA
committed itself in 1983 to international standards designed to
curb the widespread plundering of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since 1984, the MFA has acquired scores of Greek and Roman
antiquities that have no record of prior ownership, according to a
Globe inquiry. That is a dead giveaway, scholars say, that most of
the objects were illegally excavated and smuggled, mainly from
Italy, in the 14 years since the museum says it has abandoned
dealings in the illicit market.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artifacts are three valuable Greek vases, commonly
found in 2,300-year-old grave sites in the Apulian section of
southeastern Italy. In a telltale admission, the museum described
the three vases as among a ``host'' of newly discovered artifacts
in a 1993 book it published on the MFA's ancient Greek vases.
</P>
<P>
   With assistance from several classical scholars, the Globe
focused on the origin of 71 classical artifacts that were donated
or sold to the MFA by outsiders from mid-1984 to mid-1987. Only 10
of the 71 items have any recorded ownership history, or provenance.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 61 objects, including the three valuable vases
cited in the MFA volume, have no pedigree at all, strong
circumstantial evidence that most of them had been recently
unearthed by grave robbers, according to archeologists.
</P>
<P>
   For the MFA, the findings underscore the institution's
continuing challenge _ how to reconcile the august image it
projects with persistent questions about the integrity of its
collecting practices.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other major museums, scholars say, the MFA cannot
argue that it was unaware that it was acquiring valuable objects
that were most likely removed recently from the ground. Even one of
the MFA's major benefactors told the Globe the museum often turned
a blind eye to evidence the artifacts had dubious origins. And two
of its dealers said they cannot vouch for the origin of some of the
objects they sold the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Alan Shestack, who was the MFA's director from 1987 to
1994, acknowledged last week that during his tenure the museum took
insufficient steps to ensure that its acquisitions had not been
looted. ``We were not as rigorous as we might have been in those
days,'' Shestack said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Shestack said, questions were seldom raised about
the origin of undocumented artifacts the MFA was acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Shestack at odds with the current MFA director,
Malcolm Rogers. Rogers has said he has no misgivings about the
classical antiquities the museum obtained that came with no
ownership history. Unlike Shestack, Rogers has repeatedly refused
to discuss the MFA's collecting ethics.
</P>
<P>
   For the museum, which Rogers recently described as New England's
preeminent cultural institution, the Guatemalan and classical
acquisitions are bookends on a troublesome year. To the MFA's
critics, the two cases underscore the extent to which the MFA, and
some of its peer institutions, are ethically tone deaf and
oblivious to rapidly shifting international standards.
</P>
<P>
   With increasing frequency, countries like Turkey, Italy, and
poverty-stricken Guatemala are pressing legal claims against major
museums _ sometimes with help from the US government. At the same
time, officials in countries that sit atop ancient cultures have
ratcheted up accusatory rhetoric that ``Western elites'' are guilty
of cultural imperialism, colonialism, and racism for preying on
grave sites in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   As for the MFA, even some of the dealers the museum has
purchased artifacts from acknowledged that the antiquities market
is far from pristine.
</P>
<P>
   For example, two of New York's best-known dealers who have sold
classical artifacts to the MFA, Torkom Demirjian and Jerome M.
Eisenberg, admitted that they sometimes have no way of knowing
whether the objects they sell to collectors and museums were
recently plundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no tag on any piece saying, `I am legally excavated
and legally exported,' '' Eisenberg said in an interview. Asked,
for instance, about a dozen undocumented artifacts that came to the
MFA after being sold by Sotheby's and Christie's, the two major
auction houses, Eisenberg said: ``If you buy it at auction without
a provenance, it was probably illegally excavated.''
</P>
<P>
   Demirjian, who was the dealer in one celebrated case involving
looted artifacts and is a passionate critic of laws that inhibit
the antiquities trade, said he does not believe that artifacts he
has sold or donated to the MFA had been recently looted. But, he
added, ``It wouldn't matter to me if they were illegally
excavated.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who has been the MFA director since 1994, turned down
repeated requests for an interview _ a posture he adopted after the
Globe reported last December that the MFA acquired the
pre-Columbian artifacts even though its attorney knew they had been
illegally removed from Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers would respond only to inquiries in writing. But his
responses often sidestepped the questions posed by the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   To many scholars, the evidence is compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that there is a pattern by the MFA of
acquiring looted material that was illegally excavated in Italy,''
said Boston University archeologist Murray C. McClellan. ``They
have not lived up to their own standards, and they have to be
called to account for that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rogers, others who have dealt with the MFA were more
willing to discuss its acquisitions. One MFA benefactor, who has
had extensive dealings with its classical department over the
years, said the MFA has taken artifacts from him knowing they had
been looted.
</P>
<P>
   When the department ``sees a piece they really want, the
provenance doesn't become as important as it should be,'' said the
benefactor, who discussed the issue on condition that his name not
be used.
</P>
<P>
   The benefactor, though he said he does not deal directly with
smugglers, said the dealers he buys from do. But over the years, he
said, the museum's classical department cared little where the
piece originated _ unless the acquisition was ``likely to create a
fuss.'' On some pieces, he added, the MFA was complicit in helping
to alter provenance information to make the objects appear to be
clean.
</P>
<P>
   But McClellan, who is hopeful the museum can be persuaded to
change course and abide by its ethical code and international
conventions, described the allegedly illicit acquisitions as
``willful ignorance, not a conscious conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan and other classical archeologists who looked over the
Boston museum's acquisitions expressed chagrin about many of the
pieces, saying the evidence, though circumstantial, strongly
suggests the artifacts were looted in recent years from sites in
the Mediterranean, most of them in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the objects with no provenance are numerous vessels from
Apulia, marble busts, and a Greek vase that originated in Tuscany.
Another piece with no pedigree is a rare Mycenaean terracotta idol
from about 1,300 B.C. that McClellan called ``one of the most
important pieces of religious art of the Second Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had not been looted, and we knew where it came from, it
would be world-famous for its historical significance. As it is,
it's merely a curiosity in a corner of the museum,'' McClellan
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Public attention to the MFA's acquisition of antiquities comes
amid growing international focus on cultural property issues,
tougher laws in source countries, and UN-led international
conventions intended to curb the widespread plunder for profit that
has decimated ancient sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit have been countries like Guatemala, Italy, Greece,
Turkey, and poor nations in Africa, such as Mali. Also vulnerable
have been war-torn nations like Iraq, Cambodia, Afghanistan, and
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But the outcry, led by archeologists, has been countered, often
in heated debate, by some museums, dealers, and collectors who
insist that laws against the antiquities trade are unreasonably
harsh, leading to a thriving black market that prompts some museums
to mask the origin of their acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, countries such as Italy and Greece, lacking
evidence pointing to the precise site where an object was looted,
seldom press claims. And US legislation in 1983 that implemented
the UN agreement contains loopholes that protect collectors and
museums from forfeiture laws. Some judges, though, have begun to
pay greater deference to the notion that objects looted abroad can
be classified as stolen property in American courts, a trend that
has unsettled the museum world.
</P>
<P>
   Most museums, including the MFA, have adopted guidelines since
1970 that recognize the legal right of countries like Italy and
Turkey to protect ancient grave sites, an obligation that Shestack
advocated in a speech in 1986, the year before he took the MFA's
helm.
</P>
<P>
   Shestack argued then that museums, by continuing to acquire
problematic antiquities, ``would not only be risking our
reputation, but would be encouraging or at least seeming to be
encouraging, or winking at, illicit activity in the international
art market.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was on Shestack's watch, from 1987 to 1994, that the MFA
acquired many of the classical antiquities that archeologists say
were probably taken from grave sites in Italy. Others have been
acquired since Rogers took his place. They include some 7th century
B.C. cups from burial grounds near Rome that raised suspicions at
the MFA, but were nonetheless accepted in 1996 _ a gift from a
longtime overseer.

FOUR PROPOSALS FOR DEALING WITH MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US Department of Justice lawyers have presented an unusually
strong case that Microsoft's abuse of its monopoly power requires
some kind of remedial action. Assume for a moment that the
government wins its antitrust case against Microsoft. What happens
next?
</P>
<P>
   The literal answer, of course, is that Microsoft will appeal.
The company's chances of winning are not bad. As TheStreet.com
columnist Jim Seymour wrote recently, The same US Court of Appeals
panel that has already ruled in favor of Microsoft twice in
pretrial maneuvering is probably going to hear the appeal. And that
body has already made it clear it doesn't think Microsoft has
broken the law.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also possible that presiding Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, after finding in favor of the government, will certify the
case directly to the US Supreme Court. Should that happen, all bets
would be off. Microsoft's strategy of losing now but winning on
appeal would be out the window. And the question of what to do
about Microsoft would loom larger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   It is extraordinarily important _ to the software and computer
industries, the future development of the Internet and, therefore,
the global economy _ that whatever remedial actions are proposed
lead to greater competition and innovation in information
technologies. It would be a disaster if they did not.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the options? There are basically four:
</P>
<P>
   --Microsoft could be levied with a gigantic fine for its
transgressions and be admonished in no uncertain terms. Since
Microsoft has $17 billion in cash, no debt, and a negative attitude
toward government edicts, this solution is a nonstarter. Consumers
would not benefit. Competition and innovation in information
technologies would not be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   --Some kind of regulatory structure could be established to
oversee Microsoft and the software industry in general. This is a
frightening prospect. The idea that thousands of government
busybodies would be making critical decisions about the future of
information technologies gives anybody a case of the willies. As
Fortune magazine columnist Stewart Alsop wrote recently, the likely
effect would be to turn Windows into an even worse product.
</P>
<P>
   --Break up Microsoft into some number of companies comprised of
its component parts. Microsoft One might be the Operating Systems
company (Windows, NT, CE). Microsoft Two might be the Applications
Software company (Word, Excel, Money and Outlook). Microsoft Three
might be the Media Company (Internet Explorer, etc.) Microsoft
Network, etceteras) You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for this idea, writes Alsop, is that this would
prevent the company from using market power in one arena to win
market power in another. But this solution would not encourage
innovation or competition in either operating systems or
productivity applications. Microsofts One and Two would still enjoy
monopolies. To make matters worse, the law of unintended
consequences would deliver a huge kicker. The newly capitalized
mini-Microsofts would be even richer (relatively speaking) than
they were when they were bundled together as Microsoft. Wall Street
would throw money at Microsoft One and Microsoft Two. Rational
investors wouldn't even think about funding companies that offered
competitive operating system and applications software. Theyd be
throwing money out the window.
</P>
<P>
   --The fourth option is Alsop's idea and merits serious
consideration. He proposes that the government take away the
intellectual-property protection Microsoft enjoys on its monopoly
products. Companies (and individuals), he explains, are allowed to
own certain intellectual property copyrights and patents
exclusively for a period of time. The idea is that this will
provide these companies or individuals with the freedom to develop
new ideas and be creative.
</P>
<P>
   Alsop proposes that government take away this exclusivity in
cases when it no longer provides an incentive for innovation, when
instead it becomes a way to prevent competition. It's clear that
we'd all be better off with other companies providing versions of
Windows that work with all the software out there. The competition
would keep Microsoft honest, and we'd get a better product as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of is that this proposal would almost certainly
require some kind of government regulatory commission. The upside
is that it would lead to genuine competition in the software
industry and enable a great deal of creative thinking. Venture
capital would flood into the operating-systems market and the
applications market in the same way it now floods the Internet
market. Consumers would be the real beneficiaries. One hopes that
Alsop's proposal gets the attention it deserves.

`DELTA' IS WARM IF A LITTLE SLOW-MOVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
DOWN IN THE DELTA 
Directed by: Maya Angelou 
Screenplay by: Myron Goble 
Starring: Alfre Woodard, Al Freeman, Jr., Esther Rolle, Mary Alice,
Loretta Devine, Anne-Marie Johnson, Mpho Koaho, Justin Lord, Wesley
Snipes 
Running time: 111 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (drug-related material) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta,'' Maya Angelou's film directing debut,
strongly establishes her ability to command emotional authenticity
and fashion rich, beautifully wrought images that tap into the
stabilizing dignity of family life. Essentially, it's a story of
reverse migration as a means of keeping a family together. The
Chicago branch, headed by Mary Alice's matriarch, originally came
north from Mississippi to better themselves economically. But now
things have soured.
</P>
<P>
   The grandchildren are hanging on, but their single mother,
played by Alfre Woodard, is sliding into a slow death from drugs,
alcohol, and an inability to land a decent job. Although her mother
and preteen son bawl her out, there's no labeling of Woodard's
Loretta, just a humane acknowledging that there's more facing her
than she can cope with. Her mother, feeling the inroads of age and
realizing she can't rescue the family on her own, sends daughter
and grandkids back to Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The family's Southern branch has prospered. They live on a
comfortable farm relatives bought from the family that once owned
them as slaves. It's supported by a chicken restaurant run by Al
Freeman Jr.'s patriarch, brother to the weary Mary Alice character.
The latter had to swallow a bit of pride to relocate her offspring.
The sibling rivalry between the two strong-willed seniors has never
dissipated. One thing keeping it alive is a feud over a family
antique, the interesting history of which, you may be sure, is
eventually revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise for Northern audiences may be the film's way of
quietly shattering stereotypes about the inability of
African-American families to live rewardingly in the South.
Certainly the family here does. Woodard is immense as the initially
tottering but eventually stabilizing Loretta, eating up the screen
with her expressive eyes, but if there's a deficiency in ``Down in
the Delta,'' it's that there isn't much dramatic conflict once she
arrives in her safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Goble's script pretty much charts her recovery and
progress in a straight line. Goble gives us more a family portrait
gallery than a family drama, one of the portraits being the late
Esther Rolle's as a declining matriarch, an appearance you can't
watch without feeling a lump in your throat. The most arresting
sight is that of Wesley Snipes, as Loretta's married cousin, an
educated and prosperous Atlanta businessman. You've never seen this
Snipes on screen. The antithesis of, say, Blade, he's probably the
movie character who comes closest to the real-life Snipes, who is
one of the film's producers and can take pride in its reinforcement
of positive African-American role models.

HORROCKS IS PITCH PERFECT IN `VOICE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
LITTLE VOICE 
Directed and written by: Mark Herman, based on Jim Cartwright's
play 
Starring: Jane Horrocks, Michael Caine, Brenda Blethyn, Jim
Broadbent, Ewan McGregor, Annette Badland, Philip Jackson 
Running time: 96 minutes 
Rated: R (language and brief nudity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' plucks something gossamer from a world of
unremitting dreariness and spins it forth magically. It's the
Christmas season's fairytale movie and it rides the astonishing
performance of Jane Horrocks as a reclusive young woman in a
crumbling seaside town in the north of England whose voice is
several things, but not little. As the film opens, her voice is all
but nonexistent because she has been steamrolled by her widowed
mother, whose selfishness has turned her monstrous. Brenda
Blethyn's Mari is a rampaging cow avoiding with drink the fact that
her prospects are going downhill fast, and bolstering her
self-esteem by emotionally abusing her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   As the film opens, the job is nearly complete. Horrocks's Laura,
belittlingly nicknamed Little Voice by her braying mother, sits in
her room, virtually catatonic, grieving for her dead father, a
quiet man whose sole pleasure lay in listening to his records of
Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Shirley Bassey, and other great vocal
blasts from the past. As Little Voice sees it, if she doesn't mourn
her father, nobody else will. Her communing with him takes the form
of listening endlessly to his old records and reproducing with
uncanny fidelity the voices in the grooves. Although she never
speaks up to her mother in her own voice, she matches her mom,
brassy decibel for brassy decibel, whenever she sings in the voice
of this or that diva.
</P>
<P>
   Their dead-end lives in their dead-end house on their dead-end
street goes round and round, turntable-style, until Michael Caine's
flashy Ray shows up and knocks the comedy of desperation into
orbit. Like Mari, Ray is going nowhere, but puts up a better front.
He's what Caine's Alfie might have wound up as, a terminal loser
still chasing the brass ring, which in his case takes the form of
finding an act he can exploit. After a night of seismic sex with
Mari, he's struck by the sound of Little Voice singing, tiptoes
upstairs to her bedroom retreat and starts pouring on the oily
charm. Ray _ Caine's best role and richest performance in years _
is charming, but he's also relentless and, if need be, brutally
nasty.
</P>
<P>
   They all can strike it rich, he claims, if Little Voice will
only journey from her room to the stage of the tacky beachfront
nightclub owned by Jim Broadbent. Ray pushes the right buttons,
saying her dead father would have wanted it, and so ensues her
night of 1,000 sequins. Little Voice's stagefright is cured by her
vision of her father approvingly sitting in the audience. And
Horrocks, who played the role for several years on the London
stage, is a knockout. The question is whether her spectacular
success will be more than a one-shot, and whether she'll ever find
her own voice.
</P>
<P>
   There's a hint that she might when she meets Ewan McGregor's
telephone lineman, who is as shy as she is. They communicate with
glances, but words do not come easily to either. Frankly, their
sweet little love story is quite eclipsed by the terminal seediness
of Caine and the equally versatile Broadbent as the sleazy
small-timers with big dreams. You couldn't ask for a juicier pair
of bottom-feeders trying not to drown in their own flop sweat.
Caine pounces onto Ray's sincere-seeming chicanery as a cat to
cream. ``Little Voice'' is a natural successor to ``The Full
Monty'' and Herman's previous film, ``Brassed Off.'' Powered by the
superb performances of Horrocks, Caine, and Broadbent (Blethyn is
too stridently one-note), it earns an instant niche in provincial
futility's hall of fame.

WIRED FOR SOUND SHOPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 1 a.m., and I'm looking for Love. Not the garden variety
that everybody and their little sister can get their hands on, but
the good stuff. The real thing. The way Love used to be, before
money and power and image mattered. I want raw Love. Passionate
Love. I want . . .``Rat Bastard.'' ``Rat Bastard'' is the EP that
Courtney Love _ the Love I'm looking for _ and her band Hole
released a year before their official debut, 1991's ``Pretty on the
Inside,'' came out. It has the original recording of the
incomparable ``Retard Girl'' on it, and I must have it. Now.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark ages, before computer screens lit the night with the
flat, obsessive glow of nonstop virtual shopping, the late hour
might have been an obstacle to the sort of instant gratification
I'm craving. But in today's wired world, retail is a 24-hour
phenomenon. In a click I'm at a record store the size of a stadium,
hundreds of thousands of CDs at my fingertips, satisfaction as
close as the piece of plastic balanced on my keypad.
</P>
<P>
   While shopping on line for current mainstream music is simple
and straightforward, tracking down obscure or out-of-print albums
does not qualify by any stretch of the imagination as instantly
gratifying. My search for Love begins at Amazon.com, the leading
Internet music retailer. In response to the keyword ``Hole,'' three
Hole album titles are listed on the screen, plus 57 other
``matches'' _ including jazz pianist Bill Evans's ``At Shelly's
Manne-Hole,'' and ``Dig Your Own Hole'' by the Chemical Brothers. I
have to click on the name of a Hole album, then select ``more
albums by this artist`` to learn that Amazon actually stocks eleven
Hole titles, among them imports and singles. A tricky bit of
navigation. Still, nowhere do I find my ``Rat Bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   And I don't find the title at CDnow.com or Musicblvd.com, the
Internet's other major retailers, nor Soundstone.com and Rock.com,
a pair of fast-growing upstarts. The trouble is not, however, that
those on-line stores don't stock the EP I'm looking for. It turns
out that the scrappy four-song ``Rat Bastard'' has been eloquently
rechristened (in accordance, no doubt, with poststardom marketing
strategy) ``First Session,'' a fact I discover only after checking
track listings on the unfamiliar titles.
</P>
<P>
   For the left-field fan or collector of old or obscure releases,
the road to on-line music shopping is fraught with such perilous
blind spots. But various sites supply a share of unexpected
pleasures and happy endings. Comparing the on-line music stores
depends entirely on your criteria for a satisfying shopping
experience; sheer volume of titles, certainly, but also ease of
navigation, design clarity, and extras like reviews, artist bios,
and links to other music are useful features.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of inventory, the big players _ Amazon.com,
Musicblvd.com, and CDnow.com _ are generally comparable. All three,
for example, came up with copies of Julie Driscoll's 1960 import
album, ``Streetnoise.'' Amazon also offers a ``Customers Who Bought
This CD Also Bought . . . '' section and fan reviews, which are so
minimally useful _ with no assurance of the writer's good taste,
knowledge, or credibility _ one presumes they function more as an
enticement for closet critics to shop there than as guidelines for
consumers. CDnow has a staff album advisor who reliably recommends
additional music based on one's selected artist, as well as links
to brief quotes from Rolling Stone reviews. But of the big three,
Musicblvd wins hands down for informative extras. There are links
to artist biographies, reviews, and features from a wide variety of
national music publications, and a novel list of _ and links to _
artists who have influenced the artist you're researching.
</P>
<P>
   While comparable, the big ones aren't, as it turns out, always
reliable. Case in point: In my search for Velvet Underground
drummer Maureen Tucker's first solo album, 1989's ``Life in Exile
After Abdication,'' neither CDnow nor Musicblvd carried it, and
Amazon listed it as out of stock. Tower Records' Web site, however,
had it _ for $13.99. The much lower-profile Soundstone.com also
sold the CD, and better yet, it was on sale for $9.79.
</P>
<P>
   Soundstone.com is a year-old company based in Somerville;
Soundstone president Kevin Sheehan bought Rock.com, which wasn't a
retail site, and launched it last October as the under-25 arm of
Soundstone's 25-plus/boomer business, and the pair is carving a
niche in a crowded big-name market by saturating the sites with
strong personality and the sort of service one expects to find at a
small boutique rather than a large warehouse, on line or off.
Shoppers can actually chat in real time with a customer service rep
about music, technical questions, ordering, or anything else that
pops to mind. You can check out live local music scenes in a number
of major cities, including select club listings and recommended
local CDs. They've got question-and-answer columns staffed by
actual experts _ Milo Miles on Soundstone and Brett Milano on
Rock.com. _ and archived essays about music and trends.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the collectors, those looking for rarities,
vinyl, 45s, and the like. Odds are slim you'll find what you're
looking for at the sites catering to collectors, but you'll likely
wind up wanting something you didn't even know you needed. At
Joe's-Record-Paradise.com, they keep things simple; categories are
jazz, rock, country, and ``the rest of the stuff.'' It's part
record store, part auction house; some prices are set; others are
open to bidding. You can find anything from an original mono
10-inch of Les Paul's ``Galloping Guitars'' for $20, to a set of 26
British-import Beatles 45s, for which bidding starts at $125. Joe's
also offers a thorough rating system to evaluate wear and
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Everythings-music.com is a tiny collectibles store/auction
house; no bells, no whistles, just a neat little list of stuff like
Juliana Hatfield's ``Only Everything'' in special fake-Buffalo-hide
packaging (out of print, of course) for $18, and a Misfits Coffin
Boxset (yes, the box is a coffin) for $70. Secondspin.com is the
giant flea market of on-line record stores; no awesome imports or
fancy features, just a constantly changing random sampling of CDs _
cheap, too. Ebay.com, the all-the-rage auction house, sports a
predictably eclectic array of music items _ from an autographed
(twice!) Tori Amos album to backstage laminates to current CDs and
obscure albums.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it's all a matter of style. If you know exactly what you
want and plan a surgical strike _ get in and get out with your
targeted CD _ the behemoths supply nearly identical 300,000-strong
inventories. For those of you inclined to smell the roses, perhaps
pick up a new idea or artist along the way, or just wander around
until something catches your eye, the smaller sites will serve you
well. And you just might find what you're looking for.

and scrape homes off their foundation _ scattering the devastation
of a tornado over dozens of square miles. And no place in the
United States is more prone to flash floods than the Hill Country
west of Austin. With only hours to warn the growing number of
people living along the rivers and lakes of Central Texas,
including Lake Travis, the LCRA is taking steps to improve its
weather eyes and ears. Beginning in January, the river authority
will begin a $7.2 million program to almost triple the number of

SISTERS' LOVE MAKES JUMP FROM THE STAGE

DANCING AT LUGHNASA 
Directed by: Pat O'Connor 
Screenplay by: Frank McGuinness, based on Brian Friel's play 
Starring: Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon, Catherine McCormack, Kathy
Burke, Sophie Thompson, Brid Brennan, Rhys Ifans 
Running time: 92 minutes 
Rated: PG (mild language and thematic elements) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' is a beautiful film of a beautiful play.
Not in the way you might think, not in terms of picturesque
scenery, although the play's pared-down Donegal world in August
1936, is lush and golden. Nor is it a thing of verbal flights,
although the speech is lively and pointed and in many ways loving
as it ripples among five unmarried sisters sharing a country
cottage that's also the home of the 7-year-old boy whose grown
voice we hear narrating the events of the chronicle. Director Pat
O'Connor gets the behavioral nuances right, knows what lies between
the lines of Brian Friel's play, turns it into a thing of glances,
of stifled hearts, of emotional radar readings among the five
tightly knit sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The play charts great relentless tectonic plate shifts beneath
the comforting routines of the Mundy sisters _ Meryl Streep's prim
schoolteacher, Kate, supporting the family; Kathy Burke's childless
earth mother, Maggie, presiding at the hearth; Brid Brennan's
steady Alice; Sophie Thompson's simple Rose; Catherine McCormack's
Christina, romantic, yet practical enough to know she'd derive
little comfort from marrying the flamboyant but commitment-shy
father of her child. Their quiet, contained courage, a genuflection
to which is the play's ultimate subject, is tested more than they
realize by a fateful event _ the return from Uganda of their
missionary brother, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   After hero-worshipping him from afar for years, their startled
glances eloquently register their feelings about seeng the brother
who returns looking frail and erratic and eccentric. His mental
circuitry has cross-wired the African and Celtic Catholic
religions. He regards them as interchangeable in their essentials,
no small point since Michael Gambon's ability to make us believe
that the old priest has his eye trained on something grander and
larger than pedestrian realities transports us into the heart of
the play's central metaphor. Extraordinarily for an Irish play _
and now film _ the Church doesn't figure much, except as an
impediment to spiritual sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to the pagan harvest rites, complete with
bonfires, that predate the Church and still compel the
participation of the peasants in the hills behind the sisters'
rocky farm. Pointedly, but never heavy-handedly, Friel makes us
aware of the parallel between the Irish accommodation of paganism
and Christianity and the similar phenomenon with which Jack has
made his peace in Africa _ a factor in his being sent home into
forced retirement. Through Jack's disorientation, and the fact that
he has become an embarrassment to the Church and been put out to
pasture, Gambon confirms his standing as one of the best actors in
the English-speaking world by convincing us that Jack has been
touched by grace and a kind of pantheistic wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor and his cast also convince us that the sisters were
born with grace. Although they shun the pagan rites, they arrive at
their own eruption of joy, dancing to the music from a radio bought
by the boy's wandering father en route to join anti-Franco fighters
in Spain. The sisters' dance is the merest respite from the hard
lives to which they respond with touchingly inexhaustible spirits.
This is their great legacy to the love child they all nurture. Many
a memory play has been ruined on its way from stage to screen. Not
this one, though. ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' is a tender glory.
</P>

`JOE YOUNG' GETS A SMART, ENDEARING UPDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
MIGHTY JOE YOUNG 
Directed by: Ron Underwood 
Screenplay by: Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner, based on Ruth
Rose's screenplay and Merian C. Cooper's story 
Starring: Charlize Theron, Bill Paxton, Rade Serbedzija, Peter
Firth, David Paymer, Regina King, John Alexander 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: PG (some menacing action violence and mild language) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it first surfaced in 1949, ``Mighty Joe Young'' was an
endearing alternative to ``King Kong.'' Part of this was due to the
fact that the gorilla of the title role was smaller than Kong, only
about 15 feet high. Sort of like Kong's vulnerable kid brother.
Directed by ``King Kong'' director Ernest Schoedsack, it was
endearing the first time around and it's endearing now. The new
``Mighty Joe Young'' remake with Ron Underwood behind the camera
smartly updates the story to a time of increased ecological
awareness, increased technological capacity, and even more
frightening threats to the gorilla's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, Joe has a couple of caring human friends. Charlize
Theron's primatologist and Bill Paxton's zoologist, working for a
nature conservancy. She reluctantly assents to his argument that
Joe would face less danger in his California animal preserve than
he would from poachers in his native Africa. And so he's shipped to
Los Angeles, where the poachers follow him. Joe knows something is
wrong, but the keepers misinterpret his thumpings and trumpetings
and rush to the beast label for this beauty-and-the-beast tale.
</P>
<P>
   As if self-preservation in the midst of idiots who don't even
know the threat exists weren't enough, Joe is of course smitten
with Therize, his pal since childhood, when their respective moms
were killed by the same poacher (Rade Serbedzija) who's on his
trail now. Like Joe, to say nothing of Kenneth Branagh in
``Celebrity,'' Keanu Reeves in ``The Devil's Advocate,'' and Tom
Everett Scott in ``That Thing You Do,'' Paxton's globetrotting
animal advocate falls for the pretty primatologist, too. So he's in
good company, if also in an unconventional triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, we know that Therize and Paxton are acting in front
of blue screens and playing to assistant directors holding ape
masks on sticks. We realize that the creature builders,
animatronics experts, and computer wizards added Joe later. They
all know their stuff, do a good job, and have more than a little
fun with such landmarks as Grauman's Chinese Theater and the
Hollywood sign, although the best scene comes when Joe hides from
pursuing cops under a freeway overpass before shambling off to an
amusement park for a tear-jerker ending that works despite itself.
</P>
<P>
   Movie buffs may be interested to note that Terry Moore, who
played the love object in the original, appears in this reprise in
a cameo with Ray Harryhausen, who built the original Joe. Also, for
karmic reasons, Paxton insisted that his late friend and
predecessor in the good-guy role, Ben Johnson, be genuflected to in
the form of a quickly-glimpsed movie poster for ``Wagonmaster,'' in
which Johnson starred. Karmic influences or not, the new ``Mighty
Joe Young'' works. This is one remake that isn't trying to make us
forget the original, but seems rather to embrace it and bring it
into the present in solidly crafted, family-friendly fashion.

HURRICANE VICTIMS FIND SOLACE IN THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua _ At a crowded refugee camp set up on the
grounds of an elementary school, an American psychologist was
asking a group of peasant women about the hurricane that swept away
their homes, and in some cases, their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, Susana Ramirez, had come to the shelter from the
village of Rolando Rodriguez on the side of the Casita Volcano.
After days of torrential rain in late October, the wall of a crater
lake in the volcano collapsed, and unleashed a flood followed and a
mudslide that wiped out Rolando Rodriguez and four other villages
and partially destroyed a dozen others.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's husband and many of her neighbors were killed in the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Clarisa Hernandez came from Torreon, which was mostly spared
when the wall of mud divided into two currents, leaving the village
on an island. But her nieces, nephews and cousins in Rolando
Rodriguez were killed.
</P>
<P>
   As the women spoke, they sat with arms held tightly across their
chests and eyes cast down, the day of the disaster replaying in
their minds, their sadness overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of raw pain and emotion isn't an uncommon phenomenon
for the psychologist, Adrianne Aron, who was in Nicaragua with a
team of U.S. doctors and nurses to treat the victims of the
hurricane named Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   At home in Berkeley, Calif., she ordinarily divides her time
between counseling troubled young people in the Alameda County
Juvenile Hall and treating Central Americans who fled war and
torture. She has also worked as part of Red Cross disaster teams
after both the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 and the Oakland Hills
firestorm in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Of the trauma and distress the hurricane victims were going
through, Aron said, ``We had a taste of this in a minor way with
our own earthquake. We became very distrustful of the bridges and
viaducts and freeways. We all found ourselves very nervous. If you
multiply that by a large number, that's what's going on in
Nicaragua.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several of the Nicaraguan refugees said that when it
started to rain one December day, they began to panic that the rain
would launch another landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the storm, tens of thousands of Nicaraguans are
still living in shelters, 4,400 of them in the township of
Posoltega, where the volcano is located.
</P>
<P>
   The storm, which stalled over Central America for days in late
October, killed more than 9,000 people and left as many as 2
million others homeless in Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Along with treatment the medical team provided to heal physical
ailments, Aron hoped to give survivors the tools to cope and help
each other begin to rebuild their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doris and I want to teach you something to help get rid of
tension,'' Aron said to the women in the camp, gesturing to Doris
Massey, who also lives in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doris is a nurse and she has taught other nurses to do this,
but she can teach you, too,'' Aron said. ``It's good for a headache
and it can help if you've had trouble sleeping at night since the
hurricane. It's called massage.''
</P>
<P>
   Massey demonstrated a shoulder and neck rub on Aron, then asked
the women to break into pairs and try it. Ramirez put her hands
shyly on Hernandez's shoulders and tentatively began to work the
68-year-old woman's stiff muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make small circles with your thumb, the size of a
coin,'' Massey said. ``Keep it very slow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans presented the technique to the Posoltega women as
a cure for physical ailments, but for Aron, the caring touch the
refugees were learning was also a way for them to begin to heal
their wounded spirits.
</P>
<P>
   They have received some help with basic necessities such as
food, clothing, water and medical care from their government and
private relief agencies. But the apocalyptic horror of the flood
and the enormous pain of losing their relatives and friends as well
as their homes and possessions has barely been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   With only a week on the medical brigade to tend to so many
affected people, Aron knew she must work strategically. She spent
much of her time sitting with groups of refugees and listening to
their stories. Then she offered them ways to express their
feelings, to support each other, and to begin to imagine a future.
</P>
<P>
   On her first day, Aron spoke with a despondent woman who had
lost four of her young children to the raging storm. As they spoke,
another woman joined in, explaining that five of her children had
died. With a van full of U.S. doctors waiting for her, Aron had
only time to say a few words and give each woman a warm hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to hook them up with one another,'' she said in
the van afterwards. ``They have to face Christmas now without their
children, so I'm hoping they can join forces.''
</P>
<P>
   The massage workshop, as well as drawing and singing groups Aron
organized among refugee children, were designed to encourage the
hurricane survivors to help one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a massage before,'' said Hernandez, smiling as
she thanked Ramirez for the treatment. ``But I like it. I'll do it
for my family now and I'll teach my husband how to do it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about the disaster, your head hurts and your
body hurts,'' added Mayra Martin, another refugee, who attended
Aron's workshop with her mother and daughter, 10. ``But I feel
calmer now. I think I'll do this every day.''

STOPPARD'S `SHAKESPEARE' DAZZLES 
</HEADLINE>

SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE 
Directed by: John Madden 
Screenplay by: Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard 
Starring: Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey Rush, Colin
Firth, Ben Affleck, Judi Dench, Simon Callow, Tom Wilkinson 
Running time: 122 minutes 
Rated: R (sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' is not only the year's most exhilarating
surprise. It's the best backstage comedy ever made. It gives the
kind of rush that ``Pulp Fiction'' or ``L.A. Confidential'' gave
us, the giddy sense that you're watching something daring itself to
fly, then bringing off the gamble. It's all liftoff, launched on an
inspired conceit. What, it asks itself, went into the making of the
play that made Shakespeare _ ``Romeo and Juliet''? Joseph Fiennes's
young Will, down from Stratford, trying to hustle a career in
bustling Elizabethan London in 1593, begins by being stymied with
writer's block. His new play, ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's
Daughter,'' is not going well. In fact, it's not going at all.
</P>
<P>
   But then Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman's brilliant script starts
imagining him out of trouble and into love. Never, in fact, has
imagination filled the gaps in the life of a cultural icon so
gloriously, so knowingly, so satisfyingly. Things start happening
when, Fiennes's Will, so soulful that he can't avoid tripping over
his own heart, is struck by something about a boy trying out at the
Rose Theatre. What he doesn't know, but doesn't take long to find
out, is that the newcomer is a high-born stagestruck gentlewoman in
disguise in a society where women aren't permitted to do anything
so depraved as acting for a living.
</P>
<P>
   In no time, Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola De Lesseps becomes the
unhappily married Shakespeare's real-life Juliet, complete with
balcony scene at her stately home, where he risks death, since
she's engaged to Colin Firth's dangerous and nasty aristocrat. As
his love life improves, so does his new play. His quill starts
flying across the surfaces of his hitherto paralyzingly blank
paper. Christopher Marlowe, Elizabethan drama's top dog (drolly
played by Rupert Everett), hands Shakespeare the plot he needs. Ben
Affleck, another heaven-sent presence as Ned Alleyn, the matinee
idol of his day, supplies the name change. When Shakespeare wants
to rope the A-list actor into the production by offering him the
role of Mercutio, and Alleyn asks the name of the play,
Shakespeare, skipping not a beat, replies: ``Mercutio,'' reeling
the actor in by his own ego.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck, unfurling a flair for throwaway comedy, makes Alleyn a
generous figure. The film is a generous film, in keeping with the
reconciliatory impulse in Shakespeare's own comedies. ``Shakespeare
in Love'' delights in its characters, and we do, too. It isn't out
to debunk the ardent young writer who hasn't yet become the Bard,
although it can't help smiling at the humor he can't see in his own
besotted earnestness. This is also Paltrow's best role in ages. She
burns with fevered emotions _ paler, perhaps, than Shakespeare's,
but no less incandescent. At the end, when a series of perhaps
inevitable mishaps thrusts her into the premiere performance of
``Romeo and Juliet,'' she metamorphoses into theatrical aspiration
itself.
</P>
<P>
   This soaring, earthy, serendipitous enterprise is enriched
hugely by the rightness and relish brought to it by its
just-as-delicious secondary figures. Geoffrey Rush has fun playing
the desperation of the theater owner trying to avert disaster with
the new play. Tom Wilkinson is a steadily ingratiating presence as
the thug he owes money to, especially when it becomes apparent that
he's been bitten by the theater bug. Simon Callow is hilarious as a
killjoy master of revels who lives to shut down theaters. It's fun
to see the young John Webster, who later became famous as the
author of bloody revenge dramas, played as a bloodthirsty little
death's head by Joe Roberts. And the priceless Judi Dench weighs in
magnificently, with a full head of mischievous imperiousness as the
aged Elizabeth I. When she orders Shakespeare to next write a
comedy for Twelfth Night, we know where the name of his heroine,
Viola, came from.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a Shakespearean scholar to enjoy the film.
But the more you do know, the more you'll be tickled by the
script's way of accounting for the sources of various lines and
phrases we identify today as Shakespearean. The romance works, the
comedy works, most of all ``Shakespeare in Love'' works because of
its champagne script. Norman got the idea from his son who was
taking a drama course at Boston University in 1989. Stoppard
finished what Norman started. Although I have no idea who wrote
what, I can't resist noting that Stoppard has become the
English-speaking stage's natural successor to George Bernard Shaw,
on the strength of his playful, inventive wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' is also sexier than anything Shaw could
ever permit himself to write. It's something of a throwback to
Stoppard's ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' and even more
of one to Stoppard's dazzling ``Arcadia.'' When it comes to
imagining what went on among our illustrious predecessors, Stoppard
simply has no competition. Hurtling through a believably yeasty
London with confidence and panache, ``Shakespeare in Love'' lives
by the word, and ought to at least get a best screenplay Oscar.
It's a bawdy, exuberant, nimble-witted, impassioned lark.

`STEPMOM' PULLS THE HEARTSTRINGS A LITTLE TOO HARD

STEPMOM 
Directed by: Chris Columbus 
Screenplay by: Gigi Levangie, Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers, Karen
Leigh Hopkins, Ron Bass 
Starring: Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Ed Harris, Jena Malone,
Liam Aiken, Lynn Whitfield, Darrell Larson, Mary Louise Wilson 
Running time: 124 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (language and thematic elements) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll start looking at your watch.
That's the story on ``Stepmom.'' It begins as a nice starry workout
for Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon as, respectively, new
stepmom-to-be and angry discarded mom. The stepmom, of course, can
do nothing right. The biological mom, who knows every tic and
twitch of the two kids she bore, can do no wrong. The natural mom
is angry, the kids are angry, the dad is keeping a low profile, and
Roberts's stepmom finds herself playing a losing game. The kids
don't want her around. And she's not too crazy about being their
punching bag, although she gamely hangs in there, playing the
unsinkable good sport, even though her new wife-and-mom role is
undercutting her fashion photography job.
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon's ex-wife who will never be an ex-mom enjoys twisting
the knife and does it stylishly. And yet both women remain
essentially sympathetic. It allows the film to ride the barbed
comedy of malevolence as Roberts's spunky interloper scrambles to
find ways to make the kids feel they don't have to hate her in
order to express loyalty to their mom. The resentfulness of the
kids (Jena Malone and Liam Aiken) is bracing and refreshing. It
does a lot to help stave off the sentimental, drawn-out
manipulativeness that brings the film down and yanks it out of its
boomer heaven, untroubled by money pressures, unfolding in
attractively chic locations _ Manhattan loft, charming old Nyack
Colonial _ neatly personifying parental angst over the clashing
demands of child care versus career.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Harris's presumably deep-pockets lawyer, who dumped Sarandon
and is trying to make a go of it with Roberts, is little more than
a peripheral figure, partly because his character could plausibly
view his position between ex-wife and new wife as a no man's land.
Although there's a shower scene between him and Roberts, there's an
almost total absence of anything like real heat between them. The
passion is exchanged by the two women. After a while, they're more
intricately involved with each other than either is with the man to
whom one was married and the other is about to be. The real subject
here is the dynamic between the film's two big female stars. But
because they're who they are, you know they're going to come out
about even in sympathy quotients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' constantly is engaged in a pitched battle with
predictability, right down to the obvious set piece, when Roberts's
stepmom loses the kids in the park. Sarandon's disapproving
biological mom, beneath her stern exterior, loves it because she
can have the moral high ground all to herself on this one. The
film's tear-jerker second half, drawn out unconscionably, is
ushered in by news that one of the players is ill, and bickering
must be replaced by bonding. The idea that room should be made for
tolerance and non-traditional family alignments isn't enough to
carry the film past the obviousness of its button-pushing. There
simply isn't enough weight given to the supposed gravity of the
situation to make the weep-o-rama palatable. There's a lot to be
said for watching Sarandon and Roberts pretend to spar, but
``Stepmom,'' despite _ or perhaps because of _ its five
screenwriters, makes it all seem more ersatz that it ought to have
been.

HINTS OF HUMOR IN NIHILISTIC `HURLYBURLY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
HURLYBURLY 
Directed by: Anthony Drazan 
Screenplay by: David Rabe, based on his play 
Starring: Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright Penn, Chazz
Palminteri, Garry Shandling, Anna Paquin, Meg Ryan 
Running time: 122 minutes 
Rated: R (constant drug use, pervasive strong language, and sexual
material) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Rabe was dissatisfied with the original off-Broadway
staging of his play, ``Hurlyburly.'' That makes two of us. Three,
actually, if you count Sean Penn, who performed it in Los Angeles
and now, a decade later, stars in a transformed screen version of
``Hurlyburly.'' It isn't every script that gets a second and then a
third chance. So was ``Hurlyburly'' worth sticking with? The
answer, to my surprise, is yes. What seemed like a few hours of
nihilistic self-destructiveness from a roomful of misogynistic
Hollywood losers on stage emerges on screen with new clarity and
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurlyburly'' benefits immensely from a few shifts in emphasis
and direction. And from a sizzling and _ against the odds _
sympathetic performance from Penn. His character, a Hollywood agent
named Eddie who aptly describes himself as his own biggest
distraction, has become a guy who may not even know on a conscious
level that he's looking for something better than a frantic search
for sensation. But without ever moralizing, or even verbalizing it,
Penn's Eddie makes us feel he is groping his way toward something
better. While the ending is far from resoundingly affirmative, it
at least leaves the door open to hope.
</P>
<P>
   The play is fueled by Rabe's torrents of male bondingspeak. It's
guys being guys, playing to each other, not necessarily kind to one
another, but certainly treating each other better than they treat
the women who have the bad luck to fall into their orbit. As
director (and producer) Anthony Drazan has conceived it, Eddie and
his cronies Mickey (Kevin Spacey) and Phil (Chazz Palminteri) are
the three facets of a broken organism. Spacey's Mickey, Eddie's
glib partner in the agency, is taking what he calls a timeout from
his wife and kids to go the fast-lane route, but always in an
armored, detached way. Phil (Chazz Palminteri) is driven by
whatever convulsive spasm of emotion he's feeling at the time.
</P>
<P>
   If Mickey represents superego to a fault, Phil represents an id
in need of a lid. Eddie is somewhere in the middle. He's all
flailing ego, reachable provided you can get to him, which takes
some doing, given his penchant for distraction. There's an
unofficial fourth musketeer, a low-level Hollywood player played by
Garry Shandling, whose pseudocool is constantly eclipsed by his
desperation. He, God help him, thinks the other three are cool and
he wants to run with them. As an initiation fee, he drops in on the
Hollywod Hills condo shared by Eddie and Mickey with a gift, a
street waif, Donna (Anna Paquin), whom he describes as a care
package.
</P>
<P>
   What the benighted guys fail to see is that all three women who
come in contact with them are far stronger than they are, including
Paquin's waif, who's more resilient than she seems; Robin Wright
Penn's female loose cannon, who two-times both Eddie and Mickey;
and Meg Ryan's revelatory performance as a stripper who begins by
seeming a doormat, but ends up seeming the film's moral center.
Drazin's cinematographer, Changwei Gu, photographs many scenes and
moments through reflective surfaces _ mirrors, glass doors, a glass
coffee table, water in a pool. The question is whether Eddie can
ever bring himself to break through the reflections of reality to
begin dealing with the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Corrosively as the characters are drawn, there remains room for
outcroppings of surprising humor in ``Hurlyburly.'' And while it
may seem the height of male self-involvement to worry about the
possible redemption of one or more of the guys and not the superbly
characterized women they victimize, you'll find yourself caring
whether Eddie can pull himself out of the nothingness he's trying
so hard to avoid facing. Penn's performance is amazing. His Eddie
has steam coming out of his ears, yet he's also something of a
patsy. The thing that makes him redeemable is that he's also
harboring a lot of pain. ``Gotta wake up,'' Eddie tells himself.
He's of a piece with Penn's other tightrope-walking performances
that make him one of the few actors whose work keeps you believing
in movies.

WILLIAMS WINS A TOO-EASY ARGUMENT FOR HUMANE MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
PATCH ADAMS 
Directed by: Tom Shadyac 
Screenplay by: Steve Oedekerk 
Starring: Robin Williams, Monica Potter, Daniel London, Philip
Seymour Hoffman, Bob Gunton, Peter Coyote, Josef Sommer, Harve
Presnell 
Running time: 110 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (some strong language and crude humor) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' would seem to be a natural for Robin Williams.
Based on a true story, it's about a maverick doctor who shakes up
the establishment by clowning around with cancer patients in the
name of relating to them as people. He makes kids in a pediatric
cancer ward laugh when he cuts a slit in a red rubber ball, pops it
on his nose, and makes faces. He even breaks through the anger of a
dying pancreatic cancer patient by showing up in the guy's room
wearing gauze wings and singing ``Blue Skies'' to him.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it sounds like ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and
``Dead Poets Society'' in a hospital. And it could have been, it
could have been. There's nobody whose riffs you'd rather see in the
role of a shaker-upper than Williams. There's always enough pain
and sensitivity in his eyes to tell us that he's not just being
insensitive, that the humor may be his way of hiding his own thin
skin. Here, he gets more than the usual sympatico sendoff when we
see that his route to medical school was through his own
institutionalization for depression.
</P>
<P>
   It's while he's undergoing treatment that he discovers he's much
better at relating to the other patients than the doctors are. And
so, thus convinced that he can supply something the establishment
often lacks, he enters medical school. His grades are great, but
his antics in the name of reinventing the bedside manner and
personalizing medicine get him into trouble. The problem,
dramatically, is that it gets him into trouble we reject as too
simplistic. Granted, a film needs conflict, but the way ``Patch
Adams'' goes about getting it is too blatantly manipulative.
</P>
<P>
   Patch's chief antagonist is the med school dean, played by Bob
Gunton. In case you've forgotten, Gunton played the evil warden in
``The Shawshank Redemption.'' If you missed that prison film, you
can see the performance repeated here. Gunton is too much a
humorless martinet. And for that matter, Patch is too much a
wayward angel. Most good doctors, you suspect, steer a humane and
flexible course between the dean's rigidity and Patch's
loose-cannon antics. Didn't it ever occur to someone to have a
calmed-down Patch quietly walk into a room and simply take
someone's temperature?
</P>
<P>
   The film is too stridently polarized between the forces of
humane progress and unyielding rule-following. It does have one
figure, a senior physician played by Josef Sommer, who embodies
compassionate flexibility yet is comfortable within the structure.
His reasonable presence shows the rest of the film up as a
one-sided argument for emotional involvement with patients. It
would have been helped by an equally sympathetic figure on the
other side of the argument. Monica Potter and Daniel London as
colleagues who come to share Patch's ideas add to the likability
quotient. But instead of drama, ``Patch Adams'' gives us mere
iconography, and wastes Williams's iconoclastic dedicated doc.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Central Station'' Classic humanist art cinema from
Brazil. Fernanda Montenegro is magnificent as a crusty old woman
whose heart is thawed when she accompanies a motherless boy
(Vincius de Oliveira) on a literal and symbolic journey to find his
father in Walter Salles's road film about contemporary Brazil
finding its identity, too. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  1/2 ``Dancing at Lughnasa'' A beautiful film of a beautiful
play (by Brian Friel) about five unmarried sisters in Donegal and
the refusal of their hearts and spirits to be crushed by the
grinding hardship they face and the return, in disgrace, of their
brother, a missionary priest who no longer sees any need to
distinguish between pegan religions and Catholicism. Meryl Streep
is the presiding sister. Michael Gambon is haunting as the
spiritual pilgrim. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Down in the Delta'' Richly-textured film directing debut of
poet Maya Angelou. In it, a single mother whose life is falling
apart in Chicago rights herself and her family after she returns to
her relatives and her roots in Mississippi. Alfre Woodard delilvers
a strongly-arched performance as the woman who becomes whole again.
You've never seen Wesley Snipes as he appears here in the role of a
soft-spoken, educated, prosperous Atlanta businessman. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Hurlyburly'' David Rabe's houseful of Hollywood loose
cannons make more dramatic sense here than they did on the New York
stage. Sean Penn is intense, yet sympathetic, as Eddie, trying to
lose himself in the fast-lane life, yet also wondering if he
shouldn't be keeping his ear cocked for a wakeup call. Strong
support from Kevin Spacey, as his too-cool pal, and from Chazz
Palminteri, Garry Shandling, Robin Wright Penn, Anna Paquin, and
Meg Ryan _ the latter three as women too strong to be destroyed by
the misogynistically destructive men. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  1/2 ``The Last Emperor'' Bernardo Bertolucci's Oscar-winning
film on the life of China's Pu Yi is as visually luscious as ever _
and even longer than when it was first released in 1987. This
director's cut of the film, restored to its hefty original 219
minutes, still soars despite some draggy moments, and remains
Bertolucci's masterpiece. (PG-13) (Renee Graham) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Little Voice'' Captivating fairytale about a reclusive young
woman in a crumbling seaside town in the north of England,
squelched into silence by her overbearing mother, except when she
uncannily reproduces the voices of Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe,
Shirley Bassey, and the other divas she spends her days listening
to from her dead father's record collection. Jane Horrocks is
amazing as the girl whose voice is anything but little, Michael
Caine is wonderful as the sleazy agent who wants to exploit her
talent (he's Alfie, 25 years later) and Jim Broadbent is a big
help, too, as a seedy nightclub owner. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  ``Mighty Joe Young'' Solidly-crafted, family-friendly remake
of the 1949 film about a sensitive gorilla who suggests King Kong's
kid brother and is highly unhappy in so-called civilization.
Charlize Theron is the primatologist who turns it into a
beauty-and-the-beast story, and Bill Paxton is another plus in the
role of the guy who wants to save them both. (PG) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! &LR;  ``Patch Adams'' This film about a nonconformist doctor who
clowns around with patients in the name of treating them more
humanely and effectively would seem to be made to order for Robin
Williams. But the manipulativeness of the clunky script keeps
getting in the way by stacking the deck. The docs are either rigid
martinets or compassionate shaker-uppers, almost never anything in
between. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!!! &LR;  ``Shakespeare in Love'' The best backstage comedy ever made.
It's delightful for other reasons, too. Never has a script had so
much fun filling in the gaps in the life of a cultural icon as this
one does imagining what went into the writing of ``Romeo and
Juliet.'' Joseph Fiennes is an amusingly soulful Shakespeare,
Gwyneth Paltrow is luminous as the high-born woman he was thinking
of when he wrote Juliet and the supporting players are unfailingly
zestful, too, from Judi Dench's high-spirited Elizabeth to Ben
Affleck's droll matinee idol to Geoffrey Rush's desperate theater
owner. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! &LR;  ``Stepmom'' This starry workout for Susan Sarandon and Julia
Roberts, as discarded mom and stepmom to be, respectively, is fun
when it sticks with the comedy of antagonism. To start, anger
rules, especially with the resentful kids, caught in the middle of
their father's decision to leave their mom and live with a younger
babe. The string-pulling doesn't become a liability until it
introduces a dark plot strand that asks us to let the women come
full circle and start bonding. It becomes too pat and predictable
and prefab to not get in the way. (PG-13)

THE `EMPEROR' GETS NEW CLOTHES, NOT PADDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE LAST EMPEROR 
Directed by: Bernardo Bertolucci 
Written by: Mark Peploe and Bernardo Bertolucci 
Starring: John Lone, Joan Chen, Peter O'Toole, Ying Ruocheng,
Victor Wong, Dennis Dun 
Running time: 219 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (adult situations) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eleven years after its initial release, ``The Last Emperor'' is
still one of the most visually luscious films of the past
quarter-century. Bernardo Bertolucci's Oscar-winning movie, a
full-bodied biography of the last man to rule as emperor upon
China's Dragon Throne, is breathtaking filmmaking _ even more so
since Bertolucci and his crew were the first Westerners allowed to
shoot a film within China's labyrinthine Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the film spans Pu Yi's life from age 3 until his
death at 62, one would have thought Bertolucci left few stones
unturned in detailing the times of a man who went from exalted
emperor to playboy exile to alleged war criminal. But as is so
common these days, Bertolucci has unveiled a director's cut of
``The Last Emperor,'' with several scenes adding nearly an hour to
the film's original running time of 160 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the words ``director's cut'' should be met with a
healthy sense of skepticism. Often, it's just an excuse for an
egomaniacal director trying to squeeze a bit more green out of
moviegoers by fattening his movie and resurrecting scenes that
should have been left buried. (Just the thought of James Cameron
someday releasing a director's cut of the
already-too-long-for-its-own-good ``Titanic'' makes me faint.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the most remarkable thing about this new edit of ``The Last
Emperor'' is that the additions do not make the film seem bloated
or unnecessarily padded _ and that's saying a lot for a film that
now runs three hours, 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The basic story, of course, remains the same. The film flashes
between two eras. As the film begins, it is 1950, and Pu Yi (played
as an adult by John Lone) is shuttled among Chinese men imprisoned
for war crimes and treason. In a railway restroom, he attempts
suicide _ and the story shoots back to 1908, and the events that
led him to this day of disgrace. At the tender age of 3, Pu Yi
ascends to the Imperial throne, emperor of China and ``Lord of
10,000 Years.'' Unaware of his power and prominence, he is a child
who misses his mother and wants nothing more than to go home. One
of the film's most stunning scenes is the little boy (energetically
played by Richard Vuu impatiently leaping from this throne toward a
billowing golden curtain. When the curtain is pulled away, the boy
stares in wonder at thousands of eunuchs, kowtowing to him.
</P>
<P>
   Pu Yi would sit on the throne for all of four years, becoming
just a figurehead once China was declared a republic. As a
teenager, his thirst for knowledge of the Western world was whetted
by Reginald Johnson, (Peter O'Toole), a Scottish tutor, and he
would dream of going to school in Cambridge. These moments are
blended with scenes of Pu Yi's imprisonment in a ``reeducation''
camp, along with his brother and longtime servant. Many of the
film's additions are in these sequences.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ``The Last Emperor'' can be draggy _ even the
two-hours-plus version had its slow-as-molasses moments _ but they
have more to do with the dense historical matters than with the
film itself. For the most part, ``The Last Emperor'' is a
compelling story about a lost era, with splendid virtuoso
filmmaking that remains Bertolucci's masterpiece.

CELEBRITIES: OPEN MOUTH, INSERT FOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Eszterhas, who cranked out the screenplay of ``Showgirls,''
one of the most breathtakingly worthless movies ever made,
explained the film's raison d'etre thus: ``It's a spiritual
message. And forgive me, but I think it's almost a deeply religious
message on a very personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, don't forgive him. But I've seen the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Eszterhas's quote is one of many in ``Stupid Celebrities,'' a
diverting little collection of dumb things said by famous people.
On the one hand, it may make you feel better about all the stupid
things you've said (or written) yourself. On the other hand, it may
depress you.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest in a series of books by Ross and Kathryn Petras,
among them ``The 776 Stupidest Things Ever Said,'' ``The 776 Even
Stupider Things Ever Said,'' and ``Stupid Sex.'' The word
``stupid'' serves as a kind of catchall. Some of the quotes are
idiotic. But others might better be described as self-deluded or
egomaniacal or sexist. Some are merely shameless self-promotion.
These are celebrities after all.
</P>
<P>
   There are some famously ominous lines, among them Mick Jagger on
the prospect of aging: ``I'd rather be dead than singing
`Satisfaction' when I'm 45.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's Kathie Lee Gifford, who in her autobiography wrote
of her marriage to Frank: ``Cheating is out of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagger pops up frequently, mostly saying outrageous things about
women, such as: ``I should think that being my old lady would be
all the satisfaction or career any woman needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone seeking examples of the male mind at its lowest ebb need
look no further than ``Stupid Celebrities.'' It's difficult to pick
a favorite, but I kind of like something Axl Rose said: ``It's
really hard to maintain a one-on-one relationship if the other
person is not going to allow me to be with other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Women, too, or some women anyway, say the darndest things.
``There aren't enough men to go around,'' Helen Gurley Brown is
quoted as complaining. ``Every time there's a plane accident, it's
one hundred men dead . . . and I literally think, `Why couldn't
some women have been on that flight?' ''
</P>
<P>
   As we know, movie stars say whatever it takes to call attention
to their latest project. Demi Moore, interviewed about the film
``Striptease,'' told one reporter she'd learned this about
stripping: ``It's not really about taking your clothes off.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is it about, Demi? ``Today's strip clubs are
capital-intensive female empowerment zones.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad to have that issue clarified.
</P>
<P>
   The rich really are different, nowhere more so than in their
attitude toward money. Deborah Koons Garcia is quoted as saying:
``Jerry died broke. We only have a few hundred thousand dollars in
the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Rampant egomania rears its head on nearly every page of ``Stupid
Celebrities.'' Here's Barbra Streisand on herself: ``One thing's
for sure: Now when I look at `Funny Girl,' I think I was gorgeous.
I was too beautiful to play Fanny Brice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some lines are almost too stupid to believe, among them the
following, attributed to Sylvester Stallone: ``I'm astounded by
people who take 18 years to write something. That's how long it
took that guy to write `Madame Bovary,' and was that ever on the
bestseller list?''
</P>
<P>
   He must have been kidding. No?
</P>
<P>
   With ``Stupid Celebrities,'' the Petras have struck a rich vein
of gold. There are bound to be sequels because, as we see and hear
almost daily, celebrity is a bottomless well of stupidity. I hope
they add an index to their next collection so readers can turn
straight to the dumb things said by their favorite (or least
favorite) celebrities.

   It wasn't the sort of letter we usually receive here. She didn't
complain about anything. She didn't say she had been ripped off. In
fact, it was just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers was one of a dozen readers who responded to our request
a month ago for tales of exceptionally good consumer experiences.
We thought there would be a lot more positive letters, given that
we get 20 to 30 complaint letters and calls each week. Despite the
low response rate, we still think it's worthwhile talking about the
good as well as the bad out there.
</P>
<P>
   In the sampling of stories that follow, a couple of themes
emerge. The companies in most cases went out of their way to make
sure their customer was satisfied. In some instances, it was
company policy, but in several of the cases another factor was at
work. Store officials said they helped a consumer not because of
any company rule but simply because the customer was so nice.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers fits the nice category. She went to the Circuit City in
Manchester, N.H., on Nov. 24 to buy a TV for her husband for his
70th birthday. She ended up buying a floor model for $650 that
store officials loaded, unboxed, in the back of her Ford Explorer.
She remembers expressing some concern about the safety of the TV
back there, but says the loader told her it would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   About two blocks away from the store she heard a thud in the
back. She pulled into a Friendly's parking lot, opened the tail
gate and was barely able to get out of the way before the set
tumbled out and crashed to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   A woman at Friendly's helped her load the ruined TV back in her
car. With tears in her eyes, she drove back to Circuit City and
explained what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any hassle at all,'' Rodgers said, store manager Sean
McCarthy gave her another TV off the shelf and had it loaded in her
back seat. This time the TV was strapped in with a seat belt and
pinned in with the front seat. ``Friends who know this story are
amazed that a firm as large as this has any compassion. I am very
grateful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, who has been with Circuit City six years, stressed
that it is impossible to satisfy every single customer, ``But she
was so nice and I didn't want to disappoint her husband on his
birthday.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A little less paranoid &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kamens, 29, describes himself as a ``paranoid''
shopper. He seems to collect stories about bad consumer
experiences, such as the time a tire-maintenance program was not
honored or the day his contractor installed the wrong windows.
</P>
<P>
   So last July 5th was a memorable day for him. He and his
pregnant wife had just bought a futon and frame from Sleep-Rite in
Framingham, Mass. He agreed to buy the floor model of the frame,
because the sales staff said it was the only one available. He also
got a 15 percent discount on the $350 frame, or $52 off.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the items were delivered at his Boston home, a new
un-assembled frame showed up instead of the already assembled floor
model. The delivery workers said the store had found a new frame in
stock. Kamens braced himself to hear about needing to pay full
price, and perhaps a $15 assembly fee.
</P>
<P>
   But instead the delivery men assembled the bed at no extra
charge. ``I was pleasantly surprised,'' said Kamens, a computer
programmer and father of a 4-month-old.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Farber, the manager at Sleep-Rite, said she remembers her
experience with Kamens very clearly. She said she simply felt the
store should honor the original price given. She said it was also
easier to ``go the extra mile'' for someone like Kamens who was so
kind to everyone at the store. ``It helps when the customer is so
nice,'' she said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A real guarantee &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fred Liberatore, a father of four, had always heard about the
lifetime guarantee on Cross pens. So when his son found a busted
Cross pen in a library parking lot a couple of months ago,
Liberatore decided to send it to the A.T. Cross company in Lincoln,
R.I., and test the guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   To his amazement, three weeks later, he received a brand-new
grey Cross pen with gold trim, an exact copy of the broken pen he
had sent in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed unreal,'' said Liberatore, a 54-year-old biochemist.
``Here was a company standing behind its product.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Boss, president of the company, said the 152-year-old
company always honors the lifetime guarantee and generally receives
only 1 percent of its merchandise back for replacement or repair.
He said the guarantee on its pens _ which range from an $18
ball-point pen to a $450 fountain pen _ ``has won us a lot of
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Boss recalled a time when a Pennsylvania farmer sent them a pen
covered with dark soil in a plastic bag. It turns out he farmer
droped his pen in the fields one day and couldn't find it. Some
months later, he found the pen in the cow manure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cow ate it and got rid of it,'' Boss said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the pen worked or not, Boss is not sure. He can't say
anyone even tested the digested pen. He said the company gladly
sent the farmer back a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Liberatore said he is amazed that such old-fashioned customer
service exists. After receiving the new pen, he said, he's sure to
give the Cross company a lifetime of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You patronize companies that treat customers right,'' he
said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Have it your way &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kathy de Natale pleaded with Roche Bros. to bring back a muffin
recipe she liked. Roche Bros. refused, but did the next best thing.
The supermarket agreed to make her a dozen of the muffins she liked
whenever she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   G. Robert Warren says he had a similar experience with Shaw's
Supermarkets, but with doughnuts instead of muffins.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is a private investigator and self-described doughnut
connoisseur, although he says his wife thinks he's
doughnut-obsessed. Shaw's introduced new items to its bakery
section a year ago and in the process eliminated some items to make
room. One of those eliminated items was the powdered sugar
doughnut, Warren's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   He protested to Shaw's and they restored it to the bakery case,
but they did more than that. Warren liked his powdered sugar
doughnuts greasy and sugared heavily right out of the oven. ``The
greasier the better,'' he said. Shaw's made it that way only about
20 percent of the time, he said. When he inquired, the bakery
department at the Shaw's in Hanover, mass. agreed to make the
doughnuts his way whenever he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's spokesman Bernard Rogan said such special requests are
often granted. ``It's called developing customer loyalty,'' he
said. &QL;

HOW BEST TO INVEST RETIREMENT ACCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 54 and lost my mother earlier this year. I have
inherited $80,000 from her estate that I want to invest, but I'm
not sure in what. Most of my investments _ a total of $740,700 _
are in TIAA/CREF accounts, heavily dominated by equity positions. I
add $1,730 a month to those positions. I have $22,400 in savings
bonds and money markets, and I have been putting $300 a month in a
diversified portfolio of mutual funds. How would you suggest I
invest this inheritance, and do you suggest any changes in my
present investment strategy if my goal is to retire in six to eight
years with an annual income of $75,000 to $80,000?
</P>
<P>
   S.K., Cambridge, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suggest you invest it very conservatively, as the first of
a number of steps to reduce the risk level in the overall
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose that over the next seven years your portfolio
achieved only 8 percent average annual total returns. With ongoing
contributions at current levels, you would amass $1,533,154. With
such an accumulation, the portfolio could support withdrawals at
the $80,000-a-year level with a portfolio return of only 5.35
percent. And that's without adding the $80,000 inheritance into the
figures.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that you are already clearly in sight of your
target. That's why I used that presumption of only 8 percent growth
during the next seven years _ because I think you should sharply
reduce portfolio risk.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of your money is $491,000 in the CREF stock
fund, and that's also where the biggest part of your ongoing
contributions is going. I know, it's a great account, and it has
done great things for you in the past few years. But as those
lawyers are so fond of saying, past performance should not be
considered an indication of future performance.
</P>
<P>
   I think the bull market is pretty tired. Moreover, at this point
you're only an intermediate-term investor, with a six- to
eight-year time horizon for accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   After that, you will begin to use part of the portfolio to
provide an income stream, with the balance left in stocks as a
hedge against future inflation. But you should move gradually from
the accumulation to the income-producing stage. Now is the time to
begin moving toward more conservative positions.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you immediately shift your allocations at CREF so that
no more than 65 percent is in stock funds, with the balance in the
TIAA (annuity) and the bond fund accounts. I'd make similar moves
in the mutual fund accounts you are building, which currently are
being divided evenly between stock and fixed-income funds.
</P>
<P>
   Since the $300 a month that's going into these accounts is a
fairly small part of your ongoing savings, I suggest you reallocate
that money, putting all of it on the fixed-income side.
</P>
<P>
   As for the $80,000 inheritance, I'd also put that on the
fixed-income side. My choice would be the Vanguard GNMA fund. If
you reinvested dividends, achieved average 6.5 percent annual
returns there, and used other money to deal with the resulting tax
liabilities, that account would add a further $124,318 after seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 65 and about to retire. I have $45,000 in my retirement
account. My company proposes to give me $349 a month for the rest
of my life _ and after my death the money would be gone. I think I
can do better myself and save the principal. What do you think,
considering that I do not need the money? I am considering the
following allocation among Vanguard funds: 15 percent in U.S.
Growth, 20 percent in the Index 500 fund, 25 percent in Wellesley
Income, 25 percent in GNMA, and 15 percent in a money market fund.
Would I have to start selling these investments at age 70?
</P>
<P>
   R.M., San Diego &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You would require a 9.72 percent total return to bring you a
$349 monthly income stream without invading your $45,000 principal.
Since your proposed portfolio works out to 44 percent stocks
(reflecting 36 percent of the Vanguard Wellesley fund portfolio
that's in equities) and the balance is on the fixed-income side,
you are unlikely to come up with such a return.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that over the long haul, the total return from such
a portfolio would more likely be in the 7 percent to 8 percent
range _ and if you did achieve such results and withdrew $349 every
months, the well would run dry shortly before 21 years have
elapsed.
</P>
<P>
   But from your statement that you don't need the money, and from
your final question about when you would have to begin withdrawals,
I am guessing that what you have in mind is accumulating a pool of
money rather than getting an income stream.
</P>
<P>
   So I would transfer the lump-sum payment to a tax-deferred
account at Vanguard, in which you would not have to make any
withdrawals until after 5 1/2 years _ mandatory withdrawals begin
after age 70 1/2. But if you did achieve average 8 percent
portfolio return and made no withdrawals, at that point the account
would amount to $67,025.
</P>
<P>
   Then you would have enough capital to withdraw $349 a month for
as long as you live _ with the principal gaining modestly to boot.
Theoretically, after 20 years of such a schedule, you would have
accumulated $97,113.
</P>
<P>
   But I say theoretically, since the amount of your required
annual withdrawal would rise steadily. Presuming that the
beneficiary of this tax-deferred account is the same age as you,
for example, for the year in which you turn age 70 1/2, you would
be required to take a mandatory withdrawal of at least $3,318.
</P>
<P>
   That sequence of $349 monthly income checks would more than
cover that.
</P>
<P>
   But as the years elapsed, the escalation in the amount of the
mandatory minimum withdrawal would eventually mean that you would
have to go beyond that $349 monthly figure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to retire around age 65 with an income of $2,500
to $3,000 a month. I am now 49 and plan to have my home paid for by
the time I retire. I have $25,000 in a bank savings account paying
5 percent, and I will have the opportunity to join my company's
profit sharing and pension plan at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   O.L., Bedford, Texas &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's assume that you'll need $2,750 a month in retirement.
You could achieve such an income stream from a moderately
conservative fixed-income portfolio of about $510,000.
</P>
<P>
   But you'll also want to have additional funds _ money you'll
leave in more aggressive investments such as stock funds to build a
supplementary pool to protect you against inflation in the later
years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   So let's (fairly arbitrarily) select $650,000 as a target
accumulation by the time of your retirement. Let's also treat that
$25,000 now in the bank as emergency money _ presuming that you'll
leave it where it is, but not spend it. After 16 years, that
$25,000 would have grown to $54,571 _ meaning that you will need to
save $595,429 more by age 65.
</P>
<P>
   How much will you need to save to get there? If you went with a
fairly aggressive savings program _ investing primarily in stock
investments _ you might aim for a 10 percent average annual return.
If that return were achieved, you'd need to put away $1,319 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   If you went with a more conservative balanced portfolio _
typically divided about 65 percent stocks and the rest bonds _ you
might expect 8 percent average annual returns. That would entail
monthly savings of $1,587.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are truly conservative, you might go for a
fixed-income portfolio, balancing a few bond funds with money
market holdings. But here you should expect only about 6 percent
average returns, and it would thus require savings of $1,881 a
month to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the best vehicle for these savings is through the
profit sharing and pension plans available through your work. If
these plans don't allow you to save as much as you, need to, you
could add Roth IRA accounts (limited to $2,000 annual
contributions) or variable annuity plans, or even taxable mutual
fund accounts. All of those options are available at most mutual
fund companies.
</P>
<P>
   As for investment vehicles, if you must go beyond your
employer's plans, I'd suggest that the additional savings be done
with the Vanguard Index 500 fund (if you are taking the more
aggressive course), Vanguard Balanced Index fund (for the
middle-of-the-road option), or Vanguard Asset Allocation fund at
the most conservative.
</P>
<P>
   I know that saving $1,300 to $1,800 a month for 16 years might
seem like a pretty daunting task, but my bet is that you'll have
the discipline to do this.

FOR SEATTLE, A NEW TREND: WAKE   UP, SMELL THE COFFEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the crewmen's shack on Pier 14 of Puget Sound's
Elliott waterway, an engineer in orange slicker and flannel who
identifies himself only as ``Captain'' holds forth at a table of
dock workers clutching cups of oily coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city has become a fraud,'' he said, voicing a common view
on the waterfront, where the city's chic latte-drinking set is
viewed askance. ``It's not what people want you to think it is.
This is no different than anywhere else. Never was.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade of building itself up as the nation's
lifestyle paradise, where Gore-Tex took the place of Armani and the
economy seemed bulletproof, Seattle recently has found reason to
doubt itself.
</P>
<P>
   This month Boeing, by far the city's largest employer, announced
plans to lay off 48,000 workers, a drastic move expected to push
the city into its first recession in 16 years. With Asia in
financial crisis, ships that once departed Seattle docks loaded
with wheat, timber, paper, and aluminum bound for Japan and Korea
are leaving empty. Exports fell 20 percent in the first six months
of the year, decimating some farms and regional manufacturers that
have become dependent on foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see stuff coming in, but there's a lot of empty crates
going out,'' said Bob Dalheim, a tugboat operator.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some say the much vaunted Pacific Northwest
image that became a virtual trademark for many local companies and
made dozens of them household names is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the fascination with that Seattle image, be it
lifestyle or whatever, is probably wearing off,'' said Richard
Conway, a local economist.
</P>
<P>
   All that is a hard fall for a place that was, in the words of
Fortune magazine, the ``capital of the '90s.'' By reputation, at
least, it has everything: urban chic, stunning natural beauty, and
prosperity. The companies it spawned made millions exporting to the
rest of the nation what became known as the Seattle mystique in the
form of designer coffee, microbrewed beer, camping equipment, and
of course, computer software.
</P>
<P>
   But now Microsoft has become a behemoth known these days for its
ongoing battle with the Justice Department, which has accused the
company of widespread anticompetitive practices. Bill Gates is
viewed in many quarters as a corporate Darth Vader, not the Wonder
Boy of a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks, once an icon of Seattle's homey hipness, is nearly as
common as McDonalds and may be best known as the brand preferred by
Clinton prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr. Eddie Bauer, an L.L.
Bean-style outdoor clothier that relied on homespun simplicity, now
belongs to a mass-market catalog company and has abandoned its
original product line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales at Nike, another Pacific Northwest corporate
giant, have fallen precipitously in the last quarter, as the youth
market continues to eschew athletic shoes. The company's ``Just Do
It'' message, practically a generational motto just a few years
ago, has been trashed in recent marketing surveys and Nike's image
has been tarnished by reports of sweatshop conditions at its
foreign manufacturing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started as symbols of a lifestyle, you might say a pure
lifestyle,'' Conway said. ``But when you get big and make a lot of
money, you lose the personal touch. Then people love to hate you.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle itself seems no longer to possess all the qualities that
helped fuel a dedade of regional hubris. Rampant development has
severely damaged native salmon populations. New subdivisions creep
ever farther up the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. And
rush-hour traffic, once virtually nonexistent, was recently
determined by a Texas consulting firm to be the nation's worst
behind San Francisco and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the same town it was, that's for sure,'' lamented
Peter Conte, a native and spokesman for Boeing, the company that
more than any other represents what locals now call ``the old
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   That time is nostalgically recalled as the era that helped make
Seattle famous in the 1990s. The city was uncrowded, according to
long-time residents, life was simpler, and people hiked and fished
in the unspoiled forests and mountains nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a one-company town, whose fortunes were tied to
Boeing. During the company's heyday, in the 1960s, two out of every
three of the city's working adults were employed in its cavernous
aircraft assembly plants and administrative offices. When the
company laid off 54,000 in the early 1970s, the city nearly
collapsed. A billboard along the highway near the plant read, ``The
Last Person to Leave, Please Turn Out the Lights.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials embarked on a plan to resurrect Seattle's economy
and build an image as ``the most beautiful city in America.'' Much
was made of the local landscape in recruiting employees and
businesses from other regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to all say that Mount Rainier was worth $10,000 a year
in salary,'' Boeing's Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it helped inspire a mass migration in the 1980s from
cities like Los Angeles and New York, which go-go yuppies fled to
seek a more meaningful life in the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in California in the '80s,'' said Mary Ann Quarton,
director of the University of Washington's retail management
program. ``I saw what it did to people. Nobody was happy. It was
all about making money and spending it. The values of the Northwest
really caught on. Suddenly everyone wanted to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was flooded with more than a half-million new residents,
and with the deluge came innovative ideas and marketing savvy. It
is ``interesting to note,'' said Richard Yalch, a University of
Washington marketing professor, ``that some of the most successful
companies selling the Seattle life were started by New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers bred deep resentments among established residents,
who responded by forming such groups as the ``Committee for a
Lesser Seattle'' and coining terms like ``Californication'' to
describe what they saw happening to the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It was the birth of ``the new Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the old Seattle and there is the new Seattle,'' said
Quarton. ``The new Seattle is Microsoft. That culture is taking
over.''
</P>
<P>
   And very rich. Microsoft's 11,500 Seattle-area employees receive
an average of $250,000 a year, including salary, stock options, and
benefits, according to Conway, the economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking chump change here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of that wealth is everywhere, especially on the
city's east side, where subdivisions of sparkling near-mansions
have been carved into the forest. The wooded shores of Lake
Washington, where Gates is finishing his $60 million,
40,000-square-foot mansion, increasingly is fronted by houses
purchased by the new techno class.
</P>
<P>
   Among real estate agents, the vision of a 25-year-old bachelor
Microsoft programmer putting down cash on an $800,000 house has
become a Seattle archetype.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's depressing,'' said Ken Bacon, managing broker for
Windermere Realty in Redmond, the suburb where Microsoft is
headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of other excesses proliferate. According to the Seattle
Times, a Microsoft employee recently hosted a private dinner for a
group including his tailor, chef, and wine buyer. The tab, after
Chateaubriand, wine, cognac, and cigars: $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   If recession hits Seattle, Microsoft is expected to be one of
the few companies to come out unscathed. While virtually every
other industry has felt the pinch of Asia's financial crisis, the
company is likely to exceed the $2 billion in software it exported
to Pacific Rim countries last year. And when Boeing announced its
layoffs early this month, Microsoft hastily and pointedly announced
it planned to hire thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty clear the message they were sending,'' said
Boeing's Conte. ``They didn't make any bones about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtual reality,'' said economist Conway. ``That's
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its visible presence, Microsoft is not enough to save
Seattle from a likely downturn, economists said. But in the view of
some, the company and its wealthy minions are setting a new tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money now,'' said Quarton.
</P>
<P>
   The REI mountaineering store offers a view of how things have
changed. Its giant wooden lodge near downtown opened last year and
has become Seattle's most popular tourist attraction except for the
space needle.
</P>
<P>
   Landscaped with native conifers, the site boasts a bike path and
a two-story waterfall. Inside, a stone pinnacle for climbers rises
65 feet. A rain booth simulates mountain thunder showers for
Gore-Tex wearers.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors never make it to the mountains, admitted William
Chin, REI's special events coordinator. ``The point is they feel
good coming here,'' he said. ``They're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of such things, a Seattle resident recently complained in a
letter to the Seattle Times that ``it now appears Seattleites' idea
of a good time has switched from outdoor activities to indoor
shopping.''

   ``Well, that's American life now,'' said Quarton. ``We had an
image of being a different sort of place. But reality is reality.
It always has a way of creeping back in.''

 UNDATED: ... marketing fanfare.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gillette could use a blockbuster. Economic problems in Asia,
Russia, and Latin America have hurt US multinationals, and in
Gillette's case those troubles caused the company to disappoint
Wall Street in its earnings for the first time in many years.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced a round of layoffs to improve its
financial position, although it seemed Boston would escape the
heaviest cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, much is riding on the Mach3. Early signs are that
men are embracing the pricey razor with the same enthusiasm with
which they previously snapped up the Sensor and other Gillette
razor innovations. But whether the Mach3 is truly a worldwide smash
hit won't be known until some time in 1999. &QL;

<P>
   After 1998, you'll never hear another skeptical word about the
future of Internet retailing. Consumers at last set aside their
fears of credit-card fraud and shoddy merchandise, and began
spending real money on line.
</P>
<P>
   Burgeoning sales of cheap personal computers have transformed
the Internet from an engineer's playground into a hangout for
millions of average citizens. There are now PCs in about half of
all American homes, and, according to Nua Internet Surveys, an
Irish market research firm, between 70 million and 80 million of us
are on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Get that many Americans together anywhere, and you can certainly
sell them something. Sure enough, a survey taken in November found
that 65 percent of America's Internet users have made purchases on
line, up from only 47 percent in April. And 72 percent of Internet
users planned to do at least some of their holiday shopping on
line.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that Jupiter Communications, the market
research firm in New York, predicted $2.3 billion in on-line
holiday sales this year. That's more than twice the 1997 level. And
as sales of home PCs remain strong, the Internet retailing boom has
only begun. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Microsoft on trial &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, the world's richest man, claimed imperfect memory
and nitpicked government lawyers during lengthy federal court
proceedings in an effort to prevent antitrust regulators from
dismantling his beloved Microsoft Corp. It didn't work, but a
surprising business deal among a group of Microsoft's key rivals
may yet succeed in helping Gates and Co. wriggle off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Microsoft and the Justice Department met head-on in a
Washington, D.C., courtroom. Government attorneys claim that
Microsoft uses unfair tactics to preserve its monopoly in operating
system software for desktop computers, and to expand that monopoly
into other areas of the software business.
</P>
<P>
   So far, court watchers think Microsoft is getting the worst of
it. The government scored point after point by featuring the
testimony of executives from rival companies, who say Microsoft
repeatedly threatened and bullied them to do things Bill's way.
Microsoft's cause wasn't helped when a videotape of Gates's
deposition was played. Gates came across as arrogant and evasive;
some of his answers roused laughter from Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, and even from some Microsoft attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Worse was to come when a federal judge in California ordered
Microsoft to stop offering a version of the Java computing system
not entirely compatible with the one offered by Java's inventor,
Sun Microsystems Inc. Microsoft had licensed Java from Sun but
wanted to make what it called improvements. Sun argued those
changes were intended to make Java work properly only on machines
running Microsoft operating systems. In issuing an injunction, the
judge ruled Sun would probably win at trial _ providing federal
antitrust lawyers with another bit of evidence that Microsoft had
abused its monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft caught a big break when Netscape Communications
Corp., which the government had portrayed as perhaps Microsoft's
biggest victim, agreed to be bought by America Online Inc. for $4
billion, with Sun Microsystems to adopt Netscape server software as
part of the deal. Microsoft claimed the result would be a
reshuffling of the computer market, demonstrating how little real
power Microsoft had. By year's end, even Judge Jackson, who had
seemed hostile to Microsoft, agreed the AOL-Netscape-Sun deal could
undercut government arguments. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Supermarket sweep &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation in the supermarket industry continued apace in
1998, with J Sainsbury PLC, owner of Shaw's Supermarkets Inc.,
announcing plans to buy Star Market Cos. for $490 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Shaw's headquarters in East Bridgewater, Mass., company
officials suggested size is crucial for survival in an industry
that is seeing smaller players get gobbled up. A few years ago, New
England's biggest chain, Stop &AMP; Shop Cos., was bought by a Dutch
company. In fact, with Star soon to be integrated into Shaw's, most
of the big supermarket chains on the East Coast are now owned by
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Is there more consolidation ahead? Most likely. By making
companies more efficient, consolidations are supposed to lead to
lower prices for consumers; 1999 could test that theory. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Breaking ground &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Commercial real estate development in downtown Boston broke a
decade-long hiatus, with new names bringing new money to town.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Partners of New York began construction on a $400
million downtown hotel-cinema-condominium project, on the edge of
Chinatown. Millennium also unveiled plans for a $300 million
hotel-retail-residential complex, capped with a 50-story tower,
straddling the Massachusetts Turnpike near Massachusetts Avenue in
an area heretofore immune to big development.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a $600 million convention center in South Boston
and the completion of the Seaport Hotel across from the World Trade
Center triggered renewed planning and debate over the future of
what has been dubbed the Seaport District, which many expect will
become a major extension of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the $140-million office tower at 10 St. James Avenue
in the Back Bay got under way as office vacancy rates reached their
lowest levels since the 1980s. In the suburbs, speculative office
buildings made a return. And all around the city, small and midsize
hotels sprouted, attesting to pent-up demand for accommodations for
a surge of business travelers.

BETWEEN THE COVERS: BEHIND THE SCENES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two bloodied but unbowed rock veterans have just released
entertaining autobiographies. Both live in the Boston area and are
grizzled pros who have seen their share of sex, drugs, and rock 'n'
roll. One is Al Kooper, the former Bob Dylan organist whose
``Backstage Passes &AMP; Backstabbing Bastards'' is as colorful as its
title. The other is Dinky Dawson, a madcap sound engineer who has
worked with Fleetwood Mac and Steely Dan and whose book, ``Life on
the Road,'' reads like a Jack Kerouac adventure story.
</P>
<P>
   Both tomes have been published by Billboard Books _ and both are
labors of love from authors who have lived life to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good fireside reading,'' says Dawson, who lives in
Plymouth. ``Have a couple of Red Stripes or Newcastle Brown Ales
and you'll drift into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, you'll careen into it, which is how Dawson's career
has gone. The adopted son of a steel-mill foreman in Yorkshire,
England, Dawson shares trenchant memories of a picaresque life of
getting a beer bottle thrown at his van by The Who's Keith Moon
(just another reckless night on the town) and watching the Hell's
Angels hand-deliver a shipment of West Coast LSD for the Mac, which
promptly consumed it that night. And these tales are just the tip
of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson, 51, wrote the book with the aid of Carter Alan, author
of ``Outside is America: U2 in the U.S.'' and a current staffer at
WZLX (101.7FM). They created a real page-turner that has been
selling fast in local stores and through Dawson's Web site at
www.dinkysworld.com.
</P>
<P>
   The anecdotes keep coming, as Dawson recalls seeing Janis Joplin
chase (and catch) Fleetwood Mac guitarist Danny Kirwan for a
romantic tryst. He also recalls seeing a young Rod Stewart working
in a coatroom in Club Mojo in Sheffield and hearing a jam session
with Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and the Mac's Peter Green, though
no one taped it.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, it's a miracle the book was published at all. Dawson,
who also mixed sound for the now-defunct Channel club in South
Boston, suffered a near-fatal brain disease a couple of years ago.
He recovered, he says, through ``acupuncture, vitamins, and walking
five miles a day.'' He has also inked a deal with Salem-based
Rykodisc to release a CD next month of a 1969 Mac concert at the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Kooper's new book is a humorous account of his 40-plus years as
a multi-instrumentalist and a producer for Lynyrd Skynyrd and the
Tubes, among others. Kooper, now 54, grew up in Brooklyn and talked
his way into his first recording session with Dylan, offering to
play Hammond B3 organ (he had never played it before) on Dylan's
``Like a Rolling Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kooper also accompanied Dylan at the famed 1965 Newport Folk
Festival, where Dylan went electric and was booed. Kooper says the
crowd didn't boo Dylan because he went electric, but because he had
rehearsed only 15 minutes of material. As for going electric, Dylan
had already been preceeded that day by electric sets from Paul
Butterfield and the Chambers Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kooper tells of introducing Joni Mitchell to Judy
Collins (who recorded Mitchell's ``Both Sides Now'' for a big hit)
and of playing in the Blues Project and Blood, Sweat &AMP; Tears,
though he pulls no punches in putting down the direction that BS&AMP;T
went after he left: ``If they can live with `Lucretia MacEvil' and
their Las Vegas desecration of `God Bless the Child,' then God
bless them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kooper talks about his wild days as a swinger and
Percodan-abuser, a habit he eventually kicked by himself. He also
recorded the acclaimed ``Super Sessions'' (with Mike Bloomfield and
Stephen Stills on guitar), plus served as assistant stage manager
at the Monterey Pop Festival. Kooper never fit in well with
corporate structures, but did work in the a &AMP; r (artists and
repertoire) departments of Sony and PolyGram.
</P>
<P>
   It's instructive to learn how much of a rock lifer Kooper is.
Even when he was 14, Kooper played with the Royal Teens (``Short
Shorts'' was their hit) and didn't get home until dawn on his first
gig with them.
</P>
<P>
   Kooper recalls ``sitting in the back of that taxi cab . . . with
my Sears guitar and cheezy little 25-watt Ampeg Rocket amp in the
seat beside me, watching the first sunrise I'd ever seen against
the Manhattan skyline. Then pulling up in front of our house in
Queens one step ahead of the milk truck. Passing my father on the
front walk, he on his way to work, me just returning from mine. And
that look on his face as he hurried past me, as if an inner voice
was telling him, `Your son has been lobotomized by Martians
carrying electric guitars. He'll never be the same again.' . . .
Thus ended any pretense I might have had about leading a normal
existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kooper (who now teaches at the Berklee College of Music)
nor Dawson has led a normal life, but they've both written
unusually good books about their travels.

`RATE-SURFER' ALERT: ROUGH SEAS AHEAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It always seems to happen. Savvy consumers find a way to take
advantage of the game, forcing businesses to change the rules.
</P>
<P>
   The latest example of that is in the credit card business.
</P>
<P>
   Smart consumers found a way to keep their credit card interest
rates way down: Sign up for a credit card with a low promotional
rate. When that short-lived teaser rate is about to expire, these
``rate-surfers'' transfer the balance to another bargain card.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rate-surfing has been raised to an art form among some
people,'' said Jim Shanahan, a credit card consultant at Business
Dynamics Consulting in Wilmington, Del., consultants to the
financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the credit card industry is out to teach rate-surfers a
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Issuers are beginning to charge consumers a fee to transfer
balances to their new low-rate card.
</P>
<P>
   First USA, one of the largest credit card issuers and one of the
most aggressive marketers, has started charging a fee of 2 percent
to 3 percent on balances transferred to some of its cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like paying points on a loan,'' said George McCane, First
USA spokesman. ``It's the cost of accessing credit.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the charges relate to ``handling costs and certain risk
factors,'' on which he declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers say lenders figure if you have to endure
the pain of paying balance-transfer fees, you'll think twice before
ditching your new credit card, when the teaser rate runs out, for
one that charges an even lower interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly can have that effect,'' McCane said. ``We view
our balance-transfer fees as part of a strategy to engender
loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Issuers lose when people jump &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Credit card issuers are moving toward these fees because they're
losing money when people jump from card to card, industry analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 million card holders transfer card balances several
times each year, and it costs card issuers about $100 in marketing
and mailing to attract each new card customer, industry experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of banks have lost money on this stuff,'' Shanahan said.
``You can't make money on 4.9 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Providian Financial in San Francisco will offer to beat your
original issuer's rate for a certain period, say, three months, but
then will raise the rates to between 12.99 and 21.99 percent,
depending on what rate a card holder is getting from his or her
current card issuer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are typically in the market for consumers who are actively
using credit,'' said Laurie Cole, Providian spokeswoman. ``We are
hoping to get people who are interested in a long-term
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consumers hold balance of power &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies your power as a consumer _ especially if you carry
a balance _ to get around these moves by issuers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a consumer who generally carries a balance on your
credit card, then you are a prime target for the credit card
industry and you're in a prime negotiating position as well,'' said
Gerri Detweiler, co-author of ``The Ultimate Credit Handbook.''
``It's very hard for issuers to find consumers who carry balances
and who are willing to transfer those balances to a new card.''
</P>
<P>
   If a card issuer wants to charge you a balance-transfer fee,
insist that the fee be waived. These aggressive promotions exist
because there are so many other companies out there hungry for
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very likely that if you qualify for that card, then
you'll qualify for another one,'' Detweiler said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if your credit record is good, contact your bank about its
credit card program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these banks, if they can't compete with these issuers
in terms of marketing dollars, can give a decent rate to
creditworthy people,'' Shanahan said.
</P>
<P>
   There's another way you can get around the balance-transfer
fees.
</P>
<P>
   When you get your next card statement, pay off the balance by
using one of those ``convenience checks'' issued by the card with
the lower rate, said David Gagie, marketing director at Auriemma
Consulting Group in Westbury, N.Y., consultants to the credit card
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who ends up paying that (balance-transfer fee) is not
really being smart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial piece of advice about balance transfers: Always
transfer the balance with a firm plan to pay off the debt. A
balance transfer isn't a license to keep charging up your debt. The
whole purpose of transferring a balance is to keep interest from
piling on so high that you don't make headway in paying off the
bill.

HUMOR IS OPEN TO INTERPRETATION 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another year blessed with rewarding travel experiences _ from
the Caribbean to Canada, Arizona to Austria _ is approaching its
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Though life on the road includes occasional stress and
aggravation, it's nice to find reason to chuckle as the journey
nears home.
</P>
<P>
   So the timing couldn't be better for the arrival in bookstores
of the ninth fun-filled ``do's and taboos'' volume by Roger E.
Axtell. His latest: ``Do's and Taboos of Humo(u)r Around the
World'' (Wiley, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``Laughter has no accent,'' Axtell reminds us in his
introduction. ``And no matter where you travel in our world, there
is one form of communication that is understood _ the smile.''
</P>
<P>
   If only similar understanding through words were guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Axtell's book, like its predecessors, aims to help American
travelers _ especially business executives _ avoid communication
blunders. Many of his stories and tips have a serious tone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What did you say? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, humor can be quite unintentional. Among Axtell's
examples:
</P>
<P>
   ``In Belgium, General Motors used a tag line, `Body by Fisher,'
but when that was translated into Flemish it said, `Corpse by
Fisher.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, Kentucky Fried Chicken's famous slogan
`finger-lickin' good' came out as `eat your fingers off.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Braniff Airlines translated a slogan about its luxurious
upholstery (`Fly in leather') into Spanish, it came out as `Fly
naked.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Axtell tells about a time when, as an executive with the Parker
Pen Co., he sent a fax to a factory manager in Peru. ``In the
message, I explained that I needed a head count. I said: `I need to
know the number of people in your office, broken down by sex, and I
need the information immediately.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The manager dutifully replied: `Here is your head count. Here
we have 35 in our factory, 10 in the office and five in the
hospital _ none broken down by sex.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, in a footnote, he added, `If you must know, our problem
down here is with alcohol.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think before speaking &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Too often, as Axtell illustrates, travelers don't stop to think
clearly before speaking. He relates the story of an American who
asked an Englishman, ``How do you celebrate Thanksgiving in your
country?'' The Englishman paused, smiled and replied dryly, ``I
suppose you could say in Britain we celebrate Thanksgiving on the
Fourth of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Another American, visiting England as part of a tour group, was
impressed by a lovely church not far from Heathrow Airport. ``When
was it built?'' she asked the guide, who responded, ``About 650
years ago.'' ``It's a pity,'' the woman said, ``they built it so
close to the airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Axtell recalls telephoning the front desk at an Indonesian hotel
to request a wake-up call, only to be informed that alarm clocks
were installed in every room for that purpose. `` `But what happens
if it doesn't work?' I asked. After a pause he replied, `Just call
me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was American baseball pitcher Bill Gullickson, who
signed a lucrative contract to play in Japan and was asked about
daily life in that country. ``He replied that language was the most
difficult and different feature,'' Axtell writes. `` `It's crazy,'
he said. `The only American words I saw were Sony and Mitsubishi.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Other travelers know exactly what they are saying. And why.
Axtell's brother, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet fully recovered from a broken leg but required to travel
overseas, he discovered a sure-fire way to fly in comfort. His
conversation with any person in an adjacent seat:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pardon me, are you going to need that airsick bag?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No. Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I normally need more than one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Invariably, the person would raise a hand, carry on a
whispered conversation with the flight attendant and move to
another seat,'' Axtell writes. And his brother would stretch out
over two seats.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes even accurate translations can lead travelers into
uncomfortable situations. Axtell tells of a woman who discreetly
asked the manager of a restaurant in Peru where she could go to
wash her hands. ``The manager ushered her into a bathroom where
some painters happened to be working. When the painters started to
leave, the manager stopped them, saying: `That's OK. Don't leave.
The lady only wants to wash her hands.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A highlight is Axtell's listing of some of those classic mangled
misinterpretations on signs posted all over the world. Let's usher
out the 1998 travel year with a few gems (and if you want to read
more, bookstores stock or can order Axtell's newest publication and
others in the series):
</P>
<P>
   At a Russian cemetery: ``You are welcome to visit the cemetery
where famous Russian and Soviet composers, artists and writers are
buried daily except Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Polish hotel menu: ``Salad a firm's own make; limpid red
beet soup with cheesy dumplings in the form of a finger; roasted
duck let loose; beef rashers beaten up in the country people's
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In an English bathroom: ``Toilet out of order. You are welcome
to use floor below.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Belgian dry cleaner's: ``Men: For best results, drop
trousers here. Ladies: Leave your clothes here and spend the
afternoon having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Hong Kong dress shop: ``Ladies have fits upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   In an Acapulco hotel: ``All the water in this hotel has been
personally passed by the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   And a detour sign in Japan: ``Stop: Drive sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   May all your detours lead to fun-filled adventures. And no
matter what you say or how you say it, keep smiling. &QL;

START NOW TO GET A JUMP ON WEEDS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I would like to get a jump on lawn weeds. How can I eliminate
weeds in flower beds?
</P>
<P>
   A: &UR;  &LR; Other gardeners have asked about weeds recently, so while
you plant winter color such as dianthus, snapdragons, pansies,
ornamental kale and cabbage and a round of prechilled tulips, use
the time to remove weeds in your beds. It's a great way to work out
stress. Mulch will improve the appearance of your new plantings,
help retain some soil moisture and warmth for the roots and help
keep weeds down.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-emergent herbicides applied in late winter/early spring can
prevent annual weeds in your beds, and you can spot-treat weeds
that already have sprouted with a herbicide containing glyphosates.
Do not let the latter touch desirable plants. Again, I encourage
you to be as organic as possible.
</P>
<P>
   As you pull and plant, think about your lawn. A healthy lawn
generated by proper fertilizing, watering and mowing is your first
line of defense in controlling weeds. However, if your lawn has
become thin through neglect or weather-related reasons, you may
want to move to another level of weed control. (More on herbicides
in just a minute.) This year's drought, then extra-heavy rains,
have certainly taken a toll on lawns and other plants.
</P>
<P>
   Weeds gain ground through weak spots in a lawn. They thrive
where turfgrass has fallen victim to stress. Bare spots, thin
patches of grass, and diseased or insect-infested areas invite the
seeds of unwanted plants, or weeds.
</P>
<P>
   During the growing season, proper watering, mowing and
fertilizing will promote healthy, thick growth that gives turf a
competing edge over weeds. Don't overwater, as many weeds thrive in
moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Aerate the soil _ either with special aerating shoes or with a
pitchfork.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended mowing height for St. Augustine is 2 { to 3
inches. If you use a mulching mower, the small grass bits will
break down and replenish soil nutrients. Mow {-inch higher during
dry, hot weather to keep roots shaded. Mow high in shaded areas.
That extra bit of leaf surface is needed for photosynthesis to make
up for reduced sunlight. Taller blades block the light needed to
ensure weed seed germination. Mow close and you open up the area to
weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Fertilize the lawn after the grass greens in spring and is
growing and in late October or early November.
</P>
<P>
   A dense turf crowds out weeds, discourages perennial weeds from
spreading and shades the soil, preventing waiting weed seeds from
germinating. When a healthy lawn starts growing in spring,
cool-season weeds become less noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Each year a long roster of weeds confronts the gardener. It's
helpful to keep in mind that there are warm-season annuals and
perennials and cool-season annuals and perennials. There are
products for each. Use the right product at the right time. The
trick to using a herbicide is to know the type of turfgrass you
have and which weeds you want to eliminate. Labels list target
weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Used improperly, weedkillers can do a lot of harm. Certain
herbicides will kill certain grasses. And don't use them in edible
gardens.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of weedkillers: pre-emergent and
post-emergent. Pre-emergent herbicides are applied in early spring
to deter warm-season annual weeds and in early fall to prevent
outbreaks of cool-season annual weeds. If you use such products
after the seeds germinate, you've wasted your time and money.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to prevent crabgrass, a warm-season annual, from
emerging, apply a pre-emergent herbicide about two weeks before the
last anticipated frost.
</P>
<P>
   Henbit and chickweed, two cool-season annuals that germinate in
fall, may be deterred with a pre-emergent weedkiller applied in
early fall. Gallery is one pre-emergent product.
</P>
<P>
   Post-emergents attack weeds after they've sprouted and are most
effective when applied to young weeds. The older the weed, the more
difficult it is to control.
</P>
<P>
   According to the research I've done, post-emergents are a more
effective control of perennial weeds. Ortho's Weed-B-Gon for
Southern Lawns is one post-emergent control that can be used on St.
Augustine turf for control of chickweed, dandelions, henbit, oxalis
and other broad-leaved weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia buttonweed is a warm-season perennial that can be a
nuisance in Houston lawns. This matting, fleshy-leafed weed has
small white flowers and green seed pods that resemble green beads.
It spreads underground, so pre-emergents aren't effective. You'll
have to repeat post-emergent applications. Image is said to be
helpful. You can pull it, too, to chisel away at the root network.
</P>
<P>
   Pesky nutsedge (nutgrass) is particularly adept at popping up in
bare spots, but it loses ground in a thick lawn of St. Augustine.
Again, Image is a post-emergent product that helps control
nutsedge.
</P>
<P>
   I hesitate to use product names in this column, but I was asked
to be specific. Ask your certified nurseryman for information
before selecting a herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   Take special note: Only materials recommended for St. Augustine
grass should be used on St. Augustine lawns, as the turf might be
damaged by some chemicals that are safe for Bermuda grass or other
turf. Repeat applications may be necessary for both pre-emergent
and post-emergent herbicides. Follow label recommendations for all
herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   You might consider this, too: It's best to fertilize a lawn
after it has greened and is growing in spring. Pre-emergents for
warm-season lawn weeds must be applied before it's time to apply a
spring fertilizer; therefore weed-and-feed formulas may not be the
answer.

 &HT;    __ What do you give a man who has Alzheimer's disease? Ronald
Reagan's daughter gets an unexpected answer. __
 &HT;    ........................
 &HT;    Christmas is supposed to be about giving _ not so much the
material kind, but giving of the self, the soul, the heart. Giving
at any time is supposed to be about that, but it's easy to forget,
particularly at Christmas. The concept gets buried beneath Neiman
Marcus catalogues, lists, bills.
 &HT;    My grandmother understood the essence of giving and never forgot
it. In the '40s and '50s, Nelle Reagan regularly visited
tuberculosis patients at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar,
Calif. She had little money, but believed that giving to others is
a vital part of life. She always brought the patients something,
even if it was just a card or a pencil.
 &HT;    But when people close to you are ill, especially if death is
whispering in their ears, you want to give them impossible things _
more time, less pain, an escape from long nights of fear. A friend
of mine recently found out that cancer has conquered vast regions
of his body. His chemo treatments are a race against time. Many of
his nights are spent sitting in a chair, fighting pain.
 &HT;    ``It's so quiet then,'' he said. ``When it gets so late and
everyone's asleep.'' Alone with his pain and his fear, the hours
crawl slowly.
 &HT;    Although my father is not in pain, he loses more of himself each
month to Alzheimer's. For him, as for anyone who has this disease,
time is the enemy. It becomes jumbled, confused, compressed and
emptier all the time _ hollowed out.
 &HT;    My brother Michael and I meet at our father's office with gifts
for him _ ours and our brother Ron's. Ron wasn't sure when he'd be
down from Seattle and we wanted to give our gifts all at once. My
sister, Maureen, had made other arrangements for hers.
 &HT;    We have all thought along the same lines: What will he like to
look at, what will hold his attention or, even better, tug at his
imagination? We've brought picture books, mostly of nature scenes,
and chocolates _ a forbidden treat.
 &HT;    And a snow globe. When I saw it, I remembered that when I was a
child my father would describe white, snowy Christmases,
transporting me from the brilliant sunshine of a California
December. It seemed perfect to give him a miniature replica of
Christmas, a fantasy encased in glass.
 &HT;    My father's office is high above Los Angeles. Blue sky and
rooftops are the view from his windows. He still goes there for a
couple of hours on weekday mornings. There isn't much for him to
do, but that isn't the point. It's a routine, and with Alzheimer's
routines are important. They structure time, fill the hours.
 &HT;    There is something comforting about cluttering up his desk with
gifts and cards. These days, it's mostly empty. A yellow pad that's
never written on is always in the same place, and has been for
months. I watch his hands as he tries to be careful, peeling tape
from the wrappings. Then he just tears it, giving in to impatience,
perhaps. His eyes light up at the chocolates; for a moment, we're
co-conspirators, bringing him a delicacy he rarely gets.
 &HT;    ``Those are all for you, Dad,'' Michael tells him. ``You don't
have to share them with anyone.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, good,'' he says playfully, pulling them toward him.
 &HT;    He becomes engrossed in the books, the photographs of lakes and
meadows and mountains. He turns the snow globe and smiles at the
tiny winter wonderland. I tell him that when he tires of the
sunshine outside the window, he can just look into the snow globe
and change the season.
 &HT;    He looks straight into my eyes and says flatly, ``OK.''
 &HT;    And I wonder, as I often do, if he knows that sometimes I search
for amusing things to say to him.
 &HT;    I'm not sure if my father still understands Christmas, but I'm
certain he understands giving. And for the time we are there, so do
Michael and I. We are removed from the madness of shopping malls
and parking problems. When my brother and I leave, I ask him who
was given the greater gift, our father or us. He doesn't need to
answer me; we both know.
 &HT;    The next day, I give my friend who has cancer a round piece of
polished rose quartz that fits neatly into the palm of the hand and
feels cool and soothing. I thought he could hold it during the long
nights when he sits in a chair trying to bargain with his pain.
 &HT;    It shouldn't take illness or tragedy to remind us what Christmas
is supposed to be about. Yet, sadly, it usually does. Recently, I
went hiking in the hills and stopped at a waterfall and a pool,
shaded by tall trees. I sat on a rock and listened to the water,
the breeze shivering the leaves, a bird's wings overhead.
 &HT;    I wished I could give that to my father and my friend, who
always believed he would live much longer than he will live. I
wished I could give them both the peace of those few moments, the
sweetness of those sounds, the serenity of that spot. I can't.
 &HT;    But I can remember the true nature of giving, at Christmas and
at every other time. That might be almost as good.

and parking problems. When my brother and I leave, I ask him who
was given the greater gift, our father or us. He doesn't need to
answer me; we both know.
 &HT;    The next day, I give my friend who has cancer a round piece of
polished rose quartz that fits neatly into the palm of the hand and
feels cool and soothing. I thought he could hold it during the long
nights when he sits in a chair trying to bargain with his pain.
 &HT;    It shouldn't take illness or tragedy to remind us what Christmas
is supposed to be about. Yet, sadly, it usually does. Recently, I
went hiking in the hills and stopped at a waterfall and a pool,
shaded by tall trees. I sat on a rock and listened to the water,
the breeze shivering the leaves, a bird's wings overhead.
 &HT;    I wished I could give that to my father and my friend, who
always believed he would live much longer than he will live. I
wished I could give them both the peace of those few moments, the
sweetness of those sounds, the serenity of that spot. I can't.
 &HT;    But I can remember the true nature of giving, at Christmas and
at every other time. That might be almost as good.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     (Editors: Because of its timeliness, we are moving this article
in your Centerpiece package early. Happy Holidays!) 
 &HT;    __ What do you give a man who has Alzheimer's disease? Ronald
Reagan's daughter gets an unexpected answer. __
 &HT;    ........................
 &HT;    Christmas is supposed to be about giving _ not so much the
material kind, but giving of the self, the soul, the heart. Giving
at any time is supposed to be about that, but it's easy to forget,
particularly at Christmas. The concept gets buried beneath Neiman
Marcus catalogues, lists, bills.
 &HT;    My grandmother understood the essence of giving and never forgot
it. In the '40s and '50s, Nelle Reagan regularly visited
tuberculosis patients at Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar,
Calif. She had little money, but believed that giving to others is
a vital part of life. She always brought the patients something,
even if it was just a card or a pencil.
 &HT;    But when people close to you are ill, especially if death is
whispering in their ears, you want to give them impossible things _
more time, less pain, an escape from long nights of fear. A friend
of mine recently found out that cancer has conquered vast regions
of his body. His chemo treatments are a race against time. Many of
his nights are spent sitting in a chair, fighting pain.
 &HT;    ``It's so quiet then,'' he said. ``When it gets so late and
everyone's asleep.'' Alone with his pain and his fear, the hours
crawl slowly.
 &HT;    Although my father is not in pain, he loses more of himself each
month to Alzheimer's. For him, as for anyone who has this disease,
time is the enemy. It becomes jumbled, confused, compressed and
emptier all the time _ hollowed out.
 &HT;    My brother Michael and I meet at our father's office with gifts
for him _ ours and our brother Ron's. Ron wasn't sure when he'd be
down from Seattle and we wanted to give our gifts all at once. My
sister, Maureen, had made other arrangements for hers.
 &HT;    We have all thought along the same lines: What will he like to
look at, what will hold his attention or, even better, tug at his
imagination? We've brought picture books, mostly of nature scenes,
and chocolates _ a forbidden treat.
 &HT;    And a snow globe. When I saw it, I remembered that when I was a
child my father would describe white, snowy Christmases,
transporting me from the brilliant sunshine of a California
December. It seemed perfect to give him a miniature replica of
Christmas, a fantasy encased in glass.
 &HT;    My father's office is high above Los Angeles. Blue sky and
rooftops are the view from his windows. He still goes there for a
couple of hours on weekday mornings. There isn't much for him to
do, but that isn't the point. It's a routine, and with Alzheimer's
routines are important. They structure time, fill the hours.
 &HT;    There is something comforting about cluttering up his desk with
gifts and cards. These days, it's mostly empty. A yellow pad that's
never written on is always in the same place, and has been for
months. I watch his hands as he tries to be careful, peeling tape
from the wrappings. Then he just tears it, giving in to impatience,
perhaps. His eyes light up at the chocolates; for a moment, we're
co-conspirators, bringing him a delicacy he rarely gets.
 &HT;    ``Those are all for you, Dad,'' Michael tells him. ``You don't
have to share them with anyone.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, good,'' he says playfully, pulling them toward him.
 &HT;    He becomes engrossed in the books, the photographs of lakes and
meadows and mountains. He turns the snow globe and smiles at the
tiny winter wonderland. I tell him that when he tires of the
sunshine outside the window, he can just look into the snow globe
and change the season.
 &HT;    He looks straight into my eyes and says flatly, ``OK.''
 &HT;    And I wonder, as I often do, if he knows that sometimes I search
for amusing things to say to him.
 &HT;    I'm not sure if my father still understands Christmas, but I'm
certain he understands giving. And for the time we are there, so do
Michael and I. We are removed from the madness of shopping malls
and parking problems. When my brother and I leave, I ask him who
was given the greater gift, our father or us. He doesn't need to
answer me; we both know.
 &HT;    The next day, I give my friend who has cancer a round piece of
polished rose quartz that fits neatly into the palm of the hand and
feels cool and soothing. I thought he could hold it during the long
nights when he sits in a chair trying to bargain with his pain.
 &HT;    It shouldn't take illness or tragedy to remind us what Christmas
is supposed to be about. Yet, sadly, it usually does. Recently, I
went hiking in the hills and stopped at a waterfall and a pool,
shaded by tall trees. I sat on a rock and listened to the water,
the breeze shivering the leaves, a bird's wings overhead.
 &HT;    I wished I could give that to my father and my friend, who
always believed he would live much longer than he will live. I
wished I could give them both the peace of those few moments, the
sweetness of those sounds, the serenity of that spot. I can't.
 &HT;    But I can remember the true nature of giving, at Christmas and
at every other time. That might be almost as good.

CLINTON SAYS SOCIAL SECURITY PROTECTED AGAINST COMPUTER BUG

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton declared Monday that the
computers controlling the nation's Social Security system are ready
for the Year 2000 computer bug, ensuring that benefits to 48
million older Americans won't be halted in January of that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This problem won't delay checks a single day,'' Clinton said
at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   He said the computer systems that each year make 860 million
payments worth more than $1 billion on behalf of the Social
Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the
Internal Revenue Service and other agencies will work on Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was truly a stunning achievement,'' he said of the
agencies' work to solve the so-called Y2K problem that threatens to
shut down computers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that earlier this month an independent contractor
confirmed after testing the system for those agencies that the
computers would work. But the president warned that the computer
glitch continues to threaten the country and that a great deal more
work needs to be done to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This involves everyone who depends on computers, which is
nearly all of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to White House officials, 61 percent of federal
computer systems are now Y2K compliant, up from 27 percent a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agencies face a March deadline to finish their computer
repairs and are required to send status reports on their efforts to
the White House and Congress on a quarterly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success of the Social Security and other systems,
congressional overseers, such as Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah,
chairman of the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000 Problem,
have said that many other government agencies, including the
Departments of Defense and State, are hopelessly behind.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional reports estimate that the cost to fix the federal
government's computer systems will be $6.4 billion. In addition,
the reports say that many smaller state and local government
agencies are far behind schedule and may not be Y2K compliant in
time.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from the fact that many computers originally
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year will
fail or give out wrong information on Jan. 1, 2000, when those
machines will assume it is 1900.
</P>
<P>
   The failure could also come when one computer system that thinks
the year is 1900 interacts with another computer system that thinks
the year is 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Some computers can be reprogrammed through tedious review of and
changes to their software code, but many devices have embedded
microchips that must be physically replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer experts warn that the Y2K problem could cause
massive disruptions to everyday life as computers controlling
banks, rail systems, power grids and other essential facilities
shut down or malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that on Jan. 1, 2000, power comes on,
that water continues to run, that the most vital functions of daily
life are completely safe,'' Bennett said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists also have warned that closed factories and
disabled transportations systems could send the United States,
along with the rest of the world, into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist of the investment firm Deutsche
Morgan Grenfell's North American division, predicted that the
economic disruptions caused by the Year 2000 problem could cause a
recession as severe as the economic downturn of 1974-1975. That
recession was triggered by the Middle East's oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's is no doubt that this will be cause some serious
disturbances in the United States,'' he said in a statement Monday.
``The question is how big will they be, and that will depend on
what we do from this point on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yardeni, who gained a large following on Wall Street when he
correctly forecasted the stock market boom of the early 1990s,
currently estimates that there is a 70 percent chance that the Year
2000 computer bug will cause a worldwide recession.

   SCI-GRAVITY-LENS (Undated) _ Far away in the cosmos, where
everything is separated by distances measured in hundreds and
billions of light-years, sometimes a galaxy or cluster of galaxies
in the foreground intersects the light from a more distant object.
The conjunction plays visual tricks, producing mirages that are
becoming a practical tool of astronomy, a kind of natural
telescope. Aided by more sensitive cameras and advanced computer
technologies, systematic searches of the heavens are yielding an
increasing number of examples of such celestial phenomena, known as
gravitational lenses. Scientists are learning to interpret these
distorting and magnifying lensing events for revealing clues in the
most intractable mysteries of the universe. By John Noble Wilford.

   SCI-BABERUTH-CANCER (Undated) _ The Doctor's World column: This
year, the 50th anniversary of Babe Ruth's death, his sports legacy
has been extolled again as baseball heroes of newer generations
breezed past the home-run record the Babe held for 34 years, until
1961. But unknown to many, Ruth also left a legacy in the annals of
medical history. In fact, he was among the first patients anywhere
to receive experimental chemotherapy, and some researchers say he
was the first ever to receive a combination treatment of
chemotherapy and radiation for his type of cancer. By Lawrence K.
Altman Jr. (2200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-IMMORTAL-CELLS (Undated) _ Life and death lie nowhere so
close together as in the human cell's counting device for limiting
how often it can divide. The device is a sort of tally stick that
gets shorter at each division. When it runs out, the cell dies. New
research on cell division demonstrates the potential to overrule
the counter and ``provide therapeutic opportunities for age-related
diseases.'' according to one team of researchers. Researchers are
pleased now that even after multiple divisions of cells, far beyond
their normal life of 50 divisions of so, the cells show no
cancerous tendencies. By Nicholas Wade. (900 words).
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PRAIRIE-CHICKENS (Urbana, Ill.) _ For six decades,
conservationists in Illinois tried to save the greater prairie
chickens that once covered the state like its sea of grass.
Nonetheless, the showy little birds, beloved for their flamboyant
mating rituals, began a headlong population collapse to fewer than
50. Now a team of geneticists and ecologists from state agencies
and the University of Illinois has reversed that decline and, for
one of the first times in a wild population, documented how
inbreeding and loss of habitat reinforced each other to create what
an ``extinction vortex.'' By Jo Thomas. (1475 words)
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ISOTOPES-BUTTERFLIES (Undated) _ Every winter, after flying
south from the Eastern United States, millions of monarch
butterflies festoon fir trees in the mountains of Mexico, creating
one of the world's most dazzling and famous biological spectacles.
But in spite of interest in these insects, details of their travels
have largely remained a mystery. Now, three new studies herald the
arrival of a powerful new technique that can identify, sometimes to
within a few miles, where migrating animals have been. The new
technique takes advantage of different forms, known as isotopes, of
chemical elements. Biologists have begun discovering that these
isotopes, present in different amounts in different regions, can
leave a distinctive chemical signature written in the feather of a
bird or the wing of a butterfly living in that region. By Carol
Kasek Yoon. (1325 words)
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CERNETTES (Undated) _ The language of physics is not exactly
the stuff of song lyrics, but the Cernettes, billed as the world's
first particle physics rock band, have hit the Internet. Even if
nonphysicists fail to get their musical jokes, the Cernettes count
on an audience of admiring scientists. By Malcolm W. Browne. (880
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: I read that
quinoa, a grain from the Andes, is very high in calcium. How high?
What are some other nondairy sources of calcium? (285 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Shorts on science: Items on ancient global
warming, how fish perceive what's around them, pollution that
crosses the Pacific and a newly named telescope. (720 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Health and Fitness &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ORNISH-DIET (Undated) _ Dr. Dean Ornish advocated a diet of
virtually no fat, no sugar, no caffeine and minimal sodium and
claims it helps patients' cardiovascular systems. While he has some
supporters in the medical profession, others say this his studies
involve so few patients over such a short time that no conclusions
about benefits can be drawn from his tightly regulated and highly
promoted program. By Gina Kolata. (1935 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Only about 15 percent of Americans
now consume the recommended minimum of five servings a day of
fruits and vegetables, the foods most closely linked to leanness
and health, but with a little effort and planning people can easily
work those food groups and healthier foods into their diets. By
Jane E. Brody. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-EXERCISE (Undated) _ An essay: a vow to exercise
less. It's time to stop and smell the roses, or at least something
other than the guy sweating on the next treadmill. By Andrea
Higbie. (725 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DRUG-SAFETY (Undated) _ When a drug harms patients, there is
no independent agency to find out what went wrong. Instead, the
government relies on doctors to report problems voluntarily, and
the job of investigating then falls to the same people who put the
drug on the market in the first place: the FDA, which approved the
drug, and the pharmaceutical company that manufactured it. In a
recent issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, three doctors
compared airplane safety and drug safety, noting that drug
reactions kill 100,000 Americans a year, vastly more than plane
crashes. They suggested that the United States needed an
independent drug safety agency, analogous to the transportation
board. By Denise Grady. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TAXI-SAFETY (Undated) _ Despite taped reminders to buckle up
from Eartha Kitt, Joe Torre, Joan Rivers and Placido Domingo and
increased accessibility of seat belts in New York taxis, a new
survey reports that passengers are not fastening themselves in.
(285 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Shorts on health and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _If every little millimeter counts in the height of your
children, a spring or fall birth might give them an edge.
Researchers are not sure why. (300 words)

PUT FINANCIAL PLAN IN BLACK AND WHITE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a writer, I know the power of writing your ideas down.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about taking the trouble to put our ideas down
on paper that solidifies them and forces us to weed out the
extraneous stuff.
</P>
<P>
   You can tap this power to help you develop a plan that will help
you achieve your goals for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   This effort doesn't have to be anything elaborate. The key is to
simply put down your ideas and use them to guide you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where am I today, where do I want to go and how am I going to
get there?'' said Woody Laywell, a certified financial planner at
Laywell Financial Resources in Houston. ``It does not have to be
rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Be specific &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Be as specific as possible about your plan so you can estimate
the real costs and benefits of your ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just say, `I want to take a trip,' you could end up
anywhere,'' said Wynette Stuntz, a partner and certified financial
planner at Allen, Hampton, Stuntz &AMP; Welsh Financial Services in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After listing your spending and saving goals, prioritize them.
Which ones are the most important? What do you want to accomplish
first?
</P>
<P>
   Write them down in the present tense. That makes them seem more
achievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does something to your subconscious,'' Stuntz said. ``Your
subconscious mind accepts orders that are in the present tense
better than it does orders that are in the future tense.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, don't just write, ``I want to get rich,'' because
that's too vague.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better to write, ``I have $100,000 on Dec. 31,
2005.'' What you're doing is reinforcing your subconscious on what
you want to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Being specific and active in your thinking is especially
important in setting retirement goals.
</P>
<P>
   Set an age when you want to have enough money on hand so you
won't have to keep working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then set a specific dollar amount that you want to have coming
in from all sources in today's dollars at that age _ a gross dollar
amount to make you independent of the need to work,'' Stuntz said.
</P>
<P>
   After you've written down a goal, list ways to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may mean that I will have to make reasonable sacrifices
today to obtain those future goals,'' Laywell said. ``A person with
a sheet of paper, with a calculator, their checkbook, can determine
what their spending is, where they might be able to conserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Every one of us can cut out some fat in our spending.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever steps you take to achieve your goals, do them
consistently and review what you've done periodically to see if
you're on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, you should review it monthly until you get on track
and get comfortable with what you're doing,'' Laywell said.
</P>
<P>
   If you're married, it's crucial that you and your spouse work
together as a team to write down a financial plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to talk about it and agree about it, because you
can't do it unilaterally,'' Laywell said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keep it simple &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't write off your effort. Keep your plan simple. If
you set unrealistic goals, you risk getting discouraged and giving
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason a lot of people fail is because they make it too
complicated,'' Laywell said. ``They say, `I can't do this, so it
won't fit at all.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Don't try to achieve too many goals at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will have better success if you focus on one goal at a
time,'' Stuntz said. ``If you diversify too much, you're pulled off
in too many directions and you end up not accomplishing anything at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get bogged down in picky details.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make the monitoring of this so much by trying to
evaluate jot and tittle, and you can find yourself doing more
detail and you become frustrated,'' Laywell said. ``That's not
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't give up if you deviate from your written plan. A big part
of a financial plan will call for your changing behavior that took
years and years to build up. Old habits die hard, and you will trip
up once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason people fail is they expect too much, too soon when
they start making changes in their financial management,'' Laywell
said.
</P>
<P>
   So don't rip into yourself too harshly for periodic mistakes.
The trick is to not mess up all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Married couples, don't beat each other up. Putting your plans
down on paper literally calls for you both to be on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three steps forward and two back are still progress,'' Laywell
said.

SOLAR STORMS MAY SHOWER EARTH WITH PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The sun goes a little crazy now and then by
hurling million-degree fireballs and star-sized, electrically
charged clouds toward Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Its next celestial fit is likely in mid-2000, possibly even next
summer, and could disrupt the huge electricity grids that link
power systems across the continent, and cause problems with cell
phones and other technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more vulnerable than we used to be because of the
increasing interconnection of society,'' said Don J. Michels, a
solar physicist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The solar phenomenon has already started.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two years, you can easily see an increase in solar
activity,'' said Steve Hill, a researcher at NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the
Defense Department are scrambling to launch satellites that can
give advance warning of incoming solar storms. The military is
especially concerned because of the possible failure of
reconnaissance satellites during a military engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists hope to improve their understanding of the
sun's structure and behavior by launching satellites such as HESSI,
the High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, now being designed at
the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Planned for launch in mid-2000, HESSI will study X-rays and
gamma rays from solar flares and ``coronal mass ejections,'' vast
clouds of electrically charged particles, said Jay Trimble, the
HESSI integration test manager.
</P>
<P>
   On reaching Earth, the particles warp Earth's magnetic field.
The field gyrations induce electrical currents in power lines that
can short-circuit them. The longer the line, the greater the
electrical surge, making long-distance power lines particularly
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies such as NASA, the National Science Foundation, the
Boulder, Colo.-based Space Science Institute and others are trying
to spread the word about the coming threat.
</P>
<P>
   A harbinger of what may come during the disruptions occurred in
May, when a powerful solar storm tripled and quadrupled electrical
currents in the ionosphere, the thick envelope of ionized air
overhead, said researcher Daniel Baker of the University of
Colorado. The greater the electrical current, the greater the risk
to sensitive electronic gear, communications systems, power lines
and other societal infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The solar breakdown might come sooner than expected, said
Richard C. Altrock, a U.S. Air Force scientist. He expects the
solar storms to peak in mid-1999, a year earlier than other
forecasts, based on his observations of a solar phenomenon
whimsically known as the ``Rush to the Poles.''
</P>
<P>
   At a solar observatory in Arizona, Altrock has observed solar
gases rich in ionized iron steadily flowing toward the sun's north
and south poles. Such flows have preceded the last two solar storms
by an average of 15 to 17 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current rush began in February 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Already we're starting to (detect) quite large flares and mass
ejections that are impacting our Earth.''
</P>

   SCI-GRAVITY-LENS (Undated) _ Far away in the cosmos, where
everything is separated by distances measured in hundreds and
billions of light-years, sometimes a galaxy or cluster of galaxies
in the foreground intersects the light from a more distant object.
The conjunction plays visual tricks, producing mirages that are
becoming a practical tool of astronomy, a kind of natural
telescope. Aided by more sensitive cameras and advanced computer
technologies, systematic searches of the heavens are yielding an
increasing number of examples of such celestial phenomena, known as
gravitational lenses. Scientists are learning to interpret these
distorting and magnifying lensing events for revealing clues in the
most intractable mysteries of the universe. By John Noble Wilford.

   SCI-BABERUTH-CANCER (Undated) _ The Doctor's World column: This

has been extolled again as baseball heroes of newer generations
breezed past the home-run record the Babe held for 34 years, until
1961. But unknown to many, Ruth also left a legacy in the annals of
medical history. In fact, he was among the first patients anywhere
to receive experimental chemotherapy, and some researchers say he
was the first ever to receive a combination treatment of
chemotherapy and radiation for his type of cancer. By Lawrence K.
Altman Jr. (2200 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-IMMORTAL-CELLS (Undated) _ Life and death lie nowhere so
close together as in the human cell's counting device for limiting
how often it can divide. The device is a sort of tally stick that
gets shorter at each division. When it runs out, the cell dies. New
research on cell division demonstrates the potential to overrule
the counter and ``provide therapeutic opportunities for age-related
diseases.'' according to one team of researchers. Researchers are
pleased now that even after multiple divisions of cells, far beyond
their normal life of 50 divisions of so, the cells show no
cancerous tendencies. By Nicholas Wade. (900 words).

   SCI-PRAIRIE-CHICKENS (Urbana, Ill.) _ For six decades,
conservationists in Illinois tried to save the greater prairie
chickens that once covered the state like its sea of grass.
Nonetheless, the showy little birds, beloved for their flamboyant
mating rituals, began a headlong population collapse to fewer than
50. Now a team of geneticists and ecologists from state agencies
and the University of Illinois has reversed that decline and, for
one of the first times in a wild population, documented how
inbreeding and loss of habitat reinforced each other to create what
an ``extinction vortex.'' By Jo Thomas. (1475 words)

   SCI-ISOTOPES-BUTTERFLIES (Undated) _ Every winter, after flying
south from the Eastern United States, millions of monarch
butterflies festoon fir trees in the mountains of Mexico, creating
one of the world's most dazzling and famous biological spectacles.
But in spite of interest in these insects, details of their travels
have largely remained a mystery. Now, three new studies herald the
arrival of a powerful new technique that can identify, sometimes to
within a few miles, where migrating animals have been. The new
technique takes advantage of different forms, known as isotopes, of
chemical elements. Biologists have begun discovering that these
isotopes, present in different amounts in different regions, can
leave a distinctive chemical signature written in the feather of a
bird or the wing of a butterfly living in that region. By Carol

   SCI-DRUG-SAFETY (Undated) _ When a drug harms patients, there is
no independent agency to find out what went wrong. Instead, the
government relies on doctors to report problems voluntarily, and
the job of investigating then falls to the same people who put the
drug on the market in the first place: the FDA, which approved the
drug, and the pharmaceutical company that manufactured it. In a
recent issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, three doctors
compared airplane safety and drug safety, noting that drug
reactions kill 100,000 Americans a year, vastly more than plane
crashes. They suggested that the United States needed an
independent drug safety agency, analogous to the transportation
board. By Denise Grady. (1000 words)

 &HT;    As 2000 nears, predictions of doom and delight collide
 &HT;    (Eds: This is the first of weekly columns by Atlanta
Constitution editorial writer Marilyn Geewax on issues raised by
the coming of 2000.)
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday night, when you start the 10-9-8-etc. ritual and pop
the champagne, yell and kiss everyone, it may be the last fun New
Year's Eve party you'll have for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   At least that is the advice of some experts working on the
computer problem commonly called the Y2K bug. Despite all the
turmoil we're in because of the presidential impeachment process,
1998 soon will be remembered as the good old days. As 1999 unfolds,
awareness of Y2K will grow, and panic will spread as people prepare
for the worst, they predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``By this time next year, there will be rationing at the grocery
store,'' predicts Harrison Fox, staff member of the U.S. House
subcommittee on technology. Speaking in mid-December at a World
Future Society conference on Y2K held in Washington, Fox said it's
``very likely'' next year's 2000 celebrations will be marred by
blackouts and fuel shortages caused by the inability of many
computers to recognize the date 1-1-00.
</P>
<P>
   A few Y2K extremists are even predicting disruptions so severe
that society as we know it will break down.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Isn't next year's changeover supposed to be the
biggest party ever?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, according to travel agents, party planners and many
economists who insist Y2K worries are overblown. Sure, there may be
a flickering light here or there, but in general, the computer
problem is being fixed and by Dec. 31, 1999, the world will be
bracing only for the biggest party in history.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists note, for example, that although some banks'
automated teller machines might not work after midnight on 1-1-00,
the party will go on. Consumers will be forewarned about ATMs so
they can take out cash in advance. Indeed, the Federal Reserve
System already is preparing for this and has announced that the
financial system will make plenty of cash available leading up to
Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most Americans are siding with the optimists. Walt
Disney World's 27 hotels have long been reporting ``no general
availability'' for Dec. 31, 1999. Many cruises are booked solid.
</P>
<P>
   And for many people, the more expensive the party, the better.
Though dinner and a bottle of champagne may do for New Year's Eve
1998, travel agents say affluent Americans are seeking a
``once-in-a-lifetime'' experience for 1999, hoping to be gazing up
at Egypt's Great Pyramid of Cheops or standing on China's Great
Wall when the calendar flips to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many trend watchers are predicting that productivity
will decline next year between Christmas and New Year's, but not
because of Y2K problems. The atmosphere will be so exuberant, they
predict, most Americans will be unable to concentrate on their
jobs; instead, they'll be staging a weeklong party.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike controversies that never end, the debate over whether
it's best to celebrate New Year's Eve 1999 in a bunker or on a
cruise ship will be settled. By Jan. 1, 2000, we'll know whether
the doomsdayers or the partiers had the right idea.
</P>
<P>
   But many Y2K experts insist theirs is the safer bet. They point
out that older computer programs, as well as the silicon chips
embedded in machinery, were not designed to recognize dates beyond
1999. The pessimists predict that when those date-sensitive
programs and embedded processors hit 1-1-00, computers and chips
will become confused and fail. Such failures will throw off
electric generators, gas pipeline valves, building security systems
and much more, causing a widespread breakdown of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not wise to plan for big celebrations,'' said Paula
Gordon, a visiting professor at George Washington University and a
Y2K expert. She fears that tipsy partiers will get caught up in a
chaotic night of blackouts and transportation failures after
midnight on Jan. 1, 2000. ``We should postpone celebrations until
2001,'' she said, because that would give computer programmers time
to fix any systems that might fail in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The worst idea for Dec. 31, 1999, would be to travel by air, she
said. ``Next year will be a good time to have a party with friends
who live within walking distance. If nothing goes wrong at
midnight, then all well and good. But it just would not be wise''
to count on any computer-dependent means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   One interesting suggestion for this year's party: Get a video
camera or audio tape recorder and ask friends to make predictions
for Dec. 31, 1999. Will it be the party of a lifetime? Or the end
of partying as we have known it?
</P>
<P>
   Then start counting down the days ...

FOG CAUSES FLIGHT DELAYS IN BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dense fog envoloped the San Francisco Bay area
Sunday and early Monday, stranding thousands of airline passengers
trying to go home after the Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
   All flights were canceled in and out of San Jose and Oakland
Sunday night. Flights that were already in the air when the
airports were shut were diverted to Sacramento and, in some cases,
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco International Airport, where as many as 300
stranded passengers spent Sunday night, faced more delays on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fog was attributed to a high pressure ridge over the Bay
area that acted as a lid on the cold, damp ground level air, said
Jim Carroll of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco International was a sea of confusion Sunday night,
when fog caused delays of up to three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Although the crowds had thinned by early Monday, thousands of
stranded travelers were still waiting outside the terminal for
rides to hotels or to friends' homes. Many people had been waiting
for hours as they waited for flights to resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family took me all the way here from Sonoma County, then
they got stuck in (San Francisco 49ers) football game traffic on
the way back,'' said Liddy Chan, who was trying to get to Los
Angeles. ``Now, I'm asking them to come here again and endure more
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Wally Hartmann of Seattle said he understood it wasn't safe to
fly in heavy fog. ``But the thing that really makes me mad is the
lack of timely information,'' he said. ``If you want to cancel my
flight, cancel it. But they should have a backup plan and tell
everyone ... Right now I feel really lost and clueless. Quote me:
This stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   San Jose International was shut at 7 p.m. Sunday because runway
visibility was down to 1,200 feet. Pilots need at least 1,600 feet
visibility for takeoff, said airport spokesman Egan Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   The same was true at Oakland where heavy fog shut the airport at
7 p.m., stranding several Southwest Airlines passengers, flight
coordinator John Schwammel said. A short while later, some flights
were cleared for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The fog also delayed flights at the San Jose airport Monday
morning.

REV. CHARLES STITH: ON THE SPOT IN TANZANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Stith, well known in Boston, must have figured
he was headed for several years of obscurity when he accepted
President Clinton's offer to become ambassador to the African
nation of Tanzania. All that changed on Aug. 7 when terrorists
bombed the US embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's capital, killing
10 people. The high profile attack put the country and the US role
there in the spotlight in a way in which Stith never could have
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   In his first 100 days as ambassador, Stith has worked to restore
the morale of the embassy staff. He has also focused attention on
his primary mission: boosting trade and investment in the
impoverished nation. It is a task with which he is familiar. As a
minister of the Union United Methodist Church in the South End and
later as head of the Organization For a New Equality, Stith's has
dedicated his career to improving the economy of America's
low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Globe reporter Charles Stein spoke with Stith by telephone last
week about his first few months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did you accept this post in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   A: The short answer is the president asked me. It is difficult
to say no when the President asks you to serve your country in some
capacity. Beyond that, I saw a real synergy between what he wanted
and what I had been doing. The President wanted to focus foreign
policy in Africa on investment and trade rather than just foreign
aid. It seemed to me the skills I developed in trying to help
undercapitalized communities in the US could also be used to help
undercapitalized countries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there genuine parallels between the two?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are. In both cases it is critical to have access to
capital, it is critical to create confidence in the environment as
a place to invest and it is critical that those involved have a
mindset that approaches development, not as charity, but as an
economic opportunity. You need that mindset if you want to grow in
today's global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tanzania is pretty far afield. Is it realistic to think you
are going to put it on the map of US investors?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have to help put Tanzania on investors' map of
potential opportunities. While the characters who bombed the
embassy meant it for evil, one of the upsides of that horrendous
situation was that there were a lot of people who, because of the
daily news coverage, were in a position to look at Tanzania. They
saw that this is a stable country with a viable democracy. The
bombing was an aberration, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you surprised by the extent of the damage from the
bombing?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I touched down in Dar es Salaam I went immediately to
the site of the embassy. Seeing the devastation I wondered how the
staff had continued to manage and whether they could continue to
manage. Every way I turned the damage was enormous. There was a car
damaged beyond recognition. The house across the street had one
whole side gone. It reminded me of a doll house we had bought for
our daughter Mimi on one of her first Christmases. You could see
every room and all the rubble from where I stood. It was clear that
the despicable human beings who did this meant to maximize the
death zone. Inside the embassy the damage was unbelievable. We
walked into one room full of fallen debris and I was told, ``Sir,
this is your office or what is left of it. Thank God you weren't
here. There is no way you would have survived.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you had to spend a lot of time keeping morale up in the
wake of the bombing?
</P>
<P>
   A: A big part of my responsibility is making sure the morale of
the staff is high. Having said that, one of the things I take a
great deal of pride in is the level of professionalism and
resilience of the staff here. There were outright acts of heroism
in the aftermath of the bombing. But the staff has made it clear
that they don't want this simply to be known as the embassy which
was assaulted by terrorists. They want an embassy that is actively
engaged in furthering the foreign policy objectives of the United
States. We've got real troopers. They do us all proud as Americans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have all the extra security measures you've had to take made
it difficult for you to do your job?
</P>
<P>
   A: Quite frankly, the day the bomb went off in Dar es Salaam,
the job description changed. It was a clear indication the rules of
the game have changed. The security measures we've taken to make us
less vulnerable are not things that can be looked upon as
inconveniences. They are necessities. They are part and parcel of
what you have to deal with representing American interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand you have seen quite a bit of the country since
you arrived. What are your impressions of Tanzania?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is an absolutely beautiful country. It is also huge, the
size of Texas and New Mexico. We took a trip recently from Dar es
Salaam to Arusha, which means we traveled about half the length of
the country. I sat down and calculated that it was the equivalent
of traveling from Boston to Washington DC.
</P>
<P>
   And there is so much diversity. There are pristine beaches on
Zanzibar. In the Tarangire National Park if you wake up before
sunrise you can literally hear the world awaken. You step out of
your tent and as the sun begins to rise you hear birds chirp and
animals rustle in the grass and you see bull elephants jostle.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to see this stuff and not be filled with a
childlike sense of awe. In Mwanza we saw boulders placed so
precisely in formation that it seemed as if the work was done by
angels under the direct supervision of God. It is just
breathtakingly beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: In Arusha, you and your children sat in on a trial of a man
charged with genocide in Rwanda. What was that like?
</P>
<P>
   A: We were there for a sentencing hearing for a man named
Jean-Paul Akeyesu. He was the mayor of a one-horse town in Rwanda
no one would have ever heard of had he not personally supervised
the murder of 2000 people.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was quite dramatic. The man had fired his lawyer and
was representing himself. As he stood up to talk my son leaned over
and whispered, ``Dad, this guy looks so normal.'' I was struck by
the poignancy of what he said. The man was well-dressed. He could
have been a deacon in a church on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   I think it was important for my kids to appreciate that it is
the demons that lurk in the hearts of normal people that cause them
to do some of the very worst things to others. That is why we have
to be eternally vigilant on issues like justice and mercy and make
sure we are all responsible for making the world a more humane and
better place.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: The news from Africa is generally so depressing: war,
disease, poverty. Do you ever feel you are in a hopeless situation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The answer is no. In part that has to do with my disposition.
But there are other reasons to be hopeful. For 30 years Tanzania
has been one of the most stable countries in Africa. The level of
civility is envied by countries throughout the region. It is a
country that is rich in natural resources. The government is
commited to private sector reform. The president, Benjamim Mkapa,
has some decent honest people around him trying to move that agenda
forward. I believe Tanzania is positioned to be the next economic
success story in Africa.

SOMETIMES, THE RIGHT ATTITUDE CAN PAY DIVIDENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sandy Rodgers of Amherst, N.H., sent us a letter the other day
about Circuit City.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the sort of letter we usually receive here. She didn't
complain about anything. She didn't say she had been ripped off. In
fact, it was just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers was one of a dozen readers who responded to our request
a month ago for tales of exceptionally good consumer experiences.
We thought there would be a lot more positive letters, given that
we get 20 to 30 complaint letters and calls each week. Despite the
low response rate, we still think it's worthwhile talking about the
good as well as the bad out there.
</P>
<P>
   In the sampling of stories that follow, a couple of themes
emerge. The companies in most cases went out of their way to make
sure their customer was satisfied. In some instances, it was
company policy, but in several of the cases another factor was at
work. Store officials said they helped a consumer not because of
any company rule but simply because the customer was so nice.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers fits the nice category. She went to the Circuit City in
Manchester, N.H., on Nov. 24 to buy a TV for her husband for his
70th birthday. She ended up buying a floor model for $650 that
store officials loaded, unboxed, in the back of her Ford Explorer.
She remembers expressing some concern about the safety of the TV
back there, but says the loader told her it would be fine.
</P>
<P>
   About two blocks away from the store she heard a thud in the
back. She pulled into a Friendly's parking lot, opened the tail
gate and was barely able to get out of the way before the set
tumbled out and crashed to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   A woman at Friendly's helped her load the ruined TV back in her
car. With tears in her eyes, she drove back to Circuit City and
explained what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any hassle at all,'' Rodgers said, store manager Sean
McCarthy gave her another TV off the shelf and had it loaded in her
back seat. This time the TV was strapped in with a seat belt and
pinned in with the front seat. ``Friends who know this story are
amazed that a firm as large as this has any compassion. I am very
grateful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, who has been with Circuit City six years, stressed
that it is impossible to satisfy every single customer, ``But she
was so nice and I didn't want to disappoint her husband on his
birthday.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A little less paranoid &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Kamens, 29, describes himself as a ``paranoid''
shopper. He seems to collect stories about bad consumer
experiences, such as the time a tire-maintenance program was not
honored or the day his contractor installed the wrong windows.
</P>
<P>
   So last July 5th was a memorable day for him. He and his
pregnant wife had just bought a futon and frame from Sleep-Rite in
Framingham, Mass. He agreed to buy the floor model of the frame,
because the sales staff said it was the only one available. He also
got a 15 percent discount on the $350 frame, or $52 off.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the items were delivered at his Boston home, a new
un-assembled frame showed up instead of the already assembled floor
model. The delivery workers said the store had found a new frame in
stock. Kamens braced himself to hear about needing to pay full
price, and perhaps a $15 assembly fee.
</P>
<P>
   But instead the delivery men assembled the bed at no extra
charge. ``I was pleasantly surprised,'' said Kamens, a computer
programmer and father of a 4-month-old.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Farber, the manager at Sleep-Rite, said she remembers her
experience with Kamens very clearly. She said she simply felt the
store should honor the original price given. She said it was also
easier to ``go the extra mile'' for someone like Kamens who was so
kind to everyone at the store. ``It helps when the customer is so
nice,'' she said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A real guarantee &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fred Liberatore, a father of four, had always heard about the
lifetime guarantee on Cross pens. So when his son found a busted
Cross pen in a library parking lot a couple of months ago,
Liberatore decided to send it to the A.T. Cross company in Lincoln,
R.I., and test the guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   To his amazement, three weeks later, he received a brand-new
grey Cross pen with gold trim, an exact copy of the broken pen he
had sent in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed unreal,'' said Liberatore, a 54-year-old biochemist.
``Here was a company standing behind its product.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Boss, president of the company, said the 152-year-old
company always honors the lifetime guarantee and generally receives
only 1 percent of its merchandise back for replacement or repair.
He said the guarantee on its pens _ which range from an $18
ball-point pen to a $450 fountain pen _ ``has won us a lot of
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Boss recalled a time when a Pennsylvania farmer sent them a pen
covered with dark soil in a plastic bag. It turns out he farmer
droped his pen in the fields one day and couldn't find it. Some
months later, he found the pen in the cow manure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cow ate it and got rid of it,'' Boss said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the pen worked or not, Boss is not sure. He can't say
anyone even tested the digested pen. He said the company gladly
sent the farmer back a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Liberatore said he is amazed that such old-fashioned customer
service exists. After receiving the new pen, he said, he's sure to
give the Cross company a lifetime of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You patronize companies that treat customers right,'' he
said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Have it your way &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kathy de Natale pleaded with Roche Bros. to bring back a muffin
recipe she liked. Roche Bros. refused, but did the next best thing.
The supermarket agreed to make her a dozen of the muffins she liked
whenever she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   G. Robert Warren says he had a similar experience with Shaw's
Supermarkets, but with doughnuts instead of muffins.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is a private investigator and self-described doughnut
connoisseur, although he says his wife thinks he's
doughnut-obsessed. Shaw's introduced new items to its bakery
section a year ago and in the process eliminated some items to make
room. One of those eliminated items was the powdered sugar
doughnut, Warren's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   He protested to Shaw's and they restored it to the bakery case,
but they did more than that. Warren liked his powdered sugar
doughnuts greasy and sugared heavily right out of the oven. ``The
greasier the better,'' he said. Shaw's made it that way only about
20 percent of the time, he said. When he inquired, the bakery
department at the Shaw's in Hanover, mass. agreed to make the
doughnuts his way whenever he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's spokesman Bernard Rogan said such special requests are
often granted. ``It's called developing customer loyalty,'' he
said. &QL;

 BOSTON: ... longtime overseer.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the center of the storm over the museum's ethics is Cornelius
C. Vermeule III, the MFA's longtime curator of classical
antiquities who retired in 1996. A scholar world-renowned for his
connoisseurship, and a beloved figure at the MFA and in the local
art world, Vermeule developed a swashbuckling reputation for his
acquisition habits.
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, Vermeule's decisions still preoccupy
lawyers. It was Vermeule who arranged the MFA's questionable
acquisition of the top half of a Heraclean figure the Turkish
government wants reunited with the bottom half that sits in a
Turkish museum. In another case involving the alleged theft of
precious Athenian coins from Turkey, it was Vermeule who had the
MFA authenticate them for the owners, despite evidence they might
be ``hot.''
</P>
<P>
   And like many curators of his generation, who scoured the world
for prized pieces long before the plundering of ancient grave sites
was officially proscribed, Vermeule continued to buy artifacts as
if the rules had never changed, according to McClellan, the BU
archeologist. By many accounts, Vermeule had virtual autonomy
within the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, with the help of a $30,000 grant from the National
Endowment for the Arts, Vermeule's department published a book
signaling that it was still playing by old rules. The 1993 book,
``Vase Painting in Italy,'' matter-of-factly suggests that three of
the Apulian vases it prizes most highly were newly discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the vases, attributed to the Darius Painter, a name given
by scholars to one of the finest artisans in the Greek civilization
that flourished in Apulia about 2,300 years ago, have been hailed
in one MFA annual report as ``two of the greatest South Italian
vases in America.''
</P>
<P>
   In the museum's book, the MFA's curators wrote: ``Recent years
have seen a host of new vases by the Darius Painter with rare or
unique mythological subjects . . .'' The MFA vases, acquired in
1987, 1989, and 1991, ``are among the most splendid of the new
mythological works,'' according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   The vase acquired in 1991 is jointly owned by the MFA and by
Leon Levy and Shelby White, New York collectors whose collecting
habits have long been controversial.
</P>
<P>
   To archeologists, the language in the book is an unwitting
admission that the MFA knew the prized vases were probably stolen
from grave sites. In his written response to the Globe's questions,
Rogers acknowledged that none of the three vases had any known
owners before the museum acquired them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums like the MFA should know better,'' said David W. J.
Gill, an archeologist at the University of Wales at Swansea and an
international authority on antiquities looting. Plainly, Gill said,
the reference in the book ``means the objects were newly surfaced,
and since they had no declared history, any museum curator should
have been highly suspicious of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill and a colleague, Christopher Chippindale, have done
pioneering research on undocumented antiquities. For example, after
the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibited Levy and White's
classical collection in 1990, a study by the two men disclosed that
of the 230 objects in the show, 217 had no known history before the
collecting couple acquired them.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule and White did not respond to requests for interviews.
The MFA said it would not permit Vermeule's successor, John
Herrmann, to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   White, in a recent article in the International Journal of
Cultural Property, wrote that she and her husband do not buy
artifacts that are stolen from museums or unearthed from ``known''
archeological excavations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the wheat-growing region in Apulia, virtually all of the loot
comes from thousands of ``unknown'' grave sites, sealed tombs of
the Greeks' ancient dead that often contain painted vases of the
type favored by Levy and White and the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for the Italian government to prove the vases
were stolen since there is no documentation to prove they were in
the ground,'' lamented Marina Mazzei, the Italian archeologist in
charge of government efforts to slow the looting in Apulia. ``So
just like so many vases, they magically appear on the market, as if
they came from nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzei, during a visit last spring to the pockmarked wheatfields
with a Globe reporter, said the tombaroli, or tomb robbers, have
taken tens of thousands of vases over the last 15 years, so
brazenly that they often employ mechanical excavators. The dramatic
rise in looting in the early 1980s, Mazzei said, coincided with the
growing popularity of the vases with American and European
collectors and museums.
</P>
<P>
   But with few resources, and vast territory to police, she said,
Italian authorities are almost powerless to stop the looters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, with unemployment so high in southern Italy,
``there is a high level of crime directed at the living. So to many
laymen, stealing from tombs is not considered criminal, because the
tombaroli disturb the dead, and not the living.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized rings of thieves smuggle much of the plunder into
Switzerland, with its lax statutes and reputation as an
international fencing crossroads. There, the plunder is sold to
collectors and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the Italian-Swiss border, in scenic vacation towns
like Lugano and Ascona, antiquities shops are ubiquitous, and some
dealers openly admit that their wares have been recently excavated.
In one shop last spring, a score of Apulian vases, some of museum
quality and bearing prices as high as $40,000, were displayed in
glass cases.
</P>
<P>
   Lying on the floor in a corner was a piece of Roman armor
identified by the shop owner as from the 1st century A.D. It was
still caked in mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from a 100-year-old Italian collection,'' the dealer said
with a smile and a wink.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The inexorable link between generous Italian supply and
insatiable collector demand has long raised questions about what
the principals know, or choose to know, about the origin of the
objects they acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg, a major figure in the antiquities trade, said he
would not ``knowingly buy a piece that's been smuggled.'' In fact,
he argued in an interview that the vast majority of antiquities are
of no use to archeologists and ought to be traded freely like
modern artworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-eight percent of items that are excavated offer no new
or useful information for archeologists. So collectors and museums
should be able to acquire these objects,'' said Eisenberg, whose
views anger many archeologists. Strict laws against export, he
added, force the art market to hide information and, sometimes,
prompt museums to doctor provenance information.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``minor pieces'' that most collectors buy, Eisenberg
said, ``We know they come out illegally. But no one bothers about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the major pieces he has sold, to the MFA and other clients,
he acknowledged: ``There is a likelihood that some material may
have been smuggled. No one knows ultimately where these things come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   The MFA, though it made some of its acquisition records
available to the Globe, refused to disclose the identities of
dealers who have sold classical antiquities to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   But dealers seeking tax deductions often donate artifacts to
curators they sell objects to. The MFA's list of donor-dealers
amounts to a ``who's who'' of dealers, and some collectors, who
have been involved in controversy over the origin of some of their
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   They include London dealer Robin Symes, Demirjian, White and
Levy, and the late Lawrence Fleischman, a major purchaser of
undocumented antiquities whose collection was acquired in 1995 by
the J. Paul Getty Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Two major collectors who face claims by foreign governments
seeking the recovery of artifacts are also among MFA donors:
Maurice Tempelsman, the New York financier and companion to the
late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; and Jonathan H. Kagan, one of the
defendants in Turkey's lawsuit demanding the return of the Athenian
coins.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan has donated numerous undocumented antiquities to the MFA,
including nine ceramic cups from the 7th century B.C. that
McClellan says were probably unearthed from the same tomb complex,
in Latium, the site of an ancient culture near Rome that predated
the Greek colonization of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, D. Lloyd Macdonald, Kagan declined a request
for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the dealers who have sold classical artifacts to the
museum is Robert E. Hecht Jr., a Paris-based antiquities specialist
who was once declared persona non grata by the Italian and Turkish
governments for his alleged role in selling plundered antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht, the Globe reported in April, played a central role in a
$1.8 million sale to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art of a 3d
century B.C. silver trove. Italian authorities have an affidavit
from the professional grave robber who helped unearth the objects
from Morgantina, a Greek city-state in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   During an April telephone interview, Hecht defended the trade in
looted antiquities and ridiculed laws, like Italy's, that seek to
prevent the plundering of grave sites.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA refused to divulge its relationship with Hecht, or even
acknowledge that they had done business with him. But the voluble
Hecht boasted in the interview that in mid-1997 he sold the MFA a
rare silver cup, called a skyphos, at a price reported to exceed
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked where the silver artifact originated, Hecht replied:
``What does it matter?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the MFA's classical acquisitions examined by the
Globe, the skyphos has a listed provenance. The MFA said Hecht told
them the piece was once in an American collection and provided the
museum with a letter from a third party attesting to the fact that
Hecht has had the skyphos since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The museum refused to make the letter public.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is no public evidence the MFA has changed its habits,
other institutions have.
</P>
<P>
   Shestack, who is now the deputy director of the National Gallery
of Art in Washington, said that because of the increased
international and public focus on grave robbing, ``Museums are much
more aware of the consequences of this kind of collecting. They are
much more fastidious.''
</P>
<P>
   But during the seven years he ran the MFA, Shestack conceded,
the museum relied on its dealers for written assurance that the
artifacts the MFA bought were clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal counsel, then, was not as sensitive to these issues.
The dealers often didn't want to tell us anything about the prior
ownership,'' Shestack said. ``The lawyers almost always said that
if a dealer signed a guarantee the work was clean, then everything
was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever said, `We're not going to buy it if it doesn't
have a clear provenance,' '' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Shestack said, the museum did demand a thorough
legal review of the pre-Columbian collection offered to the MFA by
Landon T. Clay, one of its trustees. The review, at an estimated
cost of $30,000, concluded that there was no reason for the MFA not
to take it. Last December, the lawyer who did the review admitted
in an interview that he knew in 1987 that Guatemalan law forbade
export of the artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1986 speech calling for higher ethical standards,
Shestack recalled, ``I cried out for stringent laws that would give
museum directors a reason for not doing the evil thing. So then
when the directors encourage you to acquire certain things, you can
say, `No, I can't. I'll go to jail.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But if there's a gray area in the law, you don't
have an out.'' The gray area, he noted, remains.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Shestack's candid recollection contradicts Rogers, who in
both the Guatemala and classical areas has insisted there has been
nothing amiss in the museum's behavior. Partly, there are legal
reasons for that: The Guatemalan government has just hired New York
attorneys Lawrence M. Kaye and Howard Spiegler, two aggressive
litigators who handle Turkey's claims, to seek restitution of the
pre-Columbian artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the legal threat, some lawyers and art historians say
Rogers has a responsibility to assure its public that the museum's
behavior sets a moral standard for the community it serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MFA needs to make an unambiguous statement that it will no
longer acquire undocumented antiquities,'' said McClellan, the BU
archeologist. ``This is one more opportunity for the MFA to say,
`Our eyes have been opened. We take responsibility for what's
happened. We've done wrong in the past, but we'll now do better.'
But they seem unwilling to say that publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Other museums, most notably the once avaricious Getty, no longer
acquire undocumented antiquities. And the Getty has done so
unambiguously.
</P>
<P>
   Marion True, the Getty's curator of ancient art, who now devotes
much of her time to helping countries in the Mediterranean rim
devise strategies to stop looting, told a conference at Rutgers
University last month that the Getty ceased buying undocumented
antiquities because it was not possible to be certain they were
clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is because of the all-too-common practices among
so-called reputable dealers of forging provenance documents and
signing false statements on warranties,'' she said. The Getty, True
added, chooses to spend money on other projects, ``rather than
continue to struggle through the mire of deception that pervades
the market.''

GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF SPLIT STATUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTALYA, Turkey _ The marble stump stands apart at the entrance
of this archeological museum, labeled by the sort of historical
plaque people here have come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   On a kiosk, visitors have scribbled angry graffiti: ``Boston --
Give it back now!'' and ``Stop crime in archeology!'' Tacked up
nearby at the Antalya Museum are more signs explaining the plight
of this lonesome half-statue, whose upper half is nestled in Boston
inside the Museum of Fine Arts, and whose story is one of many in
the international catalog of illegally smuggled works.
</P>
<P>
   According to Turkish officials and other archeological experts,
the two pieces of the ``Weary Herakles'' were not separated in some
ancient war or earthquake. Instead, they say, the top half was
plundered by a group of thieves near an excavation site in southern
Turkey in 1980, smuggled across the border, and, ultimately, sold
to the husband-wife team of American collectors Leon Levy and
Shelby White, who then donated a half-share to the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, it went on display at the New York Metropolitan Museum
of Art in an exhibit called ``Glories of the Past,'' featuring
treasures belonging to Levy and White. That was when it drew
notoriety. That December, Connoisseur magazine published an article
that revealed the startling match of the bottom half several
thousand miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Then yet another split occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Because even as experts began comparing remarkable photographs
of the two halves _ and as Turkish officials were asking a New York
law firm to begin inquiries into the matter _ the collectors and
the MFA were offering a stream of arguments defending their right
to own the marble bust. Today, it is still in their possession,
despite years of legal wrangling, although the man who was curator
of the MFA classical art department at the time it was acquired
admits the pieces are part of a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now clearly recognized that the `Weary Herakles' fits
together to form a complete statue,'' Cornelius C. Vermeule III,
who ran the department for four decades, said in an interview
earlier this month. ``Things wander, turn up in different
collections all over the world. It's the same with the things from
the Parthenon.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a far cry from the position the curator took in 1990,
when the link between the two halves was first suspected.
Confronted with evidence about the bust's origin, Vermeule said in
an interview with The New York Times that year that it was unlikely
the two would match.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many `Weary Herakles','' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   According to archeology experts, that much is true; around 150
A.D., when the disputed statue was most likely made, many artisans
devoted their skills to replicating the Herakles design originated
in the 4th century B.C., by the famous sculptor Lyssipos of Sicyon.
Such duplicates, which would have been bath or theater decorations
in their day, often turn up in excavation sites in southern Turkey,
and they are not, at least by comparison, extraordinarily rare.
</P>
<P>
   But they do belong to Turkey, according to Turkish officials,
who say Turkish laws and the US agreement to comply with the UNESCO
treaty require the top half be returned.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Turkish officials spent several years wrangling
with the American owners over whether the pieces were truly of the
same statue. Vermeule insisted down to every detail that they were
different, even claiming he could spot a separate belly button on
each. Finally, in 1992, Cultural Minister Enzin Ozgen decided to
settle the matter by sending a plaster cast of the Turkish half of
the statue to the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   Under the close watch of scholars _ and attorneys _ the plaster
cast was fitted. Thomas Hoving, former director of the
Metropolitan, said it ``fit like a hand to glove.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like having a bunch of fingerprints plastered all over
the place,'' Hoving said in an interview earlier this month. ``It
is so clear. There's no mistaking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that concrete evidence, however, the MFA and White and
Levy resisted cooperating, Ozgen said. Now, their argument is that
although the pieces do match, the top half was acquired some other
way besides illegal smuggling. Malcolm Rogers, the MFA's director,
issued a statement that ``the MFA believes that the `Weary
Herakles' was legally and properly acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has refused repeated Globe requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule also now says the top half, on display at the MFA,
could have been excavated ``any time since the Italian
Renaissance.'' Turkish law protects only artifacts smuggled out
after 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Laws aside, Ozgen says he has been rebuffed not only by the MFA
but also by Levy and White, despite several offers to reunite the
statue and share the whole.
</P>
<P>
   In one exchange, an elderly Turkish archeologist, Jale Inan, was
so distraught over the statue that she planned a hunger strike on
the steps of the MFA, Ozgen said. When White heard about the plan,
she called Ozgen at home, furious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `If you ever dare to conduct a hunger strike in
front of the museum, I will have all the Armenians demonstrate
against Turkey in front of the consulate,' '' Ozgen said.
</P>
<P>
   The hunger strike was canceled. In the years since, Turkey has
kept up negotiations with the MFA, Levy, and White, despite
Turkey's increasing tendency to file lawsuits against suspected
owners of illegal plunder. Even now, according to the attorney for
Turkey, Lawrence M. Kaye, ``Hopefully, the matter will be resolved
out of court.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if not,'' he said, ``the Republic will institute
appropriate proceedings to recover it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A sense of desperation attends the decision to launch the latest
wave of air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The man who took the decision, Bill Clinton, was facing an
imminent vote in the House of Representatives on his impeachment;
what better way to show that he was worthy of the office of
President of the United States than to exercise, in a statesmanlike
way, the authority it gives him as commander-in-chief of his
country's armed forces?
</P>
<P>
   The man against whom the decision was taken, Saddam Hussein, is
desperate too, constrained by sanctions, dogged by arms inspectors,
hated by everyone and, eight years after the end of the Gulf war,
still without hope of shaking off his pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the wider world _ in different degrees frightened of
Hussein, worried about the spread of weapons of mass destruction,
apprehensive about the use of force against a sovereign country _
it too has grown exasperated, ever more conscious that the Iraqi
dictator presents problems that never seem to go away and that have
no straightforward solution.
</P>
<P>
   If all this is unsatisfactory, so too perhaps was the trigger
for Operation Desert Fox, a report by Richard Butler, the head of
the team of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   This showed that Hussein had not fully cooperated with the
UNSCOM inspectors, as he had promised to, but it was not
unambiguously clear that his lack of cooperation had in fact been
designed to prevent UNSCOM from doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   Another, awkwardly plausible interpretation is that Hussein's
obstructiveness may have been designed to stop the inspectors, and
the Israelis to whom he assumes they pass all the information they
gather, from learning about all sorts of secrets not directly
related to weapons-making.
</P>
<P>
   Still, America _ and Britain, which has also joined the
operation _ had always said that any failure by Hussein to keep his
word would bring an attack, without further ado, and the Iraqi
therefore commands little real sympathy, whatever the public
denunciations of the decision to launch the air strikes by China,
Russia, some Arabs and, to a lesser extent, France.
</P>
<P>
   Even Arab sympathizers lost patience with Hussein on the last
occasion, in November, when he stopped cooperating with the U.N.,
and most people, whether friend or foe of Iraq, must have felt that
there was an inevitability about these strikes.
</P>
<P>
   That they should have come now, at Clinton's hour of need _ just
as an earlier strike, in August, against an apparently innocent
factory in Sudan came at another hour of need for the American
president _ is unfortunate, to say the least. Yet they should be
judged, in the end, on their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed in achieving their stated aim, that will be
welcome. But merely to ``degrade Saddam's capacity to develop and
deliver weapons of mass destruction and to degrade his ability to
threaten his neighbors,'' is not ambitious, and will not solve the
long-run problem.
</P>
<P>
   This, as Clinton and other American officials have been making
ever more explicitly clear, is Hussein himself.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure how, or when, Hussein will leave office. He
could be thrown out tomorrow, or hang on, as Fidel Castro has in
Cuba, to infuriate American presidents for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But if this round of air strikes should prove to be the lever
that prises him from power, the world will surely judge them a
success. It may even swallow some of its cynicism about the man who
ordered them at such a fortuitous time. &QL;

   BOSTON _ Helping patients laugh can be a great way to help them
heal.
</P>
<P>
   It also can be a great way for doctors to get in trouble in
these days of micro-managed medicine, political correctness, and a
love-to-litigate society. Just how much trouble became clear last
summer when a patient at New England Medical Center who lost 300
pounds sued a physician she says placed a rubber pig nose on her to
advertise the weight-loss program.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is why doctors are likely to applaud the spirit, if
not the specifics, of Robin Williams's movie ``Patch Adams,''
according to a collection of Boston health care providers who saw
the movie. It tells the true story of a misfit medical student who
a generation ago risked his career by promoting the then-unheard-of
notion that humor is a key to healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humor is a form of engagement, of empathy, it's endearing,''
said Dr. Gene Beresin, who runs the child and adolescent
psychiatric residency program at Massachusetts General and McLean
hospitals. ``I use humor to make fun of the system, like Robin
Williams did when he put on a Pinocchio nose, then said that the
hospital would take care of all of that patient's health bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Deeb Salem, chief of medicine at New England Medical Center,
also is a big believer in making his patients laugh, but the pig
nose lawsuit has made him wary about when, how and by whom it is
used: ``I truly believe humor has a place in medicine, but great
care has to be given today because of being afraid not to offend
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more basic principle, whether it's humor or anything else,
is to ask after every contact with a patient, `Have I done what I
can to make them feel better after I've talked to them than they
did before?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tom Delbanco has devoted much of his career to getting his
fellow practitioners to ask that question. But he's convinced the
new movie is likelier to set back than advance the discussion. ``I
think it will promote negative stereotypes of doctors and make
patients who already are frightened enough even more frightened of
the medical establishment,'' says Delbanco, the chief of general
and primary care medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mark of a real sense of humor is the ability to laugh at
oneself, but Robin Williams in this film laughed at everybody but
himself. He laughed at mentally ill patients, he laughed at fat
black nurses and snotty Southern doctors and many of his peers.
That's the way to sell movies but not to move the world forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of medicine was a much different place in the late
1960s and early 70s, when the real-life Adams was attending the
Medical College of Virginia. He'd been inspired to become a doctor
when he was institutionalized for depression as a teenager, but
medical school convinced him that doctors were spending too much
time treating their patients's diseases and too little getting to
know them as people.
</P>
<P>
   His remedy: dress up in a gorilla suit, don a red nose, fill a
patient's room full of balloons or their bathtub full of noodles,
and do whatever else it took to get a guffaw and, more important,
to connect emotionally with whomever he was treating. All of which
was a hit with many patients, but not with his conservative school
in that more conservative era.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to today, when doctors face decidedly different
challenges. On the one hand, our tightly-managed approach to
medicine often works against such sensitivity by giving doctors
less time to spend with patients even as today's political
correctness makes them worried about offending anyone and even
getting sued. At the same time, tuning in to patients' emotional,
psychological and spiritual needs is talked about more, taught more
and practiced more, both because health care providers understand
its importance and because they know it's an effective way to
compete for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch's red nose is a metaphor for making a human connection,
and that does happen today. Is it something you can teach? It is
something you can encourage but I don't think you can teach it,''
says Terry Schraeder, a former medical reporter for WCVB-Channel 5
who is now a fourth-year student at Tufts Medical School, where the
real Adams delivered an inspirational lecture two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sort of essence of human connection that certain
doctors have . . . Most doctors don't have a red bulb on the end of
their nose and buttons on their jacket, but when they go in and
touch a patient's child, or talk to the patient, the interaction is
so human. It's honorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Chunhan Zhu, who practices acupuncture and Chinese herbal
medicine in Newton, says that sort of human interaction has always
been a cornerstone of complementary medicine. ``Some doctors may
not like this movie,'' he adds, ``but from my point of view this
movie makes sense for someone practicing holistic or alternative
medicine . . . A healer uses unlimited methods to make patients
healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herb Levine, emeritus chairman of cardiology at New England
Medical Center and a physician noted for his human touch, says
conventional medicine places much more premium on patient
communication than it did when he trained in the late 1950s. But it
still has a long way to go in applying the lessons Patch Adams is
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch's message is such an important one that it's OK that it
is conveyed with hyperbole,'' Levine adds. ``There's not enough
humor today on the wards and at the bedside. It's a very effective
tool.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A sense of desperation attends the decision to launch the latest
wave of air strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The man who took the decision, Bill Clinton, was facing an
imminent vote in the House of Representatives on his impeachment;
what better way to show that he was worthy of the office of
President of the United States than to exercise, in a statesmanlike
way, the authority it gives him as commander-in-chief of his
country's armed forces?
</P>
<P>
   The man against whom the decision was taken, Saddam Hussein, is
desperate too, constrained by sanctions, dogged by arms inspectors,
hated by everyone and, eight years after the end of the Gulf war,
still without hope of shaking off his pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the wider world _ in different degrees frightened of
Hussein, worried about the spread of weapons of mass destruction,
apprehensive about the use of force against a sovereign country _
it too has grown exasperated, ever more conscious that the Iraqi
dictator presents problems that never seem to go away and that have
no straightforward solution.
</P>
<P>
   If all this is unsatisfactory, so too perhaps was the trigger
for Operation Desert Fox, a report by Richard Butler, the head of
the team of U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   This showed that Hussein had not fully cooperated with the
UNSCOM inspectors, as he had promised to, but it was not
unambiguously clear that his lack of cooperation had in fact been
designed to prevent UNSCOM from doing its job.
</P>
<P>
   Another, awkwardly plausible interpretation is that Hussein's
obstructiveness may have been designed to stop the inspectors, and
the Israelis to whom he assumes they pass all the information they
gather, from learning about all sorts of secrets not directly
related to weapons-making.
</P>
<P>
   Still, America _ and Britain, which has also joined the
operation _ had always said that any failure by Hussein to keep his
word would bring an attack, without further ado, and the Iraqi
therefore commands little real sympathy, whatever the public
denunciations of the decision to launch the air strikes by China,
Russia, some Arabs and, to a lesser extent, France.
</P>
<P>
   Even Arab sympathizers lost patience with Hussein on the last
occasion, in November, when he stopped cooperating with the U.N.,
and most people, whether friend or foe of Iraq, must have felt that
there was an inevitability about these strikes.
</P>
<P>
   That they should have come now, at Clinton's hour of need _ just
as an earlier strike, in August, against an apparently innocent
factory in Sudan came at another hour of need for the American
president _ is unfortunate, to say the least. Yet they should be
judged, in the end, on their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed in achieving their stated aim, that will be
welcome. But merely to ``degrade Saddam's capacity to develop and
deliver weapons of mass destruction and to degrade his ability to
threaten his neighbors,'' is not ambitious, and will not solve the
long-run problem.
</P>
<P>
   This, as Clinton and other American officials have been making
ever more explicitly clear, is Hussein himself.
</P>
<P>
   No one can be sure how, or when, Hussein will leave office. He
could be thrown out tomorrow, or hang on, as Fidel Castro has in
Cuba, to infuriate American presidents for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   But if this round of air strikes should prove to be the lever
that prises him from power, the world will surely judge them a
success. It may even swallow some of its cynicism about the man who
ordered them at such a fortuitous time. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Can anything, after the turbulence of 1998, still be considered
unthinkable? Ostriches everywhere have had to pull their heads from
the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, many people would have counted an East Asian
economic collapse as unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, before the sudden fame of a woman called Monica, so
too would have been a vote to impeach President Bill Clinton, or,
indeed, widespread calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Oil at $10 a barrel? Bill Gates on the defensive? The overthrow
of President Suharto of Indonesia? The fall and then private-sector
rescue of Long-Term Capital Management? George Soros arguing that
speculators should be restrained?
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion seems inescapable: if you are taking something
for granted, don't.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of things are, nevertheless, still taken for granted. Is
it really right to assume, as many do, that nuclear weapons will
never be used by states, that democracy will continue to spread,
that China will not break up, that shares are always the best
long-term investment?
</P>
<P>
   Those unthinkables are likely to be challenged over a period of
years or even decades. As soon as 1999, however, a different but
just as widespread assumption will face its stiffest challenge yet:
the idea that globalization is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   That ugly, 13-letter word has become a mantra of business, of
politics, even of culture.
</P>
<P>
   This decade has seen a remarkable increase in the openness to
trade and investment flows of country after country: partly because
of the demise of Soviet communism and of old ideas of socialist
self-sufficiency; partly because of liberalizations agreed upon
during the Uruguay round of what was then the GATT and is now the
World Trade Organization; and partly because of the rapid,
world-shrinking spread of new information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, foreign businesses, foreign investors and
foreign (especially American) culture have penetrated deeply into
most countries' domestic lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have tried to slow this penetration down. But few
have resisted it altogether. The mix of unstoppable technological
change with the apparently unanswerable intellectual defeat of
central planning has made globalization appear inevitable: only its
speed and its consequences seem open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Would that it were so. The effort to reverse this movement has
already begun. Next year, most probably, that effort will move into
a higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, at least, is plain to all, save possibly investors
in American shares: world recession. No one can be sure about the
future course of the world economy, even a few months ahead let
alone a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it does look likely that next year, economic growth for the
world as a whole is going to be even slower than for 1998, perhaps
a lot slower.
</P>
<P>
   For a Japanese, a South Korean, an Indonesian or even,
increasingly, a Brazilian, that will be no surprise. Those parts of
the world are already in a real recession, and there is little
reason to expect much of a recovery before 1999's second half, at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's financial troubles continue to mount, despite government
package after government package. The pace of economic shrinkage
seems to have been slowed in Korea and Thailand, but neither there
nor in Indonesia or Malaysia has much progress been made on
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, recently rescued by a $41 billion IMF-led consortium,
looks shaky: with public-spending cuts blocked by Congress, capital
flight has resumed and the real again looks a candidate for
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   China, too, long East Asia's gravity-defying hero, looks likely
to slow and quite possibly to devalue.
</P>
<P>
   That is all bad, but there is nothing unthinkable there. Nor
does this yet threaten globalization. A cause for optimism during
the past two years has been the fact that, so far, none of the
recession-hit emerging markets has raised its formal trade
barriers, and (excepting small, maverick Malaysia and large,
lunatic Russia) none has revived barriers to capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   Governments may really believe that globalization is inevitable.
Or they may be so desperate for capital, from the IMF, from western
governments or from private investors, that they think they have no
short-term alternative to openness.
</P>
<P>
   So and far are two important words. The most important test will
come not in the vulnerable economies of the developing world, nor
in Japan, but in the rich, developed world that provides most of
that capital and sets the tone on trade and investment rules.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 the European Union will launch its single currency to
much acclaim but not, alas, amid the strengthening economic
recovery that looked likely earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment may well start to rise again in the euro countries,
posing immediately a clash between national politics and the
collective, EU interest.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the risk is either of a political dust-up between the
main euro countries, most notably France and Germany, or of a
deflection of that pressure on to the outside world, through an
increase in the EU's already strong protectionist tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will offer the biggest test of all. This year,
buoyed by consumers, its economy has been remarkably strong. A
modest slowdown in 1999 is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
   A nastier time looks possible, however, as companies cut their
capital investment and as (or if) Wall Street's stock market bubble
bursts, making consumers feel poorer and companies more worried.
</P>
<P>
   Further interest-rate cuts might limit the damage; an
expansionary fiscal policy might also help; but neither is likely
to avert a slowdown altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Already, even with American unemployment at record postwar lows
and the economy steaming ahead, industries such as steel and memory
chips have resorted to anti-dumping suits to protect themselves
against imports.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has berated Europeans for not importing more
goods from Asia and thus taking the heat out of America's growing
current-account deficit. Slower growth or a full recession can only
boost the protectionist voice.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is how strong it will get. With a wounded
presidency and the 2000 election-campaign getting under way, the
defenses against it will be weakened.
</P>
<P>
   And if protectionism breaks through in the United States? Then,
the likelihood is that other, smaller, more genuinely vulnerable
countries would turn protectionist too, partly in retaliation but
partly also out of opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Such a verdict is, in truth, a rather gloomy thing to write at
Christmas. But it offers a realistic way to think about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first proper test of globalization. If the test
is passed, this slowdown could prove short, the subsequent recovery
strong and fruitful. If it is failed, and markets are closed, the
recession could prove long and painful.
</P>
<P>
   That is the choice. It would take an ostrich to pretend
otherwise. &QL;

 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was just a year ago that the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts turned aside a public demand from the government of Guatemala
to return scores of pre-Columbian artifacts that had been looted
from ancient Mayan grave sites in that country.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the museum argued that the artifacts entered the
United States legally between 1974 and 1981 _ before the MFA
committed itself in 1983 to international standards designed to
curb the widespread plundering of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since 1984, the MFA has acquired scores of Greek and Roman
antiquities that have no record of prior ownership, according to a
Globe inquiry. That is a dead giveaway, scholars say, that most of
the objects were illegally excavated and smuggled, mainly from
Italy, in the 14 years since the museum says it has abandoned
dealings in the illicit market.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artifacts are three valuable Greek vases, commonly
found in 2,300-year-old grave sites in the Apulian section of
southeastern Italy. In a telltale admission, the museum described
the three vases as among a ``host'' of newly discovered artifacts
in a 1993 book it published on the MFA's ancient Greek vases.
</P>
<P>
   With assistance from several classical scholars, the Globe
focused on the origin of 71 classical artifacts that were donated
or sold to the MFA by outsiders from mid-1984 to mid-1987. Only 10
of the 71 items have any recorded ownership history, or provenance.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 61 objects, including the three valuable vases
cited in the MFA volume, have no pedigree at all, strong
circumstantial evidence that most of them had been recently
unearthed by grave robbers, according to archeologists.
</P>
<P>
   For the MFA, the findings underscore the institution's
continuing challenge _ how to reconcile the august image it
projects with persistent questions about the integrity of its
collecting practices.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other major museums, scholars say, the MFA cannot
argue that it was unaware that it was acquiring valuable objects
that were most likely removed recently from the ground. Even one of
the MFA's major benefactors told the Globe the museum often turned
a blind eye to evidence the artifacts had dubious origins. And two
of its dealers said they cannot vouch for the origin of some of the
objects they sold the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Alan Shestack, who was the MFA's director from 1987 to
1994, acknowledged last week that during his tenure the museum took
insufficient steps to ensure that its acquisitions had not been
looted. ``We were not as rigorous as we might have been in those
days,'' Shestack said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Shestack said, questions were seldom raised about
the origin of undocumented artifacts the MFA was acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Shestack at odds with the current MFA director,
Malcolm Rogers. Rogers has said he has no misgivings about the
classical antiquities the museum obtained that came with no
ownership history. Unlike Shestack, Rogers has repeatedly refused
to discuss the MFA's collecting ethics.
</P>
<P>
   For the museum, which Rogers recently described as New England's
preeminent cultural institution, the Guatemalan and classical
acquisitions are bookends on a troublesome year. To the MFA's
critics, the two cases underscore the extent to which the MFA, and
some of its peer institutions, are ethically tone deaf and
oblivious to rapidly shifting international standards.
</P>
<P>
   With increasing frequency, countries like Turkey, Italy, and
poverty-stricken Guatemala are pressing legal claims against major
museums _ sometimes with help from the US government. At the same
time, officials in countries that sit atop ancient cultures have
ratcheted up accusatory rhetoric that ``Western elites'' are guilty
of cultural imperialism, colonialism, and racism for preying on
grave sites in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   As for the MFA, even some of the dealers the museum has
purchased artifacts from acknowledged that the antiquities market
is far from pristine.
</P>
<P>
   For example, two of New York's best-known dealers who have sold
classical artifacts to the MFA, Torkom Demirjian and Jerome M.
Eisenberg, admitted that they sometimes have no way of knowing
whether the objects they sell to collectors and museums were
recently plundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no tag on any piece saying, `I am legally excavated
and legally exported,' '' Eisenberg said in an interview. Asked,
for instance, about a dozen undocumented artifacts that came to the
MFA after being sold by Sotheby's and Christie's, the two major
auction houses, Eisenberg said: ``If you buy it at auction without
a provenance, it was probably illegally excavated.''
</P>
<P>
   Demirjian, who was the dealer in one celebrated case involving
looted artifacts and is a passionate critic of laws that inhibit
the antiquities trade, said he does not believe that artifacts he
has sold or donated to the MFA had been recently looted. But, he
added, ``It wouldn't matter to me if they were illegally
excavated.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who has been the MFA director since 1994, turned down
repeated requests for an interview _ a posture he adopted after the
Globe reported last December that the MFA acquired the
pre-Columbian artifacts even though its attorney knew they had been
illegally removed from Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers would respond only to inquiries in writing. But his
responses often sidestepped the questions posed by the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   To many scholars, the evidence is compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that there is a pattern by the MFA of
acquiring looted material that was illegally excavated in Italy,''
said Boston University archeologist Murray C. McClellan. ``They
have not lived up to their own standards, and they have to be
called to account for that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rogers, others who have dealt with the MFA were more
willing to discuss its acquisitions. One MFA benefactor, who has
had extensive dealings with its classical department over the
years, said the MFA has taken artifacts from him knowing they had
been looted.
</P>
<P>
   When the department ``sees a piece they really want, the
provenance doesn't become as important as it should be,'' said the
benefactor, who discussed the issue on condition that his name not
be used.
</P>
<P>
   The benefactor, though he said he does not deal directly with
smugglers, said the dealers he buys from do. But over the years, he
said, the museum's classical department cared little where the
piece originated _ unless the acquisition was ``likely to create a
fuss.'' On some pieces, he added, the MFA was complicit in helping
to alter provenance information to make the objects appear to be
clean.
</P>
<P>
   But McClellan, who is hopeful the museum can be persuaded to
change course and abide by its ethical code and international
conventions, described the allegedly illicit acquisitions as
``willful ignorance, not a conscious conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan and other classical archeologists who looked over the
Boston museum's acquisitions expressed chagrin about many of the
pieces, saying the evidence, though circumstantial, strongly
suggests the artifacts were looted in recent years from sites in
the Mediterranean, most of them in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the objects with no provenance are numerous vessels from
Apulia, marble busts, and a Greek vase that originated in Tuscany.
Another piece with no pedigree is a rare Mycenaean terracotta idol
from about 1,300 B.C. that McClellan called ``one of the most
important pieces of religious art of the Second Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had not been looted, and we knew where it came from, it
would be world-famous for its historical significance. As it is,
it's merely a curiosity in a corner of the museum,'' McClellan
said.

<P>
   Public attention to the MFA's acquisition of antiquities comes
amid growing international focus on cultural property issues,
tougher laws in source countries, and UN-led international
conventions intended to curb the widespread plunder for profit that
has decimated ancient sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit have been countries like Guatemala, Italy, Greece,
Turkey, and poor nations in Africa, such as Mali. Also vulnerable
have been war-torn nations like Iraq, Cambodia, Afghanistan, and
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But the outcry, led by archeologists, has been countered, often
in heated debate, by some museums, dealers, and collectors who
insist that laws against the antiquities trade are unreasonably
harsh, leading to a thriving black market that prompts some museums
to mask the origin of their acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, countries such as Italy and Greece, lacking
evidence pointing to the precise site where an object was looted,
seldom press claims. And US legislation in 1983 that implemented
the UN agreement contains loopholes that protect collectors and
museums from forfeiture laws. Some judges, though, have begun to
pay greater deference to the notion that objects looted abroad can
be classified as stolen property in American courts, a trend that
has unsettled the museum world.
</P>
<P>
   Most museums, including the MFA, have adopted guidelines since
1970 that recognize the legal right of countries like Italy and
Turkey to protect ancient grave sites, an obligation that Shestack
advocated in a speech in 1986, the year before he took the MFA's
helm.
</P>
<P>
   Shestack argued then that museums, by continuing to acquire
problematic antiquities, ``would not only be risking our
reputation, but would be encouraging or at least seeming to be
encouraging, or winking at, illicit activity in the international
art market.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was on Shestack's watch, from 1987 to 1994, that the MFA
acquired many of the classical antiquities that archeologists say
were probably taken from grave sites in Italy. Others have been
acquired since Rogers took his place. They include some 7th century
B.C. cups from burial grounds near Rome that raised suspicions at
the MFA, but were nonetheless accepted in 1996 _ a gift from a
longtime overseer.

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can anything, after the turbulence of 1998, still be considered
unthinkable? Ostriches everywhere have had to pull their heads from
the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, many people would have counted an East Asian
economic collapse as unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, before the sudden fame of a woman called Monica, so
too would have been a vote to impeach President Bill Clinton, or,
indeed, widespread calls for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Oil at $10 a barrel? Bill Gates on the defensive? The overthrow
of President Suharto of Indonesia? The fall and then private-sector
rescue of Long-Term Capital Management? George Soros arguing that
speculators should be restrained?
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion seems inescapable: if you are taking something
for granted, don't.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of things are, nevertheless, still taken for granted. Is
it really right to assume, as many do, that nuclear weapons will
never be used by states, that democracy will continue to spread,
that China will not break up, that shares are always the best
long-term investment?
</P>
<P>
   Those unthinkables are likely to be challenged over a period of
years or even decades. As soon as 1999, however, a different but
just as widespread assumption will face its stiffest challenge yet:
the idea that globalization is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   That ugly, 13-letter word has become a mantra of business, of
politics, even of culture.
</P>
<P>
   This decade has seen a remarkable increase in the openness to
trade and investment flows of country after country: partly because
of the demise of Soviet communism and of old ideas of socialist
self-sufficiency; partly because of liberalizations agreed upon
during the Uruguay round of what was then the GATT and is now the
World Trade Organization; and partly because of the rapid,
world-shrinking spread of new information technology.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, foreign businesses, foreign investors and
foreign (especially American) culture have penetrated deeply into
most countries' domestic lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries have tried to slow this penetration down. But few
have resisted it altogether. The mix of unstoppable technological
change with the apparently unanswerable intellectual defeat of
central planning has made globalization appear inevitable: only its
speed and its consequences seem open to debate.
</P>
<P>
   Would that it were so. The effort to reverse this movement has
already begun. Next year, most probably, that effort will move into
a higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, at least, is plain to all, save possibly investors
in American shares: world recession. No one can be sure about the
future course of the world economy, even a few months ahead let
alone a year.
</P>
<P>
   But it does look likely that next year, economic growth for the
world as a whole is going to be even slower than for 1998, perhaps
a lot slower.
</P>
<P>
   For a Japanese, a South Korean, an Indonesian or even,
increasingly, a Brazilian, that will be no surprise. Those parts of
the world are already in a real recession, and there is little
reason to expect much of a recovery before 1999's second half, at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's financial troubles continue to mount, despite government
package after government package. The pace of economic shrinkage
seems to have been slowed in Korea and Thailand, but neither there
nor in Indonesia or Malaysia has much progress been made on
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, recently rescued by a $41 billion IMF-led consortium,
looks shaky: with public-spending cuts blocked by Congress, capital
flight has resumed and the real again looks a candidate for
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   China, too, long East Asia's gravity-defying hero, looks likely
to slow and quite possibly to devalue.
</P>
<P>
   That is all bad, but there is nothing unthinkable there. Nor
does this yet threaten globalization. A cause for optimism during
the past two years has been the fact that, so far, none of the
recession-hit emerging markets has raised its formal trade
barriers, and (excepting small, maverick Malaysia and large,
lunatic Russia) none has revived barriers to capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   Governments may really believe that globalization is inevitable.
Or they may be so desperate for capital, from the IMF, from western
governments or from private investors, that they think they have no
short-term alternative to openness.
</P>
<P>
   So and far are two important words. The most important test will
come not in the vulnerable economies of the developing world, nor
in Japan, but in the rich, developed world that provides most of
that capital and sets the tone on trade and investment rules.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1 the European Union will launch its single currency to
much acclaim but not, alas, amid the strengthening economic
recovery that looked likely earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment may well start to rise again in the euro countries,
posing immediately a clash between national politics and the
collective, EU interest.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the risk is either of a political dust-up between the
main euro countries, most notably France and Germany, or of a
deflection of that pressure on to the outside world, through an
increase in the EU's already strong protectionist tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will offer the biggest test of all. This year,
buoyed by consumers, its economy has been remarkably strong. A
modest slowdown in 1999 is widely expected.
</P>
<P>
   A nastier time looks possible, however, as companies cut their
capital investment and as (or if) Wall Street's stock market bubble
bursts, making consumers feel poorer and companies more worried.
</P>
<P>
   Further interest-rate cuts might limit the damage; an
expansionary fiscal policy might also help; but neither is likely
to avert a slowdown altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Already, even with American unemployment at record postwar lows
and the economy steaming ahead, industries such as steel and memory
chips have resorted to anti-dumping suits to protect themselves
against imports.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has berated Europeans for not importing more
goods from Asia and thus taking the heat out of America's growing
current-account deficit. Slower growth or a full recession can only
boost the protectionist voice.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is how strong it will get. With a wounded
presidency and the 2000 election-campaign getting under way, the
defenses against it will be weakened.
</P>
<P>
   And if protectionism breaks through in the United States? Then,
the likelihood is that other, smaller, more genuinely vulnerable
countries would turn protectionist too, partly in retaliation but
partly also out of opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Such a verdict is, in truth, a rather gloomy thing to write at
Christmas. But it offers a realistic way to think about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first proper test of globalization. If the test
is passed, this slowdown could prove short, the subsequent recovery
strong and fruitful. If it is failed, and markets are closed, the
recession could prove long and painful.
</P>
<P>
   That is the choice. It would take an ostrich to pretend
otherwise. &QL;

against imports.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has berated Europeans for not importing more
goods from Asia and thus taking the heat out of America's growing
current-account deficit. Slower growth or a full recession can only
boost the protectionist voice.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is how strong it will get. With a wounded
presidency and the 2000 election-campaign getting under way, the
defenses against it will be weakened.
</P>
<P>
   And if protectionism breaks through in the United States? Then,
the likelihood is that other, smaller, more genuinely vulnerable
countries would turn protectionist too, partly in retaliation but
partly also out of opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   Such a verdict is, in truth, a rather gloomy thing to write at
Christmas. But it offers a realistic way to think about 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first proper test of globalization. If the test
is passed, this slowdown could prove short, the subsequent recovery
strong and fruitful. If it is failed, and markets are closed, the
recession could prove long and painful.
</P>
<P>
   That is the choice. It would take an ostrich to pretend
otherwise. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when Japan's economy first slowed, there was
a popular explanation for its refusal to speed up again. Japanese
consumers, this theory went, had bought so many gadgets during the
go-go years that they now declined to spend a single yen on new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Late-1990s America presents a gleaming contrast. Despite the
long boom, Americans are pursuing material happiness during this
holiday season with unwavering zeal.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the notion that they may run out of things to
buy seems laughable _ especially when you visit the mother of 1990s
consumer temples, just off a freeway in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The temple in question is the flagship store of REI, a
camping/sporting/outdoor retailer. You can buy kayaks and snowshoes
and anti-sting kits, indeed everything you might require to master
nature's various elements.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy clips and ropes and ingenious spring-loaded clamps,
all essential for turning sheer rocks into climbing frames for
adults. Upstairs, you may test a hundred types of shoe on a
convenient indoor hiking path. You may choose a waterproof jacket,
and check to see if it really keeps the moisture out by stepping
into a rain room.
</P>
<P>
   The choosing is no simple matter. The clothing at REI features a
bewildering variety of fabrics, lightweight or heavy-duty,
odor-eating or moisture-wicking, Gore-Tex, Spandex and Cordura.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the camping section, even the humble water filter
assumes an intimidating mien. Should you choose the ceramic
micro-strainer or the carbon-core membrane, the iodine resin or the
pleated glass fiber?
</P>
<P>
   To grapple with these issues, you must read a pamphlet, prepared
by REI's thoughtful staff. This describes which microorganisms are
caught by which filtration technology; no single device can be
relied upon to trap all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The prudent course, it seems, is to buy 11 filters and drain
water through each one. But what if a key filter cracks? ``Always
carry spare elements, parts and backup water treatment method,''
intones the pamphlet.
</P>
<P>
   Across America, there are now 51 REI stores, up from 26 in 1990;
and each year 1.5 million visitors flock to the mother temple in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some no doubt come to gawp: at the world's highest artificial
climbing spire, laid on for shoppers to test climbing shoes; or at
the cafeteria's bewildering variety of ethnic foods (which come
with another set of instructions, naturally).
</P>
<P>
   But other visitors go to REI with more serious intent. They know
that ambling through the countryside on a weekend afternoon carries
an intolerable opportunity cost: the time could be so much better
spent on greater things, such as whitewater canoeing or off-road
biking.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you choose deliberately not to live life to the full, you
will want to try these sports. Therefore, you realize, you will
need REI's equipment.
</P>
<P>
   And so, for opportunity maximizers at least, shopping at REI
becomes an existential duty.
</P>
<P>
   You must read the medical notes printed on REI's walls,
explaining the risks of exercising without a hydration pack
strapped on to your back, so that you can sip water regularly.
</P>
<P>
   You must master REI's high-tech gadgets, using one computer to
track your whereabouts and another to keep tabs on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   You must feed yourself with intensively nutritious vacuum-packed
objects. After all, with 11 water filters in your bag, there won't
be room for sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   Some people fret over this ingenious fuelling of materialism.
They see it as evidence of America's darker sides. Americans fret
that, for all their prosperity, life is increasingly stressful; if
buying a water filter has come to involve a chemistry lesson,
perhaps this is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Americans worry about a growing class divide; and the
REI attitude to life is spreading mainly among a select group of
richly-compensated high achievers. One in two Americans, after all,
is nowadays classified as overweight; and one in four admits to
being wholly sedentary.
</P>
<P>
   You feel this class divide most sharply in the West, where the
REI way bumps up against a more traditional outdoorsiness.
</P>
<P>
   In the old mining towns of southern Utah, the locals load the
gun racks on their pickups, and rumble off into the wilderness to
hunt; but the taste for shooting at wildlife is being rapidly
displaced by the tourist taste for photographing it.
</P>
<P>
   The locals' pickups are rusting and gnarled; but the tourists
haul themselves up rocks with clips and clamps made out of
aerospace-grade metal.
</P>
<P>
   The locals see no virtue in unnecessary strain. But the tourists
bike up mountains undeterred by desert sun, trusting in health
insurance and helmets to save them from the consequences of their
bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the rich have always sought out nature in ways that
others found bizarre. On a trip out West a century ago, Theodore
Roosevelt was bitten by a snake and pitched from a wagon on to his
head; he declared, in a rehearsal of today's mountain-bike
machismo, that this was ``very good fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, REI does represent a change. For one thing, Roosevelt
did not care what he wore. ``We are dressed about as badly as
mortals could be,'' he wrote of one youthful adventure: ``unshaven
faces, dirty gray shirts, still dirtier yellow trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, despite some interest in conservation, Roosevelt was an
environmental lout by modern standards. On a trip to Africa, he
killed nine lions, eight elephants and 13 rhinoceroses.
</P>
<P>
   The patricians of yesteryear resembled, in their approach to
nature at least, today's rougher members of the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The new masters of the information age are different. They want
to preserve the wilderness, but also to look smart in it; they have
taken the fastidious dressing and equipment fetishism of suburban
sports such as golf, and transported them to the great open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this makes for new social divisions, and occasionally
for stress; but it is fun, and it fuels the economy.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the boom lasts, America's mild economic anxieties
will pale next to Japan's. As it happens, REI aims to open its
first overseas store in Tokyo, in 2000. &QL;

FOR SEATTLE, A NEW TREND: WAKE   UP, SMELL THE COFFEE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the crewmen's shack on Pier 14 of Puget Sound's
Elliott waterway, an engineer in orange slicker and flannel who
identifies himself only as ``Captain'' holds forth at a table of
dock workers clutching cups of oily coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city has become a fraud,'' he said, voicing a common view
on the waterfront, where the city's chic latte-drinking set is
viewed askance. ``It's not what people want you to think it is.
This is no different than anywhere else. Never was.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade of building itself up as the nation's
lifestyle paradise, where Gore-Tex took the place of Armani and the
economy seemed bulletproof, Seattle recently has found reason to
doubt itself.
</P>
<P>
   This month Boeing, by far the city's largest employer, announced
plans to lay off 48,000 workers, a drastic move expected to push
the city into its first recession in 16 years. With Asia in
financial crisis, ships that once departed Seattle docks loaded
with wheat, timber, paper, and aluminum bound for Japan and Korea
are leaving empty. Exports fell 20 percent in the first six months
of the year, decimating some farms and regional manufacturers that
have become dependent on foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see stuff coming in, but there's a lot of empty crates
going out,'' said Bob Dalheim, a tugboat operator.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some say the much vaunted Pacific Northwest
image that became a virtual trademark for many local companies and
made dozens of them household names is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the fascination with that Seattle image, be it
lifestyle or whatever, is probably wearing off,'' said Richard
Conway, a local economist.
</P>
<P>
   All that is a hard fall for a place that was, in the words of
Fortune magazine, the ``capital of the '90s.'' By reputation, at
least, it has everything: urban chic, stunning natural beauty, and
prosperity. The companies it spawned made millions exporting to the
rest of the nation what became known as the Seattle mystique in the
form of designer coffee, microbrewed beer, camping equipment, and
of course, computer software.
</P>
<P>
   But now Microsoft has become a behemoth known these days for its
ongoing battle with the Justice Department, which has accused the
company of widespread anticompetitive practices. Bill Gates is
viewed in many quarters as a corporate Darth Vader, not the Wonder
Boy of a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Starbucks, once an icon of Seattle's homey hipness, is nearly as
common as McDonalds and may be best known as the brand preferred by
Clinton prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr. Eddie Bauer, an L.L.
Bean-style outdoor clothier that relied on homespun simplicity, now
belongs to a mass-market catalog company and has abandoned its
original product line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sales at Nike, another Pacific Northwest corporate
giant, have fallen precipitously in the last quarter, as the youth
market continues to eschew athletic shoes. The company's ``Just Do
It'' message, practically a generational motto just a few years
ago, has been trashed in recent marketing surveys and Nike's image
has been tarnished by reports of sweatshop conditions at its
foreign manufacturing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started as symbols of a lifestyle, you might say a pure
lifestyle,'' Conway said. ``But when you get big and make a lot of
money, you lose the personal touch. Then people love to hate you.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle itself seems no longer to possess all the qualities that
helped fuel a dedade of regional hubris. Rampant development has
severely damaged native salmon populations. New subdivisions creep
ever farther up the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. And
rush-hour traffic, once virtually nonexistent, was recently
determined by a Texas consulting firm to be the nation's worst
behind San Francisco and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the same town it was, that's for sure,'' lamented
Peter Conte, a native and spokesman for Boeing, the company that
more than any other represents what locals now call ``the old
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   That time is nostalgically recalled as the era that helped make
Seattle famous in the 1990s. The city was uncrowded, according to
long-time residents, life was simpler, and people hiked and fished
in the unspoiled forests and mountains nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a one-company town, whose fortunes were tied to
Boeing. During the company's heyday, in the 1960s, two out of every
three of the city's working adults were employed in its cavernous
aircraft assembly plants and administrative offices. When the
company laid off 54,000 in the early 1970s, the city nearly
collapsed. A billboard along the highway near the plant read, ``The
Last Person to Leave, Please Turn Out the Lights.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials embarked on a plan to resurrect Seattle's economy
and build an image as ``the most beautiful city in America.'' Much
was made of the local landscape in recruiting employees and
businesses from other regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to all say that Mount Rainier was worth $10,000 a year
in salary,'' Boeing's Conte said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it helped inspire a mass migration in the 1980s from
cities like Los Angeles and New York, which go-go yuppies fled to
seek a more meaningful life in the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in California in the '80s,'' said Mary Ann Quarton,
director of the University of Washington's retail management
program. ``I saw what it did to people. Nobody was happy. It was
all about making money and spending it. The values of the Northwest
really caught on. Suddenly everyone wanted to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was flooded with more than a half-million new residents,
and with the deluge came innovative ideas and marketing savvy. It
is ``interesting to note,'' said Richard Yalch, a University of
Washington marketing professor, ``that some of the most successful
companies selling the Seattle life were started by New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers bred deep resentments among established residents,
who responded by forming such groups as the ``Committee for a
Lesser Seattle'' and coining terms like ``Californication'' to
describe what they saw happening to the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It was the birth of ``the new Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the old Seattle and there is the new Seattle,'' said
Quarton. ``The new Seattle is Microsoft. That culture is taking
over.''
</P>
<P>
   And very rich. Microsoft's 11,500 Seattle-area employees receive
an average of $250,000 a year, including salary, stock options, and
benefits, according to Conway, the economist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking chump change here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of that wealth is everywhere, especially on the
city's east side, where subdivisions of sparkling near-mansions
have been carved into the forest. The wooded shores of Lake
Washington, where Gates is finishing his $60 million,
40,000-square-foot mansion, increasingly is fronted by houses
purchased by the new techno class.
</P>
<P>
   Among real estate agents, the vision of a 25-year-old bachelor
Microsoft programmer putting down cash on an $800,000 house has
become a Seattle archetype.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's depressing,'' said Ken Bacon, managing broker for
Windermere Realty in Redmond, the suburb where Microsoft is
headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of other excesses proliferate. According to the Seattle
Times, a Microsoft employee recently hosted a private dinner for a
group including his tailor, chef, and wine buyer. The tab, after
Chateaubriand, wine, cognac, and cigars: $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   If recession hits Seattle, Microsoft is expected to be one of
the few companies to come out unscathed. While virtually every
other industry has felt the pinch of Asia's financial crisis, the
company is likely to exceed the $2 billion in software it exported
to Pacific Rim countries last year. And when Boeing announced its
layoffs early this month, Microsoft hastily and pointedly announced
it planned to hire thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty clear the message they were sending,'' said
Boeing's Conte. ``They didn't make any bones about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtual reality,'' said economist Conway. ``That's
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its visible presence, Microsoft is not enough to save
Seattle from a likely downturn, economists said. But in the view of
some, the company and its wealthy minions are setting a new tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about money now,'' said Quarton.
</P>
<P>
   The REI mountaineering store offers a view of how things have
changed. Its giant wooden lodge near downtown opened last year and
has become Seattle's most popular tourist attraction except for the
space needle.
</P>
<P>
   Landscaped with native conifers, the site boasts a bike path and
a two-story waterfall. Inside, a stone pinnacle for climbers rises
65 feet. A rain booth simulates mountain thunder showers for
Gore-Tex wearers.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors never make it to the mountains, admitted William
Chin, REI's special events coordinator. ``The point is they feel
good coming here,'' he said. ``They're happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of such things, a Seattle resident recently complained in a
letter to the Seattle Times that ``it now appears Seattleites' idea
of a good time has switched from outdoor activities to indoor
shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's American life now,'' said Quarton. ``We had an
image of being a different sort of place. But reality is reality.
It always has a way of creeping back in.''

mortals could be,'' he wrote of one youthful adventure: ``unshaven
faces, dirty gray shirts, still dirtier yellow trousers.''
</P>
<P>
   And, despite some interest in conservation, Roosevelt was an
environmental lout by modern standards. On a trip to Africa, he
killed nine lions, eight elephants and 13 rhinoceroses.
</P>
<P>
   The patricians of yesteryear resembled, in their approach to
nature at least, today's rougher members of the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The new masters of the information age are different. They want
to preserve the wilderness, but also to look smart in it; they have
taken the fastidious dressing and equipment fetishism of suburban
sports such as golf, and transported them to the great open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this makes for new social divisions, and occasionally
for stress; but it is fun, and it fuels the economy.
</P>
<P>
   So long as the boom lasts, America's mild economic anxieties
will pale next to Japan's. As it happens, REI aims to open its
first overseas store in Tokyo, in 2000. &QL;

NOT SO FAST! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 3)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's relatively easy to find a label for a policy that involves
the promise of action. Both ``Fifty-Four Forty or Fight!'' and the
more temperate ``Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick'' carried
messages of stern forewarning. Policy slogans beginning with
 &UR; Remember &LR; , with their pledges of vengeance, had a good run in
wartime, with the outrages to be recalled ranging from the Alamo to
the Maine to Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   More recently,  &UR; containment &LR;  was George Kennan's somewhat more
sobersided contribution to Cold War foreign-policy nomenclature,
followed by the Clinton administration's  &UR; engagement &LR; . These
offered a sense of quiet but resolute policy action.
</P>
<P>
   What do you label a policy that does not appeal to jingoism,
adventurism, interventionism _ or, indeed, commit you to any
reaction whatever? Many statesmen find much in a philosophy that
eschews escalation, arguing instead, ``Don't just do something _
stand there.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the challenge that faced Strobe Talbott, deputy
secretary of state, as he sought a catch phrase to define the
Clinton administration's foreign policy in a multipolar but
uni-superpower world.
</P>
<P>
   As a former correspondent and columnist for Time magazine,
Talbott knew that a diplomatic word or phrase had to be conceived
in quietude, preferably before an academic audience, and then be
allowed to develop slowly over the months. Any more pretentious
unveiling, or capitalization, would alert the legion of carping
critics to strangle the label in its crib.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 19, 1997, he offered his conception to Stanford
University: ``We need to make sure we have a policy toward Russia
that contains an indispensable feature:  &UR; strategic patience &LR; . That
means a policy not just for coping with the issue or the crisis of
the moment or the week or even of the season, or for getting
through the next summit meeting; rather it means a policy for the
next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Few combinations of words are now wholly original.  &UR; Strategic
patience &LR;  had been used two weeks earlier by a corporate executive,
Jim Maxmin, in an article for Industry Week; a year before that, in
``The Good Guys,'' a book by Jules Bonavolonta and Brian Duffy, the
phrase was used to describe the FBI plan to infiltrate major Mafia
families to conduct long-term investigations. Earlier hits can be
made in databases covering fields from music to the military.
</P>
<P>
   But after Talbott slipped his diplomatic usage into the
bulrushes, the Senate's authority on foreign affairs, Richard
Lugar, picked it up in a January 1998 Harvard speech. ``American
policy toward Russia must contain a healthy dose of  &UR; strategic
patience &LR; ,'' he said, accepting the Talbott definition, but adding
that it was today ``particularly susceptible to Russian
nonperformance.''
</P>
<P>
   By November, the conceiver was ready to incubate the phrase in a
speech subtitle. In ``Gogol's Troika: The Case for  &UR; Strategic
Patience &LR;  in a Time of Troubles,'' Talbott _ whose enthusiastic
support of Boris Yeltsin has been tempered by disappointment _
returned to Stanford to say, ``The policy that flows from realism
is one of  &UR; strategic patience &LR;  and persistence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest he be accused of departing from previous policy, he added,
``That means  &UR; continuing engagement &LR; .'' After he reworked his
thoughtful speech for The Economist, his phrase was picked up by
his former colleagues at Time.
</P>
<P>
   Because White House speech writers have chosen no Clinton
Doctrine or catch phrase of their own and are not really married to
 &UR; engagement &LR; , Talbott's personal, long-suffering, tactical patience
has paid off: His phrase is in play.
</P>
<P>
   On what linguistic structure is this coinage bottomed? (As Henry
Kissinger once shouted at a football referee who had just made an
egregious interference call against a Redskins cornerback, ``On vot
theory?'')
</P>
<P>
   The use of an active modifier to qualify a noun that justifies
not rushing into action has a grand history in diplomatic rhetoric.
President Grover Cleveland, criticizing the seizure of Hawaii by
the United States in 1893, wrote, ``There seemed to arise ... the
precise opportunity for which he was  &UR; watchfully waiting &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, President Woodrow Wilson picked up that
alliterative phrase and, refusing to be drawn into a war with
Mexico, elevated it to policy status: ``We shall not, I believe, be
obliged to alter our policy of  &UR; watchful waiting &LR; .'' The stern
 &UR; watchful &LR;  gave a monitoring, almost monitory, cast to the feeble
 &UR; waiting &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   This built on the tradition begun in 1791 by Sir James
Mackintosh, a historian and member of Parliament, in ``Vindiciae
Gallicae,'' a response to Edmund Burke's criticism of the French
Revolution. ``The Commons, faithful to their system,'' wrote
Mackintosh, ``remained in a wise and  &UR; masterly inactivity &LR; .'' That
phrase resounded among all who wanted to do little or nothing, and
was soon followed by his equally stirring `` &UR; disciplined
inaction &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   No ringing refutations or derisive slogans have yet met
Talbott's sophisticated essay into the field of semi-oxymoronic
phrase making. We will just have to let the dust settle.
</P>
<P>
   But those sensitive to the technique soon noted another, similar
construction that offered a corollary to  &UR; strategic patience &LR; . A
White House spokesman seeking to substitute censure for impeachment
used a highly active adverb to give backbone to a passive
participle: ``Officials publicly indicated more interest than
before,'' reported The Washington Post, ``saying they were
 &UR; aggressively listening &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   COMPULSIVE COMPELLING
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a  &UR; compulsive &LR; , a  &UR; compelling &LR;  case,'' opined Henry
Hyde, House Judiciary chairman. Which did he mean?
</P>
<P>
   Both words are rooted in the Latin  &UR; pellere &LR; , ``to drive.''
 &UR; Compel &LR;  is ``to drive forcefully,''  &UR; impel &LR;  is ``to drive with
moral pressure'' and  &UR; propel &LR;  is ``to drive forward.'' Although
 &UR; compelling &LR;  and  &UR; compulsive &LR;  are usually taken to be synonyms, the
meanings of the two adjectives are differentiating usefully.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Compulsive &LR; , which still means ``having the power to compel,''
is being overtaken by its secondary meaning, ``under the
psychological coercion of obsession.'' One of these days,
psychiatrists will adopt the verb  &UR; compulse &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile,  &UR; compelling &LR;  (though its root of  &UR; compel &LR;  still means
``to force'' or ``to urge irresistibly'') is more often being used
to mean ``driving toward a conclusion or action by cogent
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde meant  &UR; compelling &LR; , I hope.

DRAWING A LINE IN THE QUICKSAND

<TEXT>
<P>
   So Iraq is now under western bombardment. On Dec. 16, a month
after a previous raid was aborted at the last minute, Bill Clinton,
with Britain's Tony Blair in faithful tow, decided to punish Iraq
with missiles and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The prompt for the current attack is a report by Richard Butler,
the chief of the U.N. inspection team (UNSCOM), that showed Saddam
Hussein had not complied with his pledge on Nov. 14 to allow UNSCOM
full access to all suspect sites.
</P>
<P>
   The response, in the Middle East and beyond, and the
consequences within Iraq itself, can only be guessed at.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been more straightforward if the attack had taken
place in November, when Hussein's behavior, in ending all
cooperation with UNSCOM's inspectors, was unequivocally condemned.
Few voices, at that time, were raised in the Iraqi dictator's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, the issues are cloudier, and feelings more
ambivalent: Russia, China and France, the three other permanent
members of the Security Council, are strongly against the attack;
the Arab world's first response was to express sorrow, cynicism and
outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Butler was reporting on Iraqi compliance in the four weeks since
Iraq averted air strikes by promising to cooperate fully with
UNSCOM's demands. The report said the promise had been broken: Iraq
was helpful in many routine ways but unhelpful in other ways and
those are the ways that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's main transgression was to refuse to allow the inspectors,
who were testing Iraqi compliance with a series of unannounced
visits to sensitive sites, access to the ruling Baath Party's
offices unless they first said what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq had supposedly been hoping that Butler's report would open
the way for a comprehensive review by the Security Council of the
whole policy of sanctions and disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But it plainly has things _ not necessarily of the
weapons-making kind _ that it would like to conceal from inspectors
it has come to regard as spies of America and/or Israel.
</P>
<P>
   From a military viewpoint, the American attack will test the
claim of military planners that missiles have become ``smarter''
and more accurate since the 1991 Gulf war: at least half the
explosives now being dropped on Iraq are supposed to be
precision-guided, compared with about 10 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise missiles have been fitted with satellite-based guidance
systems making it possible to readjust their course in mid-flight
and, in theory, to achieve pinpoint accuracy. But even the planners
agree that they cannot avoid civilian casualties _ or hope, by air
power alone, to destroy Iraq's capacity to make lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The political consequences are even more twisted. The response
of cynics, who include many Arabs, is to question the timing. The
House of Representatives' decision to delay Clinton's impeachment
debate, which had been due to start on Dec. 17, will add force to
the widely held view that attacking Iraq was a classic diversionary
tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Butler's report surely cannot have been under
Clinton's control. But Clinton's explanation that the bombing had
to start immediately because it would have been ``profoundly
offensive'' to strike Iraq during the holy month of Ramadan, which
begins on Dec. 20, is unlikely to win him Muslim friends.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech explaining why the action had to be taken, Clinton
said that ``we will pursue a long-term strategy to contain
Iraq...and work toward the day when Iraq has a government worthy of
its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that looks like two aims. America's public aim, until now,
has been to contain Hussein _ with sanctions, inspections and arms
control. But a campaign of sustained bombing could move matters to
a different plane. Forget inspection and arms control, the aim then
would be to rid Iraq of its dictator and his entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Few, including few Iraqis, would object to that _ if it could be
done, and done without causing chaos. But could it?
</P>
<P>
   The great fear among Iraq's neighbors is that America may be
militarily successful in destroying much of Iraq, but that the
eventual political success will still be Saddam's. &QL;

   KIEV _ In the shabby turn-of-the-century synagogue in Kiev's
Shchekavitska Street, a service is in rumbustious progress. Little
boys somersault on the pews and old men, leather phylacteries
strapped to their foreheads and fringed shawls over their
shoulders, debate vociferously as prayers are read from a
velvet-wrapped Torah scroll.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where KGB men once stood outside the few working
synagogues on Sabbath mornings, this scene should lift hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is poignant: every year, about one in ten of Ukraine's
300,000 Jews leaves to go to Israel, Germany or America. At the
current rate of emigration, in a decade's time Kiev's synagogues
will be empty.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian Jewry dates back to the ancient Greek colonies of the
Black Sea coast, predating the rise of the Slav principality out of
which ancient Rus grew.
</P>
<P>
   And Ukrainian Jewry later produced a host of famous names, from
Golda Meir and Leon Trotsky to the writers Isaac Babel and Sholem
Aleichem, whose bittersweet stories inspired ``Fiddler on the
Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, that grand tradition is coming to an end. Since the late
1980s, when Soviet Jews started to get exit visas in large numbers,
Ukraine's Jewish population has fallen by half, reckons Leonid
Finberg, head of Kiev's Institute of Jewish Studies.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the emigrants are young, including all Finberg's
best researchers, while those who stay behind are dying off fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every child born of a Jewish mother,'' he says, ``there
are nine deaths. If the over-50s make up 25 percent of the general
population, in the Jewish community it's over 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The more people leave, the less likely it is that the remainder
will stay: ``Most of us now have close relations abroad. So
emigration isn't seen as such a tragedy as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiefly to blame for the exodus is Ukraine's dreadful economy,
which has shrunk every year since independence. Another cause is a
lack of help for those who want to rebuild Judaism at home.
</P>
<P>
   None of the five big foreign-financed Jewish businesses working
in Ukraine specifically encourages people to stay, while the
country's 16 newly opened Jewish schools teach Hebrew, to prepare
for life in Israel, rather than Yiddish, the historic
Jewish-Ukrainian tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Ukraine's two dozen or so rabbis are American Hasidim:
none admits regret that the congregations, choirs and youth groups,
painstakingly rebuilt after years of oppression, are being lost to
emigration.
</P>
<P>
   As Yaakov Bleich, an Orthodox rabbi from Brooklyn, puts it:
``Our goal is neither to rebuild the community, nor to get them to
leave. It's to educate them, to give them as much Jewish life as
possible while they're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiev's Reform rabbi, David Wilfond, is as unsentimental. His job
is not, he says, ``to keep one last fiddler on the roof while the
house burns.'' &QL;

<P>
   Once revolutionary, the steam engine is now the epitome of
old-fashioned technology. But the motors of the industrial
revolution have not run out of steam just yet.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in Winterthur, Switzerland, the most advanced large
steam locomotive ever built is being tested at the Swiss Locomotive
and Machine Works (SLM) _ a division of a conglomerate called
Sulzer.
</P>
<P>
   Although it looks like a conventional steam locomotive, SLM's
engine incorporates a host of technological improvements that make
it cleaner and more efficient than the Puffing Billies of old. As a
result, it could give diesel engines a run for their money.
</P>
<P>
   The godfather of the modern steam-engine movement is Livio Dante
Porta, an Argentine engineer who realized, when steam engines
started to be replaced by diesels in the 1950s, that there was
still plenty of room for improvement in steam-engine design.
</P>
<P>
   He spent his career finding new ways to refine the performance
of steam engines. He and his followers, who include Roger Waller,
chief designer of the SLM locomotive, have travelled the world,
restoring and modernizing old engines, and trying to rekindle
support for steam power.
</P>
<P>
   The engine now being tested by SLM was originally built in
Germany in 1942. It has been upgraded according to Porta's
principles, which improve performance in a number of ways.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, unlike conventional coal-fired steam engines, the
new engine burns light oil. It also has an improved draft mechanism
to supply the air for combustion. With coal-fired engines as much
as half the coal is carried away by the air as it passes over the
fuel, so the new engine is far more fuel-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is no need for a stoker to shovel the coal,
and no danger of burning embers causing track-side fires.
</P>
<P>
   Another improvement is the use of modern materials to insulate
the boiler and the steam pipes. One result of this is that the
boiler stays warm overnight and the engine can be brought to its
operating temperature within 15 minutes in the morning, compared
with three hours for a conventional steam engine.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with other improvements, including weight reductions
made possible by the use of welded rather than cast-iron
components, and the replacement of oil-lubricated bearings by
modern roller bearings, the result is an engine 25 percent lighter,
36 percent more powerful, and consuming 41 percent less fuel than
old-fashioned coal-fired engines.
</P>
<P>
   But as well as outperforming conventional steam engines, the new
one compares favorably with diesels, both economically and
environmentally.
</P>
<P>
   According to SLM, modern steam locomotives cost around SFr2
million ($1.5 million) each to build from scratch _ about the same
as a diesel locomotive. Although they consume slightly more fuel,
they are simpler to maintain and repair, making them especially
suitable for use in poor countries. They last longer, too.
</P>
<P>
   And they are also less smelly. Because they rely on external
combustion (the burning of fuel at a constant rate outside the
engine's cylinders, rather than explosively inside them), they
produce only a fifth of the noxious emissions of diesels of
comparable power.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially desirable in such applications as shunting,
when locomotives spend 70 percent of their time idling, often in
built-up areas in which pollution is particularly unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   The current tests involve measuring the power of a modernized
locomotive by pitting it against two electric engines in a
tug-of-war. Once testing is complete the engine, which belongs to a
German railway company, will be used on the Orient Express.
</P>
<P>
   But according to SLM, tourism is by no means the only market for
new steam locomotives. The company also has its eye on developing
countries with extensive railway networks, such as India and China.
Once the figures from this week's tests are in to prove its case,
SLM hopes it will be full steam ahead. &QL;

PERSONAL HEALTH: MAKING CHOICE OF HEALTHIEST AND TASTIEST ONE AND
THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was at a holiday party last week. As you might guess, there
were platters of cookies, cakes and candies to tempt the weak of
will. But the three dishes that disappeared the fastest were a
lentil soup, a salad of lentils, rice and fresh vegetables and a
hot-smoked salmon fillet. Were these downed first because the
nutrition police were watching, because the partygoers were a
particularly health-conscious bunch, or because these dishes were
simply delicious?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, all three reasons prevailed. I was there, and people
assume that I watch what everyone eats. My fellow celebrants were
educated, reasonably affluent and aware of the connections between
food and health. But to me the most salient explanation was that
the foods that happened to be healthiest were also the best
tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to a recently published survey of food choices
among nearly 3,000 randomly chosen American adults, taste
(surprise, surprise) emerged as the overriding criterion for food
choices across the board, regardless of age, income or ethnic
background. People simply like to eat what tastes good to them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what tastes good TO most Americans is not exactly
good FOR them. What makes food taste good to most people? Fat and
sugar. And, predictably, as more and more Americans choose pleasure
over nutrition, we are eating more of both. True, the percentage of
calories from fats has declined, but because we are eating about
300 calories a day more than we used to, we are actually consuming
as much fat as before, primarily in fast foods, restaurant meals
and snacks _ pizza, burgers, french fries, salad dressings, pasta
sauces, potato and corn chips and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, about 60 percent of Americans eat at least one
restaurant-prepared meal every day, and most of those meals are
made without so much as a nod toward good nutrition. These
high-fat, low-fiber meals account for half of our caloric intake.
And while the craze for fat-free and low-fat foods has not yet
abated, the most popular choices are not fruits, vegetables and
whole grains (which are naturally low in fat) but sweet baked goods
and frozen desserts, which are loaded with sugar to enhance the
flavor lost when fat was reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 15 percent of Americans now consume the recommended
minimum of five servings a day of fruits and vegetables, the foods
most closely linked to leanness and health. In recent years, there
has been no change in consumption of vegetables, particularly the
most protective dark green and deep yellow ones.
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, children are not doing any better than
adults. With 60 percent of moms working and time pressures on
families ever more acute, ready-made and fast-food meals have
become the norm in many households with young children. American
children are fatter today than ever before, and one in five has a
cholesterol level that is setting him up for future heart disease.
Food specialists at Edelman Public Relations Worldwide have
predicted, ``In the next 10 years, there will be consumers who have
never cooked a meal from basic ingredients, and many of them will
have been the children of today.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the day of grandiose resolutions approaches, the time is
ideal for all Americans to prepare for the next millennium by
making gradual changes toward a healthier diet. It is important to
remember that although medical advances are keeping us alive longer
than ever before, the goal is not living long per se but living a
quality life in one's later years.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer surveys reveal that resistance to adopting a healthier
diet can be attributed to a combination of time pressures and false
beliefs. Nearly three-quarters of American adults categorize foods
as either ``good'' or ``bad,'' and more than a third think that
eating healthier means giving up their favorite foods, i.e., the
``bad'' foods. Yet, the message nutrition specialists advocate is
moderation, not elimination. While some food fanatics may label
cake, candy, ice cream, steak, fries or even pizza as poison, most
well-schooled and realistic experts say there is room for all of
these, in reasonable amounts now and then, in almost everyone's
diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable amounts'' is another problem. Anne Wolf, a
registered dietitian at the University of Virginia Health Science
Center, points out that ``our portion sizes have totally changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The original Coke bottle was a six- or eight-ounce bottle,''
she added. ``Then it grew to the 12-ounce can, then the 20-ounce
bottle, and then the Big Gulp. And now we have the Double Big Gulp,
which has 10 times the calories of a Coke 50 years ago,'' she said.
``Or consider McDonald's. Today, consumers are into value meals, so
you not only get your hamburger _ which is bigger _ but you get
more french fries and a bigger soda.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolf laments, ``We've internalized these larger portion
sizes and, frankly, it's very hard to downsize.''
</P>
<P>
   Other obstacles to dietary change include the mistaken belief
that eating better is important only for those with serious health
risks, resistance to change and confusion about conflicting
information that can emerge from studies on nutrition and health.
Is margarine OK or not? Is a high-carbohydrate diet the right
choice, or does it lead to weight gain? Does alcohol protect from
heart disease but cause breast cancer? Is olive oil healthy or just
another source of fat? A quarter of adults say there are so many
conflicting studies they do not know what is good for them, so they
have just tossed up their hands and opted to make no changes at all
in their eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   Although children learn to like best what they grow up eating,
it is also true that people's tastes can change. After all, few
adults of today grew up eating the packaged, fast-food and take-out
meals they now consume. But since economic realities combined with
on-the-go life styles make it highly unlikely many people will
return to cooking most meals from scratch, what are the options?
</P>
<P>
   For one, fresh fruits require no preparation and are ideal
snacks and desserts for young and old. Many supermarkets have salad
bars or produce sections with cut-up vegetables ready for steaming
or stir-frying or use in salads. Or, though not as crunchy or
tasty, frozen vegetables (without creamy sauces) are as nutritious
as fresh ones.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber-rich whole-grain cereals and breads take no more time to
buy or prepare than pasty white ones. Fish fillets and chicken and
turkey breasts without skin cook quickly and require only a little
seasoning to be moist and delicious. Canned beans are a nutritious,
instant addition to salads, soups and pasta sauces. Tuna and
sardines packed in water, canned salmon, sliced turkey breast and
boiled ham make great sandwiches or salad additions.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite meal plan is to cook a few double recipes on the
weekend that can be heated in the microwave for instant meals all
week long. To overcome the resistance to change (your own or your
family's), it is wise to avoid revolutionary alterations. If you
change just one meal a week, or one meal every two weeks, by the
next millennium your taste buds will have adapted to a whole new
and more nutritious diet, achieved painlessly and without the
likelihood of relapse into old unhealthy habits.
</P>
<P>
   Wishing you all a happy _ and healthy _ New Year.

RUTH'S OTHER RECORD: CANCER PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At Babe Ruth Day at Yankee Stadium in 1947, the baseball hero of
the generation stood before an admiring crowd, deep in pain and
emaciated from advancing cancer, not yet aware of what ailed him.
In the dugout moments before, clad in a topcoat and golf hat, he
suffered a coughing spell, then, pulling himself together, walked
to home plate, mentally recalling the day Lou Gehrig had made the
same trip.
</P>
<P>
   In a broadcast heard around the world, Ruth spoke slowly and
extemporaneously in a raspy voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how bad my voice sounds,'' Ruth told the roaring
crowd. ``Well, it feels just as bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen months later, at 53, he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the 50th anniversary of Ruth's death, his sports
legacy has been extolled again as baseball heroes of newer
generations breezed past the home-run record the Babe held for 34
years, until 1961.
</P>
<P>
   But unknown to many, Ruth also left a legacy in the annals of
medical history.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was among the first patients anywhere to receive
experimental chemotherapy, and some researchers say he was the
first ever to receive a combination treatment of chemotherapy and
radiation for his type of cancer. For Ruth, the chemotherapy worked
dramatically _ but only temporarily. Nevertheless, knowledge gained
from his case helped shape the combination therapy that is now
standard for his disease.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his death, the nature of his disease became clear,
and well publicized. Ruth suffered from a rare cancer,
naso-pharyngeal, that arose in the air passages in the back of his
nose and mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But the images of a hoarse Ruth, perpetuated in audio and
videotapes on the Internet, in movies and in sports broadcasts, in
addition to his well-known smoking and drinking proclivities, have
contributed to the myth that Ruth had throat cancer, which is
generally taken to mean cancer of the larynx, or voice box.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction in cancer type may be academic to fans, but to
patients and the doctors who treat them, the difference is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, even a peer-reviewed medical journal has erred in
stating the cause of Ruth's death.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Cancer Therapeutics, the official journal of
the Coalition of National Cancer Cooperative Groups, published an
article by Dr. Dennis Cooper, a Yale oncologist, stating that Ruth
had cancer of the larynx, and that even 50 years later his chances
for being cured were only slightly improved.
</P>
<P>
   The article prompted an intense discussion among doctors at the
University of California at San Francisco, who then turned to
original source materials, microfilm of The New York Times and
Ruth's autopsy report. Next month those doctors are publishing
another article, helping to correct the record, in the journal
Laryngoscope. Its editors have imposed an embargo on the new paper,
even though it is largely based on 50-year-old newspaper accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's battle against cancer offers a rare glimpse into the many
dramatic changes in medicine and attitudes toward research that
have occurred in just half a century. The changes include greater
accuracy in diagnosis, more effective therapy and stronger rules to
inform patients about diagnoses and the consent now required from
patients participating in experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the sobering fact is that more than half a million people
will die from cancer in 1998 in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's health began failing in September 1946 when he sought to
return to baseball as a manager. His voice became progressively
hoarser. He was gripped with severe and relentless pain in his left
eye. His head ached. In November, he entered French Hospital in New
York City, where doctors diagnosed sinusitis, then looked at
possible dental problems and pulled three teeth, without
improvement. His face swelled, his left eye became shut and he lost
the ability to swallow. Ruth said he ``seldom could speak.'' When
he did, he wrote in his autobiography (``The Babe Ruth Story,''
E.P. Dutton &AMP; Co., 1948), his ``voice sounded like somebody
gargling ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   X-rays showed a large abnormality at the base of Ruth's skull.
But several biopsies of tissues in his mouth showed nothing
abnormal. Ruth's symptoms worsened. His neck enlarged from swollen
lymph nodes. His jaw hurt when he ate and he was unable to swallow.
Later, Ruth was fed intravenously. Although doctors were unable to
diagnose Ruth's problem, they treated him with radiation. His hair
fell out in chunks.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the doctors operated on Ruth and documented
extensive spread of the cancer in the neck. But in the operation,
surgeons had to tie off the external carotid artery because the
cancer had wrapped itself around the blood vessel in his neck. The
cancer also pressed on nerves that course through the neck from the
brain. The pressure partly paralyzed muscles controlling his voice,
accounting for his hoarseness, and making swallowing even more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1947, Ruth spent his 52d birthday in the hospital.
He had played before throngs of cheering fans in his 22-year
professional career, which ended in 1935. Now, Ruth was secluded
and allowed few visitors. ``I often felt so alone that the tears
would run helplessly down my cheeks,'' Ruth wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1947, every ball park in organized baseball celebrated
Babe Ruth Day when Ruth, bolstered by his radiation treatments,
uttered his famous hoarse words. By June, those benefits from
radiation had waned. Severe pain had returned; he could not sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth then joined the often-unaware group of anonymous patients
who ushered in the modern era of anti-cancer treatment, which grew
out of American research into chemical warfare agents during World
War II. In 1942, researchers at Yale University tested one such
agent, nitrogen mustard, in a human for the first time. But
government secrecy restrictions prevented publication until 1946,
after several hundred patients had been treated.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, a team headed by Dr. Richard Lewisohn, a surgeon at
Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, was experimenting with an
anti-cancer drug, teropterin, in mice. There were different
teropterins, all extracted from brewers' yeast, and their effects
on mice varied widely with the preparation.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the violent objections of Lewisohn's team members, who
believed the substance was not ready for tests in people, Ruth
began receiving daily injections of teropterin on June 29. (A
closely related drug, methotrexate, is now widely used in treating
cancer and other diseases.) Ruth said he knew teropterin had rarely
been used on humans and ``asked no questions,'' and probably signed
no formal consent, as is required today, before receiving
injections for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth knew the risk: The drug could help or hurt. ``I realized
that if anything was learned about that type of treatment, whether
good or bad, it would be of use in the future to the medical
profession and maybe to a lot of people with my same trouble,''
Ruth wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The drug had dramatic effects. His pain waned; his spirit
improved. Able to eat again, he began regaining some of the 80
pounds he had lost. By August, the enlarged lymph nodes in his neck
had completely disappeared. In September, Lewisohn reported Ruth's
case, without using his name, at a scientific meeting in St. Louis.
But word leaked that Ruth had received the novel therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Citing success on an unidentified famous figure, The Wall Street
Journal's lead story of Sept. 11, 1947, suggested scientists were
on the verge of a cure for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lewisohn's teammates left Mount Sinai because the
hospital refused to support further research on teropterin, said
Dr. John Laszlo, whose father, Dr. Daniel Laszlo, was a team
member. The younger Laszlo is a retired official of the American
Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   The Babe Ruth trials clearly exemplify just how much has changed
in a half century. Today, besides requiring more extensive animal
testing, Federal officials demand that researchers obtain written
patient consent and gain approval from formal committees before
testing experimental therapies on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ruth was even fully aware that he had cancer is open to
question.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, 1948, Ruth participated in the 25th anniversary of
Yankee Stadium, wearing his old No. 3 Yankee uniform and telling
misty-eyed fans how glad he was to be with his old pals again. A
few days later, Ruth entered Memorial Hospital (now Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) in Manhattan. His wife, Claire,
later wrote (``The Babe and I,'' Prentice-Hall, 1959), that he
looked at the sign and told his doctor: ``Doc, this is Memorial.
Memorial is a cancer hospital. Why are you bringing me here?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all patients at Memorial have cancer, his physician, Philip
MacDonald, replied. But the radium put in his neck was used only
for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Ruth wrote that she believed the Babe never knew he had
cancer, though she quoted her husband in a conversation with a
visitor: ``They think they are kidding me. But they aren't. I know
what I got.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 16, Ruth died of pneumonia. An autopsy showed the cancer
that began in the nose and mouth had spread widely through his
body.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth apparently never received teropterin again. Mount Sinai has
no records on Ruth or the research, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Hospital's news release emphasized that Ruth ``received
no special drug or chemical in the attempt to control his tumor.''
Teropterin was not included in Ruth's treatment at Memorial because
it ``had been previously investigated at Memorial Hospital and
found to be of no value in the treatment of cancer,'' the news
release said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's cancer became an issue in July of this year when a team
of specialists at the University of California at San Francisco
discussed a patient with naso-pharyngeal cancer. A pathologist, Dr.
Harvey Klein, said that while in training he had learned of Ruth's
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That created a great stir because virtually everyone else in
the room said Ruth died of laryngeal cancer,'' said Dr. Jeffrey
Spiegel, a specialist in head and neck surgery at the center.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors made a friendly wager. ``The reason we were so quick
to make the bet is that we had just read the article in Cancer
Therapeutics saying he had laryngeal cancer, and we were going to
bring him a reputable medical journal at the next meeting to show
him, saying here it is in print,'' Spiegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, the Yale author, said in an interview that he talked
about Ruth's case in his frequent lectures on head and neck cancer,
but did not know about the news reports stating the type of cancer
and the autopsy findings.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Dr. Mark Singer, the chief of head and neck
surgery at Mount Zion Hospital and a participant at the June
meeting, was puzzled because the eye pain and headache Ruth had
experienced typified cancer in the back of the nose much more than
cancer of the vocal cords.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague, Dr. Nadim Bikhazi, was asked to ascertain the cause
of Ruth's death and found it in microfilm of New York Times
articles, which described the autopsy findings. Bikhazi then
received permission from Ruth's daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, to
examine the autopsy report. The crucial finding, Bikhazi said in an
interview in San Francisco, was that no cancer was found in the
larynx.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of Ruth's heavy drinking, smoking and use of
snuff and his habits' links to his cancer. Those links would hold
for cancer of the larynx, but the case for naso-pharyngeal cancer
is far less clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 cases of naso-pharyngeal cancer are now diagnosed
each year in the United States. Of the three types of
naso-pharyngeal cancer, the most common occurs among Asians and is
linked to the Epstein-Barr virus but not tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth had one of the two other types, which occur more commonly
among Caucasians. The links between these two types of cancer and
tobacco are controversial, in part because of the rarity of the
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no evidence that tobacco killed him, Bikhazi said
it probably played a part.
</P>
<P>
   Today, doctors can diagnose naso-pharyngeal cancer quicker and
less painfully than in Ruth's time. A nose bleed, lump in the neck
and hearing loss in one ear are clues to the diagnosis of
naso-pharyngeal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of performing surgery to biopsy a swollen lymph node in
the neck, doctors often insert a thin needle to remove tissue for
later examination under a microscope. Sophisticated imaging
techniques developed since Ruth's death now can pinpoint an
abnormality's location and help distinguish a tumor from an abscess
and other benign conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of naso-pharyngeal cancer, the combined information
allows doctors to classify, or stage, the tumor and to customize
the now standard course of radiation and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ruth was in the most advanced stage of the cancer, his
case would still be difficult to treat today. However, Bikhazi
said, ``Ruth definitely would have had much less pain, an improved
quality of life, and probably prolonged survival, though not a
cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 40 percent of patients with advanced
naso-pharyngeal cancer survive at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the types and amounts of medications, and timing of
their delivery, are not precisely given for naso-pharyngeal cancer
today, Spiegel said, ``Ruth was the first person to get treated
almost the right way.''

NEW YORK RIDERS, AN UNFASTENED LOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By ALISHA BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite taped reminders to buckle up from Eartha
Kitt, Joe Torre, Joan Rivers and Placido Domingo, and increased
accessibility of seat belts in taxis, a new survey reports that
passengers are not fastening themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   A New York University Medical Center research team took short
trips in 60 Yellow Cabs between April and August 1997. The
investigators looked at partitions, noted seat-belt accessibility
and observed driver seat-belt use. They also observed 102
passengers entering and leaving cabs and at stoplights.
</P>
<P>
   The NYU team, whose report appears this month in The American
Journal of Public Health, found that seat-belt accessibility has
improved greatly since a similar investigation in 1986 _ at least
partly because of a 1990 law that required cab owners to make seat
belts more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Of the cabs surveyed, 75 percent had accessible right rear seat
belts, 40 percent had usable middle belts, and just over 81 percent
had left belts. In 1986, only 16 percent had accessible right seat
belts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this was the number of passengers and drivers who
were seen wearing belts: zero. New York state does not require taxi
riders or drivers to fasten their seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seth Manoach, lead author of the report, said the Plexiglas
partition that separates the front and back of the cab, the
protruding change dish, and the metal border can cause serious
injury in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   He urged taxi passengers to buckle up: ``Sit in one of the seats
with shoulder and lap belts. The middle seats don't have them, and
during a front-end collision, your head is going to come forward
and hit the barrier.''

   &UR; Calcium and Quinoa &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read that quinoa, a grain from the Andes, is very high in
calcium. How high? What are some other nondairy sources of calcium?
</P>
<P>
   A. Quinoa is a significant source of calcium, but you would have
to eat a large amount of it to get a full daily supply; the
National Academy of Sciences recommends 1,000 milligrams a day for
most people, more for those over 50, and according to the United
States Department of Agriculture, a cup (eight ounces) of cooked
Chenopodium quinoa provides about 102 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   That is more than some other grains, but a cup of cow's milk has
about 300 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   There are other nondairy sources of calcium that are richer in
calcium. Just two corn tortillas would provide about 120
milligrams, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Many greens are especially rich in calcium, and a cup of cooked
turnip greens might offer 450 milligrams. Canned sardines and
salmon with the bones in are good sources, too, as are some beans,
peas and seeds.
</P>
<P>
   However, quinoa is a generally nutritious food, rich in protein,
and it has several vitamins and minerals in it, including folate
(49 micrograms a cup), a vitamin associated with a greatly reduced
risk of birth defects when eaten by pregnant women.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It cannot be easy to go out to dinner if you are Dr. Dean
Ornish. As a best-selling author and developer of a program that
promises to reverse heart disease and help people live better, he
is recognized everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem with going out to eat, if you are Ornish,
is what to order. His diet is not just vegetarian. It also has no
added salt, fat or oil. He allows no sugar, no caffeine. It is not
easy finding a restaurant that can accommodate him. So, Ornish
says, he likes to go to places like the Avenue Grill in Mill
Valley, Calif., where the staff members know him and can prepare
the food he requires.
</P>
<P>
   One evening last spring, Ornish started with Caesar salad, which
he ordered with dressing on the side. When the salad came, he
ignored the dressing, along with the Parmesan cheese and croutons
that were sprinkled over the lettuce. Ornish's ``Caesar salad'' was
simply a handful of leaves of romaine. His main course was a plate
of steamed vegetables surrounding a scoop of plain white rice. No
butter. No oil. No salt. Not even any spices. He drank water. No
dessert. No coffee.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly seemed like enough. But Ornish, who is far from gaunt,
explained his secret. ``I eat throughout the day,'' he said. ``I
graze.''
</P>
<P>
   The diet, however, is only part of Ornish's program. Adherents
meditate, practice yoga and exercise. Those who smoke must stop.
And they regularly attend support groups and learn to manage
stress, and they are encouraged to develop and nourish close
personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   It is an intense commitment, requiring at least 12 hours a week,
not counting time to find and prepare the food, according to
Ornish's publications, and an iron will during holidays when
everyone around is stuffing down calories as if there were no
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The program and Ornish's tireless quest to publicize it has
turned him into an American phenomenon. He runs the Preventive
Medicine Institute in Sausalito, Calif., where he directs weeklong
workshops for people who want to start his program. In March,
Ornish began endorsing a line of foods that he helped develop,
Advantage/10, with the 10 standing for the 10 percent fat in his
diet.
</P>
<P>
   Ornish's adherents swear by his program. Victor Karpenko, 76,
from Danville, Calif., said he started the program more than 10
years ago. He said he lost 30 pounds and avoided bypass surgery,
which, he says, his doctor had recommended. ``I feel great,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Brandon, 68, from San Rafael, Calif., said his family
pushed him to start the program two years ago because he had had a
prostate-cancer scare. Ornish hopes that his program will prevent
prostate cancer or, if a man already has it, slow or reverse the
tumor's growth. ``I'm in love with the program,'' Brandon said.
``I'm in love with Dean, I'm in love with the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ornish also has supporters in academic medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, he's right,'' said Dr. Lee Goldman, the
chairman of the department of medicine at the University of
California in San Francisco. ``It makes good sense and we have been
very supportive of his program.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Fair, the director of the Prostate Diagnostic Center
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, ``a
believer'' in Ornish's program, started it after he contracted
colon cancer. Now he is collaborating with Ornish on research into
whether the diet can reverse cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fair said, ``I am into the diet, I take soy proteins
and vitamin E. I am into exercise, into yoga.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, observed that most Americans would not want to
follow Ornish's strict regimen. Nor would they need to. However, he
said, Ornish's most recent data, published this month in the
Journal of the American Medical Association, show that ``if one
wants to follow this regimen, then it's going to work,'' by slowing
the buildup of plaque in coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   But others are not so sure. They question whether research
supports Ornish's claims for his program and look askance at his
record as an entrepreneur. They wonder if he can be objective about
a diet program that has been a major source of income and that he
travels so vigorously to promote.
</P>
<P>
   Ornish said that to protect his objectivity, he strives to
``make sure I collaborate with people who are the most respected in
the field and whose biases are often quite different from mine.''
He adds that many who look askance at his financial arrangements
themselves take money from drug companies for research and lectures
while they are studying the companies' drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Richard Pasternak, director of preventive cardiology at
the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said that Ornish's
research did not demonstrate anything, because his studies were
flawed. ``There's virtually no science here, as far as I can
tell,'' Pasternak said.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Paul Thompson, the director of preventive cardiology at
Hartford Hospital in Connecticut, said, ``There does come a point
where one starts becoming more of a cheerleader than a scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Ornish's curriculum vitae lists scores of speeches,
television presentations and the like, it notes only three
scientific studies. One involved 10 patients studied for a month.
Another involved 48 people, who were studied for a month. It
showed, he reported, that people who followed his program had drops
in cholesterol levels, less chest pain, and an improvement in heart
function.
</P>
<P>
   The third study began with 53 patients who were asked to follow
his program and 43 who were asked if they would undergo regular
medical assessments while having their usual care. But only 28
intervention and 20 control patients agreed to participate. One of
the intervention patients died while exercising, ``greatly
exceeding his prescribed exercise,'' Ornish says.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper published this month in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, Ornish and his colleagues reported that after
five years, 20 patients remained in the treatment group and 15 in
the control group. Those who were in his program, he and his
colleagues reported, had slightly wider coronary arteries, on
average, and had, he says, ``dramatically less'' chest pain than
those who were left to their own devices.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with these studies, critics said, was their small
size. As Thompson put it, ``Rarely have so many conclusions been
based on so few subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ornish said the size of the study was less important than
the precision of the results. His measurements of changes in the
average diameter of coronary arteries were so precise, he said,
that he could see definitive results with just a few patients.
</P>
<P>
   But some researchers said Ornish should look beyond this
measurement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Eckel, a professor of medicine at the University of
Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver and chairman of the
nutrition committee of the American Heart Association noted that
Ornish did not show whether people lived longer on his program, or
had fewer heart attacks. To see such differences, if they exist,
typically requires studies with thousands of patients, followed for
years.

</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frank Sacks, a nutrition professor at Harvard Medical School
and the Harvard School of Public Health, noted that Ornish found no
improvements in the most narrowed parts of his patients' arteries _
where blood clots might be expected to lodge and cause heart
attacks. And, he added, Ornish has no evidence that artery-clogging
plaque melted away in patients on his program.
</P>
<P>
   Ornish said that what mattered most was blood flow to the heart
as well as heart attacks, hospitalizations, bypass surgery, and
chest pain. ``We found marked improvements in blood flow and two
and a half times fewer cardiac events,'' in patients on his
program, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost a matter of happenstance that Ornish found his
calling. It happened in 1972 when he dropped out of Rice University
in Houston to recover from mononucleosis and what he describes as a
suicidal depression. At his parents' home in Dallas, Ornish met Sri
Swami Satchidananda, who had been teaching Ornish's older sister to
meditate. Ornish asked the swami to help him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Become a vegetarian.''' Ornish recalled. ``I said,
`Fine.''' He said the swami also told him to meditate, practice
yoga, exercise and ``always do something to help someone.'' The
swami ``gave me my program,'' Ornish said. ``I felt better. I felt
peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by this experience, Ornish began a small study several
years later, when he was in medical school at Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston. He would see if the program the swami taught
him might reverse heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   He found 10 patients. Half chose to follow his program; the
others did not. ``I taught yoga and led exercise sessions. I taught
nutrition,'' Ornish said. And he led the participants in a support
group where, he said, they shared what he describes as their pain
and loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Ornish said the patients who followed his program ended up with
lower blood levels of cholesterol, less chest pain and improved
heart function. He followed with his one-month study of 48
patients.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote a book, ``Stress, Diet &AMP; Your Heart'' (New American
Library) that came out at the end of 1982, just before his 1983
scientific paper describing his findings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 he started his Preventive Medicine Institute and began
another study to see if he could detect an actual reversal of
atherosclerosis in patients who followed his program. He published
a paper in 1990 while, that same year, he published a book, ``Dr.
Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease'' (Ballantine
Books), which climbed to No. 3 on The New York Times best-seller
list.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ornish is hoping that he can show his program can prevent or
reverse cancer. And, he says, he would like to see it licensed for
use across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks, for one, questions whether very many patients could stick
with the program. ``I have extreme skepticism and a lot of
experience with patients,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks said he obtained a grant from the National Institutes of
Health to study Ornish's program, but he had great trouble
recruiting patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled out all the stops. We had a superb staff,'' Sacks
said. But few patients agreed to try the program and they could not
stick with it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ornish agrees that his program is not for everyone. But, he
emphasizes, the program is more than just a medical treatment for
heart disease. He follows the diet himself, he says, ``because I
prefer low-fat foods.'' And, Ornish adds, the program has other
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most important reason that many people smoke or
eat too much is because it helps them deal with stress and
loneliness and isolation,'' Ornish said. That is where stress
management and support group meetings come in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients adhere to his program, Ornish said, because they have
gone beyond ``fear of dying to joy in living.''

D'ESTE'S POETRY OFFERS A FEEL FOR THE ROMANCE OF THE LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The poetry of Jessica d'Este is not well known
except in Britain, on the Continent and in selected places on the
East Coast. It should be.
</P>
<P>
   The author's latest book of poetry, ``Wine, Woman and Song,''
offers a feel for the romance of the English language, for the way
it can fold into everyday living. She has won prizes at poetry
slams and crisscrossed the Continent on reading tours, leaving
entire rooms in silence after working her words into music.
</P>
<P>
   A widow who lives in London, d'Este writes of her father,
biophysicist Leonidas Marinelli, of the death of her husband, of
the delight in childrens' eyes at a simple story, of a life that
has leapt out at her with every passing day.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling, starting with a poem to her father, who
helped in the creation of the atomic bomb. ``My father was a
nuclear physicist involved in the Manhattan project. I grew up with
Bikini,'' said d'Este before one recent reading. ``A strange thing
... a group of intelligent scientists starting a chain reaction
without really knowing how it would end.''
</P>

OFF TREADMILL! OUT OF LAP LANE! HAPPY 1999!

<TEXT>
<P>
   While most people are (once again) starting another new year
with a vow to exercise more, my own New Year's resolution is to
exercise less.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not trying to be contrary. I'm not planning to lie around
the house all day wolfing down pork rinds, chug-a-lugging eggnog
and smoking cigarettes. But my running shoes and I deserve a rest.
My favorite Stairmaster at the gym will have to keep step without
me. It's time to stop and smell the roses, or at least something
other than the guy sweating next to me on the treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   This resolution is new for me. When I was 3, my mother marched
me off to ballet and modern dance classes, and I've been moving one
way or another in the three decades since.
</P>
<P>
   I've done a world's worth of jogging. I've swum the equivalent
of an ocean plus a lake or two. I've climbed the equivalent of tall
buildings in multiple bounds and in teeny, tiny, heart-pumping
steps. I've been aerobicized, yogacized and wrung through the
spinning cycle. Can a Saint of Perpetual Motion stop, or at least
slow down?
</P>
<P>
   I think the timing is right for this. I used to love the way my
body ached after a good, hard workout. It even felt virtuous. Now,
it just feels annoying. I'm tired of counting laps and my pulse
beat afterward. I've read the horror stories about how women's
knees tend to give out, and worse, from overuse. I've met a couple
of those casualties, and these women are the first to say it was
definitely not gain for the pain.
</P>
<P>
   While someone else might feel euphoric from the endorphin rush,
I just feel glad that the workout's over, at least for the day. It
is always better afterward than during. I feel productive because
I've been out running, instead of, say, sleeping, but that's about
it. To tweak Dorothy Parker's phrase, I don't always love running,
but I always love having run.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, working out has become perversely necessary to
my day. As faithful as a mail carrier, in rain or shine, sickness
or in health, I've been at it: at the gym, on my stationary bike at
home or running in the park. But because the thrill is going,
going, going fast, exercising seems to be taking up too much of my
time, and getting in the way of my real life.
</P>
<P>
   I don't need to lose weight or tone up or rev my cardiovascular
system. The times I've had to cut down on exercising or stop
temporarily (childbirth, a sprained ankle, several days on a small
ship) I've felt great, though mildly guilty.
</P>
<P>
   What my workouts have done for me is clear my mind of all the
complications of daily life. It's a meditation with motion. And it
has always made me feel ready to get on with my mornings, more
energized than I do after a big cup of coffee. As an A-1 stress
reducer, it has also taken me through some trying times: a death in
the family, moving to a new house, long visits from relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But with a new year dawning it's time to move on, or at least
less often. Not sit on the sofa and turn into a sloth. But exercise
less and enjoy it more when I do it. Exercise my, uh, options to
stay home when I want to. Watch ``Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain''
with my sons, with whom I indulge in active fun like ice skating,
bike riding, swimming and nature walks, instead of watching the
clock as I go about my rounds at the gym. To meditate without
motion.
</P>
<P>
   While the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports
advises 30 minutes of daily exercise, including everything from
gardening to galloping, my own counsel on physical fitness has long
dictated 45 minutes to an hour each day, every day at high
intensity. I might as well be yelling, ``Mush!'' to my poor, tired
dogs. It's this that has to stop. Why not do it three times a week
at a lower intensity for a shorter time? Or skip a day, or (gasp)
even a week? Why not, indeed?
</P>
<P>
   Fitness trainers and gym owners will frown (work those facial
muscles!), but I resolve in 1999, and maybe for the next
millennium, to move less and savor more.
</P>
<P>
   And so, I bequeath to all those (yes, you) who have taken the
annual New Year's pledge to hit the gym running: my favorite
Stairmaster, my pedometer and a well-worn pair of sweat socks.

SO FAR, SO GOOD FOR `IMMORTAL' CELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times)

 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life and death lie nowhere so close together as in the human
cell's counting device for limiting how often it can divide. The
device is a sort of tally stick that gets shorter at each division.
When it runs out, the cell dies.
</P>
<P>
   The telomere, as biologists call the device, is overruled in
only two kinds of cell and as a result both are immortal, in the
sense that they can go on dividing indefinitely with no sign of
growing old. One is the cells of the germline, the egg cells and
sperm-generating cells, that remain ever youthful from one
generation of people to another. The other is tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists announced last January that they had learned the
death-defying secret known to germline and tumor cells, that of how
to override the telomere-shortening system. The discovery stirred a
euphoric ferment of proposals for immortalizing the various body
tissues that are especially prone to give out in old age and
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. Would the
revitalized tissues gain the endurance of germline cells or the
lethal exuberance of tumor cells?
</P>
<P>
   The two teams of biologists that announced their
telomere-override method in January now report in the journal
Nature Genetics that their cells are still growing and dividing
with no sign of cancerous tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   One team, led by Choy-Pik Chiu of Geron Corp., which owns rights
to the telomere-override component, says its laboratory cultures of
immortalized cells have doubled more than 200 times, with their
anti-cancer genes still in good order.
</P>
<P>
   This confirms the idea that the cells will ``provide therapeutic
opportunities for age-related diseases,'' the Geron scientists
assert. Usually cells divide only 50 times or so, depending on
their type, before telomere shortening drives them into senescence.
</P>
<P>
   The other team, headed by Woodring Wright and Jerry Shay at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said
their altered cells had gone through 280 doublings, also without
showing any of the wayward behavior typical of cancer cells.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups enabled their cells to defeat the
telomere-shortening system by activating an enzyme called
telomerase, which builds telomeres back up to their normal length.
In normal cells an essential component of the enzyme, the template
on which it rebuilds the telomeres, is absent because the gene that
makes it is switched off. To immortalize their cells, the two
groups inserted into them a switched-on form of the human
telomerase template gene.
</P>
<P>
   Does the new result mean that cells with activated telomerase
can be transplanted into patients' bodies without creating an extra
risk of cancer? The two experiments mean nothing of the kind, in
the view of Robert Weinberg, a leading cancer biologist at the
Whitehead Institute in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both kind of nonresults,'' he said. ``Both groups
report that putting telomerase into normal cells does not per se
create a cancer cell, which is a straw-man issue because no one
expected it would. The real problem is whether the
telomerase-bearing cells are more predisposed to undergo changes
that make them into malignant cells.''
</P>
<P>
   For a normal cell to become a cancer cell, it must defeat the
various safety circuits that protect against runaway growth.
Incipient cancer cells are thought to accumulate mutations in the
genes that underlie these circuits. Probably four or five separate
genes must be knocked out before a normal cell becomes a fully
developed tumor cell.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cell's safety circuits is the telomere-shortening
system. Indeed it may be the cell's last-ditch defense against
tumors. An incipient cancer cell that has knocked out all the other
genes restraining its growth can divide only so many times before
the telomeres drive it into senescence. Perhaps the final hurdle
for a successful tumor cell is to activate its telomerase gene.
</P>
<P>
   All that the new experiments show, in Weinberg's view, is that
the general regulatory circuits of the cell are unaffected by the
presence of active telomerase. But a cell with activated telomerase
has certainly taken one of the five steps down the road to cancer,
in Weinberg's view. ``The question is whether you are one big step
or one small step nearer, and one can't know that from their
experiments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Calvin Harley, Geron's chief scientific officer, said it was
unfair to say that no one had thought telomerase activation would
cause cells to become cancerous. Overproduction of telomerase might
well have deranged the cells' regulatory mechanisms, an important
concern that had now been laid to rest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's plan is not to give patients cells with
permanently activated telomerase, if it can avoid doing do. Rather,
the hope is to develop drugs that will switch on telomerase
temporarily, just long enough for it to rebuild the telomeres back
to their youthful length. ``The responsible approach in the
therapeutic development of telomerase is not to constitutively
activate the enzyme but to control its regulation,'' Harley said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Geron had yet developed drugs to switch the telomerase
gene on and off, Harley said, ``We have some data,'' but he added
that the company's research is focused on understanding cells with
permanently activated telomerase.

POETIC JUSTICE, `DELTA'-STYLE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; She enters a room quietly, speaks with the utmost
cordiality, takes care not to raise her naturally resonant voice
above a certain polite volume.
</P>
<P>
   All that considered, Maya Angelou commands your complete,
undivided attention. ``Have you met her? It's pronounced
An-jell-oh, and you'd better learn it quick,'' laughs Alfre
Woodard, the acclaimed actress who headlines Angelou's feature
directing debut, ``Down in the Delta.'' ``She commands space, and
she's very clear and certain about how she sees things.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she's very poetic and descriptive in communicating those
things to you,'' Woodard adds, a bit unnecessarily, about the
author of such lyrical works as ``I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings''
and ``On the Pulse of Morning.'' ``Every director has a different
way of talking to you, but hers makes a perfect line from out of
who she is as a poet, a writer and a thinker. Being directed by her
is just like spending the evening with her.''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview at a West Hollywood hotel, Angelou describes
herself in less formidable terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about filling a space,'' she says with the
precise enunciation that is one of her many trademarks. ``I do
think about being present. I mean to be totally present, so that
when I came in this room, there was no other room, there was
nothing before, there is nothing after. All my stuff is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this commercial where a 9-year-old girl is talking to
her 6-year-old sister about the properties of soap,'' Angelou adds,
pirouetting from the lofty to the mundane with the most convincing
of ease. ``The 6-year-old is just amazed, and finally she looks
right into the camera and says, `She's old. She knows lots of
stuff.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Angelou laughs heartily.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, when I bring my stuff in here, it's a lot of stuff!''
</P>
<P>
   Did we also mention that Angelou can be a master of
understatement?
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old poet, who currently teaches at Wake Forest
University in North Carolina, has been a professional dancer,
actress, journalist, editor, school administrator, civil rights
leader, screenwriter, producer, composer and theater director.
Fluent in more than half a dozen languages, she is, of course,
best-known for her poetry (``Pulse'' was composed for President
Clinton's first inaugural ceremony) and such riveting
autobiographical essays as ``Caged Bird,'' ``Singin' and Swingin'
and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas'' and ``Wouldn't Take Nothing for
My Journey Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the accomplishments, there's sad stuff, too. Raped
when she was 7, mute for five years afterward, a single mother at
16 and survivor of several failed marriages, Angelou's distinctive
voice may be the product of exceptional talent, but it's been
forged by a good deal of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Her long and varied journey helped Angelou tune into ``Delta,''
an uplifting story about a poor, troubled Chicago woman (Woodard)
who gets her and her young children's lives re-ordered during an
extended visit to an uncle's rural Mississippi home. The impressive
cast also includes Al Freeman Jr. (``Malcolm X''), Mary Alice (TV's
``I'll Fly Away''), the recently deceased Esther Rolle (``Good
Times'') and Wesley Snipes, who was also one of the film's
producers.
</P>
<P>
   A child of St. Louis, San Francisco and rural Arkansas _ in that
last place, where she was sent after the assault and the subsequent
murder of the man who raped her, a grandmother taught the silent
little Maya to seek her lost voice by reading the world's great
poetry _ Angelou knows something about the healing properties of
the Southern countryside.
</P>
<P>
   So, even though ``Delta'' was written by a white man from
Georgia, Myron Goble, she had no doubts she could make an authentic
movie from the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writer loved his work and wasn't in love with it,'' says
the director, who wrote her own scripts for the 1979 TV adaptation
of ``Caged Bird'' and the 1982 TV movie ``Sister, Sister.'' ``Which
means, he didn't hold on to everything for dear life and let his
ego be a barrier to the enriching of the work. So, when I'd ask him
for something, he was so cooperative. And he trusted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, when it came time to shoot the film, with Ontario
substituting for Chicago and Mississippi, Angelou had to learn to
trust her actors. She was, after all, trying to create something
that could not be wrought by her most dependable tools _ words and
that signature voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It challenged everything,'' she admits. ``I know that's a word
that has too much frequency, too much use currency nowadays,
challenging. But it did ask me for everything I have, to translate
myself into another medium. I know poetry and prose, but to use a
camera and actors to tell a volume without a word spoken was very
strange. You know, I can't write a book and leave four pages
empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with her multifaceted resume, there was little doubt
Angelou could make the transition from words to pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's done everything else,'' producer-star Snipes says. ``She
was a professional singer, professional dancer, of course a
professional writer, she's directed theater before. So, it just
stands to figure: Why not give it a shot? We put enough people
around her to assist in the new venue, but we were never worried
about her failing. That's like thinking Paul Robeson is going to
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's gotten the hang of it, Angelou is fired up to do
more filmmaking. She's developing a movie version of James
Baldwin's play ``The Amen Corner,'' a project in which she hopes
``to use Harlem as a character, much as I used the South as a
character in `Down in the Delta.' See, we've never seen Harlem,
we've seen only its underbelly. But there was a climate so rich,
out of it came Langston Hughes, W.E.B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey,
Betty Grace, Father Divine, Duke Ellington...
</P>
<P>
   ``So rich, the Harlem Renaissance. Good lord! I want to show
that part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelou is not as rapturous about the richness displayed by
African-American cinema over the last several years. But she
certainly finds it worth celebrating, even if some artistically
ambitious films such as Oprah Winfrey's recent production of
``Beloved'' indicate that the audience for such movies is not very
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was majestic,'' she says of ``Beloved.'' ``And I
think African-American cinema is burgeoning. Look at the movies
that have done well _ `Waiting to Exhale,' `Soul Food,' `How Stella
Got Her Groove Back.' I was sorry about `Amistad,' but `Amistad'
was more a story about John Quincy Adams; we weren't really told
the story of the African Cinque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see pictures like `Delta' really cross over
because it's such a good story,'' she adds. ``It's such a good
human story about rising and going on and making it over and
redemption and all that. I'd like to see people in Grosse Pointe,
Mich., in an all-white neighborhood, lined up around the block to
see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a visual. But then, Angelou has always had a knack
for the bridging word picture, the phrase that spans and connects
the differing sides of any number of social chasms: race, class,
gender.
</P>
<P>
   Bridge-builder; yet another job description. And as President
Clinton's erstwhile, designated poet, never more so than now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't spoken with him _ he hasn't asked me and I haven't
tried to _ since the impeachment scandal broke,'' she says. ``But I
don't regret my close association with the president's
administration, not at all. My feelings haven't changed about the
man as a president; but like all Americans, Republicans and
Democrats, I am really saddened by all that behavior. Really;
surprised and saddened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do hope and pray that there will be censure rather than
removal. I really don't want to see anybody removed from office for
activities that really should have been kept private between
consenting adults. I don't like it, but I don't think it's a
crime.'' &QL;

everything is separated by distances measured in hundreds and
billions of light-years, sometimes a galaxy or cluster of galaxies
in the foreground intersects the light from a more distant object.
The conjunction plays visual tricks, producing mirages that are
becoming a practical tool of astronomy, a kind of natural
telescope. Aided by more sensitive cameras and advanced computer
technologies, systematic searches of the heavens are yielding an
increasing number of examples of such celestial phenomena, known as
gravitational lenses. Scientists are learning to interpret these
distorting and magnifying lensing events for revealing clues in the
most intractable mysteries of the universe. By John Noble Wilford.

REVAMPED FIT TV NETWORK

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients .  With sidebar,
FITTV-SHOWS) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; In the past six weeks, you've eaten most of the
chocolate in the Western Hemisphere and downed enough eggnog to
nearly fill the Salton Sea.
</P>
<P>
   By the time New Year's Eve has come and gone, there you'll be,
just like last year: overweight, overtired and overextended. And
vowing that you'll shape up.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, help in keeping that always-made, always-broken
resolution could be as close as your television remote control.
</P>
<P>
   Fit tv, a reinvented health-and-fitness cable channel, will hit
the airwaves about the time the big, lighted ball drops in Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   The network will be available to 50 percent of viewers who
receive TCI Cable's digital package and to GTE Cable viewers in
Camarillo. Viewers of the FX and Fox Sports Net channels will also
get daily one-hour samples of fit tv's programming.
</P>
<P>
   The network was originally founded in 1993 by Jake Steinfeld of
``Body by Jake'' fame as an all-workout station, then known as FiT
TV. When Fox bought the workout network from Pat Robertson's Family
TV in 1997, Fox broadened the focus beyond simply exercise to also
include shows on healthful living.
</P>
<P>
   The new network doesn't only want to help reshape thighs and
build rock-hard abs. Instead, fit tv _ owned 92 percent by
Fox/Liberty Networks and 8 percent by Steinfeld _ aims to introduce
a sense of fitness into people's entire lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working out is not your life,'' said Beth Schueler, director
of marketing and one of the three founders of fit tv. ```Fit' means
a whole, complete lifestyle: nutritionally, emotionally,
spiritually, physically, financially. We're not taking away the
workouts, but we're adding aromatherapy, healthy cooking, yoga,
outdoor adventures, all sorts of things people are interested in.
We're making it '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Fit tv will initially offer nine shows produced at Media City in
Burbank; in February and March, two more shows will be added to the
lineup. Shows will be repeated during the day so viewers can fit
advice, chat and workouts into the most convenient times of their
day.
</P>
<P>
   One program, ``Fitting It In,'' will air at 2 and 5 p.m. daily
and fits right into the station's mission statement of being
practical and varied. The show sandwiches a 25-minute workout
between two segments on how to make healthful meals.
</P>
<P>
   The entire show is jammed into an hour, proving to viewers that
they don't need a major time commitment to eat better and work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make this material and information accessible,''
said Jim Schiebler, co-host of the show. ``We want to demystify a
lot of things. We want people to be able to implement these tidbits
and live healthy lifestyles like us. We want to motivate and
encourage and provide information for the viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although fit tv shows are designed to appeal to both sexes,
there's a definite push to attract female viewers ages 18-49, who
as a group _ marketers say _ spent more than $333 billion last year
on items ranging from lotions and potions to minivans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of it as `Skirtcenter,''' trumpets a hot-pink flier for
the revamped network, designed to appeal to potential sponsors.
``Men have their sports shows, their action shows and `Babewatch.'
What do women have? Practically nothing. What do they want? A
24-hour network just for them ... It's the television destination
for women seeking a healthy body, spa beauty secrets, or a killer
souffle recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Krigsman, a network founder and vice president of program
production and development, said he, Schueler and network president
Pyper Davis are trying to ``put together a truly unique group of
programs so that women can turn to us any time of day and find
information, workouts and entertainment that are relevant to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The trio has an ambitious goal: During the first quarter of
1999, they hope viewers in 10 million households nationwide will
tune in to one or more shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fit Resort &AMP; Spa'' is the grabber, a 30-minute sampler that
both sets an informal, friendly tone and offers bits and pieces of
exercise, cooking, conversation and other subjects that the
network's other shows will explore in more depth, Schueler said.
</P>
<P>
   Hosts of the show _ former MTV VJ and actor Mark Goodman, and
Andi Matheny, former host of the Learning Channel's ``Essentials''
_ are fit tv's answer to Regis and Kathie Lee, without the shrieks
and bravado. The two admit they're learning as they go in this new
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not experts, we're just people,'' said Goodman, a
Woodland Hills resident. ``If people see us trying to do this
stuff, maybe they'll try it, too. Me, I'll do anything, I'll get
into a hot tub. I'll belly dance. I'm open to just about
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Matheny, a Studio City resident, said she's naturally curious
and relishes learning new things, from new types of workouts to
talking to authors about their theories on how people can improve
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   On one show, Los Angeles exercise guru Karen Voight, trainer to
entertainer Tina Turner and model Elle McPherson, showed the hosts
a new exercise routine using sand-filled green plastic balls as
free weights. After the workout, everybody but Voight was panting,
and she was still urging the hosts on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're on the phone, you can fit a little of this in,''
Voight said, pantomiming holding a telephone with one hand and
hoisting a green ball with the other. ``It sounds funny, but that's
what we need to do, fit exercise in.''

UNDATED: Christmas Day. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All this could mean a miserable holiday season for a lot of
people, who know all too well that they may be unemployed within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's freaked out right now, in the bunker,'' said Kevin
Carter, an editor with the industry publication ``Gavin.'' ``Nobody
can predict how this'll all shake out. People are very nervous, and
being right before the holidays, the timing was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is predicting that there will be hard-and-fast sales
figures that determine which bands stay and which go, although
sales will, of course, be a key factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for a return on their investment,'' said
Bannister, who said she ``wouldn't even guess'' at the number of
layoffs or bands facing the ax. ``You aren't going to invest in an
asset that you don't think will pay off down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   But potential and costs will also be a major factor, according
to Philip Walden, an executive with Capricorn Records based in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A band that sells 750,000 copies but is guaranteed an upfront
multimillion-dollar payment, has lavish tour production needs and
depends on a lot of promotion and expensive videos, may be in more
trouble than a band that sells less but does so through tireless
touring, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have an inexpensive band with low recording and
production costs,'' said Walden, ``so you can sell 100,000 CDs and
still make money. A band like that is self-sufficient. But any
band's fate at any label is based on the relationship with the
people who work there.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with trimming some bands is the feeling that the Universal
downsizing will mean more caution in signing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be harder for bands to get signed,'' said Jerry
Thompson, president of Caravan of Dreams and Promoterline Inc. in
Fort Worth. ``You'll see less and less of the three- to five-album
deals _ it'll be, `Prove it to us.' And I don't think the
developmental dollars for new acts will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim DeLaughter, lead singer for Dallas' Tripping Daisy, agreed,
saying that the impact on the local music scene could be severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think bands looking to get signed, well, I just don't see
that happening for a while,'' he said. ``Companies are trying to
regroup and get their company in order before they look for
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   But even this could be a positive in the long run.

   ``It's definitely an opportunity for the independent music
community in two ways,'' said Sam Paulos, owner of indie Steve
Records based in Dallas. ``First, to possibly pick up bands that
are profitable on an indie level that may not be profitable on a
major. A band that sells 100,000 of a record on an indie is a
success, but a failure on a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, the more majors consolidate, the more there's a
reaction for independent labels to renew their efforts, to become
more flexible ...''
</P>
<P>
   DeLaughter said, ``Maybe people will speak out and new little
baby companies will come along. A lot of people out there are
already creating alternative avenues for bands who are into making
good music.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, nobody knows for sure _ and sometimes
being in limbo is worse than knowing the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Powerchurch, keyboardist for Dallas' Tomorrow People, which
was signed to Geffen last year and recorded a debut CD that isn't
out yet, said nobody knows what will happen to it, or the band, in
the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finished the record, but since all this has gone down,
we're just kinda sitting here, waiting,'' he said. ``I mean, we
hired a string section and really put a lot into this record. I
would hate for people not to hear it. Getting dropped isn't the
problem. It's the waiting around to get dropped. We don't really
care if we do. We'd just go to another label. But right now,
because we haven't been told either way, we can't do anything.''

GLUT OF CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES IS SOURING THE MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christmas carols have been in the air this month, so that means
sports fans are again subjected to what has become an endless
ordeal: championship playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   In pro football, mediocre teams with players whose names you
can't remember will slog through what seems to be an unending
series of games around the turn of the year before we can get to
the denouement of the Super Bowl. That will clear the way for the
NCAA Basketball Tournament, a semi-exclusive event that invites 64
teams so that some outfit that finished third in its conference can
have a chance to win a national title.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is no sooner out of the way than pro basketball (in
years when it's not on strike) and hockey begin their postseason
marathons that extend into June.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, the game pickled in tradition, now has a three-step
postseason system that features wild-card teams. Be thankful that
Casey Stengel didn't live long enough to see this.
</P>
<P>
   The pros have an excuse, of course. They have to make a buck,
which they do by putting more ``product,'' as they call it, on the
postseason schedule. But colleges are supposed to be above such
foolishness, or so one would think.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 5, an unbeaten and No. 1-ranked Kansas State team was
required to beat twice-defeated Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12
``championship'' game in St. Louis. We know what happened: A good
but not great Aggie team suddenly turned into an imitation of the
Denver Broncos in the fourth quarter, and K-State now is headed for
the Alamo Bowl instead of a shot at the national title and a piece
of immortality at the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for K-State, you say. It's also too bad for the Big 12.
A national championship in a sport lifts all boats in a conference,
from the winner down to Baylor. But the Big 12 won't get that
chance this year because its furrowed brows succumbed to the lure
of television money and the old saw, ``Let them settle it on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Settle what? Wasn't an 11-0 record in the regular season, which
included victories over Texas, Colorado and Nebraska, good enough
to justify calling Kansas State the Big 12 champion? Nothing
against A&AMP;M and its estimable coach, R.C. Slocum, who won the game
in St. Louis fair and square. But the lords of the Big 12 may need
to explain to the math departments at their schools how the
conference ``champion'' can have two defeats and the runner-up just
one.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that was settled on the field Dec. 5 in St. Louis
was that the conference members got $6.5 million from ABC-TV for a
game that otherwise decided nothing. Meanwhile, K-State quarterback
Michael Bishop, one of the two or three best players in college
football this past season, has to live with erroneous television
replay analyses that his fumble with two minutes left ``cost'' his
school $10 million or so.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened is that sports administrators, both pro and
college, have devalued their regular seasons. Fans are charged
ever-increasing prices for regular games that are decreasingly
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Players are asked to put more of their athletic longevity into
extended seasons. For decades, baseball had a 154-game season. It
now is 162 games, and the ultimate winner has to survive three
series and potentially play into cold November weather. If Emmitt
Smith played in the NFL in the 1950s and '60s, he would risk his
body in 12 games and maybe a championship finale. Today, Smith has
a 16-game regular season and the potential for four more games
should the Cowboys keep winning. No wonder his body may be giving
out.
</P>
<P>
   Fans, meanwhile, spend a lot of time talking among one another
about how sports somehow don't seem to be as much fun and as
satisfying as they used to be. Drugs, immature and arrogant jocks,
and greedy owners are listed as the usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem is the old truth: You decrease the value of
something by providing more of it. Just as governments undermine
their economies by printing more money, so do sports undermine
themselves by giving us more and more ``championship games.''

TV'S BIG MOMENTS IN '98, FROM PRESIDENTIAL CONFESSION TO HOME-RUN
HEROICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton and impeachment. ``ER'' and profits. Dr. Jack
Kevorkian and death. Sooner or later, everything goes through the
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Its best and worst moments often reflect the best and worst
moments of society, period. What with the information overload from
the 24-hours news channels, that's quite a vivid reflection. Here's
a look back at some memorable moments of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. ZipperGate (Aug. 18)
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 million viewers watch a pale, weary President
Clinton admit to an ``improper relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky.
All major broadcast and cable channels carry the announcement,
which lasts no more than six minutes. CNN attracts its largest
audience since that other unifying event, the 1995 verdict in O.J.
Simpson's criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Camera confessions (March 15)
</P>
<P>
   Jailed suspects in the death of Amy Robinson mug for
KDFW/Channel 4 cameras, telling in detail how they tortured and
killed the 19-year-old grocery store employee. Taking up the first
27 minutes of Channel 4's newscast, Robert Neville and Michael Hall
explain the whys of their deeds, then giggle while suggesting their
own punishment: Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Death TV (Nov. 22)
</P>
<P>
   CBS newsmag ``60 Minutes'' climbs back into the top spot as the
country's most watched TV series _ by showing death. Some stations
refuse to show the segment, which includes a video of Dr. Jack
Kevorkian giving lethal injections to Thomas Youk, who suffered
from Lou Gehrig's disease. More than 23 million people tune in.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Texas' killer cadets (Feb. 2)
</P>
<P>
   Court TV's gavel-to-gavel coverage of Diane Zamora's trial in
the murder of Mansfield teen Adrienne Jones opens old wounds.
Earlier, KXAS/Channel 5 in Fort Worth-Dallas had refused to air
``Love's Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder'' in order not to
taint the jury. Zamora's trial lasts two weeks, ending in a guilty
verdict. Sobbing, Zamora is escorted away in handcuffs. Former
lover David Graham's trial would end the same way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Classy departure (Nov. 24)
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Smits' farewell from ``NYPD Blue'' draws 22 million
viewers, the show's largest audience in three years. His character,
Detective Bobby Simone, dies of complications from a heart
condition, opening the gate for Rick Schroder and a rejuvenation of
the cop series.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. Unequal blame (July 9)
</P>
<P>
   CNN retracts a report that the U.S. military used nerve gas
during the Vietnam War. CNN News Group chairman Tom Johnson humbly
apologizes for a story claiming that the U.S. military used lethal
nerve gas in a secret 1970 mission in Vietnam aimed at killing
American defectors. The news report costs three CNN producers their
jobs, but correspondent Peter Arnett is merely reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. Baseball comeback (Sept. 8)
</P>
<P>
   Fox sidelines its entire prime-time lineup _ including the
premiere episode of a new series _ to gamble that Mark McGwire will
hit his 61st homer of the season for the St. Louis Cardinals. It
pays off. McGwire slices a line-drive home run to left field,
breaking Roger Maris' record.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8. Death Row debate (Nov. 3)
</P>
<P>
   News organizations set up camp in Huntsville, Texas, to witness
Karla Faye Tucker's execution. Tucker's case makes the national
news, reviving debate about a gender double standard when it comes
to the value of life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   9. On second thought ... (June 23)
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after transforming herself from Republican Party
star to television star, Susan Molinari bows out as co-host of
``CBS News Saturday Morning.'' Molinari expresses dissatisfaction
with the show's fluffy approach; CBS News says she never got over
her stiffness in news reading and interviewing. The show averages a
dismal 1.3 rating. Molinari's next stop? A fellowship at Harvard's
Kennedy School of Government _ no TelePrompter needed.

   10. How young TV? (April 6)
</P>
<P>
   Not since parents objected to a sedate gentleman with an
affinity for sweaters has there been such skittishness about a new
children's program. PBS presents the American premiere of
``Teletubbies,'' an imaginative program featuring cute, cuddly
creatures with antennas on their heads and TVs in their bellies.
Almost immediately, critics dismiss its educational content to
focus on whether children under age 2 should be targeted by
television producers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   11. The skinny on Ally (Oct. 2)
</P>
<P>
   A New York TV station reports that Calista Flockhart, 33,
entered a clinic for treatment of anorexia, shutting down
production of her Fox TV series, ``Ally McBeal.'' It is never
confirmed. But the story renews water-cooler debate over the
pressures for actresses to remain dangerously thin.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   12. Wagging that dog (Dec. 16)
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the airing of the impeachment debate in the House
of Representatives, President Clinton orders airstrikes on Iraq. TV
news organizations scramble to cover both stories, setting up a day
in which only two things are part of TV programming: war and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   13. Breaking the bank (Jan. 14)
</P>
<P>
   The medical drama ``ER'' renews its contract with NBC _ at $13
million per episode. It's the highest price paid for any series,
prompting a quick shift in how networks deal with studios. (They'd
rather own their own shows, which means taking a chance on a
mediocre series over a good one.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   14. Sein off (May 14)
</P>
<P>
   ``Seinfeld'' signs off the air with a woeful season finale. It
attracts 76.3 million viewers, but is critically panned as one of
the show's worst efforts. Still, the series proves its power to NBC
when the network slumps badly after its departure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   15. Heavenly TV (Aug. 31)
</P>
<P>
   Pax TV becomes the seventh broadcast network, airing off-network
reruns like ``Highway to Heaven'' and some original programming in
the form of infotainment programs, game shows and kids' series.
What's interesting is its agenda: ``Positive'' family programming
with a spiritual bent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   16. Yep, she's upset (May 6)
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Degeneres weeps and whines about the cancellation of her
ABC sitcom, ``Ellen,'' during an interview with Diane Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   17. Yep, she's bitter (May 13)
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellen'' ends on a sour note _ a painful one-hour series finale
that is star-studded but misguided. On the episode, which is shot
as a ``documentary,'' star Ellen Degeneres takes potshots at ABC
that appear more bitter than funny or clever.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   18. About time (Sept. 29)
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' premieres on the WB after being the beneficiary of
the most universal pre-airing hype in years. Starring Keri Russell
as a young woman navigating college life, the series would become
what the network wants: a narrowcast hit. Teen-agers watch
religiously, and advertisers jump aboard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   19. Skategate II (Feb. 5)
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding sit through a painful interview
conducted by sportscaster James Brown. The buildup and interview is
nightmarish, something out of a Don King promotional highlight
reel. No one wins this low-rated affair _ not Fox, not viewers. Oh,
except Kerrigan and Harding. They pick up a cool $200,000 and
$100,000, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   20. We like it, but ... (July )
</P>
<P>
   Comedian Dave Chappelle accuses Fox of racism for seeking to add
white cast members to a sitcom he's developing for the network.
Chappelle and producer Peter Tolan air their allegations in the
trade paper ``Variety,'' saying they walked away from the project
after Fox suggested replacing some black supporting characters with
white actors to broaden its appeal. Fox calls the accusation
``disturbing and upsetting.''

SAN JOSE LOOKS TO '99 AS MAJOR YEAR FOR WOMEN IN SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ On July 4, 1994, Brandi Chastain sat in the
stands at Stanford Stadium, mesmerized by the spectacle and loving
every historic minute of it as the U.S. men's national soccer team
met Brazil in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   On July 4, 1999, it could well be Chastain playing on that same
field, soaking up the pageantry and the applause but pinching
herself to make sure she isn't dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not working as an assistant coach with the women's
soccer team in Santa Clara County, Chastain is a key member of the
U.S. national squad. And if things break right, she and her
teammates will be watching the American flags wave for them next
Independence Day in the semifinals of the Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   That would represent an almost-unbelievable stretch of
imagination for Chastain, who began playing soccer at a San Jose
elementary school more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this was just not a realistic goal when I
started in soccer,'' she said. ``The opportunity to be involved in
the World Cup, the Olympics or a program like Santa Clara's,
competing on a national level every year, just was not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this would be very special to me, not only because my
family and friends could come and watch, but because it would be
such a wonderful day for patriotism and soccer in general and such
great testimony to the growth of women's athletics in our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   And grow it has in San Jose, which will host several major
women's athletic events in 1999 _ including the NCAA Women's
Basketball Final Four at San Jose Arena March 26 and 28 and five
Women's World Cup games, double-headers at San Jose State's Spartan
Stadium June 19 and 30 and the July 4 semifinal at Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the folding of the American Basketball League last week,
wiping out that circuit's All-Star Game, there are more an more
opportunities for women in sports. And professional athletes see
that as a good sign for young women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will create such good awareness for young girls who are
involved in sports. It will show them they have a lot of options
and opportunities _ a chance to reach the top levels,'' said
Jennifer Azzi, who played at Stanford and was one of the ABL's
founding players.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Cribbs, a founding partner of the ABL, was a swimming
medalist for the U.S. team at the 1960 Olympics in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women's team members came back not having been allowed to
tour Europe, as the American men did, because we needed a chaperon
and no one was available,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now little girls can dream about going on in athletics. And
there's a real difference in how their role models are viewed, too.
They can go see them play, in many cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain remembers wanting to play football (``My mom wouldn't
let me, because she didn't want me beating up on the boys in the
neighborhood,'' she said), then settling on soccer, which then was
miles from any spotlights.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I loved it, every time I stepped on a field,'' she said.
``No one was going to tell me I had to stop. I'm just grateful my
parents and grandparents gave me the support to keep playing. And
it was crucial that I grew up in the Bay area, where we had a
professional team to watch (the Earthquakes) and there was a
community filled with different cultures, most of which embraced
soccer. Now, it's just wonderful to see people understand and
appreciate how exciting and entertaining soccer and women's sports
can be.''
</P>
<P>
   San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer doesn't have to be sold on that. A
former competitive tennis player whose daughter was a four-sport
star, Hammer is a ``passionate'' fan of the Stanford University
women's basketball team and was a close follower of the ABL San
Jose Lasers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact I was able to play a small part in attracting this
list of things in 1999 is very satisfying,'' she said. ``We've
proven we know how to put on major events.''
</P>
<P>
   Local organizers, spearheaded by Stanford associate athletic
director Cheryl Levick, worked several years to attract the NCAA
Women's Basketball Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe, in bringing this event here, we will show the rest
of the nation that we really are a mecca for women's athletics as
well as women's basketball,'' said Danette Macri, the Final Four's
executive director.

   Most affected by the cooler market are the second-tier authors
who were writing in the genre, said Romanos of Simon &AMP; Schuster.
The well-known authors, he said, had a tougher time keeping their
audience, while ``the next level, the up-and-coming spy fiction,
began to shrink dramatically, so there's hardly any more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger thriller writers like Daniel Silva, 37, author of ``The
Unlikely Spy'' and ``The Mark of the Assassin,'' draw inspiration
from World War II, but ``going back to the Cold War would be a
little strange,'' he said. ``Instinctively it doesn't feel right.
There's not enough distance and drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Carre, a former British intelligence officer whose real name
is David Cornwell, can be viewed as a case study of shifting to new
themes while tinkering with publishing relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The author left his publisher of 20 years, Alfred A. Knopf,
changed literary agents and is poised to publish a new book,
``Single &AMP; Single,'' that continues his movement away from
espionage themes and the prosaic world of his weary and brooding
spy, George Smiley.
</P>
<P>
   His last book, ``The Tailor of Panama,'' involved an elaborate
plot to void the Panama Canal Treaties. His base of readers has
eroded and his past sales figured into his last advance from Simon
&AMP; Schuster, which dropped to $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Scribner, where marketing executives have a one-word view of
Cold War spy fiction (``Done'') the publishers are positioning le
Carre to reach a new generation of readers. Scribner is planning to
print 300,000 copies of the novel.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Wark, a University of Toronto history professor who
specializes in the study of intelligence services and spy fiction,
said the espionage genre still had life but was ``going through a
difficult period when clearly new settings or scenes are
required.''
</P>
<P>
   In Search of a New Lode
</P>
<P>
   Instead of new spy settings, though, writers are switching to
new genres with the intrigue of politics or police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wait for the Cold War to be quaint as a little
Napoleonic war,'' said Charles McCarry, a former CIA intelligence
officer who has moved from novels about spies to books about
political intrigue like his best-selling ``Lucky Bastard.'' ``After
doing this for almost 30 years,'' McCarry said, ``what happens is
that you live your experience and eventually it runs out. So you
find another vein.''
</P>
<P>
   A contrarian view of the Cold War comes from Follett, who with
his departure this month from Crown for Dutton, an imprint of
Penguin Putnam, intends to write a historical novel based on a
failed launching of an American satellite amid Cold War tensions in
1958. He is careful, however, to correct any typecasting of the
book as a Cold War novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say it's a Cold War story,'' Follett said, ``people
will think it has a character like Smiley and involves a KGB person
and an FBI agent who are at loggerheads. And it isn't like that at
all. None of the principal characters are Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   Follett noted that he had avoided the spy genre in his last two
novels, the latter a contemporary thriller called ``The Hammer of
Eden,'' which centers on aging hippie eco-terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the golden age of the spy story is definitely
over,'' Follett said. ``But that doesn't mean that there aren't
going to be any good ones written. In order to do so, I've had to
set my story in 1958. I don't think it would work in 1998. We're
not afraid of the Russians anymore. You need someone to be afraid
of.''

SEAGRAM'S BUYOUT OF POLYGRAM HAS BANDS WONDERING WHO'LL GET THE AX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN and MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dec. 10 announcement that Seagram Co. had bought Polygram NV
read like just another dry business story: One big company pays a
boatload of money to acquire another, profits are expected, blah de
blah de blah.
</P>
<P>
   But for any music fan it's much, much more.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which cost the Montreal-based company $10.4 billion,
means that hundreds of bands _ including local heroes such as
Arlington's Slowpoke and Fort Worth's Toadies, Tomorrow People and
Radish _ might be handed their walking papers in the next several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Why? A major facet of the merger is reducing the number of bands
on its now-combined roster, according to analysts and industry
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the consolidation of numerous labels (among them Island,
Mercury, Interscope, Geffen, Motown, Universal and A&AMP;M) into larger
groupings is expected to mean layoffs for a large percentage of the
various labels' 15,500 employees. Analyst Scott Davis with
investment firm Schroder &AMP; Co. was quoted in Bloomberg News as
saying that as many as 20 percent could be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible situation,'' said one A&AMP;M executive, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``A lot of people are losing their jobs.
Thousands. All across the board. In every department.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosters are expected to be similarly slashed as the labels are
combined into one all-inclusive company. Bands that have not sold
particularly well and/or are expensive to maintain look to be in
trouble as Seagram aims to run a leaner ship.
</P>
<P>
   And that means a time of watching and waiting for thousands of
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labels aren't letting the bands in on anything,'' said
Lisa Umbarger, bassist for the Toadies. The band's Interscope
debut, ``Rubberneck,'' sold a million copies, but the follow-up is
up in the air because the label won't give the band any more money
to finish mixing it. ``Everyone's just waiting around. From what I
hear, everyone's in danger of being dropped, but we're not worrying
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumor is, platinum (million-seller) bands are safe, but I
don't buy into that. The whole industry is downsizing. So it's not
just little bands or bands in the middle. This is affecting
everybody. The record company people have it worse than we do.
There's really no place for them to go. They're gonna be working at
7-Eleven.''
</P>
<P>
   Also facing an ambiguous future is Slowpoke; the Arlington pop
band that signed to Geffen last year and this year released its
label debut, ``Virgin Stripes.'' Now, says lead singer Dave Gibson,
``We're on hold until February or March. Nobody knows what's going
to happen until then. It's the kinda thing where there's hundreds
of bands to review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure band managers will be busy trying to convince
Interscope to keep their bands on. I think that decision will be
based on a combo of what the bands are currently doing, their sales
history and buzz. It'll be like a talent show, their time to
strut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Polygram purchase means that the new uber-company, Universal
Music Group, is the largest music company in the world, with a
roster that includes U2, Van Morrison, Beck, Erykah Badu, Marilyn
Manson, Hole and Elton John.
</P>
<P>
   UMG won't confirm layoff numbers, said Bob Bernstein, senior
vice president for public relations. He said there will be a
``paring down'' of the label rosters, but declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Announcements of layoffs and roster trims, he said, will come
``early next year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strategic acquisition,'' said Linda Bannister, an
analyst with investment firm Edward Jones. ``Seventy-five percent
of Polygram's business is international and 75 percent of
Universal's is domestic. This gives Universal an instant market
share internationally _ they're instantly a major player.'' Being a
major player has been harder for Seagram in one of its other major
entertainment ventures: movies. In 1995 Seagram went into the movie
business by buying MCA, which it renamed Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   But '98 has been a tough year for the studio, with numerous
mega-hyped movies, among them ``Psycho,'' ``Primary Colors,''
``Babe: Pig in the City'' and ``Meet Joe Black,'' performing poorly
at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the announcement of the Polygram purchase,
Seagram announced Universal Studios had a loss of $65 million for
the fiscal second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing for them, but it happens to every studio at
some point, and it's to be expected when your films aren't
profitable,'' said Bannister. ``In 1998 Seagram's net income was
$946 million, so obviously this won't break the bank. The Polygram
move was in the works long ago _ it's not a result of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's big hopes for the seasonal movie dollar now rest
with ``Shakespeare in Love'' and Robin Williams' ``Patch Adams,''
both of which opened on Christmas Day.

FOG CAUSES FLIGHT DELAYS IN BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Updates throughout with latest conditions, forecast.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA and ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A nearly impenetrable layer of fog clamped down
on the San Francisco Bay area, disrupting holiday travel plans for
thousands of passengers at three airports and turning Monday's
morning commute into an eerie adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The fog was blamed for a fatal traffic accident near Petaluma.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Francisco International Airport, where 200 to 300
stranded travelers spent Sunday night, there were flight delays of
eight hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service predicted the fog, caused by a
high-pressure ridge that put a lid on cold, stagnant, ground-level
air, will last through at least Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People heading to the airport should be prepared for the
worst-case scenario, which means it's possible they won't get out
at all,'' said Ron Wilson, spokesman for the San Francisco
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very unhappy passengers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the region usually has its heaviest fog in December and
January, Wilson said he could not recall an occasion when the
airports at San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose had been so badly
socked in.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines, the largest carrier at the San Francisco
airport, had canceled 130 flights since Sunday night, airline
spokesman Joe Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of incoming flights were diverted to Los Angeles and Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is going out and nothing is coming in at San Jose,''
an airport spokeswoman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fog lifted at Oakland airport around early in the
day and flights were leaving nearly on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility was reduced to 100 feet on bridges in the Bay area,
and the National Weather Service issued a rare fog warning.

GREAT ALT-COUNTRY, LANDMARK BOXED SETS HIGHLIGHT A HO-HUM YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Accompanied by YE-TOP10CDS) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How good a year in pop music can it be when Frank Sinatra died?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, not very _ at least not on the surface, and maybe
even a few layers deeper, too. The loss of Ol' Blue Eyes actually
makes an odd kind of sense _ one could argue that it set the tone
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Pop music in 1998 was defined by so-so pop acts of every stripe
(from Fastball to 'N Sync to matchbox 20) dominating a barren,
uninteresting landscape. Consider: If swing, a sound and style of
dance first popularized more than 40 years ago, can be the hottest
thing around for most of the year, what does that say about current
artists and contemporary music?
</P>
<P>
   Not much. Techno officially became NOT the next big thing;
Shania Twain used her unremarkable voice and cute figure to fill
arenas. At the same time, a number of acts completely misfired this
year, or found a cooler-than-expected reception: Worthy CDs by
Garbage and Beck, among others, languished on the charts, doing far
less business than one might have expected.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is so much emphasis now on a band having one big
hit and one big CD, audiences don't stay loyal to performers for
very long. More pop music fans seem to follow someone else's lead
and buy what absolutely everybody else is buying _ whether it's the
``Titanic'' soundtrack or matchbox 20's ``Yourself or Someone Like
You.''
</P>
<P>
   And this indicates that building a career is going to become
much harder in the coming years: ``Here today, gone tomorrow'' has
become ``Here today, gone today.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why some of the most interesting music released
in 1998 was from alternative-country acts such as Lucinda Williams,
Joe Ely and the Mavericks. As rock continues to water itself down,
alt-country continues to step up to the plate and offer the sort of
passion and strong songwriting that one used to expect from
mainstream rock performers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether mainstream rock will jump on this and realize the wealth
of great performers just waiting for it in this genre is still up
in the air; mainstream country radio has dropped the ball entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The other good news _ besides the Lauryn Hill debut _ was the
fistful of terrific boxed sets and live CDs that came out this
year: Bruce Springsteen's ``Tracks,'' Randy Newman's ``Guilty: 30
Years of Randy Newman,'' the ``Nuggets'' compilation of '60s garage
bands, Bob Dylan's historic and often-bootlegged 1966 show in
Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, looking to the past may be the best option these days.
The year drew to a close with the announcement of the enormous
Seagram Co./Polygram merger. That will mean widespread layoffs at
the labels affected, including A&AMP;M, Interscope and Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   More troubling, though, is the realization that the deal will
mean numerous bands will be dropped in the coming months. Cuts
won't be announced until next year, but one rumor is that bands
that have not yet gone platinum will face the ax.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably too broad, but this much is sure: There will be
even less room for experimentation and freethinking in mainstream
pop music in the coming years. And that will, in turn, lead to more
dumbing-down of the music. As Neil Young once said, if you don't
have the freedom to fail, you don't have any freedom at all.

TOP 10 CD RELEASES OF THE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: accompanies BC-YE-POP-MUSIC) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are my favorite 10 CDs of the year, in alphabetical order
by artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mermaid Avenue,'' Billy Bragg &AMP; Wilco. A terrific English
folkie and an equally terrific American alt-country band team up to
dust off a slew of Woody Guthrie lyrics and render them timeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Light,'' Calexico. Like a ghost at twilight or the
soundtrack to a movie that exists only in the mind, this noirish
and often instrumental collection of songs drifts from the
honky-tonk to the border cantina and back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twistin' in the Wind,'' Joe Ely. Ely is one of Texas' leading
bards of the barroom and the highway, and he's never made a better
(or funnier, or more deeply felt) CD than this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' Lauryn Hill. This is on
numerous year-end best-ofs for one reason: It's a masterful song
cycle of self-examination and hip-hop and soul grooves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trampoline,'' The Mavericks. This is the Miami-based band's
magnum opus, full of memorable songs, stirring singing from Raul
Malo, and a hybrid country/Latin/soul sound that's unlike anything
any other band is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deserter's Songs,'' Mercury Rev. Richly textured and darkly
intoxicating, this quiet gem of loss and disappointment can haunt
the mind and the spirit for days after a listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Philosopher's Stone,'' Van Morrison. More than two dozen
previously unreleased songs by Ireland's greatest musical poet _
many as good as anything he's ever put out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powertrip,'' Monster Magnet. If metal is on its last artistic
legs, someone forgot to tell Dave Wyndorf and his Jersey homeboys _
this teeth-rattler is the genre's best CD of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decksandrumsandrockandroll,'' Propellerheads. Best title, best
cover, best cameo (Shirley Bassey on ``History Repeating'') and a
terrific mix of electronic rhythms and R&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,'' Lucinda Williams. One of the
best CDs of the '90s, this was six years in coming and worth every
minute we had to wait; it's an alt-country benchmark and a simply
amazing collection of bittersweet songs.

   ``At least half the human use of antibiotics in the United
States is unnecessary or inappropriate,'' says Stuart Levy, a Tufts
University School of Medicine microbiologist. ``Either antibiotics
are not indicated at all, or the wrong antibiotic is prescribed, or
it's the wrong dosage or the wrong duration.'' The upshot of this
massive exposure is disease-causing bugs that resist the drugs that
once thwarted them. They're superbugs, and their power is
frightening: Superbugs that can withstand not just one but
multitudes of antibiotics. Is it too late to do anything? Peter
Radetsky, who teaches science writing at the University of
California in Santa Cruz, reports.

it's the wrong dosage or the wrong duration.'' The upshot of this

frightening: Superbugs that can withstand not just one but

   In the United States, AIDS deaths dropped 47 percent from 1996
to 1997 _ thanks mostly to expensive drug treatments. Elsewhere the
picture is very bleak. Rates of HIV infection are soaring in
impoverished African and Asian countries. In Zimbabwe, for example,
one-quarter of the adult population is now thought to be infected
with HIV. Worldwide, 16,000 people are newly infected with the
virus every day. Josie Glausiusz, an associate editor at Discover
magazine, reports.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Wells Shoemaker is a pediatrician in a small California town.
Not too long ago he saw a patient new to the area, a little boy
with a runny nose.
</P>
<P>
   The child had a cold, but his nasal fluid was clear, and he had
no hint of an ear infection. As Shoemaker offered his diagnosis,
the mother interrupted: ``The only thing that keeps him from
getting an ear infection is antibiotics. My previous doctor used to
give him antibiotics at the beginning of a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, an antibiotic might prevent an infection, but it might
not,'' Shoemaker explained. ``It could even make way for a more
aggressive germ that might cause an ear infection from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother had heard enough. ``I don't care! I know my child
better than you do. I want antibiotics now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give them to you,'' Shoemaker replied. ``In all good
conscience, I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy would have been proud of the beleaguered
pediatrician. Levy, a Tufts University School of Medicine
microbiologist, is one of the world's loudest voices decrying the
misuse of antibiotics. He's the founder of a worldwide network
called the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of a crisis,'' he says, his baritone rising
an octave. ``We have to change things!''
</P>
<P>
   The mother's conduct at the clinic was typical of what Levy
laments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least half the human use of antibiotics in the United
States is unnecessary or inappropriate,'' Levy says. ``Either
antibiotics are not indicated at all, or the wrong antibiotic is
prescribed, or it's the wrong dosage or the wrong duration.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of this massive exposure is the increasingly familiar
predicament the world now faces: disease-causing bugs that resist
the drugs that once thwarted them. It's what Levy calls ``the
antibiotic paradox.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the problem is startling. At least two dozen
different kinds of bacteria have developed resistance to one or
more antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Some strains of three life-threatening species _ the blood
poisoners Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the TB bug _ now frustrate every single
antibiotic known, more than 100 different drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous pathogens such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and
Pneumococcus, which among them cause ear, nose and throat
infections, scarlet fever, meningitis and pneumonia, are becoming
widely resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the yearly toll exacted by drug-resistant infections in
the United States is estimated to exceed $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that bugs should develop resistance to our
efforts to wipe them out. It's only natural for an organism to do
everything it can to evade its killer.
</P>
<P>
   The range of microbial resistance strategies is mind-boggling,
as are the resistance mechanisms they engender. Bacteria have used
such survival strategies for millions of years, but now things are
different. Never before have bacteria encountered such colossal
evolutionary pressure. Humans are pushing microbial evolution into
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Superbugs that can withstand not just one but
multitudes of antibiotics. Superbugs that display resistance to the
newest antibiotics even before they are formally introduced.
Diseases that no longer respond to our attempts to prevent or cure
them.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to do anything? Are we spiraling back to a
pre-antibiotic world in which we are reduced to trying to avoid
infection and, failing that, helplessly hoping for the best?
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy's hope is that if we can get antibiotic use under
control, with physicians prescribing appropriately, according to
more precise diagnoses; if animal and agricultural use is pared
down to the bare essentials; and if household disinfectants are no
longer spiked with lingering bug killers, then we might be able to
turn back the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The good bugs might supplant the bad, and our existing drugs
might once more be able to shoulder the load.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it, advises population and evolutionary biologist
Bruce Levin from Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Levin and his student Bassam Tomeh sampled
bacteria from the diapers of 25 toddlers at a nearby day-care
center. When they isolated samples of the common gut bacteria
Escherichia coli, they found that a quarter were resistant to the
antibiotic streptomycin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors have almost never used streptomycin in the last 30
years,'' Levin exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Bruce is right,'' Levy concedes. ``Maybe you can't go
back again in terms of converting resistant bacteria back to
susceptible ones. But that's not the point. The point is that it's
a numbers game.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers he's talking about involve the ratio between
resistant and susceptible bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   If susceptibles outnumber resistants, then the more vulnerable
bugs may carry the day despite the intransigence of the others.
</P>
<P>
   One way to accomplish that may be to seed our bodies with
benign, drug-susceptible bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring in susceptible E. coli,'' Levy suggests. ``Drink it, day
in and day out. What do you think is going to happen? Resistant
strains are going to stay there? No! They're going to be shed and
the susceptibles take over.''
</P>
<P>
   This very approach is being used in animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
   In March the FDA approved a spray containing 29 types of
bacteria isolated from the guts of mature chickens. These are the
bugs that chicks would normally receive from their mothers but that
hatchery-born chicks lack. Once sprayed with the mix, the chicks
ingest the bacteria while preening themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So far the results have been promising (and in Japan, where the
spray has been available for more than a year, it has been highly
successful).
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the spray of good bugs protect the chicks from
pathogenic bacteria _ in particular Salmonella _ simply by
occupying the niches where the bad bugs would otherwise lodge, but
it discourages antibiotic use. Because why would anyone want to
give these animals antibiotics that would kill off the very bugs
that are protecting them?
</P>
<P>
   Levy considers this approach a model of what can be done in
humans. But the list of changes that must accompany such an
approach is daunting: education and more accurate diagnoses leading
to fewer, and more appropriate, prescriptions of antibiotics;
restrained use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and agriculture;
reduced use of antibacterials in household disinfectants.
</P>
<P>
   And what if, after all is said and done, it just doesn't make a
difference? The years to come may be grim, indeed. The bugs are
reminding us who's boss.

<P>
   Wells Shoemaker is a pediatrician in a small California town.
Not too long ago he saw a patient new to the area, a little boy
with a runny nose.
</P>
<P>
   The child had a cold, but his nasal fluid was clear, and he had
no hint of an ear infection. As Shoemaker offered his diagnosis,
the mother interrupted: ``The only thing that keeps him from
getting an ear infection is antibiotics. My previous doctor used to
give him antibiotics at the beginning of a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, an antibiotic might prevent an infection, but it might
not,'' Shoemaker explained. ``It could even make way for a more
aggressive germ that might cause an ear infection from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother had heard enough. ``I don't care! I know my child
better than you do. I want antibiotics now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give them to you,'' Shoemaker replied. ``In all good
conscience, I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy would have been proud of the beleaguered
pediatrician. Levy, a Tufts University School of Medicine
microbiologist, is one of the world's loudest voices decrying the
misuse of antibiotics. He's the founder of a worldwide network
called the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of a crisis,'' he says, his baritone rising
an octave. ``We have to change things!''
</P>
<P>
   The mother's conduct at the clinic was typical of what Levy
laments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least half the human use of antibiotics in the United
States is unnecessary or inappropriate,'' Levy says. ``Either
antibiotics are not indicated at all, or the wrong antibiotic is
prescribed, or it's the wrong dosage or the wrong duration.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of this massive exposure is the increasingly familiar
predicament the world now faces: disease-causing bugs that resist
the drugs that once thwarted them. It's what Levy calls ``the
antibiotic paradox.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the problem is startling. At least two dozen
different kinds of bacteria have developed resistance to one or
more antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Some strains of three life-threatening species _ the blood
poisoners Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the TB bug _ now frustrate every single
antibiotic known, more than 100 different drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous pathogens such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and
Pneumococcus, which among them cause ear, nose and throat
infections, scarlet fever, meningitis and pneumonia, are becoming
widely resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the yearly toll exacted by drug-resistant infections in
the United States is estimated to exceed $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that bugs should develop resistance to our
efforts to wipe them out. It's only natural for an organism to do
everything it can to evade its killer.
</P>
<P>
   The range of microbial resistance strategies is mind-boggling,
as are the resistance mechanisms they engender. Bacteria have used
such survival strategies for millions of years, but now things are
different. Never before have bacteria encountered such colossal
evolutionary pressure. Humans are pushing microbial evolution into
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Superbugs that can withstand not just one but
multitudes of antibiotics. Superbugs that display resistance to the
newest antibiotics even before they are formally introduced.
Diseases that no longer respond to our attempts to prevent or cure
them.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to do anything? Are we spiraling back to a
pre-antibiotic world in which we are reduced to trying to avoid
infection and, failing that, helplessly hoping for the best?
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy's hope is that if we can get antibiotic use under
control, with physicians prescribing appropriately, according to
more precise diagnoses; if animal and agricultural use is pared
down to the bare essentials; and if household disinfectants are no

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In middle life Kari came home. The Icelanders welcomed the
prodigal; their leaders gave him their support. So did a Swiss
pharmaceutical firm, which pledged $200 million to the company Kari
started. He said it would study the genes of his countrymen and
find the secrets of many diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland is not so different from other places. It has a
McDonald's in local decor. It has shop windows filled with baggy
pants, skateboards and elevator sneakers. It has people walking
down the streets with cell phones pressed to their ears. It also
has a biotechnology company, the one Kari Stefansson started,
called deCODE Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iceland also remains beautifully different, empty and
strange. It was all but devoid of mammals, let alone human beings,
until 874, when the first settlers arrived from Norway. By 1800
there were only 45,000 or so Icelanders, and they were barely
surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty isolated the them. Icelanders today are virtually all
descended from a few thousand people who arrived in the ninth and
10th centuries. That feature makes them of great interest to
geneticists.
</P>
<P>
   In an island nation, tracing family connections even
astonishingly far back into the past is not hard _ and deCODE has
set about doing it once and for all. No more than 625,000 souls
have ever dwelled on Iceland. The deCODE genealogy now includes
560,000 of them, their names and relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kari believes it will encompass 600,000 names in another year or
two and that nearly all the missing ones will date from before
1700.
</P>
<P>
   Medical records for other Icelanders exist back to 1915, when
the country's National Health Service was formed. In the Icelandic
system, people with specific diseases are funneled into specialized
treatment centers, which makes them easy to find. When Kari and his
colleagues decide to study a particular disease, they simply call
the appropriate specialists and quickly assemble a list of everyone
in Iceland with that affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Then deCODE's robotic PCR machines and DNA sequencers and
white-coated young technicians go to work. For each patient, they
scan the entire genome _ all his or her DNA _ for markers that are
identical in most people with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   On Iceland, even unrelated people with the same disease often
have the exact same mutation. The patients who have it are not
completely unrelated, of course; they all must have inherited it
from the same founder, probably from one of the original settlers.
And the importance is this: Two otherwise unrelated Icelanders who
inherit a mutation from a common ancestor 50 generations back will
share a much smaller chunk of DNA than, say, two first cousins who
inherit a mutated gene from their common grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   With each generation, chromosomes are cut to pieces and the
pieces are shuffled; Over time, the pieces that can be traced
intact to any particular ancestor get smaller and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the DNA of unrelated or distantly related
Icelanders, deCODE can quickly zero in on a much smaller region
around the disease gene. To find the disease mutation, deCODE
workers still have to sequence that region step-by-step _ but now
they are analyzing a sequence of only 100,000 to 200,000 bases
instead of 5 to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kari first conceived deCODE in 1996, he has enjoyed good
support. Last year, he and his colleagues pinpointed the locus of a
gene _ not the gene itself _ for a fairly common disorder which
causes involuntary shaking of the hands, arms and head, especially
in elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, Jeff Gulcher, who runs the lab at deCODE, said
they had narrowed the search for a multiple sclerosis gene down to
a DNA region comprising three to five genes, which they were now
sequencing.
</P>
<P>
   In between, business boomed. Last February, Kari signed a deal
with Hoffman-La Roche, under which the Swiss pharmaceutical firm
will pay deCODE more than $200 million over five years to identify
genes for 12 specific diseases. The agreement gives Roche the right
to develop diagnostic tests and drugs based on the genes deCODE
discovers. It also gives all Icelanders free access to those drugs
and tests.
</P>
<P>
   What deCODE got from the deal is its lab full of gleaming
machinery and a huge staff expansion, which is expected to soon
number 200. Still, he probably would not have had problems with
other Icelandic researchers if it had not been for his database
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Kari's idea is to combine the deCODE genealogy of all Icelanders
with a crude genotype _ the marker map _ of all Icelanders, or of
as many as will agree to give blood. This is, of course, precisely
what deCODE is already doing in searching for disease genes. The
difference here is that Kari wants to include all Icelanders, the
healthy along with the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have raised several objections. The first is that a
centralized medical database would threaten the privacy of
patients. The idea of all that information being collected in one
place and placed under the control of a private company makes some
people deeply wary.
</P>
<P>
   Another criticism of the database is that it is just Kari's
attempt to monopolize genetic research on Iceland. Among other
things, the database would constitute all the spadework that would
ever need to be done to launch any genetic study in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   To make the database happen, Kari needs a law authorizing its
creation and especially giving deCODE some sort of exclusive
commercial rights to it. Such a bill, rewritten, is currently
before the Althing, the Icelandic Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of the database is to be guaranteed by an
independent committee, paid for by deCODE. And academic geneticists
would be allowed access to the new database _ provided that their
research does not undermine the commercial interests of deCODE. The
bill would grant deCODE a monopoly on commercial exploitation of
the database for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Iceland would get a couple of hundred good jobs. The
government would also get full access to the database, and the
country's medical records facilities would be standardized,
modernized and computerized at deCODE's expense.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill would not require deCODE to share with Icelanders
any of the profits it might make off their medical and genetic
histories _ or any money it might make from a public offering of
its stock.
</P>
<P>
   All he has ever wanted, Kari Stefansson explains, is to do good
science and to do good by Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the isolation of the nation over 1,100
years, and if you think about all the natural disasters, all this
misery over the centuries _ we are so fortunate that we are a
company in a position to turn the consequences of that into value
for this nation. Into the creation of new knowledge for the entire
world. You could argue that it was an attempt to seek some poetic
justice for the misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's my spin on it. I'm not sure that everyone else
would agree.''

healthy along with the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have raised several objections. The first is that a
centralized medical database would threaten the privacy of
patients. The idea of all that information being collected in one
place and placed under the control of a private company makes some
people deeply wary.
</P>
<P>
   Another criticism of the database is that it is just Kari's
attempt to monopolize genetic research on Iceland. Among other
things, the database would constitute all the spadework that would
ever need to be done to launch any genetic study in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   To make the database happen, Kari needs a law authorizing its
creation and especially giving deCODE some sort of exclusive
commercial rights to it. Such a bill, rewritten, is currently
before the Althing, the Icelandic Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of the database is to be guaranteed by an
independent committee, paid for by deCODE. And academic geneticists
would be allowed access to the new database _ provided that their
research does not undermine the commercial interests of deCODE. The
bill would grant deCODE a monopoly on commercial exploitation of
the database for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Iceland would get a couple of hundred good jobs. The
government would also get full access to the database, and the
country's medical records facilities would be standardized,
modernized and computerized at deCODE's expense.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill would not require deCODE to share with Icelanders
any of the profits it might make off their medical and genetic
histories _ or any money it might make from a public offering of
its stock.
</P>
<P>
   All he has ever wanted, Kari Stefansson explains, is to do good
science and to do good by Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the isolation of the nation over 1,100
years, and if you think about all the natural disasters, all this
misery over the centuries _ we are so fortunate that we are a
company in a position to turn the consequences of that into value
for this nation. Into the creation of new knowledge for the entire
world. You could argue that it was an attempt to seek some poetic
justice for the misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's my spin on it. I'm not sure that everyone else
would agree.''

<P>
   In the United States, AIDS deaths dropped 47 percent from 1996
to 1997 _ thanks mostly to expensive drug treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Though such therapies have reduced AIDS fatalities in the United
States and Western Europe, elsewhere the picture is almost
uniformly bleak. Rates of HIV infection are soaring in impoverished
African and Asian countries _ the nations least prepared to prevent
and treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million people are now infected with HIV, and
almost 90 percent of them live in the developing countries of Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, 16,000 people are newly infected with the virus every
day _ a figure twice as large as previous estimates, which were
modeled in part on the infection rate in Uganda, where the epidemic
has recently begun to plateau.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, the extent of infection is nothing short of
horrifying. In Zimbabwe, for example, one-quarter of the adult
population is now thought to be infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   But the ravages are not limited to Africa. India, with 4 million
cases, is now the world leader in absolute numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates are also rising with blinding speed in Ukraine,
a country that was largely free of HIV before the 1991 breakup of
the Soviet Union. It now has 110,000 people infected with HIV. That
is nearly four times as many as in all of Eastern Europe just four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Poor countries can't afford expensive drugs to treat the
disease. But last year brought a bit of good news. In February the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a short,
four-week course of the anti-AIDS drug AZT during late pregnancy
and delivery halved the transmission rate of the virus from
HIV-positive women to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The trial had been heavily criticized as unethical because half
its subjects _ pregnant HIV-positive women in Thailand and the
Ivory Coast _ were given a placebo, despite results from a 1994
study showing that the drug reduced maternal HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CDC persisted, noting that the 26-week treatment the
earlier study tested costs $800 _ roughly 80 times the annual
health budget per person in many poor, developing countries. Only a
second trial could test whether a shorter, less-expensive course of
drug treatment could work, too.
</P>
<P>
   When positive results came from Thailand last February, the
trial was halted, and the Ivory Coast women on the placebo were
switched to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But even the cost of the short, four-week course of AZT _ $50 _
is far beyond the reach of many women in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS, based in Geneva, agreed to pay for the treatment of
30,000 HIV-positive pregnant women in developing countries. Glaxo
Wellcome, the maker of AZT, will supply the drug at a 60 percent to
75 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Though the United States can generally afford such preventive
strategies, there are still substantial gaps. For example, 40
percent of all U.S. AIDS cases occur among injecting drug abusers,
and the majority of pediatric AIDS cases occur among children born
to injecting drug users or their partners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite results from a recent government inquiry
demonstrating that needle-exchange programs can reduce HIV
transmission among injecting drug users by 30 percent, the Clinton
administration in April refused to lift a ban on federal funding
for such programs, stating that the programs send the wrong message
to children.
</P>
<P>
   This past year also saw new findings illuminating the early
history of the AIDS virus. In February, researchers led by David Ho
of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York announced
that they had isolated fragments of the HIV genome from a blood
sample drawn in 1959 from a man living in what was then
Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa in the Democratic
Republic of Congo).
</P>
<P>
   By comparing genetic sequences of these segments with sequences
from more recent strains of HIV, they created a family tree and
traced elements in the 1959 sample to a common ancestor of three
present-day HIV subtypes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 virus, it turned out, closely resembles the ancestral
virus, which is believed to have hopped from an animal host into
humans. Based on that resemblance, the researchers suspect the hop
probably occurred in the early 1950s or mid-1940s _ soon after the
end of World War II and the collapse of European colonialism in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of those events supports the observation that the
spread of HIV accelerates in conditions of social turmoil and
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Wain-Hobson, a British virologist and AIDS researcher at
the Pasteur Institute in Paris, believes that the disruption and
migration that characterized post-colonial Africa may have played a
key role in the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English and the French kept people ruthlessly under
control,'' Wain-Hobson says. ``They didn't let them move; they
didn't let them travel. And what happened finally when the English
pulled out was a free-for-all. There were pogroms, there was
corruption, there was blackmail, there were movements of
populations, the introduction of the motorcar. There was the
beginning of the urbanization of Africa, which is a postwar
event.''
</P>
<P>
   These developments, he believes, may have helped HIV expand
beyond the narrow range it occupied after it first emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plausible hypothesis,'' says Wain-Hobson, ``but we
might never get beyond that.''

ANCIENT GLOBAL WARMING  
 PERCEPTIVE FISH  
 NEW IMPORT: POLLUTED AIR  
 HONORING DR. CHANDRA 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Global warming is often thought of as a product of the 20th
century, the result of industrialization that has released more
carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere.
But in fact, the world has often gone through warm periods
throughout its history. Now there is new evidence to confirm one
such warming spell _ more than 90,000 centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the University of Rochester, digging in fossil
beds in the Canadian Arctic that date 90 million years, have
discovered fish and turtles and, most important, the bones of
several champsosaurs, crocodilelike dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   The champsosaur needed extended periods of warmth to survive and
reproduce. Judging by the number and size of the specimens found,
the researchers, writing in a recent issue of Science, estimate
that the ancient Arctic must have been downright balmy, with summer
temperatures in the 80s and 90s Fahrenheit, and winters that were
rarely below freezing.
</P>
<P>
   The fossils date from a time that followed hard on the heels of
a period of intense, worldwide volcanic activity that released huge
amounts of carbon dioxide. Scientists had long thought that this
period must have produced warmer temperatures, and the fossil find
suggests that they are right.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptive Fish
</P>
<P>
   Most creatures judge distance by taking sensory readings of an
object from different angles. The readings can be simultaneous from
two or more sensory organs (a human's two, slightly separated,
eyes, for example) or over time from a sole organ (like receptors
on certain insects) as the creature moves.
</P>
<P>
   But biologists from Germany, France and Uruguay have discovered
that a type of electric fish can judge distance with only one
reading from a single group of receptors. It would be as if a human
had great depth perception with one eye closed.
</P>
<P>
   The fish, a freshwater, nocturnal species found in Africa and
South America, produces a weak electric field around it. Nearby
objects distort the field, and the distortions are detected by
electroreceptors on the fish's skin. In this way, the fish can
``see'' in complete darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is: How does the fish determine if a slight
distortion, say, is caused by an object that is close by, or by a
larger object that is farther away?
</P>
<P>
   The solution, as determined by the researchers, is best
envisioned by thinking of the distorted electric field as a shadow
cast on the fish. In this model, an object that is close by
produces a shadow with sharply defined edges. An object that is
farther away might produce the same size shadow, but the edges will
be fuzzier.
</P>
<P>
   The fish is able to process these two qualities _ size of the
distortion, plus how quickly the distortion changes at its edges _
to determine distance.
</P>
<P>
   New Import: Polluted Air
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution is the latest import from Asia, say scientists at
the University of Washington who have tracked small but measurable
amounts of carbon monoxide and other pollutants reaching the West
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, air coming from Asia is cleansed as it crosses the
Pacific. But the researchers found that pollutants can make it
directly across, particularly when there is a stable zone of
low-pressure air over the Aleutians coupled with a high-pressure
zone over Hawaii. The two air masses act like rollers in a conveyor
belt, pulling the dirty air across the ocean in as few as four
days.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers cannot yet pinpoint the source of the pollution
within Asia. And they note that the imports pale in significance
compared with pollution that is Made in the U.S.A. But they warn
that the dirty air from Asia could increase with rapid industrial
growth in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Honoring Dr. Chandra
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is naming its
new orbiting X-ray telescope after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the
University of Chicago astrophysicist and Nobel laureate whose work
on the evolution of stars pointed to the existence of black holes.
</P>
<P>
   Chandrasekhar, who died in 1995 at the age of 84, was known as
Chandra to his colleagues. The Chandra Observatory is scheduled to
be launched in April.

<P>
   Wells Shoemaker is a pediatrician in a small California town.
Not too long ago he saw a patient new to the area, a little boy
with a runny nose.
</P>
<P>
   The child had a cold, but his nasal fluid was clear, and he had
no hint of an ear infection. As Shoemaker offered his diagnosis,
the mother interrupted: ``The only thing that keeps him from
getting an ear infection is antibiotics. My previous doctor used to
give him antibiotics at the beginning of a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, an antibiotic might prevent an infection, but it might
not,'' Shoemaker explained. ``It could even make way for a more
aggressive germ that might cause an ear infection from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother had heard enough. ``I don't care! I know my child
better than you do. I want antibiotics now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give them to you,'' Shoemaker replied. ``In all good
conscience, I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy would have been proud of the beleaguered
pediatrician. Levy, a Tufts University School of Medicine
microbiologist, is one of the world's loudest voices decrying the
misuse of antibiotics. He's the founder of a worldwide network
called the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of a crisis,'' he says, his baritone rising
an octave. ``We have to change things!''
</P>
<P>
   The mother's conduct at the clinic was typical of what Levy
laments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least half the human use of antibiotics in the United
States is unnecessary or inappropriate,'' Levy says. ``Either
antibiotics are not indicated at all, or the wrong antibiotic is
prescribed, or it's the wrong dosage or the wrong duration.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of this massive exposure is the increasingly familiar
predicament the world now faces: disease-causing bugs that resist
the drugs that once thwarted them. It's what Levy calls ``the
antibiotic paradox.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the problem is startling. At least two dozen
different kinds of bacteria have developed resistance to one or
more antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Some strains of three life-threatening species _ the blood
poisoners Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the TB bug _ now frustrate every single
antibiotic known, more than 100 different drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous pathogens such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and
Pneumococcus, which among them cause ear, nose and throat
infections, scarlet fever, meningitis and pneumonia, are becoming
widely resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the yearly toll exacted by drug-resistant infections in
the United States is estimated to exceed $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that bugs should develop resistance to our
efforts to wipe them out. It's only natural for an organism to do
everything it can to evade its killer.
</P>
<P>
   The range of microbial resistance strategies is mind-boggling,
as are the resistance mechanisms they engender. Bacteria have used
such survival strategies for millions of years, but now things are
different. Never before have bacteria encountered such colossal
evolutionary pressure. Humans are pushing microbial evolution into
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Superbugs that can withstand not just one but
multitudes of antibiotics. Superbugs that display resistance to the
newest antibiotics even before they are formally introduced.
Diseases that no longer respond to our attempts to prevent or cure
them.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to do anything? Are we spiraling back to a
pre-antibiotic world in which we are reduced to trying to avoid
infection and, failing that, helplessly hoping for the best?
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy's hope is that if we can get antibiotic use under
control, with physicians prescribing appropriately, according to
more precise diagnoses; if animal and agricultural use is pared
down to the bare essentials; and if household disinfectants are no
longer spiked with lingering bug killers, then we might be able to
turn back the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The good bugs might supplant the bad, and our existing drugs
might once more be able to shoulder the load.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it, advises population and evolutionary biologist
Bruce Levin from Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Levin and his student Bassam Tomeh sampled
bacteria from the diapers of 25 toddlers at a nearby day-care
center. When they isolated samples of the common gut bacteria
Escherichia coli, they found that a quarter were resistant to the
antibiotic streptomycin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors have almost never used streptomycin in the last 30
years,'' Levin exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Bruce is right,'' Levy concedes. ``Maybe you can't go
back again in terms of converting resistant bacteria back to
susceptible ones. But that's not the point. The point is that it's
a numbers game.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers he's talking about involve the ratio between
resistant and susceptible bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   If susceptibles outnumber resistants, then the more vulnerable
bugs may carry the day despite the intransigence of the others.
</P>
<P>
   One way to accomplish that may be to seed our bodies with
benign, drug-susceptible bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring in susceptible E. coli,'' Levy suggests. ``Drink it, day
in and day out. What do you think is going to happen? Resistant
strains are going to stay there? No! They're going to be shed and
the susceptibles take over.''
</P>
<P>
   This very approach is being used in animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>
   In March the FDA approved a spray containing 29 types of
bacteria isolated from the guts of mature chickens. These are the
bugs that chicks would normally receive from their mothers but that
hatchery-born chicks lack. Once sprayed with the mix, the chicks
ingest the bacteria while preening themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So far the results have been promising (and in Japan, where the
spray has been available for more than a year, it has been highly
successful).
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the spray of good bugs protect the chicks from
pathogenic bacteria _ in particular Salmonella _ simply by
occupying the niches where the bad bugs would otherwise lodge, but
it discourages antibiotic use. Because why would anyone want to
give these animals antibiotics that would kill off the very bugs
that are protecting them?
</P>
<P>
   Levy considers this approach a model of what can be done in
humans. But the list of changes that must accompany such an
approach is daunting: education and more accurate diagnoses leading
to fewer, and more appropriate, prescriptions of antibiotics;
restrained use of antibiotics in animal husbandry and agriculture;
reduced use of antibacterials in household disinfectants.
</P>
<P>
   And what if, after all is said and done, it just doesn't make a
difference? The years to come may be grim, indeed. The bugs are
reminding us who's boss.

<P>
   Wells Shoemaker is a pediatrician in a small California town.
Not too long ago he saw a patient new to the area, a little boy
with a runny nose.
</P>
<P>
   The child had a cold, but his nasal fluid was clear, and he had
no hint of an ear infection. As Shoemaker offered his diagnosis,
the mother interrupted: ``The only thing that keeps him from
getting an ear infection is antibiotics. My previous doctor used to
give him antibiotics at the beginning of a cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, an antibiotic might prevent an infection, but it might
not,'' Shoemaker explained. ``It could even make way for a more
aggressive germ that might cause an ear infection from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother had heard enough. ``I don't care! I know my child
better than you do. I want antibiotics now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give them to you,'' Shoemaker replied. ``In all good
conscience, I just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Levy would have been proud of the beleaguered
pediatrician. Levy, a Tufts University School of Medicine
microbiologist, is one of the world's loudest voices decrying the
misuse of antibiotics. He's the founder of a worldwide network
called the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of a crisis,'' he says, his baritone rising
an octave. ``We have to change things!''
</P>
<P>
   The mother's conduct at the clinic was typical of what Levy
laments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least half the human use of antibiotics in the United
States is unnecessary or inappropriate,'' Levy says. ``Either
antibiotics are not indicated at all, or the wrong antibiotic is
prescribed, or it's the wrong dosage or the wrong duration.''
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of this massive exposure is the increasingly familiar
predicament the world now faces: disease-causing bugs that resist
the drugs that once thwarted them. It's what Levy calls ``the
antibiotic paradox.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the problem is startling. At least two dozen
different kinds of bacteria have developed resistance to one or
more antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Some strains of three life-threatening species _ the blood
poisoners Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the TB bug _ now frustrate every single
antibiotic known, more than 100 different drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous pathogens such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and
Pneumococcus, which among them cause ear, nose and throat
infections, scarlet fever, meningitis and pneumonia, are becoming
widely resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the yearly toll exacted by drug-resistant infections in
the United States is estimated to exceed $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that bugs should develop resistance to our
efforts to wipe them out. It's only natural for an organism to do
everything it can to evade its killer.
</P>
<P>
   The range of microbial resistance strategies is mind-boggling,
as are the resistance mechanisms they engender. Bacteria have used
such survival strategies for millions of years, but now things are
different. Never before have bacteria encountered such colossal
evolutionary pressure. Humans are pushing microbial evolution into
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Superbugs that can withstand not just one but
multitudes of antibiotics. Superbugs that display resistance to the
newest antibiotics even before they are formally introduced.
Diseases that no longer respond to our attempts to prevent or cure
them.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to do anything? Are we spiraling back to a
pre-antibiotic world in which we are reduced to trying to avoid
infection and, failing that, helplessly hoping for the best?

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   In middle life Kari came home. The Icelanders welcomed the
prodigal; their leaders gave him their support. So did a Swiss
pharmaceutical firm, which pledged $200 million to the company Kari
started. He said it would study the genes of his countrymen and
find the secrets of many diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland is not so different from other places. It has a
McDonald's in local decor. It has shop windows filled with baggy
pants, skateboards and elevator sneakers. It has people walking
down the streets with cell phones pressed to their ears. It also
has a biotechnology company, the one Kari Stefansson started,
called deCODE Genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Iceland also remains beautifully different, empty and
strange. It was all but devoid of mammals, let alone human beings,
until 874, when the first settlers arrived from Norway. By 1800
there were only 45,000 or so Icelanders, and they were barely
surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty isolated the them. Icelanders today are virtually all
descended from a few thousand people who arrived in the ninth and
10th centuries. That feature makes them of great interest to
geneticists.
</P>
<P>
   In an island nation, tracing family connections even
astonishingly far back into the past is not hard _ and deCODE has
set about doing it once and for all. No more than 625,000 souls
have ever dwelled on Iceland. The deCODE genealogy now includes
560,000 of them, their names and relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kari believes it will encompass 600,000 names in another year or
two and that nearly all the missing ones will date from before
1700.
</P>
<P>
   Medical records for other Icelanders exist back to 1915, when
the country's National Health Service was formed. In the Icelandic
system, people with specific diseases are funneled into specialized
treatment centers, which makes them easy to find. When Kari and his
colleagues decide to study a particular disease, they simply call
the appropriate specialists and quickly assemble a list of everyone
in Iceland with that affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Then deCODE's robotic PCR machines and DNA sequencers and
white-coated young technicians go to work. For each patient, they
scan the entire genome _ all his or her DNA _ for markers that are
identical in most people with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   On Iceland, even unrelated people with the same disease often
have the exact same mutation. The patients who have it are not
completely unrelated, of course; they all must have inherited it
from the same founder, probably from one of the original settlers.
And the importance is this: Two otherwise unrelated Icelanders who
inherit a mutation from a common ancestor 50 generations back will
share a much smaller chunk of DNA than, say, two first cousins who
inherit a mutated gene from their common grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   With each generation, chromosomes are cut to pieces and the
pieces are shuffled; Over time, the pieces that can be traced
intact to any particular ancestor get smaller and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the DNA of unrelated or distantly related
Icelanders, deCODE can quickly zero in on a much smaller region
around the disease gene. To find the disease mutation, deCODE
workers still have to sequence that region step-by-step _ but now
they are analyzing a sequence of only 100,000 to 200,000 bases
instead of 5 to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kari first conceived deCODE in 1996, he has enjoyed good
support. Last year, he and his colleagues pinpointed the locus of a
gene _ not the gene itself _ for a fairly common disorder which
causes involuntary shaking of the hands, arms and head, especially
in elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, Jeff Gulcher, who runs the lab at deCODE, said
they had narrowed the search for a multiple sclerosis gene down to
a DNA region comprising three to five genes, which they were now
sequencing.
</P>
<P>
   In between, business boomed. Last February, Kari signed a deal
with Hoffman-La Roche, under which the Swiss pharmaceutical firm
will pay deCODE more than $200 million over five years to identify
genes for 12 specific diseases. The agreement gives Roche the right
to develop diagnostic tests and drugs based on the genes deCODE
discovers. It also gives all Icelanders free access to those drugs
and tests.
</P>
<P>
   What deCODE got from the deal is its lab full of gleaming
machinery and a huge staff expansion, which is expected to soon
number 200. Still, he probably would not have had problems with
other Icelandic researchers if it had not been for his database
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Kari's idea is to combine the deCODE genealogy of all Icelanders
with a crude genotype _ the marker map _ of all Icelanders, or of
as many as will agree to give blood. This is, of course, precisely
what deCODE is already doing in searching for disease genes. The
difference here is that Kari wants to include all Icelanders, the
healthy along with the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have raised several objections. The first is that a
centralized medical database would threaten the privacy of
patients. The idea of all that information being collected in one
place and placed under the control of a private company makes some
people deeply wary.
</P>
<P>
   Another criticism of the database is that it is just Kari's
attempt to monopolize genetic research on Iceland. Among other
things, the database would constitute all the spadework that would
ever need to be done to launch any genetic study in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   To make the database happen, Kari needs a law authorizing its
creation and especially giving deCODE some sort of exclusive
commercial rights to it. Such a bill, rewritten, is currently
before the Althing, the Icelandic Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of the database is to be guaranteed by an
independent committee, paid for by deCODE. And academic geneticists
would be allowed access to the new database _ provided that their
research does not undermine the commercial interests of deCODE. The
bill would grant deCODE a monopoly on commercial exploitation of
the database for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Iceland would get a couple of hundred good jobs. The
government would also get full access to the database, and the
country's medical records facilities would be standardized,
modernized and computerized at deCODE's expense.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill would not require deCODE to share with Icelanders
any of the profits it might make off their medical and genetic
histories _ or any money it might make from a public offering of
its stock.
</P>
<P>
   All he has ever wanted, Kari Stefansson explains, is to do good
science and to do good by Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the isolation of the nation over 1,100
years, and if you think about all the natural disasters, all this
misery over the centuries _ we are so fortunate that we are a
company in a position to turn the consequences of that into value
for this nation. Into the creation of new knowledge for the entire
world. You could argue that it was an attempt to seek some poetic
justice for the misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's my spin on it. I'm not sure that everyone else
would agree.''

   Kari's idea is to combine the deCODE genealogy of all Icelanders
with a crude genotype _ the marker map _ of all Icelanders, or of
as many as will agree to give blood. This is, of course, precisely
what deCODE is already doing in searching for disease genes. The
difference here is that Kari wants to include all Icelanders, the
healthy along with the sick.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have raised several objections. The first is that a
centralized medical database would threaten the privacy of
patients. The idea of all that information being collected in one
place and placed under the control of a private company makes some
people deeply wary.
</P>
<P>
   Another criticism of the database is that it is just Kari's
attempt to monopolize genetic research on Iceland. Among other
things, the database would constitute all the spadework that would
ever need to be done to launch any genetic study in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   To make the database happen, Kari needs a law authorizing its
creation and especially giving deCODE some sort of exclusive
commercial rights to it. Such a bill, rewritten, is currently
before the Althing, the Icelandic Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The anonymity of the database is to be guaranteed by an
independent committee, paid for by deCODE. And academic geneticists
would be allowed access to the new database _ provided that their
research does not undermine the commercial interests of deCODE. The
bill would grant deCODE a monopoly on commercial exploitation of
the database for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Iceland would get a couple of hundred good jobs. The
government would also get full access to the database, and the
country's medical records facilities would be standardized,
modernized and computerized at deCODE's expense.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill would not require deCODE to share with Icelanders
any of the profits it might make off their medical and genetic
histories _ or any money it might make from a public offering of
its stock.
</P>
<P>
   All he has ever wanted, Kari Stefansson explains, is to do good
science and to do good by Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about the isolation of the nation over 1,100
years, and if you think about all the natural disasters, all this
misery over the centuries _ we are so fortunate that we are a
company in a position to turn the consequences of that into value
for this nation. Into the creation of new knowledge for the entire
world. You could argue that it was an attempt to seek some poetic
justice for the misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's my spin on it. I'm not sure that everyone else
would agree.''

<P>
   In the United States, AIDS deaths dropped 47 percent from 1996
to 1997 _ thanks mostly to expensive drug treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Though such therapies have reduced AIDS fatalities in the United
States and Western Europe, elsewhere the picture is almost
uniformly bleak. Rates of HIV infection are soaring in impoverished
African and Asian countries _ the nations least prepared to prevent
and treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 million people are now infected with HIV, and
almost 90 percent of them live in the developing countries of Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, 16,000 people are newly infected with the virus every
day _ a figure twice as large as previous estimates, which were
modeled in part on the infection rate in Uganda, where the epidemic
has recently begun to plateau.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, the extent of infection is nothing short of
horrifying. In Zimbabwe, for example, one-quarter of the adult
population is now thought to be infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   But the ravages are not limited to Africa. India, with 4 million
cases, is now the world leader in absolute numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates are also rising with blinding speed in Ukraine,
a country that was largely free of HIV before the 1991 breakup of
the Soviet Union. It now has 110,000 people infected with HIV. That
is nearly four times as many as in all of Eastern Europe just four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Poor countries can't afford expensive drugs to treat the
disease. But last year brought a bit of good news. In February the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that a short,
four-week course of the anti-AIDS drug AZT during late pregnancy
and delivery halved the transmission rate of the virus from
HIV-positive women to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The trial had been heavily criticized as unethical because half
its subjects _ pregnant HIV-positive women in Thailand and the
Ivory Coast _ were given a placebo, despite results from a 1994
study showing that the drug reduced maternal HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the CDC persisted, noting that the 26-week treatment the
earlier study tested costs $800 _ roughly 80 times the annual
health budget per person in many poor, developing countries. Only a
second trial could test whether a shorter, less-expensive course of
drug treatment could work, too.
</P>
<P>
   When positive results came from Thailand last February, the
trial was halted, and the Ivory Coast women on the placebo were
switched to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But even the cost of the short, four-week course of AZT _ $50 _
is far beyond the reach of many women in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the Joint United Nations Program on
HIV/AIDS, based in Geneva, agreed to pay for the treatment of
30,000 HIV-positive pregnant women in developing countries. Glaxo
Wellcome, the maker of AZT, will supply the drug at a 60 percent to
75 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Though the United States can generally afford such preventive
strategies, there are still substantial gaps. For example, 40
percent of all U.S. AIDS cases occur among injecting drug abusers,
and the majority of pediatric AIDS cases occur among children born
to injecting drug users or their partners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite results from a recent government inquiry
demonstrating that needle-exchange programs can reduce HIV
transmission among injecting drug users by 30 percent, the Clinton
administration in April refused to lift a ban on federal funding
for such programs, stating that the programs send the wrong message
to children.
</P>
<P>
   This past year also saw new findings illuminating the early
history of the AIDS virus. In February, researchers led by David Ho
of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York announced
that they had isolated fragments of the HIV genome from a blood
sample drawn in 1959 from a man living in what was then
Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa in the Democratic
Republic of Congo).
</P>
<P>
   By comparing genetic sequences of these segments with sequences
from more recent strains of HIV, they created a family tree and
traced elements in the 1959 sample to a common ancestor of three
present-day HIV subtypes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 virus, it turned out, closely resembles the ancestral
virus, which is believed to have hopped from an animal host into
humans. Based on that resemblance, the researchers suspect the hop
probably occurred in the early 1950s or mid-1940s _ soon after the
end of World War II and the collapse of European colonialism in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of those events supports the observation that the
spread of HIV accelerates in conditions of social turmoil and
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Wain-Hobson, a British virologist and AIDS researcher at
the Pasteur Institute in Paris, believes that the disruption and
migration that characterized post-colonial Africa may have played a
key role in the spread of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The English and the French kept people ruthlessly under
control,'' Wain-Hobson says. ``They didn't let them move; they
didn't let them travel. And what happened finally when the English
pulled out was a free-for-all. There were pogroms, there was
corruption, there was blackmail, there were movements of
populations, the introduction of the motorcar. There was the
beginning of the urbanization of Africa, which is a postwar
event.''
</P>
<P>
   These developments, he believes, may have helped HIV expand
beyond the narrow range it occupied after it first emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a plausible hypothesis,'' says Wain-Hobson, ``but we
might never get beyond that.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   A complex weather pattern will evolve over the East on Tuesday,
bringing snow to portions of the interior Northeast later Tuesday
and Tuesday night. During the daytime, snow will accompany low
pressure traversing the northern Great Lakes with over 6 inches of
new snow likely in parts of Michigan's upper peninsula. Meanwhile,
patches of lighter snow or rain will occur farther south over the
southern Great Lakes and upper Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A potent jet-stream disturbance crossing the Southeast will
produce low pressure near the Middle Atlantic coast Tuesday
afternoon. As the low strengthens, showers will develop from
northern Florida to the eastern Carolinas. Isolated thunderstorms
will also ignite over the region as the disturbance interacts with
humid Atlantic air.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday night, the Middle Atlantic low will combine with the
low crossing the Great Lakes, setting the stage for heavy snow
Tuesday night and Wednesday across interior New England.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk winds from the northwest will direct bitterly cold air
into the upper Mississippi Valley on Tuesday with dangerously low
wind-chill values near the Canadian border. Farther south, dry and
mild air will cover the southern Plains and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of Pacific moisture will bring heavy rain to the
Northwest coast while intermittent lighter showers occur east of
the Cascades. As the moist plume of air is further cooled upon
intercepting the higher terrain, heavy snow will fall along the
west-facing slopes of the northern Cascades and Bitterroots.
Meanwhile, southern California will be sunny and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Squeezing the Wind
</P>
<P>
   High wind warnings were posted Monday for the Guadalupe Pass in
the mountains of western Texas as steady winds of 40 mph with gusts
in excess of 60 mph swept through the region. One driving force for
the powerful winds was the circulation around an expansive and
persistent high-pressure system centered over Nevada and Utah.
Another important contributing factor was the lie of the land. Air
coursing through mountain passes accelerates as its flow is
constricted, much like toothpaste squirting from a tube that is
squeezed too tightly.

<P>
   URBANA, Ill. _ For six decades, conservationists in Illinois
tried to save the greater prairie chickens that once covered the
state like its sea of grass. Hunting was banned. Sanctuaries were
set up. Predators were driven away.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the showy little birds, beloved for their
flamboyant mating rituals, began a headlong population collapse
that saw their numbers fall from 25,000 statewide in 1933 to 2,000
in 1962, to fewer than 50 in 1993, though they remained abundant in
other Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   Now a team of geneticists and ecologists from state agencies and
the University of Illinois has reversed that decline and, for one
of the first times in a wild population, documented how inbreeding
and loss of habitat reinforced each other to create an ``extinction
vortex.'' They reported their findings in a recent issue of the
journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists have suspected a genetic bottleneck _ a sharp
reduction in genetic diversity _ in the decline of other animals
like the cheetah, the Florida panther and the black-footed ferret.
But conclusive ``before'' and ``after'' data were not available to
rule out other possibilities like natural disasters, isolation or
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the prairie chicken, said Dr. Alan Templeton,
professor of biology and genetics at Washington University in St.
Louis: ``You can see the genetic impact of what humans have done
quite clearly. In many cases, you can infer it. Here it is
documented. That's why it's so compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Westemeier, the lead author of the Science article, has
studied the prairie chicken, Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus, for 35
years and recently retired as a wildlife ecologist with the
Illinois Natural History Survey.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest blow to the survival of the Illinois prairie
chicken, he said, was the introduction in 1837 of the steel plow,
the first that could slice through the deep, dense root systems of
prairie plants. By the turn of the century, the Illinois prairie
had vanished into farms, and the heart of the prairie chickens'
range had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-pound wild bird, which was a staple of the local diet in
the 1800s and was brought to Chicago markets by the hundreds of
thousands, survived in scattered patches, especially in the south
central part of Illinois, where farmers used to grow red top grass,
a favorite for nesting, as a cash crop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, the subspecies known as the heath hen (Tympanuchus
cupido cupido) became extinct in the eastern United States. Two
years later, Illinois banned the hunting of the prairie chicken. In
1962, a sanctuary, now called the Prairie Ridge State Natural Area,
was established in Jasper County, about four miles southwest of
Newton, Ill. A second grassland sanctuary was established 40 miles
away, in Marion County, by the Nature Conservancy in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   But privately owned grasslands in the area kept disappearing,
along with their prairie chickens. By the 1980s, the birds were
found only on the two wildlife preserves, cut off by hundreds of
miles from populations in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1970s, we thought we knew everything we needed to know
about preserving a flock of wild birds,'' Westemeier said. But by
1973, that changed. Their numbers kept falling, he said, adding,
``We found more and more nests with unhatched eggs.'' By 1990, the
hatching rate, which had averaged between 91 and 100 percent, had
dropped to an extreme low, 38 percent in Jasper County.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid 1990s, Westemeier said: ``The count of males dropped
as low as six on each sanctuary. We had every reason to believe we
were going to lose them completely.'' In Illinois, this was
unthinkable. Here, as in other Midwestern states where it makes its
home, the prairie chicken has a loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fun,'' said Dr. Dan Svedarsky, a wildlife biologist
and member of the Minnesota Prairie Chicken Society. In Rothsay,
the ``Prairie Chicken Capital'' of Minnesota, residents have even
built a huge, illuminated chicken wire and concrete statue near
Interstate 94 to honor the bird. Newcomers to the area, Svedarsky
said, cannot believe the real prairie chicken ``puts on such an
unusual show.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Simpson, who manages the Jasper County preserve for the
Illinois Department of Natural Resources, agrees. ``Once you've
seen them and heard them,'' he said, ``it's nothing you forget.''
</P>
<P>
   In a mating ritual that takes place every spring, the male
prairie chicken goes to communal mating grounds, called leks, where
each male stakes out territory and tries to woo as many hens as
possible. There he inflates bright orange air sacs, part of his
esophagus, into two orange-sized balloons on each side of his head.
As air is drawn into these sacs, it creates a three-syllable
``boom-boom-boom'' _ similar to the sound of air being blown across
the mouth of a bottle _ that can be heard for miles.
</P>
<P>
   While memorable for biologists, the downside of this mating
system, said Jeffrey Brawn, an ecologist and co-author of the
Illinois study, is that the dominant male contributes
disproportionately to the future gene pool, and ``if there are
inbreeding problems, they will be exaggerated by this system.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers here wanted to know whether significant genetic
differences existed between the Illinois prairie chickens, which
were dying out, and the birds in other states, which seemed to be
thriving. Dr. Ken Paige, a co-author and a geneticist at the
University of Illinois, was concerned about the possibility of
losing ``some of the things that were unique about the Illinois
birds'' when plans to introduce prairie chickens from other states
were carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Bouzat, then a doctoral student at the university, worked
with Paige to compare DNA from frozen tissue samples of birds that
died in Illinois between 1974 and 1993 with DNA from blood samples
of birds captured in Kansas, Nebraska and Minnesota between 1992
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison suggested that all the birds were related but
that in recent years the Illinois birds had become less genetically
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To investigate that possibility, Bouzat turned to stuffed birds
he found at the Illinois Natural History Survey here. Ten had been
collected in the 1930s and five in the 1960s. Most came from the
same population in Jasper County. Bouzat was able to extract DNA
from tissue in the roots of the birds' feathers.
</P>
<P>
   He found little genetic difference between the Illinois birds of
the 1930s and present-day prairie chickens in other states. But he
found that the present-day prairie chickens in Illinois had lost
one-third of the genetic diversity of the birds that lived in the
same sanctuary before the genetic contraction, or bottleneck, took
place. Westemeier believes the gene pool diminished to the point of
near certain extinction in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the state's prairie chicken population from dying out,
Simpson and other wildlife managers from the state's Division of
Natural Heritage had begun transplanting birds from Minnesota,
Kansas and Nebraska to Illinois. Between 1992 and 1996, they
brought in 518 prairie chickens. All were tracked with leg bands
and some with radio-telemetry tags. The new and old populations
interbred, and hatching rates went back up to 94 percent this year.
No major changes in the local environment occurred during that
time, so the scientists attribute the success to factors intrinsic
to the breeding birds.
</P>
<P>
   It was, they reported in Science, ``a unique example of the
general scenario predicted by `extinction vortex' models. These
models predict that demographic and genetic effects reinforce each
other in small populations to increase the probability of local
extinction. We believe that the near-complete loss of suitable
grasslands and satellite populations in the region drove the
greater prairie chicken toward this scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lacy, a population geneticist in the department of
conservation biology at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, said the
study has two important lessons: ``One is that there are cases,
like the prairie chicken, we can do something about still. In other
cases, we're down to the last population.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the black-footed ferret, isolated for up to 50
years and rediscovered in Wyoming in the early 1980s. The last ones
were captured in the hope of breeding them in captivity and
releasing them into the wild. Although the low numbers have been
taken care of, he said, ``the ones being released have lesser
genetic diversity'' and, without a genetically healthy population
for comparison, there is ``no way of knowing whether the effort to
re-establish them will be compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies like the prairie chicken caution us not to drop down
to a single, isolated population,'' he said.

NEED IS SEEN FOR A DRUG-SAFETY BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an airplane crashes, scores of investigators descend on the
site, searching for the ``black box'' and piecing together the
wreckage in a grim effort to find out what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators work for an independent government agency, the
National Transportation Safety Board _ not for the company that
built the plane, not for the airline that flew it and not for the
Federal Aviation Administration, which gave its stamp of approval
to both the manufacturer and the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Air safety is considered too important, and human nature too
fragile, to allow the same people who put the plane in the air to
lead an investigation of a disaster that might ultimately be traced
back to their own mistakes in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when a drug harms patients, there is no independent
agency to find out what went wrong. There is not even a formal
program or system in place to require that early signs of trouble
be reported.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the government relies on doctors to report problems
voluntarily, and the job of investigating then falls to the same
people who put the drug on the market in the first place: the Food
and Drug Administration, which approved the drug, and the
pharmaceutical company that manufactured it.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in a recent issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine, three doctors _ Dr. Raymond Woosley of Georgetown
University, and Dr. Alastair J.J. Wood and Dr. C. Michael Stein of
Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. _ compared airplane
safety and drug safety, noting that adverse reactions to medication
kill 100,000 Americans a year _ vastly more than the number who die
in plane crashes, which are nonetheless far more thoroughly
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors suggested that the United States needed an
independent drug-safety agency, analogous to the transportation
board, to investigate drug ``crashes,'' and a mandatory reporting
system to catch adverse drug effects as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The diet drug Redux is a case in point. It was taken off the
market in 1997, because as part of the weight-loss combination
fen-phen, it was found to cause heart-valve damage. Millions of
people had taken fen-phen, but because of the lack of rigorous
postmarketing surveillance, the authors said, there was little
information about how many people were harmed, how the damage
occurred and whether other drugs might cause similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   A safety board might have been able to make better sense of what
happened, Woosley said in a telephone interview, ``so that when we
approve the next obesity drug, we might not be creating the same
problem again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another drug, Posicor, prescribed for high blood pressure, was
also taken off the market earlier this year only 10 months after it
was approved, because of dangerous interactions with more than 25
other drugs. The FDA had received reports of 400 health problems
and 24 deaths among the 200,000 Americans who had taken it, though
it was not known whether these problems had actually been caused by
the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The allergy drug Seldane was also taken off the market because
its interactions with other drugs caused serious heart problems. It
had been on the market for five years and had been used by tens of
millions of people. (Late last year, it was reformulated and
released as Allegra-D.)
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to turn over investigations of drug mishaps to a
new safety board has not been well received at the FDA. Officials
there issued a statement saying that the agency was best equipped
to handle the job. ``FDA scientists who review marketing
applications,'' it said in part, ``have extensive knowledge of the
products and families of related products, which significantly
benefits the agency's ability to monitor the products once they are
on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   But Woosley said that the article was not meant to criticize the
agency or the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention was not so much to find fault as to improve the
process,'' he said, adding that a drug-safety board could act as an
advocate for the FDA and nudge Congress to provide more money when
needed. The board could help industry, too, he said, by providing
information about why a drug failed, or data that could even help a
company defend itself against unfounded liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   Adverse effects will always show up after a drug is approved,
Woosley and his colleagues said, writing, ``It is simply not
possible to identify all the side effects of drugs before they are
marketed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One reason is that some effects may not occur frequently enough
to show up in studies that include hundreds or even thousands of
people. A problem that affects 1 percent of patients, for instance,
may be easy to miss in trials, because only a handful of
participants may be affected. But if the drug then goes to market
and is taken by hundreds of thousands of people, 1 percent
translates into thousands of cases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people who take a drug after it is marketed may be
quite different from those in whom it was tested: They may have
different illnesses and be taking medications with which the new
drug has not been studied.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect is that people who take new drugs may unwittingly
become subjects in a massive experiment. That experiment needs more
careful monitoring, Woosley said.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that the FDA has speeded up its approval process,
approving 92 drugs from 1996 through 1997, almost twice its
previous rate, the authors said that better monitoring was needed
more than ever. Woosley said more and more drugs with interaction
problems would probably come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the people who make decisions at FDA are
excellent,'' he said. ``But they shouldn't be put in a situation
where they have to second-guess their own decisions. We don't do it
with radiation or airplanes. We shouldn't do it with drugs.''

   Every winter, after flying south from the eastern United States,
millions of monarch butterflies festoon fir trees in the mountains
of Mexico, creating one of the world's most dazzling and famous
biological spectacles. But in spite of intense interest in these
beloved insects, the details of their travels, like those of so
many creatures that do not submit to tagging or to voyeuristic
techniques like radio-transmitters, have largely remained a
mystery.

monarchs, herald the arrival of a powerful new technique that can
identify, sometimes to within a few miles, where migrating animals
_ from butterflies to mastodons to humans _have been. The new
technique takes advantage of different forms, known as isotopes, of
chemical elements. Biologists have begun discovering that these
isotopes, present in different amounts in different regions, can
leave a distinctive chemical signature written in the feather of a
bird or the wing of a butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   By pinpointing crucial places where animals spend their lives,
for example the major breeding grounds of monarch butterflies, the
studies are not only illuminating the paths of these travelers, but
are showing where conservationists should be focusing their
efforts. In the case of monarchs, much of their breeding ground now
appears to be on some of the most heavily farmed regions, heavily
sprayed with pesticides, in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a massive breakthrough,'' said Dr. Keith Hobson,
a research scientist at the Canadian Wildlife Service in Saskatoon,
who carried out the monarch work along with Dr. Len Wassenaar, a
research scientist with Environment Canada, also in Saskatoon.
``These are questions we could get at no other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Page Chamberlain, a geochemist at Dartmouth College and
another of the leaders in this newly developing field, said that
when he first heard that researchers were using isotopes to trace
elephant movements, ``We thought, `Hey, we can do that. We can do
it with fish too.' Now within a couple of years we've gone from
fish to birds to insects. It has a lot of promise.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, to biologists' delight, that the world is peppered
and painted with many different kinds of isotopes whose levels in a
region vary depending on factors like temperature, rainfall,
bedrock and soils.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogen, for example, which comes in its standard form as well
as the heavier form deuterium, shows a distinctive pattern of
distribution. Depending on whether hydrogen in any particular
molecule of water is heavy or light, the water will be heavy or
light. When clouds move inland from over the ocean, heavy water
rains out first and lighter water further inland, creating a stable
gradient that can be mapped. Those differences get translated into
plants that take up the water and then into insects that eat the
plants, birds that eat the insects and so on, leaving an indelible
mark on even the flightiest creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers can refine their ability to pinpoint locations by
using multiple isotopes with different specificities. Strontium,
for example, an element that has been used to trace salmon
movements, can vary greatly between streams just a few miles apart.
</P>
<P>
   To track monarchs, researchers used carbon and hydrogen, first
developing a detailed isotope map. Working with Dr. Chip Taylor, an
ecologist at the University of Kansas and the director of Monarch
Watch, a nonprofit research and education group, Wassenaar and
Hobson enlisted the help of 90 amateur butterfly enthusiasts, many
of them schoolchildren. These volunteers around the country raised
monarch caterpillars on milkweed plants, the insect's food plant,
from their area. The carbon and hydrogen in the wings of the
resulting butterflies revealed the variation in isotope ratios from
the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic _ the breeding range of the
monarchs that migrate to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were then able to study the wings of monarchs that
had died naturally in 13 wintering sites in Mexico. They showed for
the first time that these butterflies dangling together like
crowded Christmas tree ornaments came from all parts of the
breeding range, flying in and mingling after having grown up as
caterpillars in places as distant as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland. The work put to rest a theory that different roosts were
populated by butterflies from distinct geographic regions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new findings are a big step forward as earlier attempts to
track the monarchs had been limited to tagging. ``The odds of
recovery with little guys, like monarchs, are pathetically low,''
Wassenaar said, about one recaptured monarch for every several
thousand tagged.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising discovery, however, was that, while the
monarchs' breeding range is quite large, half of all the
butterflies collected from Mexico had come there from a fairly
restricted and highly agricultural area including Kansas, Nebraska,
Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and Ohio _
soybean and corn country.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, said Dr. Lincoln Brower, a monarch researcher at
Sweet Briar College, is that ``pesticides are killing milkweed
plants on a grand scale in this very region, what they've shown is
the most important breeding region for monarchs.''
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome still, Taylor said, is the use of transgenic
plants, which have been genetically altered so that they can
withstand pesticide sprays that competing weeds, like milkweeds,
cannot. Other transgenic plants, like those that produce toxins in
their tissues, are of great concern to biologists who note that it
remains entirely unknown what effect these novel plants might have
on non-target insects in these regions, including monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a revolution coming along in agriculture,'' Taylor
said, ``that has great potential to eliminate a lot of milkweeds.''
</P>
<P>
   The reach of the new isotope studies is becoming so broad that
even the dead are not immune from these investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. T. Douglas Price, archeologist at the University of
Wisconsin, and an international team of colleagues are tracking the
movements of ancient humans using strontium deposits in teeth and
bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of this is that in people, your tooth enamel forms
at birth and doesn't change and your bone represents where you
lived the last 10 years of your life,'' he said. ``If the ratios
are different, we know that the person moved.'' Using such simple
principles, Price said his team had just completed a study of the
peoples of the Mexican city of Teotihuacan, testing the idea that
different parts of the city were ethnic neighborhoods of people
from different regions of Mexico. ``We've looked at their bones and
they're definitely outsiders,'' Price said. ``The potential of this
technique is really remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, others are tracking declining songbirds and salmon,
and two paleontologists, Kathryn Hoppe at Princeton University and
Dr. Paul Kock at the University of California at Santa Cruz, are
reconstructing the movements of fossil mastodons and mammoths.
Meanwhile, there remain many untapped isotopes and as many new
questions to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can look at just about any animal, you name it,''
Hobson said. ``Forensic applications are also quite possible. If
someone wanted to know if marijuana was grown in the southern
United States or Canada, that would just be a piece of cake.''

MILDER MONTHS BRING BIGGER BABIES  
 FOR ATHLETES, BETTER FOCUS WITH HYPNOSIS

   If every little millimeter counts in the height of your
children, a spring or fall birth might give them an edge. European
researchers do not know why but those babies are longer and by age
18 taller than other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``A difference of 2 millimeters does not seem a lot and surely
one should not try to plan a `long' baby based on seasonality of
conception,'' said Dr. Mads Melbye of the Danish Epidemiology
Center who studied the birth records of more than 1 million Danish
children born between 1973 and 1994. ``What was striking to us was
the consistency we observed in the seasonal variation.''
</P>
<P>
   In a research letter in the current Lancet, the investigators
concluded, ``The seasonal pattern at birth was similar across the
strata of birth year, birth order, sex and gestational age, which
supports the hypothesis that month of birth is important for adult
stature.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was inspired by Austrian research, reported in the
journal Nature last February, which showed ``clear evidence for a
dependence of final body height at age 18 on birth month.'' Melbye
and his colleagues expanded upon the earlier study not to grow
basketball players or jockeys but because of ongoing research
exploring the link between fetal size and health problems in later
life.
</P>
<P>
   Neither study could definitively explain the link between height
and birth month, but the Austrian researchers suggested it could be
related to annual rhythms and sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Melbye said that he would like to see similar studies done in
the Southern Hemisphere. ``We have at present no explanation for
these findings,'' he added, ``other than that an external factor
which is seasonally determined must influence the growth of a
baby.''

   For Athletes, Better Focus With Hypnosis
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the gun sounded to start his World Cup 400-meter
race, Iwan Thomas gently tugged on his left ear lobe. This subtle
movement helped him block out the noise of the crowd and the
runners on either side of him.
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of other top athletes, Thomas has been using
hypnosis to enhance his performance. The action of pulling his ear
lobe is known as an associative posthypnotic command, which brought
him into a heightened state of concentration. He won the race that
day, capping his best season ever.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, 24, of Wales, described how he came to work with a
hypnotist: ``I met Robert Farago in 1995 when the BBC was looking
for a guinea pig for one of their morning breakfast programs. Then
last year things weren't going well for me, and my parents said
`Why don't you give that hypnotist a try?' I think it helped to
keep me calm and focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional athletes and their weekend counterparts are turning
to hypnosis to help correct everything from a poor golf swing to
precompetition jitters. Dr. Dwight Damon, president of the National
Guild of Hypnotists in Merrimeck, N.H., said he believed more and
more of the guild's 7,000 members are using hypnosis to help
athletes improve performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hypnosis does is it takes the champion's best
performance, makes it available 100 percent of the time,'' said
Farago, who works with athletes at his hypnosis clinic in Windsor,
England. ``Sports people know it as going `into the zone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Farago works this way: He takes out a pocket watch and asks the
subject to focus on it as he swings it to and fro, which results in
a trance. For the next hour, Farago commands the required change,
either something specific like ``You will hit the ball straight
down the fairway'' or more general as in ``You will win!'' These
commands might be tied to a gesture like tugging on the ear lobe.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Reese, former head trainer for the New York Jets, also uses
hypnotherapy with both professional and recreational athletes. He
said he believed that the only drawback of the practice was its
image problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I learned early on about hypnosis is to quit
calling it that,'' said Reese, who runs a company called Train Your
Brain, in North Port, N.Y., and charges between $65 and $150 a
session. ``There was a built-in fear _ they didn't want to give up
their minds. Instead, I started telling athletes we were going to
do some high-powered visualization techniques.''

DEATHS SPUR EFFORT TO TOUGHEN STANDARDS IN COSMETIC SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the wake of scores of deaths around the
country linked to cosmetic surgery, legislative reforms targeted to
the boom in ``rejuvenation'' surgery are being considered in
California.
</P>
<P>
   State legislators and medical officials are calling for stricter
standards, ranging from mandatory malpractice insurance for
physicians to tightening qualifications for doctors who perform
cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite shocked at what I've heard _ that physicians are
essentially taking 16-hour weekend courses, then on Monday putting
themselves out to the public to practice cosmetic surgery,'' says
Democratic Assemblyman Martin Gallegos, chairman of the Assembly
Health Committee. ``There are physicians who are ill-prepared and
put the public at risk with these procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos backs the efforts of a special cosmetic surgery
committee formed last year by the state Medical Board in response
to rising alarm over complications stemming from vanity treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are using cosmetic surgery to supplement their income,
it's another outcropping of the explosion of managed care,''
Gallegos says.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``as best as I can tell, there are not uniform and
consistent standards and guidelines pertaining to training, to what
are safe quantities for liposuction removal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A San Francisco Examiner investigation published in September
documented escalating peril over cosmetic surgery _ treatment,
promoted as low-risk, that can be performed without additional
training by any medical doctor. In the last five years, the field
has exploded, with baby boomers hoisting sagging jowls, plumping
breasts and dewrinkling middle-age visages.
</P>
<P>
   The series detailed a spate of puzzling deaths of healthy people
who underwent liposuction, the nation's most popular form of
cosmetic surgery. According to one estimate, 60 to 100 fatalities
occurred last year in the United States out of about 100,000
liposuction procedures, a rate doctors term both shocking and
preventable.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gage, a consultant for the Joint Legislative Sunset Review
Committee, which reviews all consumer boards under the Department
of Consumer Affairs, credits the series with helping to fuel
efforts to initiate regulatory improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the state needs to step in and make sure they (the
boards) are doing a better job of protecting the consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert del Junco, head of the cosmetic surgery committee,
says another new liposuction study indicates a fatality rate of 1
in 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is completely unacceptable,'' says del Junco, one of the
most outspoken doctors in the state pushing for legislative
remedies. ``In a cosmetic operation that has no health benefit, the
fact that there is one death is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   A prudent first step, he says, would be mandatory malpractice
insurance for physicians who perform elective cosmetic surgery in
outpatient clinics. Insurance carriers would then require special
training for doctors before they could perform cosmetic surgery, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California you need malpractice insurance to practice in a
hospital setting,'' says del Junco, an ear, nose and throat
specialist practicing near Los Angeles. ``Now we've turned more to
outpatient settings in medicine and the law is inconsistent.
Doctors are not necessarily held to the same insurance standard.
We're saying we at least should require it for cosmetic surgery
(where) doctors have the freedom of going from internal medicine to
cosmetic surgery over a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``For patients, it makes sense to be able to get some form of
economic compensation. It doesn't deny doctors the opportunity to
do a career change, but it says before you can practice on the
public, you have to have training before you can be insured. It
becomes a marketplace issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say that only 1 percent or fewer of the state's
physicians are believed to be practicing without insurance
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Gallegos says he will likely sponsor legislation
to require it for doctors in outpatient surgical centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a patient is harmed, there would be recourse for
compensation,'' Gallegos says.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for the cosmetic surgery committee is false and
misleading advertising.
</P>
<P>
   An October committee report said some ads use different models
for ``before'' and ``after'' photos or use untouched ``befores''
and air-brushed ``afters.'' The report also cited the use of terms
``impossible to support, such as `painless,' `entirely safe,' and
`satisfaction guaranteed.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, consumers seeking cosmetic procedures are increasingly
influenced by these questionable ads ...'' said the report.
``Although it can be argued that current law already prohibits the
very practices the committee would seek to prohibit, the law would
be less problematic to enforce if more defining regulations were
written.''
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation of outpatient surgery centers, where the majority
of cosmetic procedures are performed _ from minor treatments like
collagen injections to major procedures like face lifts _ also
should be reviewed in the coming legislative term, says Julianne
D'Angelo Fellmeth, administrative director of the Center for Public
Interest Law at the University of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The law now requires facilities to be accredited if they use
certain levels of anesthesia, but ``it is not working,'' Fellmeth
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different accrediting agencies apply different criteria to
doctors' settings ... and it's not clear at what point (of
anesthesia) the doctors have to be accredited,'' says Fellmeth.
``Holes need to be filled in. The area of cosmetic surgery seems to
be an area where it is demonstrably not working.''

PHYSICISTS DISCOVER ANOTHER UNIFYING FORCE: DOO-WOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(mk) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The arcane language of physics is not exactly the stuff of song
lyrics, but the Cernettes, billed as the world's first particle
physics rock band, have hit the Internet. Even if nonphysicists
fail to get their musical jokes, the Cernettes count on a growing
audience of admiring scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The Cernettes take their name from CERN, the acronym for
Europe's pre-eminent high-energy particle laboratory straddling the
French-Swiss border near Geneva, with which all the singers are
associated. Membership in the four-woman amateur singing group and
its band changes from year to year, but the Cernettes'
songwriter-lyricist, Silvano De Genarro, constantly provides
material to keep his group up to par at the many physics meetings
and celebrations where they perform.
</P>
<P>
   On the job at CERN, De Genarro, a computer scientist, uses
virtual reality to manipulate the virtual counterparts of
battleship-size particle detectors that must fit into cramped
niches in the laboratory's 17-mile circular accelerator tunnel. But
in his spare time he writes songs of the doo-wop style popular in
the 1950s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average physicist around here was growing up in those
years,'' De Genarro said in an interview, ``and they get a
nostalgic kick out of my tunes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his songs involve the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC,
nearing completion in CERN's circular accelerator tunnel spanning
the border between Switzerland and France near Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a typical verse from De Genarro's lament ``Collider'':
</P>
<P>
   I gave you a golden ring to show you my love,
</P>
<P>
   You went to stick it in a printed circuit
</P>
<P>
   To fix a voltage leak in your collector
</P>
<P>
   You plug my feelings into your detector
</P>
<P>
   You never spend your nights with me
</P>
<P>
   You don't go out with other girls either
</P>
<P>
   You prefer your collider
</P>
<P>
   You only love your collider.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the LHC, which will be a Mecca for American as well
as European high-energy physicists, the Cernettes have renamed
themselves ``Les Horribles Cernettes,'' or LHC for short, and they
have posted some songs on their Web page:
http://sgvenus.cern.ch/musiclub/cernettes.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of computers with sound cards can hear the Cernettes (who
often emulate the Supremes) croon catchy tunes like ``Strong
Interaction'' (``You quark me up, you quark me down, you quark me
top, you quark me bottom''), ``Antiworld,'' ``Surfing on the Web''
and ``Microwave Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its birth in 1954, CERN's achievements have included
monumental discoveries in particle physics, a succession of Nobel
prizes and the construction of a proton collider that may yield
enough energy to discover the elusive Higgs boson _ a theoretical
particle supposedly responsible for endowing all matter with mass _
and a magazine read by physicists around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But for ordinary people, CERN's most memorable achievement was
to invent the World Wide Web as a way to organize and find
information on the Internet. The laboratory originally used its Web
system as a communication network for physicists, but it grew as
the Internet became as universal as the world's postal system. As
the Web outgrew the laboratory, CERN cast off its creation, which
is now administered by others.
</P>
<P>
   De Genarro, an Italian, writes his songs entirely in English
``because English is the universal language of physics.''
</P>
<P>
   But this has created something of a language barrier between the
CERN laboratory and the French and Swiss people outside it. Most of
CERN's neighbors do not understand the jokes in his songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concerts are more popular in France than in Switzerland,''
he said, ``because the Swiss seem to think we're too noisy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cernettes are not the only performers specializing in
physics songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Dr. Lynda Williams _ a former go-go dancer
who teaches physics at San Francisco State University _ has become
a smash hit at physics conferences. Her on-stage gyrations and
clever allusions to physics keep audiences of specialists roaring
with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   One of the theories she tackles is ``supersymmetry.'' Many
physicists believe this theory will eventually unite the realm of
the ultra large (as described by relativity) and the ultra small
(governed by quantum mechanics). The idea is that for every
particle of matter there may be an unseen supersymmetric particle
of some force carrier, and that for every known force carrier
(photons of light, for example) there is an unseen particle of
supersymmetric matter.
</P>
<P>
   Such particles are called ``sparticles,'' ``squarks,'' and so
on. Williams' song, to the tune of George Gershwin's
``S'wonderful,'' pokes fun at the government's cancellation in 1993
of the Superconducting Supercollider (SSC), which would have been
the largest accelerator in the world:
</P>
<P>
   S'quantum dream, squandered it,
</P>
<P>
   Bad publicity.
</P>
<P>
   A'awfully sad, S'could of had
</P>
<P>
   Our own SSC.
</P>
<P>
   But where did the funding go?
</P>
<P>
   Must be hiding with the higgsinos
</P>
<P>
   S'wonderful, s'marvelous
</P>
<P>
   There's still the LHC!

IMPROBABLE LAWYER GEARS UP FOR NEW YORK'S NO. 2 JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With her marriage in disarray and her daughter in
diapers, 33-year-old Mary Kenney rejected her matriarchal mother's
advice and enrolled in law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it would be the biggest mistake I ever made and that
if Sara was able to talk, I'd hear a lot about it from my daughter
as well,'' recalled the native, of Troy, N.Y., who is now Lt.
Gov.-elect Mary Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   Enrolling in Albany Law School in 1980 proved to be a critical
juncture for Donohue, and a springboard into an improbable career
for the bookish, quiet daughter of Thomas and Ruth O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up in a very traditional Irish family,'' Donohue
said.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue's father, ``Whitey O'Connor,'' was a legendary Collar
City lawyer and popular city court judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a brilliant lawyer, a very accomplished, interesting
lawyer who, after he stepped down from the bench, devoted his
professional life to defending poor people,'' said Troy attorney
Thomas J. O'Connor, Donohue's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue's mother was ``an old-fashioned Irish mom, a wonderful
mom'' with deep roots in the hardscrabble, industrial city, she
said. And Mary was the dutiful daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Of going to law school, Donohue said: ``You have to make the
decision that is right for you. It was a very big turning point in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Donohue made a decision that could very well be another
turning point, and may or may not be right for her.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years after attaining what could have been the
pinnacle of a legal career, election to a 14-year term as a state
Supreme Court justice, Donohue quit the judiciary to join Gov.
George Pataki on the campaign trail _ opting to run for a less
prestigious job that historically has been a ticket to oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it could land Donohue in the Executive
Mansion if Pataki leaves to pursue national office. Clearly, the
prospect of becoming chief executive of the nation's third-largest
state does not intimidate Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In deciding whether I would run with the governor for
lieutenant governor, of course I was aware of the potential,''
Donohue said in a recent interview, carefully sidestepping queries
on whether she actually aspires to Pataki's job. ``If that had
given me pause to hesitate, I would have, and I did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said she signed onto the Pataki team because she was
impressed with the governor's accomplishments, in agreement with
his Republican politics, and enchanted by a philosophy she calls
``empowering the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is reflective of both the governor's and my
philosophy, a belief in the individual ... giving the money and the
power back to the individual, to families, so individuals can
prosper, rather than having the bureaucracy and the state enhancing
itself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empowered'' is not a word one would have used to describe Mary
O'Connor until she was in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
   She got a bachelor's degree in English from the College of New
Rochelle, and soon married Troy attorney Tom Kenney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom I knew since we were kids,'' Donohue said. ``Our families,
our mothers, were best friends. He is still my brother Tom's
closest friend, believe it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary began teaching, and eventually picked up a master's degree
at Russell Sage College in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after years and years of trying to have a baby, Tom
and Mary conceived Sara. But their marriage was crumbling, and Mary
_ more to get it out of her system than anything else _ took the
law boards. She scored in the top 2 percent and, despite her
mother's advice, enrolled, often bringing year-old Sara to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in class with people who were able to live and breathe
law school every day, every minute, while I was juggling jobs, baby
and other priorities,'' Donohue said. ``Fortunately, I was able to
juggle things.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the things Donohue juggled was an internship at the U.S.
Attorney's office in Albany, where the region's top federal
prosecutor, David R. Homer, tossed a gnarly medical malpractice
case her way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought she was a very hard worker,'' said Homer, now a U.S.
magistrate. ``I gave her a difficult assignment on a civil case,
and she did an exceptional job.''
</P>
<P>
   In law school, Mary met her next husband, Brian Donohue, now a
lawyer in Troy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first encounter with Mary was at the Supreme Court library
in Troy, where you'd go to study because it was quiet,'' recalled
Brian Donohue. ``The first time she ever said anything to me, she
gave me a dirty look and said, `Please be quiet' _ the first time
of many.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Mary who first asked Brian out on a date. They went
to an Albany County Bar Association function.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school, Donohue took a job with the
Albany law firm of O'Connell &AMP; Aronowitz, where she litigated cases
ranging from Dalkon Shield product liability matters to matrimonial
actions, winning the respect of her colleagues and, just as
importantly, the blessings of her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never angry with my mother about her philosophy (about
attending law school), but I never, never expected with her strong
maternal personality that she would understand,'' Donohue said.
``She said: `You know, you were right. You are doing great and your
daughter is doing great and I really respect you for standing up to
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue left O'Connell &AMP; Aronowitz in 1988, shortly before her
second child, Justin, was born. She was 41, and took a job as an
assistant Rensselaer County attorney, a job that put her in the
political loop. Four years later, Donohue was selected as the
Republican candidate for district attorney, and designated the task
of challenging the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue ran to win, and won, but soon attracted criticism when
her office was forced to plea bargain a gang rape case and had to
settle for a manslaughter conviction when it sought a murder
verdict involving a North Greenbush councilman who killed his wife
with chloroform. One former staffer said Donohue was well out of
her league.
</P>
<P>
   Another, however, said Donohue perhaps made mistakes early on,
but never made the same mistake twice.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Donohue was re-elected in 1995 with a landslide 70
percent of the vote. She was viewed in GOP circles as an
exceptional campaigner, and when party leaders went looking for a
Supreme Court candidate in 1996, they knocked on her door.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue easily outpolled five other candidates, and promptly
settled into a 14-year term in robes _ only to ditch it all two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pataki announced that he was dumping Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross from his re-election ticket, and suggested Donohue
would be a good replacement. In May, he asked Donohue to join the
team, and she agreed, without hesitation or, so far, regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed tremendously being a judge,'' Donohue said in a
measured, prudent tone. ``But there is a component in being asked
to be the running mate of a governor whose philosophy I share, who
had done so much already ... to have the opportunity to work with
him and hopefully use my background as a judge to help him be more
effective as governor, was an opportunity I did not want to say no
to.''

   IRAQ-FOREIGN-JOURNAL _ BAGHDAD _ In good times, Iraqis live
under a restrictive regime and crippling economic sanctions. In bad
times, they have all that and missile attacks, too. Still, they are
hospitable to a visiting American correspondent whose government
has just attacked them with 400 cruise missiles. (Kaplow, Cox News

   GA-SCHOOLS _ATLANTA _ Middle school teachers in Georgia and the
rest of the South are not as prepared as they should be to teach in
those grades, even though many of the educational problems in the
south are most dramatic in the middle grades, according to a
Southern Regional Education Board study. (Cumming, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   OAK _ ATLANTA _ The Great Oak is gone forever, a victim of the
great ice storm power outage that hit central Virginia and
scattered parts of Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi. The famous
white oak tree thought to be as old as Williamsburg itself toppled
and shattered into huge logs and a massive stump. Colonial
Williamsburg plans to memorialize the tree by distributing an
obituary this week. (Konigsmark, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   PBP _ PARTY SWITCH (DEVELOPING) _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
Republicans have been switching parties nationally since the last
national election. The trend happening here in Palm Beach County.
Is it because Republicans are fed up over the Clinton impeachment.
(Moffett, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   PBP _ NO BEGGING (DEVELOPING) _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ No

Beach County. The sign has the county logo and number to call for
the homeless coalition. (Pressly, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   US-LCRA-FLOOD-GAUGE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Flash floods can rip
60-foot trees out of the ground, turn boulders into battering rams
and scrape homes off their foundation _ scattering the devastation
of a tornado over dozens of square miles. And no place in the
United States is more prone to flash floods than the Hill Country
west of Austin. With only hours to warn the growing number of
people living along the rivers and lakes of Central Texas,
including Lake Travis, the LCRA is taking steps to improve its
weather eyes and ears. Beginning in January, the river authority
will begin a $7.2 million program to almost triple the number of
rainfall monitors and flood gauges on rivers and creeks. (Lindell,
Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   w/AUS-GAUGE-SIDE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Before there were river
gauges and technology, the LCRA relied on people to measure
rainfall and telephone in their results. If the weather was
particularly bad, the weather watchers were told to telegraph the
Austin Dam (Tom Miller Dam today). All this for $3.50 a year. Some
families have been doing this since the program began in 1939,
including Bonnie L. Rahe, 72, of Harper, who took over from her
father-in-law in 1974. (Lindell, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TX-MINORITY-ENROLL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ A Texas law touted as a
colorblind way to lure more black and Hispanic students to in-state
colleges produced uneven results at the state's major universities
and did not pack the punch some lawmakers had expected. University
officials said, however, that it's too soon to judge whether Texas'
effort to trump affirmative action in college admissions is
working. A look at what's happening. (Roser, Austin

   GA-PRIVATEPRISON-LAPSES _ ATLANTA _ Little more than a month
after the first private prison opened in Georgia, state inspectors
found security lapses, sloppy record-keeping and dirt during two
inspections of the D. Ray James State Prison, which Cornell
Corrections Inc. operates in Charlton County. According to reports
from state Department of Corrections monitors after inspections at
the Cornell prison on Nov. 18-19 and again on Dec. 9, the private
prison guards were not keeping track of inmates as they moved
around the prison. (Cook, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   FREAKNIK _ ATLANTA _ City police officers made $1 million in
overtime for last April's Black College Spring Break, according to
figures just wrangled out of the city. A committee is to be
appointed by the city in January to prepare for next year's
Freaknik, April 16-18. Will check to see if Daytona Beach's
decade-old competing Freaknik will lure away some of the black
college students who used to come to Atlanta. Daytona's event was
marred by the shooting death of a student this year.

   Be patient, children. Another few days and we bet your parents
will have your ``Some Assembly Required'' Christmas toys put
together.
</P>
<P>
   Another way we'll know we've got a serious Y2K problem is if, in
2000, William McKinley gets elected president.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if most senators want a speedy impeachment trial.
For one thing, they want to get right back to avoiding the real
issues.
</P>
<P>
   A ``speedy'' Senate trial could mean one that ends by spring.
Senate work has the same relation to speed that most diets have to
losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   Over the Christmas break, Mr. Clinton saw the play ``Twelfth
Night.'' No, it was the Shakespeare production, not a re-enactment
of his twelfth tryst with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   For his planned presidential library in Arkansas, Mr. Clinton
needs to raise about $45 million, it's reported. If his past
girlfriends give just $100 each, it should be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The president wants Congress to pass tougher drunken-driving
laws. Maybe some drunken-legislating laws would help, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security system is so ready for the Y2K computer bug
that no payment will be delayed ``by a single day,'' Mr. Clinton
says. Makes us wonder if there's such a thing as a married day.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has thanked Fidel Castro for allowing Cubans
to celebrate Christmas. In return, will Vatican residents get to
celebrate the July 26 anniversary of the Cuban revolution?
</P>
<P>
   Love letters between Queen Victoria and her servant John Brown
have been found in an attic in Scotland, it's reported. Impeach
her, we say.

   The violent crime rate has dropped to its lowest level in 25

movies watching violent crimes?

   This ice storm is all over the country. In Washington, it was so
cold today Ken Starr had to scrape the ice off people's bedroom
windows to look inside.

   Here's some good White House gossip. It seems President Clinton
and Hillary have cancelled their annual family vacation to the
Virgin Islands this year. I wonder what happened?
</P>
<P>
   The American Association for Nude Recreation has come out with a
list of the most popular recreation activities to do whole nude.
Let me tell you something. If you can't figure out what to do for
fun while naked, you don't deserve to be naked in the first place.

   ``Earlier today, President Clinton read Christmas stories to a
bunch of kids at the White House. At one point the president asked
a boy if he's been good this year and the boy said, 'Well, put it
this way, I didn't perjure myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Hastert, the Republicans' next choice for Speaker of
the House, came from a small town in Illinois and was once a high
school wrestling coach. When asked to comment about this Hastert
said, 'I resign.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new study shows that primetime TV under represents women and
senior citizens. Network executives said they'll hire more women
and seniors as soon as granny gets implants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the White House last night, President Clinton read the
story 'A Visit From St. Nick.' The weird part is, in the
President's version it's a conjugal visit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christmas Ally McBeal has her own line of pajamas and
retailers say they're selling like hotcakes. Actually they're
selling more like low-fat rice cakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Germany accused members of the Three Tenors of tax
evasion. Apparently, they feel that Luciano Pavarotti should claim
Pizza Hut as a second home.''

   After about 15 minutes of snaking their way along, Mildred Mauer
and other would-be viewers hadn't yet reached the Van Gogh exhibit
at the National Gallery in Washington. An exasperated mother in
front of Mildred addressed her perhaps 8-year-old son. ``We're not
even in yet,'' she said. ``What do you mean you're bored?''

   Lucille Waldman was busy navigating the holiday crowds on
Madison Avenue in the vicinity of F.A.O. Schwarz. As she waited for
the light to change, she didn't know whether to be pleased to be a
native New Yorker, or whether she was fair game. An intrepid dog
walker was admonishing his dog: ``And don't bite any tourists!''

   Walking on the Upper West Side, I saw this tiny lady _ an old
70, I'd guess _ in this incredible dress. It was cotton pique with
large flowers on it in a wonderful range of colors _ and each
covered button was a different color.
</P>
<P>
   I said to her, ``Great dress,'' and she said, ``Thank you.''
Then she came close to me and said: ``A Saks Fifth Avenue dress _ I
got it for $3. At my age, I need to economize. I bought it at a
thrift store. I'm not long for this world.'' She pointed to a woman
wearing a very tight, stretchy dress with a visible panty line
clinging to an enormous behind. ``When I see a dress like that, it
hastens my end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I asked her how she found her great dress. ``People ask me for
advice all the time, but I need to keep it to myself,'' she said,
making her hands into fists and placing them on her heart. ``I need
it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A young man walked by, and she pointed him out to me. ``He held
open the door for me in my building once. I remember people who are
kind to me.'' She then continued as if we had known each other a
long time. ``I can feel my end coming. I'm not myself. I ran into a
friend at the laundromat recently and she said, `Lil, what's
wrong?' I know I don't look like myself. I've been around here long
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   I told her I hoped not, because we needed her to wear great
dresses in New York. She said, ``Thank you for your compliment.'' I
wished her the best of luck, and we parted ways.

   Chris Boneau was showing Texas relatives the town. When he got
out of a cab with them, he realized he had left behind the
expensive camera he had bought in Tokyo. The cab had driven off,
and he had no receipt.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, he was in his apartment bemoaning his loss
when his friend Benedicta Pollock walked in and announced excitedly
that she had taken a cab and found this terrific camera in the back
seat. ``That's my camera!'' Chris cried as he tore it from her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that remains is to see if his relatives' images are on
the film when it's developed. If not, he said, the camera goes to
the Taxi and Limousine Commission. But in his own mind, he's
certain the pictures will be there and the camera is his. His
relatives believe that these things happen all the time in New
York, but he knows, he said, that ``this is, after all, the season
of miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman pointed to a display of stamps in the post office and
asked the provenance of one particular stamp. ``It's the new
Hanukkah stamp,'' the clerk said. The woman was incredulous. ``They
already have a stamp for Monica?'' she asked. As Arnold Aaron
reported, ``For several laugh-filled minutes, the mail did not go
through.''
</P>
<P>
   A man I know recently found himself doing some lunch-hour
holiday shopping at the Victoria's Secret at South Street Seaport.
His rather conservative selections were carefully packed and placed
in a large shopping bag. To his dismay, the bag was quite the
opposite of the proverbial plain brown bag _ it was brightly
colored, with Victoria's Secret emblazoned across the side. He
shuddered at the idea of returning to the office with it, but was
informed that it was the only style of bag the store carried.
</P>
<P>
   As he emerged, imagining the snickers and titters as he walked
down the long hall to his office, past secretary after secretary,
he noticed a Foot Locker store next door. Inspired, he walked in
and approached a saleswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' he began, ``would you by any chance have ...''
``You want a bag,'' she interrupted, laughing, looking at the
Victoria's Secret bag. ``Exactly,'' he responded, with surprise and
relief. As he thanked her for the bag and turned to leave, she
shook her head and asked, ``Why is it that every guy walks out of
Victoria's Secret and comes in here asking for a Foot Locker bag?''

   Mark Blackman was at the counter of a Greek coffee shop when a
woman beside him began to lose patience with her tired, unruly
child. ``Jason, try to behave,'' she said. ``Remember, Santa is
right now working on his list of who's naughty and who's nice, and
he's going to release it very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greek waiter behind the counter shook his finger amiably.
``And Ken Starr is going to subpoena it,'' he said.

   A father said, `Son, the object of dating is to SCORE! And to do
that, you have to give the woman something. So when you pick up
your date later, make sure you have some flowers or chocolates to
give her. Girls go crazy over that stuff. The more you give, the
more you get!`
</P>
<P>
   So, he showed up with flowers AND chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   She was very flattered and pleased, and she rewarded him with a
long,
</P>
<P>
   passionate kiss.
</P>
<P>
   After the kiss, he turned and bolted for the door.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh! I'm sorry,` she said. `I didn't mean to scare you away.`

orthodox rabbi for their final session. The rabbi asks if they have
any final questions.
</P>
<P>
   The man asks, `Is it true that men and women don't dance
together?`
</P>
<P>
   Yes,` says the rabbi, `for modesty reasons, men and women dance
separately.`
</P>
<P>
   `So I can't dance with my own wife?`
</P>
<P>
   `No.`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, okay,` says the man, `but what about sex?`
</P>
<P>
   `Fine,` says the rabbi. `A mitzvah within the marriage!`
</P>
<P>
   `What about different positions?` the man asks.
</P>
<P>
   `No problem,` says the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   `Well, what about standing up?`
</P>
<P>
   `NO!` says the rabbi, `It could lead to dancing!`

   A woman takes her 16-year-old daughter to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The mother says, `It's my daughter Darla, she keeps getting
these cravings, she's putting on weight and is sick most mornings.`
</P>
<P>
   The doctor gives Darla a good examination then turns to the
mother and says, `Well,I don't know how to tell you this but your
Darla is pregnant - about 4 months would be my guess.`
</P>
<P>
   The mother says, `Pregnant?! She can't be, she has never ever
been left alone with a man! Have you Darla?`
</P>
<P>
   Darla says, `No mother! I've never even kissed a man!`
</P>
<P>
   The doctor walked over to the window and just stares out it.
About five minutes pass and finally the mother says, `Is there
something wrong out there doctor?`
</P>
<P>
   The doctor replies, `No, not really, it's just that the last
time anything like this happened, a star appeared in the east and
three wise men came over the hill. I'll be darned if I'm going to
miss it this time!`
</P>

   &UR; A PUN LIVES IN RUSSIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Russian couple were walking down the street in Moscow one
night, when the man felt a drop hit his nose. `I think it's
raining,` he said to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   `No, that felt more like snow to me,` she replied.
</P>
<P>
   `No, I'm sure it was just rain,` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, as these things go, they were about to have a major
argument about whether it was raining or snowing.
</P>
<P>
   Just then they saw a minor communist party official walking
toward them.
</P>
<P>
   `Let's not fight about it,` the man said, `Let's ask Comrade
Rudolph whether t's officially raining or snowing.`
</P>
<P>
   As the official approached, the man said, `Tell us, Comrade
Rudolph, is it officially raining or snowing?`
</P>
<P>
   `It's raining, of course,` he replied, and walked on.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman insisted, `I know that felt like snow!`
</P>
<P>
   To which the man quietly replied, `Rudolph the Red knows rain,
dear.''

   Be patient, children. Another few days and we bet your parents
will have your ``Some Assembly Required'' Christmas toys put
together.
</P>
<P>
   Another way we'll know we've got a serious Y2K problem is if, in
2000, William McKinley gets elected president.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if most senators want a speedy impeachment trial.
For one thing, they want to get right back to avoiding the real
issues.
</P>
<P>
   A ``speedy'' Senate trial could mean one that ends by spring.
Senate work has the same relation to speed that most diets have to
losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   Over the Christmas break, Mr. Clinton saw the play ``Twelfth
Night.'' No, it was the Shakespeare production, not a re-enactment
of his twelfth tryst with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   For his planned presidential library in Arkansas, Mr. Clinton
needs to raise about $45 million, it's reported. If his past
girlfriends give just $100 each, it should be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The president wants Congress to pass tougher drunken-driving
laws. Maybe some drunken-legislating laws would help, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security system is so ready for the Y2K computer bug
that no payment will be delayed ``by a single day,'' Mr. Clinton
says. Makes us wonder if there's such a thing as a married day.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has thanked Fidel Castro for allowing Cubans
to celebrate Christmas. In return, will Vatican residents get to
celebrate the July 26 anniversary of the Cuban revolution?
</P>
<P>
   Love letters between Queen Victoria and her servant John Brown
have been found in an attic in Scotland, it's reported. Impeach
her, we say.
</P>
<P>
   The violent crime rate has dropped to its lowest level in 25
years. Are all the violent criminals in front of the TV or at the
movies watching violent crimes?

   This ice storm is all over the country. In Washington, it was so
cold today Ken Starr had to scrape the ice off people's bedroom
windows to look inside.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some good White House gossip. It seems President Clinton
and Hillary have cancelled their annual family vacation to the
Virgin Islands this year. I wonder what happened?
</P>
<P>
   The American Association for Nude Recreation has come out with a
list of the most popular recreation activities to do whole nude.
Let me tell you something. If you can't figure out what to do for
fun while naked, you don't deserve to be naked in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier today, President Clinton read Christmas stories to a
bunch of kids at the White House. At one point the president asked
a boy if he's been good this year and the boy said, 'Well, put it
this way, I didn't perjure myself.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis Hastert, the Republicans' next choice for Speaker of
the House, came from a small town in Illinois and was once a high
school wrestling coach. When asked to comment about this Hastert
said, 'I resign.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new study shows that primetime TV under represents women and
senior citizens. Network executives said they'll hire more women
and seniors as soon as granny gets implants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the White House last night, President Clinton read the
story 'A Visit From St. Nick.' The weird part is, in the
President's version it's a conjugal visit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christmas Ally McBeal has her own line of pajamas and
retailers say they're selling like hotcakes. Actually they're
selling more like low-fat rice cakes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Germany accused members of the Three Tenors of tax
evasion. Apparently, they feel that Luciano Pavarotti should claim
Pizza Hut as a second home.''

   After about 15 minutes of snaking their way along, Mildred Mauer
and other would-be viewers hadn't yet reached the Van Gogh exhibit
at the National Gallery in Washington. An exasperated mother in
front of Mildred addressed her perhaps 8-year-old son. ``We're not
even in yet,'' she said. ``What do you mean you're bored?''

   Lucille Waldman was busy navigating the holiday crowds on
Madison Avenue in the vicinity of F.A.O. Schwarz. As she waited for
the light to change, she didn't know whether to be pleased to be a
native New Yorker, or whether she was fair game. An intrepid dog
walker was admonishing his dog: ``And don't bite any tourists!''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Walking on the Upper West Side, I saw this tiny lady _ an old
70, I'd guess _ in this incredible dress. It was cotton pique with
large flowers on it in a wonderful range of colors _ and each
covered button was a different color.
</P>
<P>
   I said to her, ``Great dress,'' and she said, ``Thank you.''
Then she came close to me and said: ``A Saks Fifth Avenue dress _ I
got it for $3. At my age, I need to economize. I bought it at a
thrift store. I'm not long for this world.'' She pointed to a woman
wearing a very tight, stretchy dress with a visible panty line
clinging to an enormous behind. ``When I see a dress like that, it
hastens my end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I asked her how she found her great dress. ``People ask me for
advice all the time, but I need to keep it to myself,'' she said,
making her hands into fists and placing them on her heart. ``I need
it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A young man walked by, and she pointed him out to me. ``He held
open the door for me in my building once. I remember people who are
kind to me.'' She then continued as if we had known each other a
long time. ``I can feel my end coming. I'm not myself. I ran into a
friend at the laundromat recently and she said, `Lil, what's
wrong?' I know I don't look like myself. I've been around here long
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   I told her I hoped not, because we needed her to wear great
dresses in New York. She said, ``Thank you for your compliment.'' I
wished her the best of luck, and we parted ways.

   Chris Boneau was showing Texas relatives the town. When he got
out of a cab with them, he realized he had left behind the
expensive camera he had bought in Tokyo. The cab had driven off,
and he had no receipt.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, he was in his apartment bemoaning his loss
when his friend Benedicta Pollock walked in and announced excitedly
that she had taken a cab and found this terrific camera in the back
seat. ``That's my camera!'' Chris cried as he tore it from her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that remains is to see if his relatives' images are on
the film when it's developed. If not, he said, the camera goes to
the Taxi and Limousine Commission. But in his own mind, he's
certain the pictures will be there and the camera is his. His
relatives believe that these things happen all the time in New
York, but he knows, he said, that ``this is, after all, the season
of miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman pointed to a display of stamps in the post office and
asked the provenance of one particular stamp. ``It's the new
Hanukkah stamp,'' the clerk said. The woman was incredulous. ``They
already have a stamp for Monica?'' she asked. As Arnold Aaron
reported, ``For several laugh-filled minutes, the mail did not go
through.''
</P>
<P>
   A man I know recently found himself doing some lunch-hour
holiday shopping at the Victoria's Secret at South Street Seaport.
His rather conservative selections were carefully packed and placed
in a large shopping bag. To his dismay, the bag was quite the
opposite of the proverbial plain brown bag _ it was brightly
colored, with Victoria's Secret emblazoned across the side. He
shuddered at the idea of returning to the office with it, but was
informed that it was the only style of bag the store carried.
</P>
<P>
   As he emerged, imagining the snickers and titters as he walked
down the long hall to his office, past secretary after secretary,
he noticed a Foot Locker store next door. Inspired, he walked in
and approached a saleswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' he began, ``would you by any chance have ...''
``You want a bag,'' she interrupted, laughing, looking at the
Victoria's Secret bag. ``Exactly,'' he responded, with surprise and
relief. As he thanked her for the bag and turned to leave, she
shook her head and asked, ``Why is it that every guy walks out of
Victoria's Secret and comes in here asking for a Foot Locker bag?''

   Mark Blackman was at the counter of a Greek coffee shop when a
woman beside him began to lose patience with her tired, unruly
child. ``Jason, try to behave,'' she said. ``Remember, Santa is
right now working on his list of who's naughty and who's nice, and
he's going to release it very soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greek waiter behind the counter shook his finger amiably.
``And Ken Starr is going to subpoena it,'' he said.

   A father said, `Son, the object of dating is to SCORE! And to do
that, you have to give the woman something. So when you pick up
your date later, make sure you have some flowers or chocolates to
give her. Girls go crazy over that stuff. The more you give, the
more you get!`
</P>
<P>
   So, he showed up with flowers AND chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   She was very flattered and pleased, and she rewarded him with a
long,
</P>
<P>
   passionate kiss.
</P>
<P>
   After the kiss, he turned and bolted for the door.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh! I'm sorry,` she said. `I didn't mean to scare you away.`
</P>
<P>
   `You didn't!` he replied. `I'm going out to get you some
jewelry!`

   Walking on the Upper West Side, I saw this tiny lady _ an old

large flowers on it in a wonderful range of colors _ and each
covered button was a different color.
</P>
<P>
   I said to her, ``Great dress,'' and she said, ``Thank you.''
Then she came close to me and said: ``A Saks Fifth Avenue dress _ I
got it for $3. At my age, I need to economize. I bought it at a
thrift store. I'm not long for this world.'' She pointed to a woman
wearing a very tight, stretchy dress with a visible panty line
clinging to an enormous behind. ``When I see a dress like that, it
hastens my end,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I asked her how she found her great dress. ``People ask me for
advice all the time, but I need to keep it to myself,'' she said,
making her hands into fists and placing them on her heart. ``I need
it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   A young man walked by, and she pointed him out to me. ``He held
open the door for me in my building once. I remember people who are
kind to me.'' She then continued as if we had known each other a

   Chris Boneau was showing Texas relatives the town. When he got
out of a cab with them, he realized he had left behind the
expensive camera he had bought in Tokyo. The cab had driven off,
and he had no receipt.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, he was in his apartment bemoaning his loss
when his friend Benedicta Pollock walked in and announced excitedly
that she had taken a cab and found this terrific camera in the back
seat. ``That's my camera!'' Chris cried as he tore it from her
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that remains is to see if his relatives' images are on
the film when it's developed. If not, he said, the camera goes to
the Taxi and Limousine Commission. But in his own mind, he's
certain the pictures will be there and the camera is his. His
relatives believe that these things happen all the time in New

   A man I know recently found himself doing some lunch-hour
holiday shopping at the Victoria's Secret at South Street Seaport.
His rather conservative selections were carefully packed and placed
in a large shopping bag. To his dismay, the bag was quite the
opposite of the proverbial plain brown bag _ it was brightly
colored, with Victoria's Secret emblazoned across the side. He
shuddered at the idea of returning to the office with it, but was
informed that it was the only style of bag the store carried.
</P>
<P>
   As he emerged, imagining the snickers and titters as he walked
down the long hall to his office, past secretary after secretary,
he noticed a Foot Locker store next door. Inspired, he walked in
and approached a saleswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' he began, ``would you by any chance have ...''
``You want a bag,'' she interrupted, laughing, looking at the
Victoria's Secret bag. ``Exactly,'' he responded, with surprise and
relief. As he thanked her for the bag and turned to leave, she
shook her head and asked, ``Why is it that every guy walks out of

<P>
   The man asks, `Is it true that men and women don't dance
together?`
</P>
<P>
   Yes,` says the rabbi, `for modesty reasons, men and women dance
separately.`
</P>
<P>
   `So I can't dance with my own wife?`
</P>
<P>
   `No.`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, okay,` says the man, `but what about sex?`
</P>
<P>
   `Fine,` says the rabbi. `A mitzvah within the marriage!`
</P>
<P>
   `What about different positions?` the man asks.
</P>
<P>
   `No problem,` says the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   `Well, what about standing up?`

<P>

<P>
   Darla says, `No mother! I've never even kissed a man!`

   The doctor walked over to the window and just stares out it.
About five minutes pass and finally the mother says, `Is there
something wrong out there doctor?`

<P>
   `No, that felt more like snow to me,` she replied.
</P>
<P>
   `No, I'm sure it was just rain,` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, as these things go, they were about to have a major
argument about whether it was raining or snowing.
</P>
<P>
   Just then they saw a minor communist party official walking
toward them.
</P>
<P>
   `Let's not fight about it,` the man said, `Let's ask Comrade
Rudolph whether t's officially raining or snowing.`

   As the official approached, the man said, `Tell us, Comrade
Rudolph, is it officially raining or snowing?`

   `It's raining, of course,` he replied, and walked on.

<P>
   But the woman insisted, `I know that felt like snow!`

   A father said, `Son, the object of dating is to SCORE! And to do

   So, he showed up with flowers AND chocolates.

<P>
   She was very flattered and pleased, and she rewarded him with a

<P>
   A couple preparing for a religious conversion meets with the
orthodox rabbi for their final session. The rabbi asks if they have
any final questions.
</P>
<P>
   The man asks, `Is it true that men and women don't dance
together?`
</P>
<P>
   Yes,` says the rabbi, `for modesty reasons, men and women dance
separately.`
</P>
<P>
   `So I can't dance with my own wife?`
</P>
<P>
   `No.`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, okay,` says the man, `but what about sex?`
</P>
<P>
   `Fine,` says the rabbi. `A mitzvah within the marriage!`
</P>
<P>
   `What about different positions?` the man asks.
</P>
<P>
   `No problem,` says the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   `Well, what about standing up?`
</P>
<P>
   `NO!` says the rabbi, `It could lead to dancing!`

<P>
   The mother says, `It's my daughter Darla, she keeps getting
these cravings, she's putting on weight and is sick most mornings.`
</P>
<P>
   The doctor gives Darla a good examination then turns to the
mother and says, `Well,I don't know how to tell you this but your
Darla is pregnant - about 4 months would be my guess.`
</P>
<P>
   The mother says, `Pregnant?! She can't be, she has never ever
been left alone with a man! Have you Darla?`
</P>
<P>
   Darla says, `No mother! I've never even kissed a man!`
</P>
<P>
   The doctor walked over to the window and just stares out it.
About five minutes pass and finally the mother says, `Is there
something wrong out there doctor?`
</P>
<P>
   The doctor replies, `No, not really, it's just that the last
time anything like this happened, a star appeared in the east and

</P>
<P>
   `No, that felt more like snow to me,` she replied.
</P>
<P>
   `No, I'm sure it was just rain,` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, as these things go, they were about to have a major
argument about whether it was raining or snowing.
</P>
<P>
   Just then they saw a minor communist party official walking
toward them.
</P>
<P>
   `Let's not fight about it,` the man said, `Let's ask Comrade
Rudolph whether t's officially raining or snowing.`
</P>
<P>
   As the official approached, the man said, `Tell us, Comrade
Rudolph, is it officially raining or snowing?`
</P>
<P>
   `It's raining, of course,` he replied, and walked on.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman insisted, `I know that felt like snow!`
</P>
<P>
   To which the man quietly replied, `Rudolph the Red knows rain,

   WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. _ The darkling countryside was
eerie and foreboding as it spread before travelers taking a
six-hour train trip from Washington into the chilly, snow-covered
mountains of West Virginia at Christmas time.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of miles of neat, well-kept houses were deserted,
lifeless _ no children played in the yards, no illumination framed
bleak windows, no holiday decorations twinkled with colored lights,
no welcoming smoke rose from chimneys, no cars moved on the roads.
A winter ice storm had downed electric lines and wiped out power to
nearly 300,000 homes, where occupants fled the unpleasant
consequences of several cold days unable to cook, light rooms, use
hot water, heat their homes or generally function normally.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, the nation was awash in grim predictions of a
similar gray and silent landscape on the fringes of an atomic-blast
epicenter, a nuclear winter produced by widespread radioactive
fallout. At the peak of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, the
prime target was expected to be the nation's capital, turning our
historic seat of government to rubble and making neighboring
regions uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   A relatively minor nuclear threat still exists today, but few
people worry about it beyond those officials whose duty it is to
anticipate dire possibilities. One place, however, where it is
still taken seriously is the Greenbrier here in the West Virginia
mountains, a fabulous world-class resort.
</P>
<P>
   But the Greenbrier isn't frightened. It is making money off
public curiosity, charging its guests to view a massive concrete
tribute to the folly of bureaucratic efforts to imagine the
unimaginable. Since the once-secret structure's 1995 opening,
85,000 people have had a look.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the Greenbrier in the late 1950s the federal
government built an enormous bomb-proof bunker meant to house
members of Congress, favored staffers and perhaps the vice
president, while the rest of us were being incinerated. There are
other such bunkers near Washington for the president, the judiciary
and other government officials _ elaborately protected sites whose
existence has never been fully acknowledged and whose current
status is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Only once, as President John Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev engaged in a test of wills during the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis, did the hidden bomb shelters came close to actually being
readied for immediate use. I know this to be true: I was the Hearst
White House correspondent at the time and was told how I would be
alerted to join an exodus to one of the bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenbrier hideaway has been fully deactivated and restored
to its full 1950s glory. The Dwight Eisenhower administration went
to a lot of trouble and taxpayer expense to develop it. As a stolid
military-style structure, it is impressive. As a practical way for
more than 1,000 of the governing elite to escape nuclear disaster,
it is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption was that Washington would have plenty of advance
warning of any pending Soviet nuclear strike: The Kremlin leader
was supposed to call the president and announce, ``Ike, my friend,
we bomb in 26 hours. Empty your buildings. Best wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   If the strike were a surprise, nobody in the city would be left
to escape into the mountains, or have the means to do so. At the
airport, the planes would be cinders. The roads would be
impassable, the cars nonexistent or malfunctioning. It's too far to
walk. The mountain air at the Greenbrier might be uncontaminated,
but you still had to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Those to be saved were supposed to be easily rounded up rather
than out of touch at a movie. It was assumed they could manage
through traffic jams to reach a Washington airport where planes
would be available and ready to fly.
</P>
<P>
   And they would have been ordered to leave their families behind.
Imagine any decent father or mother doing that!
</P>
<P>
   Once at the Greenbrier bunker, lawmakers, with all those
inflated congressional egos, were supposed to take their marching
orders from minor civil defense bureaucrats they considered beneath
them in normal life. The legislators were supposed to sleep en
masse in prison-style tin bunkbeds, lined up not by seniority but
by bureaucratic whim. Imagine Sens. Jesse Helms and Paul Wellstone
stretched out side-by-side! Would they punch each other out in
their sleep?
</P>
<P>
   A section was set up for radio communication to whatever was
left of the outside world. A government in exile is no good if no
one knows it exists. But who would be out there to receive a
message?
</P>
<P>
   And how could power lines that break in a cold snap possibly
survive the heat of a nuclear blast, even on the periphery?
</P>
<P>
   The bunker had a self-contained power plant, a 60-day stockpile
of packaged food, a kitchen and dining room, hospital,
message-processing facilities, waste-disposal system, briefing
rooms and a dental operating room. But its functioning was
dependent on a lack of interference from outside conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively comfortable motel-style rooms were meant to
accommodate the Senate majority leader and House speaker, but
there's nothing but the crowded bunk room for the leaders of the
congressional minority or the committee chairs. Bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   There is no prison, but in recognition that these intimate
arrangements might drive some people mad, a supply of straitjackets
was on hand. But who would bell those particular cranky cats?
</P>
<P>
   In those days of Cold War doomsday terror, this unworkable
project was called ``continuity of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Greenbrier wants to turn the exposed bunker into a
peacetime amusement _ a gambling casino. It would be a fitting
adaptation for an installation grounded in fantasy.

THE YEN GOES OUT OF CANADIAN TOURISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The cartoon colors that Japanese tourists seem to
favor in ski suits _ orange, pink and shiny silver _ may not be
missed on Canadian ski slopes this winter, but the extravagant
spending habits that Japanese tourists used to bring with them
certainly will be.
</P>
<P>
   Since the spread of Asian economic flu through Japan and other
Pacific countries over the past year, Canadian tourism has been hit
hard. By October the number of Asian tourists had dropped by 19.7
percent across Canada. And except for unusual attractions like the
aurora borealis and the house on Prince Edward Island that was the
inspiration for ``Anne of Green Gables,'' Canadian tourism
destinations have lost some of their biggest spenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have traditionally been very generous visitors,'' Rod
Harris, the president of Tourism British Columbia, said of Japanese
tourists. ``It's a source of great concern.''
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia has done slightly better than the rest of
Canada in luring Asian tourists despite the economic slowdown that
has crippled the economies of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. So far
this year, Asian visits to British Columbia are down 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Asian tourists often stop in Vancouver or Victoria, two major
West Coast cities with large Asian populations. Harris said that
while fewer Asian visitors are taking extravagant cross-country
tours, many continue to make the trip to the nearest destination in
Canada, which is British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Since Asian visitors make up 33 percent of overseas visitors to
Canada who stay for at least a night, the decline represents a loss
of about $78 million in the first six months of this year alone,
according to the Canadian Tourism Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest drops are in the number of visitors from South
Korea, down almost 60 percent, and mainland China, off almost 25
percent. The decline in Japanese tourists is less steep, 16
percent, but it hurts more because Japanese are the largest single
group of Asian visitors to Canada and the ones who spend the most
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely having an impact,'' said John Olsthoorn, a
spokesman for the Canadian Tourism Commission. ``Fortunately, the
increase in American tourists has helped buffer the drop.''
</P>
<P>
   A significant weakening of the Canadian dollar this year has
made traveling north a bargain for Americans, who can expect an
exchange rate of from $1.45 to $1.50 Canadian for every American
dollar. American overnight visits to Canada in the first 10 months
of 1998 totaled 13.3 million, a 10.6 percent increase over the same
period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has more than compensated for the erosion in visitors
from the Asia-Pacific region,'' said Harris. He said that Americans
from border states who hop in their cars and drive to Vancouver or
the ski slopes at Whistler, British Columbia, do not spend as much
as the rich Japanese tourists, but there are many more of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absolute size of the U.S. market is far larger than any
other of our other international markets,'' he said, ``so when the
number of U.S. tourists grows, even though some of it is short-haul
visits, the overall effect is very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian visitors to some specialized Canadian sights are driven by
dreams and will come despite economic conditions. Kathie Adam,
general manager of the Northern Frontier Visitors' Association, a
government tourism office in Yellowknife, in the Northwest
Territories, said she hasn't noticed any decline in the number of
Asian tourists planning to come to see the aurora borealis.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most specialized Canadian destination for Asian
tourists is Prince Edward Island, the home of Lucy Maud Montgomery,
author of ``Anne of Green Gables.'' For more than a decade,
Japanese girls have been fascinated by the freckle-faced Anne, and
a visit to the house in Cavendish that inspired the book has become
a once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is a niche market for people who really have
an interest in Anne,'' said Bob Brammer, owner of Prince Edward
Tours, an agency that specializes in Japanese tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Brammer said his agency has handled about 5,000 tourists in the
last 12 months, a decline of only 3 to 5 percent, despite current
economic conditions. ``I had one lady who said she had been saving
for close to 10 years,'' he said. ``For many, it's a lifelong
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Brammer said Japanese tourists used to want to see all of
Canada, starting with British Columbia and working east to Banff
National Park, Toronto, Niagara Falls and the city of Quebec before
arriving at Prince Edward Island. ``Now they land in Atlantic
Canada or the United States before heading here,'' he said. ``It's
cheaper.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Faraway in the cosmos, where everything is separated by
distances measured in hundreds and billions of light-years,
sometimes a galaxy or cluster of galaxies in the foreground
intersects the light from an even more distant object. The
conjunction plays visual tricks, producing mirages that are
becoming a practical tool of astronomy, a kind of natural
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by more sensitive cameras and advanced computer
technologies, systematic searches of the heavens are yielding an
increasing number of examples of such celestial phenomena, known as
gravitational lenses. Scientists are learning to interpret these
distorting and magnifying lensing events for revealing clues in the
most intractable mysteries of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lensing is a really explosive area of observations,'' said Dr.
Christopher Impey, an astronomer at the University of Arizona
Steward Observatory. ``For decades the theory sat there, but no one
could observe lensing. Now we can see the universe as one big
optics experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The new observations are proving Albert Einstein right, as
usual. In 1916, he predicted in his general theory of relativity
that the gravitational field of any mass bends light. Two decades
later, he proposed that a massive object could thus act as a lens,
bending and distorting radiations from a more distant object so
that it would appear as a ring or arc of light.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein doubted that telescopes would ever be able to detect
such faint and rare events, but now looking through gravitational
lenses, astronomers are exploring a wide range of problems in
cosmology. They are making new measurements of the age of the
universe, looking for planets and other unseen objects, and
investigating the structure and nature of quasars, some of the most
distant and enigmatic objects in the distant reaches of the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   Of surpassing importance, lensing observations are being used to
weigh the universe. According to the standard theory of big-bang
cosmology, luminous matter of stars probably contributes less than
1 percent of the cosmic mass, and all ordinary matter, seen and
unseen, accounts for no more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With lensing, astronomers are beginning to find and map the
distribution of some of the missing mass _ the unknown and
invisible dark matter that shapes the universe and probably
controls its ultimate fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time we now have a window on the universe that's
not biased to radiation,'' said Dr. Anthony Tyson, an astronomer at
Bell Labs of Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill, N.J., who is one
of the most experienced observers of gravitational lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, he explained, astronomers looked for evidence of dark
matter only through its gravitational influence on bright galaxies.
This is like searching for lost keys only under a lamppost, blind
to what might lie in the darkness beyond. What if much of the
missing mass inhabits the dark intergalactic voids?
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and colleagues have developed increasingly effective
techniques for lensing observations to ``see'' dark matter in
clusters of galaxies. Future surveys beyond the galactic lampposts,
they say, will demand exceedingly long periods of observations
requiring the services of a large, new ``dark-matter telescope''
devoted exclusively to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the mass density of the universe, in both ordinary and
dark matter, is a critical issue in cosmology. A lightweight
universe, which is indicated by other evidence, would force
theorists to rethink all their models based on reasoned assumptions
that the universe is delicately balanced between eventual collapse
and infinite expansion.
</P>
<P>
   They have already started. Cosmologists now postulate the
existence of a pervasive ``dark energy,'' which might make up for
any deficiency in cosmic mass and also could explain the stunning
discovery, reported earlier this year, that the universe's
expansion appears to be speeding up, not slowing down as had been
thought. If they still cannot somehow balance the books on cosmic
mass, theorists may have to turn the page to a revised theory.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dennis Walsh of the Jodrell Bank Observatory in England and
colleagues saw the first gravitational lens in 1979. They noticed
two starlike objects where their radio observations indicated there
should be only one. Further study revealed that these were not
separate objects but rather that the light from a distant quasar
was split in two by the gravity of a giant galaxy halfway between
the quasar and Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, astronomers have discovered a few dozen other lensed
quasars. But with the development of charge-coupled devices, highly
sensitive electronic instruments that have replaced photographic
plates in astronomy, lensing observations are no longer restricted
to powerful quasars. Lesser radiations from galaxies and even
single stars can also be seen through gravitational lenses.
</P>
<P>
   It is the light from these fainter objects, in particular small
blue galaxies that seem to predominate in the great depths of space
and time that form the backdrop for Tyson's work. When Tyson saw
the first of billions of these previously undetected faint blue
galaxies toward the limits of the observable universe, he
recognized this as a breakthrough in his dark-matter search.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Tyson's group began to collect and analyze lensed
images of these galaxies, reasoning that they would shed light, so
to speak, on the distribution of dark matter in the present
universe. Assisted by new computer software, astronomers saw in the
distorted light evidence of clumps of dark matter not only in the
lensing galaxy clusters but well beyond their glowing structure.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers realized that in looking for mass only in luminous
regions, they might be missing plenty of mass where there is no
light at all, and here was an effective way of mapping the wider
distribution of dark matter.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged, Tyson and an associate, Dr. Gary Bernstein, now at
the University of Michigan, developed a large-format camera with a
mosaic of charge-coupled devices. Mounted on a large telescope at
the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in Chile, the new camera
can take single exposures spanning { degree of sky, an area larger
than the full moon. The camera has enabled astronomers to survey
more of the sky faster and with greater sensitivity in mapping
dark-matter distribution.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Tyson and others examined the backdrop of blue
galaxies through the lens of a cluster of galaxies seen with the
Hubble Space Telescope. This produced a surprise, reported earlier
this year in The Astrophysical Journal. In what is called ``the
first high-resolution mass map of a cluster of galaxies,'' Tyson
found, contrary to most assumptions, a much smoother and less
centrally concentrated distribution of dark matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. August Evrard of the University of Michigan wrote that if
the findings are confirmed and observed elsewhere, this ``is likely
to produce insights into the mechanisms governing galaxy-cluster
formation'' and could be ``a clue to the very nature of dark
matter.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Tyson called this ``just a brief foray into the wilderness of
dark-matter structure,'' but the lensing suggested that ``there's a
lot of mass that we just don't see, because it's not coupled with
radiation.'' Perhaps, he said, broader lensing surveys in time will
find at most twice as much dark matter in the universe as has been
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Tyson should uncover greater amounts of dark matter,
scientists question whether it would be sufficient to meet the
requirements of standard theory describing a flat universe with
enough mass eventually to brake expansion. In this view, the
universe is neither closed and destined to collapse nor open to
endless expansion, with galaxies flying outward and ever farther
apart into a dark, desolate infinity.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the January issue of Scientific American, Dr.
Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland
concluded: ``The standard cosmology of the 1980s, postulating a
flat universe dominated by matter, is dead. The universe is either
open or filled with an energy of unknown origin. Although I believe
the evidence in favor of the latter, either scenario will require a
dramatic new understanding of physics.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's research has concentrated on dark matter in the form of
exotic particles, relics of physics in the earliest moment after
the Big Bang. If they exist, these subatomic particles must be
sluggish and electrically neutral not to be producing detectable
radiations; hence their designation as WIMPs, for weakly
interacting massive particles.
</P>
<P>
   Some objects like dim stars, failed stars, giant planets and
other obscure ordinary material may make up another fraction of the
dark matter. In a playful contrast to WIMPs, these are called
MACHOs, for massive astrophysical compact halo objects. Astronomers
estimate that the dark halo around Earth's home galaxy, the Milky
Way, could contain 10 times more mass than the visible part of the
galaxy, and MACHOs could account for about half of that invisible
mass.
</P>
<P>
   At the suggestion of Dr. Bohdan Paczynski, a Princeton
University astrophysicist, a team of astronomers has focused on
fields of stars near the center of the Milky Way or out in the
neighboring galaxy known as the Large Magellanic Cloud.
</P>
<P>
   If one of these stars suddenly brightens and grows fainter in a
characteristic way over a period of several weeks, this is
presumably evidence of some intermediate dark mass acting as a lens
in the line of sight, possibly a MACHO. Several candidates have
been identified, though interpretations are controversial.
</P>
<P>
   The lensing agents could be ordinary stars not previously seen
or some renegade star population not known, or some of them could
be dark matter in one form or another, said Dr. Christopher Stubbs,
an astrophysicist at the University of Washington in Seattle who is
a member of the MACHO search team,
</P>
<P>
   With improved detection instruments and methods at a telescope
in Chile, Stubbs said that in two years the team should be
detecting 10 times as many lensing events, enhancing prospects for
more definitive sightings. Similar experiments could also reveal
the presence of planets. One such tantalizing observation has
already been made, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When gravitational lensing was in its infancy, quasars were
merely the bright sources of the light being distorted and
magnified. Now scientists are testing a lensing technique for
studying the quasars themselves.
</P>
<P>
   American astronomers led by Dr. Edwin Turner of Princeton
University, working at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, are
monitoring the Einstein Cross quasar, which is lensed by an
intervening galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   They are watching for peculiar perturbations and magnifications
in the lensed light when a single star in the galaxy moves directly
into the line of sight. When one is detected, the Hubble space
telescope in Earth orbit will be focused on the strongly magnified
target to examine its spectrum of light.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring variations in the spectral lines over time, scientists
say, should reveal the relative size and structure of different
emission regions in the quasar. This would be the most remote
remote-sensing mapping enterprise ever undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the spectral maps should define the structure of
the whirlpool of gas and other stellar matter being drawn
inexorably into a gravitational sink known as a black hole.
Radiations from this dynamic accretion disc are the likely source
of a quasar's brilliant light.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could find out if this picture of a quasar is right,''
Turner said. ``All theorists think so, but this would be a way of
checking and learning even more about this phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
in Cambridge, Mass., and the University of Arizona in Tucson are
using the infrared and optical cameras on the orbiting Hubble
telescope to examine the lensing of light from two dozen quasars.
They are trying a new method of clocking the cosmic expansion to
determine the age of the universe, another fundamental issue of
cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   The measured velocity of galaxies moving apart with the
expansion of space-time is expressed as the Hubble constant. The
higher the value of the constant, the faster the expansion rate and
thus the younger the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research using the Hubble telescope has measured the
distance to certain stars and their recessional velocity and
recession of certain stars, translating this into a value for the
Hubble constant that is uncomfortably high. It puts the upper limit
of the age of a flat universe at about 10 billion years, possibly
younger than the oldest stars.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of The Astrophysical Journal, astronomers
reported somewhat lower values _ thus a lower expansion rate _ also
using the Hubble telescope, but this time observing the lensing of
a quasar 10 billion light-years away.
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of an intervening galaxy split the quasar light into
four separate images, each of which travels a different path and
arrives at the telescope at slightly different times. By measuring
these time delays, astronomers calculated the distance to the lens,
which is the hard part, and then observed the recessional velocity
of the object to complete calculations leading to the value of the
Hubble constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a more direct method for determining the expansion
rate,'' said Impey of Arizona, a member of the research team. ``I
don't think it's necessarily superior to other methods, but it's a
critical crosscheck of other results.''
</P>
<P>
   Impey said there was a good-news-bad-news aspect to the
findings. It was reassuring that the results indicate a slow enough
expansion rate to resolve the age crisis; lensing studies by a
group led by Turner has produced similarly low values for the
expansion rate.
</P>
<P>
   The universe appears to be somewhat older than the oldest stars,
as it should be. The bad news, though, is that the solution to the
age crisis seems to require that the universe has a low mass
density.
</P>
<P>
   So the results are one more example of the potential of
gravitational lensing in astronomy and another cause for
cosmologists to take a hard look at their theories.

<P>
   Q. I will be going to Paris and would appreciate information on
the location of the salon that Natalie Clifford Barney had there
earlier in this century. Is the salon or studio a place that can be
visited?
</P>
<P>
   Maria Hopewell, Dallas
</P>
<P>
   A. It was at 20 Rue Jacob, in the sixth arrondissement, that
Barney, an American expatriate and writer, conducted a salon every
Friday, attracting a galaxy of literary and intellectual lights.
Among them were Djuna Barnes, Sylvia Beach, Colette, Hilda
Doolittle, Janet Flanner, Andre Gide, Gertrude Stein and William
Carlos Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The salon met for more than 50 years (except during the two
world wars) until about the early 1960s, according to Karla Jay,
director of Women's and Gender Studies at Pace University in New
York. The Rue Jacob building, near the Place Furstenburg, is
landmarked but not open to the public. In the garden there's a
small temple, with Doric columns, that bears the inscription ``A
l'Amitie'' (``To Friendship'').
</P>
<P>
   Born to an Ohio family of great wealth, Barney moved to Paris as
a student and pursued her interest in French culture, writing
primarily in French. She died in 1972 and is buried in the ninth
division of the Passy cemetery. Also buried at Passy is Renee
Vivien, an expatriate poet from Britain who was among Barney's
loves. Another was Romaine Brooks, whose paintings include some of
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth arrondissement is rich in literary connections. If you
set out on your own, you will find the maps and descriptions in
Noel Riley Fitch's ``Walks in Hemingway's Paris'' valuable. (It was
reissued by St. Martin's Press in 1997 and is $10.95.) If you
prefer a guided tour, one possibility is Bohemian Paris, run by
Siren's Song Tours, 5 Rue du Parc, 93389 Pierrefitte-sur-Seine,
France; (33-1) 48.26.62.15, fax (33-1) 48.21.41.69. Web site:
www.onecity.com/paris.
</P>
<P>
   The tours, conducted by Gentry Lane, are available daily by
appointment. They take about two and a half hours, cover a mile and
a half on the Left Bank and are limited to six people. On the
itinerary are cafes frequented by Hemingway and Modigliani, the
residences of Modigliani, the composer George Antheil and James
Joyce, and the studios of Man Ray, Picasso and Brassai. Cost: $36
each, at 5.5 francs to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   By way of background, you may want to read Shari Benstock's
``Women of the Left Bank: Paris, 1900-1940'' (University of Texas
Press) and Ms. Jay's book ``The Amazon and the Page: Natalie
Clifford Barney and Renee Vivien'' (Indiana University Press). A
site on the Internet devoted to Barney and her era _ run by Paula
DiTallo, who describes herself as an Atlanta software engineer with
a love for literature _ is

</P>
<P>
   Rugby World Cup
</P>
<P>
   Q. We would like to attend the Rugby World Cup this year. How
can we get tickets, especially to the championship matches, and do
you have suggestions for lodging? Is there hooliganism as there is
at soccer matches?
</P>
<P>
   _ Andrew Schiavoni, Bronx, N.Y. &QR;
</P>
<P>
   A. Competing in the Rugby World Cup, scheduled to be played in
Britain and France from Oct. 1 to Nov. 6, are 20 teams divided into
five groups. The official source for tour packages is Gullivers
Sports Travel, which takes the minimalist approach: Fans handle
their own air travel.
</P>
<P>
   The closer the date of the final games, the more nights of
accommodation one must buy. So fans who want to follow the initial
progress of a single team, or what is called ``follow the flag,''
get two nights' lodging. The cost, $695 to $895, is based on double
occupancy and includes two breakfasts; a seat at the opening game
and ceremonies on Oct. 1 at the new 72,500-seat Millennium Stadium
in Cardiff, and seats at three games played by a single team.
</P>
<P>
   A package that offers a ticket to the quarterfinal in Paris or
Edinburgh is $699 to $799. It includes three nights at a three-star
hotel and three breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who want tickets to the last four games _ the two
semifinals, the playoff and the final _ get nine nights in London
at $3,245 to $4,895. The package covers breakfast daily and, except
for those choosing the economy level lodgings, bus transportation
to and from the games.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever package you choose, there is no guarantee as to the
category of ticket you get. Information: Gullivers Sports Travel,
973 Vale Terrace, Vista, Calif. 92084; (760) 941-7323, fax (760)
941-2997.
</P>
<P>
   A Rugby World Cup spectator's guide is available from the
British Tourist Authority by mail; call (800) 462-2748. It includes
tour suggestions plus a listing of places to stay and agencies
handling accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about rowdiness, Ed Hagerty, editor and publisher of Rugby
magazine, cited this adage: Rugby is a ruffians' game played by
gentlemen; soccer is a gentlemen's game played by ruffians. He
noted that after a game, competing teams socialized in what is
known as ``the third half.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Haze
</P>
<P>
   Q. We are considering a tour that will include Indonesia but are
concerned that it could be spoiled by haze from the forest fires.
Can you hazard a guess as to the chances of clear conditions in
February and March? And what about the outlook for Myanmar and
Thailand? _ John Hebard, Sutton, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   A. The drought of El Nino and the haze created by forest fires
are history _ for now, anyway. ``Definitely pack your umbrella,''
says Bill Patzert, a research oceanographer at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. He reports that there are no fires
and no smog over Indonesia or Southeast Asia; in fact, in December,
there were heavy rains. On average, Jakarta, for example, has 11.8
inches of rain in February and 8.6 in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Topex-Poseidon satellite, a French-American project,
measures the height of the sea surface. As the surface heats up,
the sea level rises, which in turn promotes conditions that produce
rainfall. That is exactly what is happening now: At year's end, the
sea level was 7.8 inches above normal in the western Pacific,
Patzert said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Myanmar and Thailand, a National Centers for
Environmental Prediction model suggests that temperatures may be a
bit higher than usual _ it's normally in the low 70s to low 90s in
Bangkok _ and that the precipitation will not differ from the norm,
which is eight-tenths of an inch in February and 1.4 inches in
March.

 &HT;    Now as in 1929, Americans are preoccupied with sex
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mr. Excitement _ that's what my kids call me _ will be
in bed early, as usual. New Year's Eve and I'm sacked out by 10:30,
a paperback Travis McGee mystery beside me on the big down
comforter. Let others ring in the new year; I'll miss the old one.
</P>
<P>
   I'll miss it for many things, but mainly all the sex.
</P>
<P>
   However you look at it, this has been one great year for sex.
Biggest in my lifetime. If it were wine, you could compare it to
the Bordeaux vintage of '47.
</P>
<P>
   Now we've about finished it off and you know what? We're going
to miss it.
</P>
<P>
   We're going to miss Monica and Bill and Ken and Bob Barr _ his
marquee value's not high enough for us to know him on a first-name
basis, with or without the mustache _ and the whole slimy cast. Oh,
there'll be the trial in the Senate, and there'll be testimony that
won't surprise us and sundry exhibits, one of which still hasn't
been sent to the dry cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   But we've seen the best of it. Next year, if not already, we'll
be asking, ``Is this really necessary?''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the question's been asked. It was asked almost 70
years ago, just as the good times were crashing down. Whatever else
1999 brings, we can expect edgy replays of the stock market
collapse in October 1929. But the fall of that year was notable in
a smaller way for something else: the publication of E.B. White and
James Thurber's little parody, ``Is Sex Necessary?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Thurber and I concocted the book,'' White wrote 20 years
later, ``we were riding one of the many small waves that, taken all
together, created the turbulence of the 1920s. Those were unstable
years. The economy was blown up beyond reasonable dimensions, and
nerves were frazzled.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex was in the air, same as now, and it occurred to two young
writers _ unknown to anyone outside the still-infant New Yorker
magazine _ that Americans had a thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   You'll never get them to admit it, but it's the subject
Americans think about most. In a study sponsored by the American
Society of Newspaper Editors, 80 percent of respondents said they
``agree'' or ``strongly agree'' with the statement ``Journalists
chase sensational stories because they think it'll sell papers, not
because they think it's important news.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine, blame the messenger. But someone will have to explain a
federally appointed special prosecutor's spending tens of millions
of dollars investigating an Arkansas real estate deal and coming to
court with boxes and boxes of evidence having to do mostly with
oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the movies, blame television, blame Cosmo and every other
magazine with a bare-breasted woman on its cover. There's plenty to
go around. But when everyone has his full share, the fact remains
that Americans don't know what to do about sex. The Puritan side of
their makeup looks upon it with a cold eye, while their prurient
side privately wonders what it is.
</P>
<P>
   It was no different in White and Thurber's day. ``I think we
somehow managed, simultaneously, to arrive at the conclusion that
(to borrow a phrase from Wolcott Gibbs) the heavy writers had got
sex down and were breaking its arms. We were determined that sex
should retain its high spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Sex Necessary?'' was reissued in paperback this year, with
Thurber's inimitable line drawings still fresh and funny and a
subtitle that retains its parodic point: ``Or, Why You Feel the Way
You Do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was meant as a spoof on medical books of the day, with their
basso profundo omniscience, but now the joke's on us. We know more
and more about the biological aspects of sex, and less and less
about love. We explain more than we experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding the principles of passion,'' White and Thurber
wrote, ``is like knowing how to drive a car; once mastered, all is
smoothed out; no more does one experience the feeling of perilous
adventure, the misgivings, the diverting little hesitancies, the
wrong turns, the false starts, the glorious insecurity. All is
smoothed out, and all, so to speak, is lost.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where we are as one year folds into another, lost in
a quagmire we neither understand nor enjoy. We'd like to believe
it's only about an adulterous president and a frisky intern, and so
limit it in time and space. We'd like to believe it's about a
voyeuristic prosecutor, a Peeping Tom with power to subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   We'd like to believe it's about anyone but us. Here's a bet:
This time next year, we'll still be talking about sex. Not in the
White House, maybe, but somewhere. The stock market may have
crashed, or at least taken a bad fall, but sex will still sell. We
buy it and buy it, and wonder later why we bought so much.

 &HT;    Aboard Neurolab on WPBA tonight
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WPBA heads into space tonight with an hour exploration
of NASA's Neurolab research mission, launched last April aboard
space shuttle Columbia. ``Exploring Frontiers: The Neurolab Space
Shuttle'' (8 p.m.) is pretty much as dry, stiff and by-the-textbook
as the title implies.
</P>
<P>
   The program, produced by WPBA with funding from the Morehouse
School of Medicine(Atlanta, Ga.), shows experiments done on
Columbia to research how space flight affects the human nervous
system.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, it's not a Bruce Willis-led ``Armageddon'' drill team
hoping to knock an asteroid out of harm's way. It's not even John
Glenn returning to space to juice NASA's marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   This show is a real-life science fair project, full of good
information and delivered with as little creativity as anyone
anywhere can possibly imagine.

 BOSTON: ... longtime overseer.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the center of the storm over the museum's ethics is Cornelius
C. Vermeule III, the MFA's longtime curator of classical
antiquities who retired in 1996. A scholar world-renowned for his
connoisseurship, and a beloved figure at the MFA and in the local
art world, Vermeule developed a swashbuckling reputation for his
acquisition habits.
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, Vermeule's decisions still preoccupy
lawyers. It was Vermeule who arranged the MFA's questionable
acquisition of the top half of a Heraclean figure the Turkish
government wants reunited with the bottom half that sits in a
Turkish museum. In another case involving the alleged theft of
precious Athenian coins from Turkey, it was Vermeule who had the
MFA authenticate them for the owners, despite evidence they might
be ``hot.''
</P>
<P>
   And like many curators of his generation, who scoured the world
for prized pieces long before the plundering of ancient grave sites
was officially proscribed, Vermeule continued to buy artifacts as
if the rules had never changed, according to McClellan, the BU
archeologist. By many accounts, Vermeule had virtual autonomy
within the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, with the help of a $30,000 grant from the National
Endowment for the Arts, Vermeule's department published a book
signaling that it was still playing by old rules. The 1993 book,
``Vase Painting in Italy,'' matter-of-factly suggests that three of
the Apulian vases it prizes most highly were newly discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the vases, attributed to the Darius Painter, a name given
by scholars to one of the finest artisans in the Greek civilization
that flourished in Apulia about 2,300 years ago, have been hailed
in one MFA annual report as ``two of the greatest South Italian
vases in America.''
</P>
<P>
   In the museum's book, the MFA's curators wrote: ``Recent years
have seen a host of new vases by the Darius Painter with rare or
unique mythological subjects . . .'' The MFA vases, acquired in
1987, 1989, and 1991, ``are among the most splendid of the new
mythological works,'' according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   The vase acquired in 1991 is jointly owned by the MFA and by
Leon Levy and Shelby White, New York collectors whose collecting
habits have long been controversial.
</P>
<P>
   To archeologists, the language in the book is an unwitting
admission that the MFA knew the prized vases were probably stolen
from grave sites. In his written response to the Globe's questions,
Rogers acknowledged that none of the three vases had any known
owners before the museum acquired them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums like the MFA should know better,'' said David W. J.
Gill, an archeologist at the University of Wales at Swansea and an
international authority on antiquities looting. Plainly, Gill said,
the reference in the book ``means the objects were newly surfaced,
and since they had no declared history, any museum curator should
have been highly suspicious of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill and a colleague, Christopher Chippindale, have done
pioneering research on undocumented antiquities. For example, after
the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibited Levy and White's
classical collection in 1990, a study by the two men disclosed that
of the 230 objects in the show, 217 had no known history before the
collecting couple acquired them.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule and White did not respond to requests for interviews.
The MFA said it would not permit Vermeule's successor, John
Herrmann, to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   White, in a recent article in the International Journal of
Cultural Property, wrote that she and her husband do not buy
artifacts that are stolen from museums or unearthed from ``known''
archeological excavations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the wheat-growing region in Apulia, virtually all of the loot
comes from thousands of ``unknown'' grave sites, sealed tombs of
the Greeks' ancient dead that often contain painted vases of the
type favored by Levy and White and the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult for the Italian government to prove the vases
were stolen since there is no documentation to prove they were in
the ground,'' lamented Marina Mazzei, the Italian archeologist in
charge of government efforts to slow the looting in Apulia. ``So
just like so many vases, they magically appear on the market, as if
they came from nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzei, during a visit last spring to the pockmarked wheatfields
with a Globe reporter, said the tombaroli, or tomb robbers, have
taken tens of thousands of vases over the last 15 years, so
brazenly that they often employ mechanical excavators. The dramatic
rise in looting in the early 1980s, Mazzei said, coincided with the
growing popularity of the vases with American and European
collectors and museums.
</P>
<P>
   But with few resources, and vast territory to police, she said,
Italian authorities are almost powerless to stop the looters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she said, with unemployment so high in southern Italy,
``there is a high level of crime directed at the living. So to many
laymen, stealing from tombs is not considered criminal, because the
tombaroli disturb the dead, and not the living.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized rings of thieves smuggle much of the plunder into
Switzerland, with its lax statutes and reputation as an
international fencing crossroads. There, the plunder is sold to
collectors and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Just across the Italian-Swiss border, in scenic vacation towns
like Lugano and Ascona, antiquities shops are ubiquitous, and some
dealers openly admit that their wares have been recently excavated.
In one shop last spring, a score of Apulian vases, some of museum
quality and bearing prices as high as $40,000, were displayed in
glass cases.
</P>
<P>
   Lying on the floor in a corner was a piece of Roman armor
identified by the shop owner as from the 1st century A.D. It was
still caked in mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's from a 100-year-old Italian collection,'' the dealer said
with a smile and a wink.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The inexorable link between generous Italian supply and
insatiable collector demand has long raised questions about what
the principals know, or choose to know, about the origin of the
objects they acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenberg, a major figure in the antiquities trade, said he
would not ``knowingly buy a piece that's been smuggled.'' In fact,
he argued in an interview that the vast majority of antiquities are
of no use to archeologists and ought to be traded freely like
modern artworks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-eight percent of items that are excavated offer no new
or useful information for archeologists. So collectors and museums
should be able to acquire these objects,'' said Eisenberg, whose
views anger many archeologists. Strict laws against export, he
added, force the art market to hide information and, sometimes,
prompt museums to doctor provenance information.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``minor pieces'' that most collectors buy, Eisenberg
said, ``We know they come out illegally. But no one bothers about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the major pieces he has sold, to the MFA and other clients,
he acknowledged: ``There is a likelihood that some material may
have been smuggled. No one knows ultimately where these things come
from.''
</P>
<P>
   The MFA, though it made some of its acquisition records
available to the Globe, refused to disclose the identities of
dealers who have sold classical antiquities to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   But dealers seeking tax deductions often donate artifacts to
curators they sell objects to. The MFA's list of donor-dealers
amounts to a ``who's who'' of dealers, and some collectors, who
have been involved in controversy over the origin of some of their
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   They include London dealer Robin Symes, Demirjian, White and
Levy, and the late Lawrence Fleischman, a major purchaser of
undocumented antiquities whose collection was acquired in 1995 by
the J. Paul Getty Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Two major collectors who face claims by foreign governments
seeking the recovery of artifacts are also among MFA donors:
Maurice Tempelsman, the New York financier and companion to the
late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis; and Jonathan H. Kagan, one of the
defendants in Turkey's lawsuit demanding the return of the Athenian
coins.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan has donated numerous undocumented antiquities to the MFA,
including nine ceramic cups from the 7th century B.C. that
McClellan says were probably unearthed from the same tomb complex,
in Latium, the site of an ancient culture near Rome that predated
the Greek colonization of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Through his lawyer, D. Lloyd Macdonald, Kagan declined a request
for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the dealers who have sold classical artifacts to the
museum is Robert E. Hecht Jr., a Paris-based antiquities specialist
who was once declared persona non grata by the Italian and Turkish
governments for his alleged role in selling plundered antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Hecht, the Globe reported in April, played a central role in a
$1.8 million sale to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art of a 3d
century B.C. silver trove. Italian authorities have an affidavit
from the professional grave robber who helped unearth the objects
from Morgantina, a Greek city-state in Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   During an April telephone interview, Hecht defended the trade in
looted antiquities and ridiculed laws, like Italy's, that seek to
prevent the plundering of grave sites.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA refused to divulge its relationship with Hecht, or even
acknowledge that they had done business with him. But the voluble
Hecht boasted in the interview that in mid-1997 he sold the MFA a
rare silver cup, called a skyphos, at a price reported to exceed
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked where the silver artifact originated, Hecht replied:
``What does it matter?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the MFA's classical acquisitions examined by the
Globe, the skyphos has a listed provenance. The MFA said Hecht told
them the piece was once in an American collection and provided the
museum with a letter from a third party attesting to the fact that
Hecht has had the skyphos since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The museum refused to make the letter public.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there is no public evidence the MFA has changed its habits,
other institutions have.
</P>
<P>
   Shestack, who is now the deputy director of the National Gallery
of Art in Washington, said that because of the increased
international and public focus on grave robbing, ``Museums are much
more aware of the consequences of this kind of collecting. They are
much more fastidious.''
</P>
<P>
   But during the seven years he ran the MFA, Shestack conceded,
the museum relied on its dealers for written assurance that the
artifacts the MFA bought were clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal counsel, then, was not as sensitive to these issues.
The dealers often didn't want to tell us anything about the prior
ownership,'' Shestack said. ``The lawyers almost always said that
if a dealer signed a guarantee the work was clean, then everything
was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever said, `We're not going to buy it if it doesn't
have a clear provenance,' '' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Shestack said, the museum did demand a thorough
legal review of the pre-Columbian collection offered to the MFA by
Landon T. Clay, one of its trustees. The review, at an estimated
cost of $30,000, concluded that there was no reason for the MFA not
to take it. Last December, the lawyer who did the review admitted
in an interview that he knew in 1987 that Guatemalan law forbade
export of the artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1986 speech calling for higher ethical standards,
Shestack recalled, ``I cried out for stringent laws that would give
museum directors a reason for not doing the evil thing. So then
when the directors encourage you to acquire certain things, you can
say, `No, I can't. I'll go to jail.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``But if there's a gray area in the law, you don't
have an out.'' The gray area, he noted, remains.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Shestack's candid recollection contradicts Rogers, who in
both the Guatemala and classical areas has insisted there has been
nothing amiss in the museum's behavior. Partly, there are legal
reasons for that: The Guatemalan government has just hired New York
attorneys Lawrence M. Kaye and Howard Spiegler, two aggressive
litigators who handle Turkey's claims, to seek restitution of the
pre-Columbian artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the legal threat, some lawyers and art historians say
Rogers has a responsibility to assure its public that the museum's
behavior sets a moral standard for the community it serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MFA needs to make an unambiguous statement that it will no
longer acquire undocumented antiquities,'' said McClellan, the BU
archeologist. ``This is one more opportunity for the MFA to say,
`Our eyes have been opened. We take responsibility for what's
happened. We've done wrong in the past, but we'll now do better.'
But they seem unwilling to say that publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Other museums, most notably the once avaricious Getty, no longer
acquire undocumented antiquities. And the Getty has done so
unambiguously.
</P>
<P>
   Marion True, the Getty's curator of ancient art, who now devotes
much of her time to helping countries in the Mediterranean rim
devise strategies to stop looting, told a conference at Rutgers
University last month that the Getty ceased buying undocumented
antiquities because it was not possible to be certain they were
clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is because of the all-too-common practices among
so-called reputable dealers of forging provenance documents and
signing false statements on warranties,'' she said. The Getty, True
added, chooses to spend money on other projects, ``rather than
continue to struggle through the mire of deception that pervades
the market.''

 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was just a year ago that the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts turned aside a public demand from the government of Guatemala
to return scores of pre-Columbian artifacts that had been looted
from ancient Mayan grave sites in that country.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, the museum argued that the artifacts entered the
United States legally between 1974 and 1981 _ before the MFA
committed itself in 1983 to international standards designed to
curb the widespread plundering of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since 1984, the MFA has acquired scores of Greek and Roman
antiquities that have no record of prior ownership, according to a
Globe inquiry. That is a dead giveaway, scholars say, that most of
the objects were illegally excavated and smuggled, mainly from
Italy, in the 14 years since the museum says it has abandoned
dealings in the illicit market.
</P>
<P>
   Among the artifacts are three valuable Greek vases, commonly
found in 2,300-year-old grave sites in the Apulian section of
southeastern Italy. In a telltale admission, the museum described
the three vases as among a ``host'' of newly discovered artifacts
in a 1993 book it published on the MFA's ancient Greek vases.
</P>
<P>
   With assistance from several classical scholars, the Globe
focused on the origin of 71 classical artifacts that were donated
or sold to the MFA by outsiders from mid-1984 to mid-1987. Only 10
of the 71 items have any recorded ownership history, or provenance.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 61 objects, including the three valuable vases
cited in the MFA volume, have no pedigree at all, strong
circumstantial evidence that most of them had been recently
unearthed by grave robbers, according to archeologists.
</P>
<P>
   For the MFA, the findings underscore the institution's
continuing challenge _ how to reconcile the august image it
projects with persistent questions about the integrity of its
collecting practices.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other major museums, scholars say, the MFA cannot
argue that it was unaware that it was acquiring valuable objects
that were most likely removed recently from the ground. Even one of
the MFA's major benefactors told the Globe the museum often turned
a blind eye to evidence the artifacts had dubious origins. And two
of its dealers said they cannot vouch for the origin of some of the
objects they sold the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Alan Shestack, who was the MFA's director from 1987 to
1994, acknowledged last week that during his tenure the museum took
insufficient steps to ensure that its acquisitions had not been
looted. ``We were not as rigorous as we might have been in those
days,'' Shestack said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Shestack said, questions were seldom raised about
the origin of undocumented artifacts the MFA was acquiring.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Shestack at odds with the current MFA director,
Malcolm Rogers. Rogers has said he has no misgivings about the
classical antiquities the museum obtained that came with no
ownership history. Unlike Shestack, Rogers has repeatedly refused
to discuss the MFA's collecting ethics.
</P>
<P>
   For the museum, which Rogers recently described as New England's
preeminent cultural institution, the Guatemalan and classical
acquisitions are bookends on a troublesome year. To the MFA's
critics, the two cases underscore the extent to which the MFA, and
some of its peer institutions, are ethically tone deaf and
oblivious to rapidly shifting international standards.
</P>
<P>
   With increasing frequency, countries like Turkey, Italy, and
poverty-stricken Guatemala are pressing legal claims against major
museums _ sometimes with help from the US government. At the same
time, officials in countries that sit atop ancient cultures have
ratcheted up accusatory rhetoric that ``Western elites'' are guilty
of cultural imperialism, colonialism, and racism for preying on
grave sites in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   As for the MFA, even some of the dealers the museum has
purchased artifacts from acknowledged that the antiquities market
is far from pristine.
</P>
<P>
   For example, two of New York's best-known dealers who have sold
classical artifacts to the MFA, Torkom Demirjian and Jerome M.
Eisenberg, admitted that they sometimes have no way of knowing
whether the objects they sell to collectors and museums were
recently plundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no tag on any piece saying, `I am legally excavated
and legally exported,' '' Eisenberg said in an interview. Asked,
for instance, about a dozen undocumented artifacts that came to the
MFA after being sold by Sotheby's and Christie's, the two major
auction houses, Eisenberg said: ``If you buy it at auction without
a provenance, it was probably illegally excavated.''
</P>
<P>
   Demirjian, who was the dealer in one celebrated case involving
looted artifacts and is a passionate critic of laws that inhibit
the antiquities trade, said he does not believe that artifacts he
has sold or donated to the MFA had been recently looted. But, he
added, ``It wouldn't matter to me if they were illegally
excavated.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who has been the MFA director since 1994, turned down
repeated requests for an interview _ a posture he adopted after the
Globe reported last December that the MFA acquired the
pre-Columbian artifacts even though its attorney knew they had been
illegally removed from Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers would respond only to inquiries in writing. But his
responses often sidestepped the questions posed by the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   To many scholars, the evidence is compelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that there is a pattern by the MFA of
acquiring looted material that was illegally excavated in Italy,''
said Boston University archeologist Murray C. McClellan. ``They
have not lived up to their own standards, and they have to be
called to account for that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rogers, others who have dealt with the MFA were more
willing to discuss its acquisitions. One MFA benefactor, who has
had extensive dealings with its classical department over the
years, said the MFA has taken artifacts from him knowing they had
been looted.
</P>
<P>
   When the department ``sees a piece they really want, the
provenance doesn't become as important as it should be,'' said the
benefactor, who discussed the issue on condition that his name not
be used.
</P>
<P>
   The benefactor, though he said he does not deal directly with
smugglers, said the dealers he buys from do. But over the years, he
said, the museum's classical department cared little where the
piece originated _ unless the acquisition was ``likely to create a
fuss.'' On some pieces, he added, the MFA was complicit in helping
to alter provenance information to make the objects appear to be
clean.
</P>
<P>
   But McClellan, who is hopeful the museum can be persuaded to
change course and abide by its ethical code and international
conventions, described the allegedly illicit acquisitions as
``willful ignorance, not a conscious conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan and other classical archeologists who looked over the
Boston museum's acquisitions expressed chagrin about many of the
pieces, saying the evidence, though circumstantial, strongly
suggests the artifacts were looted in recent years from sites in
the Mediterranean, most of them in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the objects with no provenance are numerous vessels from
Apulia, marble busts, and a Greek vase that originated in Tuscany.
Another piece with no pedigree is a rare Mycenaean terracotta idol
from about 1,300 B.C. that McClellan called ``one of the most
important pieces of religious art of the Second Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had not been looted, and we knew where it came from, it
would be world-famous for its historical significance. As it is,
it's merely a curiosity in a corner of the museum,'' McClellan
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Public attention to the MFA's acquisition of antiquities comes
amid growing international focus on cultural property issues,
tougher laws in source countries, and UN-led international
conventions intended to curb the widespread plunder for profit that
has decimated ancient sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit have been countries like Guatemala, Italy, Greece,
Turkey, and poor nations in Africa, such as Mali. Also vulnerable
have been war-torn nations like Iraq, Cambodia, Afghanistan, and
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But the outcry, led by archeologists, has been countered, often
in heated debate, by some museums, dealers, and collectors who
insist that laws against the antiquities trade are unreasonably
harsh, leading to a thriving black market that prompts some museums
to mask the origin of their acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, countries such as Italy and Greece, lacking
evidence pointing to the precise site where an object was looted,
seldom press claims. And US legislation in 1983 that implemented
the UN agreement contains loopholes that protect collectors and
museums from forfeiture laws. Some judges, though, have begun to
pay greater deference to the notion that objects looted abroad can
be classified as stolen property in American courts, a trend that
has unsettled the museum world.
</P>
<P>
   Most museums, including the MFA, have adopted guidelines since
1970 that recognize the legal right of countries like Italy and
Turkey to protect ancient grave sites, an obligation that Shestack
advocated in a speech in 1986, the year before he took the MFA's
helm.
</P>
<P>
   Shestack argued then that museums, by continuing to acquire
problematic antiquities, ``would not only be risking our
reputation, but would be encouraging or at least seeming to be
encouraging, or winking at, illicit activity in the international
art market.''

   But it was on Shestack's watch, from 1987 to 1994, that the MFA
acquired many of the classical antiquities that archeologists say
were probably taken from grave sites in Italy. Others have been
acquired since Rogers took his place. They include some 7th century
B.C. cups from burial grounds near Rome that raised suspicions at
the MFA, but were nonetheless accepted in 1996 _ a gift from a
longtime overseer.

`THE LAST DINOSAUR BOOK': WHY ARE DINOSAURS GREEN? DON'T ASK. 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Last Dinosaur Book,'' the scholar W.J.T. Mitchell
solemnly suggests that Steven Spielberg's ``Jurassic Park'' does
for the dinosaur what Spenser's ``Faerie Queene'' did for the
dragon.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that the movie's ending _ in which the human characters
manage to escape when their pursuers, a pair of voracious female
velociraptors, are attacked by a huge Tyrannosaurus rex _ expresses
``a nostalgia for the days of big patriarchal capital, before the
arrival of career women and `clever girls' in multinational
corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mitchell sees it, the T. rex symbolizes ``the good old days
of `feudal' capitalism, when companies were identified with
individual `giants' (like Spielberg himself) who were capable of
great evil and great good,'' while the raptors ``represent the new
stage of post-modern capitalism, of `downsizing,' flexibility,
rapid strike forces, teamwork, adaptability, steep learning curves,
and (not incidentally) gender confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Were such observations delivered with any wit or tongue-in-cheek
humor, ``Last Dinosaur'' might well make for entertaining reading.
As it stands, however, the book is a lumbering, dinosaurian tome
that takes a potentially engaging subject, our current fascination
with dinosaurs and the cultural reasons behind it, and turns it
into an absurdly pretentious treatise, gussied up with all the
latest Marxist, feminist and structuralist allusions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mitchell has assembled an impressive archive of
dinosaur images _ from Barney to the dinosaur skeleton in the Cary
Grant movie ``Bringing up Baby,'' from the Sinclair gas logo to the
logo of the Toronto Raptors basketball team _ he does little to
shed light on what these images might mean.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with this copiously illustrated book is that
Mitchell, a professor in the departments of English and art history
at the University of Chicago, sees dinosaurs not merely as ``an
infinitely flexible cultural symbol,'' but as ``a kind of blank
slate on which every kind of collective and individual fantasy can
be projected.'' In other words, dinosaurs can mean anything and
everything.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``us'' and ``not-us,'' Mitchell writes: ``As erect
bipeds, they resemble us; as reptiles, they are the `other,' the
exotic, strange, sinister alien, loaded down with satanic
associations, from the serpent who tempts Eve to the Great Red
Dragon of the Apocalypse.''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, dinosaurs ``can symbolize the dominant `master
race' that commands a global empire''; on the other hand, they can
symbolize ``the vanished, savage races that lost out in the
Darwinian struggle, or an invading horde of aliens who threaten
white supremacy.'' They can be figures of ``obsolescence and
failure to adapt,'' or in the case of Godzilla, symbols of
``novelty and sometimes runaway innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dinosaur is a prestige symbol for modern nation-states,''
Mitchell asserts, ``and a model for ideologies of world conquest
and domination. It is associated with childhood, old age and
everything in between. It is associated with sexual differentiation
and reproduction, and with the failure to reproduce. It is a figure
of everything alien to human nature (cold-blooded, reptilian,
rapacious) and of all that is most familiar in human nature
(coldblooded, reptilian, rapacious).''
</P>
<P>
   To the Victorians, Mitchell contends, the dinosaur was a fitting
symbol of ``the world's largest empire at the peak of its glory and
self-confidence.'' The Crystal Palace exhibition of 1854, fittingly
enough, included the very first dinosaur reproductions made for the
public: huge, life-size leviathans that ``reflected the best
scientific knowledge of the time'' but that look, in retrospect,
like reptilian hippos or the offspring of a buffalo and an iguana.
</P>
<P>
   To Americans of the gilded age, however, the dinosaur's aura was
best captured, Mitchell argues, by Charles Knight's famous
paintings, which depicted heavily armored behemoths in one-on-one
combat: ``the paleontological equivalent of that other war of
giants, the struggles among the `robber barons' in late
19th-century America.''
</P>
<P>
   This period, he goes on, ``so often portrayed as the era of
`social Darwinisn,' economic `survival of the fittest,' ruthless
competition, and the formation of giant corporate entities headed
by gigantic individuals is aptly summarized by the Darwinian icon
of giant reptiles in a fight to the death.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such arguments make sense in a late-night college bull
session sort of way, they are undermined by Mitchell's repetitious
and highly disorganized narrative, his passion for pompous and
unhelpful digressions (about everything from Jeffersonian democracy
to modernist art), and his tendency to push his observations past
the bounds of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Last Dinosaur'' is peppered with specious remarks. In
one chapter Mitchell writes: ``When Foucault wondered what would
take the place of the Age of Man he probably didn't suspect that it
would be the Age of the Dinosaur.'' And in another: ``If the
dinosaur is an ancestral figure at the level of community or
nation, it is the Oedipal father in the private sphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mitchell's remarks are pedantic statements of the
obvious: ``A cubist dinosaur would not be of much use, either to a
paleontologist or to the public.'' Some are predicated upon dubious
findings: ``The fortunes of dino-science seem to flourish in
inverse relation to dinomania: when the scientific side is
depressed, the popular image seems to become even more inflated and
prolific.''
</P>
<P>
   And others are just plain comical. Wondering why dinosaurs in
the modern period (1900-1960) were usually depicted as green,
Mitchell asks, ``Is it a symbol of the `colored' racial other, the
savage, primitive denizen of the green world? Or is it an emblem of
the white man's burden, the color of the military camouflage
required for the Great White Hunter to blend in with the jungle and
thus to dominate it?''
</P>
<P>
   Such passages do not add to our understanding of dinosaurs as a
cultural icon. They instead read like a parody of current academic
scholarship: lots of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

 &HT;    At Friedman's, fewer big dogs amble in during NBA lockout
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An NBA lockout can really foul up the sales of $850
alligator skins, especially in size 17.
</P>
<P>
   This season, like most in recent memory, could have been
larger-than-life for Atlanta-based Friedman's Shoes, a modern-day
cobbler to the flashy tastes of pro basketball players and other
high-rolling athletes.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to a National Basketball Association lockout that's
putting the squeeze on spending by the loafer-loving players, the
shoe shop's order list has been short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're usually on our sixth reorder of the top shoes by now,
but we stopped at two shipments this year,'' said Brett Teilhaber,
holding up a camel-and-bone mule he helped design based on the
fancies of Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley and Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Just counting the missed home games of the Atlanta Hawks,
Friedman's is more than a dozen major sales shy of a regular year.
Every Hawks game brings a towering crowd of big spenders from the
visiting team, and sometimes they'll drop $50,000 in a single
shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't bus them over, I send a van over to the Omni and
pick them up,'' said Bruce Teilhaber, Brett's father and owner of
Friedman's, which has adjacent stores for men and women on Mitchell
Street downtown and a third store in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Teilhaber has been courting the oversized needs of pro
ball players since the 1960s, around the time Joe Namath was
getting ready to hit the NFL and long before big-footed guys had
any fashion choices beyond wingtips and clunky cap toes.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teilhaber's father-in-law, Phillip Friedman, founded the
business in 1929 as a used-shoe store and repair shop. About 25
years ago, Teilhaber said he realized men's feet were getting
larger and he talked manufacturers into making bigger shoes.
</P>
<P>
   His break in the pro sports circuit came in the late 1960s when
football players dropped by after a game between the Atlanta
Falcons and San Francisco 49ers. ``Big guys know other big guys,''
Teilhaber said. ``From there, we got some hockey players and then
it spread to basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's was filling a huge niche by carrying shoes up to size
13, which was large in those days. ``But then John Havlicek of the
Boston Celtics came in and needed a size 14 narrow,'' said
Teilhaber, who's still lamenting 20-odd years later that he
couldn't fill the order. ``It killed me. I couldn't sleep that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's, which has three stores in Atlanta, would be hard
pressed not to find a fit today. Three floors of the downtown men's
store bulge with big shoes in all styles and widths, including
lime, orange and olive tones popular with NBA stars. Shoes that fit
Shaq's size 22 foot alone stand 15 boxes high and almost as wide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the so-far aborted season, stars like O'Neal are still
ordering shoes from Friedman's, said Teilhaber, who estimates sales
to NBA players make up 15 percent of his business. The sales that
are suffering are those to the lesser-known players and the
first-round draft picks, he said. But even the big stars could cut
back on their shoe budget, with recent endorsement cancellations by
Nike and Fila USA.
</P>
<P>
   Teilhaber is staying upbeat, though, counting on catalog sales
and a new Web site to reach those players that aren't in town this
season. And there are always celebrities like Don King, who once
dropped $65,000 at Friedman's on 110 pairs of shoes. ``This NBA
thing is hurting us, but we're still doing fine,'' he said.
``There' are plenty of big people out there.''

 &HT;    Rural facilities plagued by deteriorating financial stability
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bacon County Hospital in Alma, Ga., is living on the
financial edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are operating on three days' cash flow,'' says
Cindy Turner, who doubles as the chief financial officer and chief
operating officer for the 50-bed rural hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, with annual revenue of about $10 million, has lost
money the last three years. A prime factor: cuts in hospital
payments by the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which account for
about 80 percent of Bacon County Hospital's care. And for the few
patients with private insurance, their employers are demanding big
discounts from the hospital, Turner says.
</P>
<P>
   Now another threat looms. The agency that runs the federal-state
Medicaid program has proposed lowering payments to hospital-based
nursing homes. Bacon County Hospital has such a facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any cut in reimbursement would impact us tremendously,''
Turner says wearily.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with red ink, though, Bacon County has plenty of
company. Statistics compiled by HomeTown Health, a rural hospital
association, show that 21 rural facilities have lost money in three
straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Another 17 have been unprofitable two of the three years,
according to HomeTown Health, which bases its figures on state
hospital survey data. Thirteen more lost money in one of the three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The main financial damage lies south of metro Atlanta,
particularly in the southeastern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of rural hospitals erupted as a major issue in the
1998 General Assembly. Lawmakers pushed to equalize rates paid by
Medicaid to both urban and rural hospitals for the same medical
procedure. And they passed a bill to help rural facilities join
managed-care networks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rural hospitals again are expected to take a high profile
in the upcoming Legislature. Besides the proposed nursing-home cut,
measures likely will surface to give rural facilities more
financial flexibility. And Gov.-elect Roy Barnes has urged that the
state's $4.8 billion tobacco settlement create a fund that targets
rural hospitals, along with Medicaid reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   But for the 21 hospitals on the critical list, more help is
needed, says Jimmy Lewis, chief executive officer of HomeTown
Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no reserves; they have no cash,'' Lewis says. ``Many
of these hospitals have a (daily patient) census of two, four, six
or 10.''
</P>
<P>
   A hospital shutdown would devastate a local community, experts
insist. The presence of health care services is a crucial
ingredient to a rural community's ability to attract and keep
industry. If a hospital shuts down, tax bases, jobs and even
populations can evaporate. Many rural areas that lack up-to-date
facilities often struggle to recruit doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These little hospitals are needed out here,'' says Buck
Benton, CEO of the struggling Minnie G. Boswell Memorial Hospital
in Greensboro. ``When you lose your hospital, you lose your ability
to (attract) industry and create jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a hospital is the leading employer in many
counties, or, as in Bacon County, the No. 2 employer.
</P>
<P>
   Problems in access to care can produce disturbing health
statistics. South Georgia, in fact, suffers from alarming rates of
infant mortality, low-birthweight babies, and cardiovascular and
cancer deaths.
</P>
<P>
   If the negative trends continue, ``We can write a health care
scenario in southeast Georgia that would resemble that of a Third
World country,'' Lewis says.
</P>
<P>
   With rural areas having a high level of Medicare and Medicaid
patients, recent government cost-cutting has left scars. The
federal Medicare program for the elderly, for example, is
delivering $1 billion in cuts to Georgia hospitals over five years,
according to GHA, an association of Georgia hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   And reductions in the Medicaid program, which serves low-income
residents, have amounted to $100 million for Georgia hospitals over
the past three years, GHA adds.
</P>
<P>
   If hospital cuts continue, says state Sen. Jack Hill
(D-Reidsville), who has chaired several legislative hearings on
rural hospitals this year: ``We could be looking at the demise of
20 to 40 hospitals. There's almost no tomorrow for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The common ingredients in their financial predicaments, Hill
says, include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A high percentage of Medicare and Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ Low numbers of privately insured patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ An inability to modernize equipment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Difficulty in recruiting physicians.
</P>
<P>
   _ Losing hundreds of thousands of dollars on patients who can't
or don't pay.
</P>
<P>
   Another setback, Hill says, could be the proposed Medicaid
reduction in the rates for hospital-based nursing homes, to the
level of free-standing nursing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Many rural facilities have such nursing homes. Holly Snow of GHA
notes that hospital-based facilities treat sicker patients than
other nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The nursing home at Effingham Hospital is one of the few nursing
homes in the area that take ventilator patients, says Scott
Burnette, CEO of the Springfield, Ga., hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A cut, he said, ''would eliminate our ability to take that type
of patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital has lost money three straight years, but its
financial health is improving this year, Burnette says. Still, the
facility constantly fights a patient exodus to Savannah hospitals,
a 45-minute drive away.
</P>
<P>
   With costs rising and fewer patients requiring hospital care,
Monroe County Hospital finds itself in the same unprofitable
predicament. Its administrator, Buzz Tanner, concludes:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the state is unable to help small hospitals somehow, I'd
guess that 50 percent of them will go belly up in the next five
years.''

 &HT;    NBA lockout pits some players on other side of strike line
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Outside, Monday morning has come wet and nasty, but
inside the gymnasium at Life University the pace is slow, relaxed
and easy as a summer's day for small groups of athletes who have
little to do, no place to go and are in no hurry to get there.
</P>
<P>
   While young Hawks guard Ed Gray shoots at the near end of the
court and his father, Ed Sr., of Riverside, Calif., records with a
video camera, Toronto's Kevin Willis demonstrates his hook shot 80
feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Track athletes work on wind sprints under a coach's supervision
at the far side, while a high school freshman, Alexander Stevenson,
works on his free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Life varsity player Ron Glover watches from a chair, his right
hand in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hawks' Dikembe Mutombo becomes engaged in passionate
discussion with NBA free agent Ivano Newbill, his ex-teammate,
about the stalled negotiations that have the NBA season on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the scene at Life, where many NBA players are fearing
a season-long death.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo, a member of the NBA Players Association's negotiating
committee, is angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am also making a sacrifice,'' he tells Newbill. ``We (all
the board members) are making this sacrifice for the next
generation of players. We've made our money. We've saved our money.
Now we must help those players to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbill, a former Georgia Tech player, doesn't buy it. He's
agitated. ``I'm a three-year guy,'' he said. ``I haven't made my
money. I need to play. A lot of guys need to play. But I read in
the paper you're giving up on the season, and I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo argues that David Stern has given the players no choice
in the matter. He disputes Stern's ``final offer,'' and argues that
the NBA commissioner's Jan. 7 ``drop-dead'' date is disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Mutombo will miss his fourth scheduled pay check
of the season, at a cost to date of more than $4 million. He says
he is aware that that money, and any money lost this season, never
can be recouped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, I sit down with my wife (Rose) and I tell her,
'Honey this is how much money we've lost today,''' Mutombo says.
This accounting is instructive, ``because that way we know exactly
how much we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Newbill, a minimum-salary player, has taken a beating at his own
level. A third of a season is lost, and it's probably too late to
play in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be 20 jobs over there, and how many guys will want
them if the season's over?'' he asks. ``If I had any idea this was
going to go this long, I would have enrolled in graduate school. I
could have completed the first quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo pulls out a sheaf of pages bound in plastic. It is the
NBA's ``final'' offer from a few weeks ago. He holds up a list of
improvements the league presented to the union at a Sunday meeting
in Denver. He tells Newbill there will be another final offer from
the league.
</P>
<P>
   Newbill, lips pursed, shakes his head in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo begins getting ready for play. ``I came here to play
some basketball,'' he says while walking onto the court where
Willis embraces him, then tugs him over to a couple of folding
chairs for another impassioned discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Willis has broken ranks publicly with union leadership, calling
for a secret vote of membership on the NBA's new offers.
</P>
<P>
   There is word that agent Norman Blass is urging a players'
revolt. Blass, the agent for Hawks guard Mookie Blaylock, said
Monday that he has sent letters league-wide asking players to vote
their pocketbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Newbill wants to speak to Blaylock, but he doesn't have his
telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't do you no good to have it; he don't answer the
phone,'' the younger Gray says. Newbill is aggravated. ``I been
here since 8,'' he says, glancing at a clock that reads 11:45 a.m.
``Ty (Corbin) is in South Carolina, Steve (Smith) took his wife to
Michigan. . . . Hey, we need to play.''
</P>
<P>
   At the far end, Mutombo and Willis end their intense labor
discussion and finally take the court for a game.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Newbill is sour. ``Nobody had their heart in it,'' he
said. ``We're 10 days away from the end of the season. This is
terrible, and nobody's doing anything about it.''

 &HT;    Reeves to be involved in pre-playoff planning
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons coach Dan Reeves, who went to team
headquarters Monday, said he will participate part-time this week
in preparation for a home playoff game Jan. 9, and he plans to be
at that game.
</P>
<P>
   However, Reeves and the team internist, Dr. Charlie Harrison,
are not sure whether the 54-year-old coach will return to the
sideline that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, 54, had quadruple heart bypass surgery Dec. 14. After
being released Dec. 18, he was re-admitted Dec. 20 with an
irregular heartbeat but was released again Dec. 24.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the team workout facility in Suwanee on Monday
just before regularly scheduled 2 p.m. meetings. The coach quickly
congratulated players and coaches, and headed for his first workout
_ a date with a treadmill _ since surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better,'' he said. ``I got my physical this morning,
and everything so far looks good. I'll probably be out here every
day this week, seeing what my energy level allows me to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be at the stadium somewhere (for the playoff game). I
don't want to get in the way of our football team; they're doing a
great job without me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Brooks, the assistant head coach and defensive coordinator
who has served as interim coach in Reeves' absence, will continue
setting practice schedules and running meetings this week.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves will be around, however. He planned on Monday to review
film of Dallas (10-6), Green Bay (11-5) and San Francisco (12-4),
all potential playoff opponents for the Falcons (14-2) on Jan. 9.
He also will attend practice Wednesday and Thursday, unless he's
too tired.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Reeves seems likely to be back in charge, but he
won't put in the typical 60-plus hours at work.
</P>
<P>
   One concern about being on the sideline for the game would be
that if Reeves got hit and cut, the blood-thinning medication he's
taking could lead to excessive bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the safest place to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said Reeves is back on track for a normal recuperation,
after a setback experienced by 10 percent to 30 percent of all
bypass patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week, he'll gain strength (by working out),'' Harrison
said. ``He's looking great. It's a good thing the team has (a bye).
They'll . . . be off Friday, Saturday and Sunday. He can help with
the game plan. We'll make the decision about what he can do (on
game day) when I see him next Monday.''

 &HT;    Finally, easy-to-keep resolutions
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Instead of plunging into impossible vows that can't be
kept, a few easy resolutions for 1999. This annual ritual doesn't
have to be a chore, if you pick your promises carefully.
</P>
<P>
   I hereby resolve:
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to watch any sport described as extreme, ultra or radical.
As soon as they break out a ramp or a board of any kind, I'm outta
there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never to do the ''Dirty Bird'' in public, no matter how
well-served I've been. Regardless of how a middle-aged white guy
may try, it's still going to look like he just mistook flaming
sterno for his roll-on deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never to fall into SportsCenter speak and refer to a home run
as ''Booo-Yeahhh,'' or ''Gyot-It,'' or ''I am the king of the
diamond. Let there be a postgame feast in my honor. Me and my
followers will feast on the finest of wines and cheeses.'' It is
just a home run.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to take up mahjong.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to buy a used Maserati from an NBA player.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never to ask Bobby Cremins to be my investment broker. One day
flush, the next day flat broke _ who could stomach the ride?
</P>
<P>
   _ Never to use the ATM at a casino. That is one small step away
from borrowing the money from some guy nicknamed ''Mako.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Always to have at least one less demand than Roger Clemens and
one more friend than Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sometimes to overlook ego. It can be a good thing, too. Take
for example Jamal Anderson. On his touchdown run against Miami
Sunday, he began to celebrate 10 yards before the end zone,
dangling the ball in his left hand. Had he not been watching
himself run on the Georgia Dome video screen, he wouldn't have
noted the Dolphin defender who was closing fast, ready to slap the
ball free. But Anderson did see the big picture and switched the
ball to his right hand at the last second. He was actually saved by
narcissism.
</P>
<P>
   _ Occasionally to watch an NHL highlight or read a hockey story.
They keep insisting that it's coming to town next season and I've
really got to start caring. Put this in the same file with such
duties as flossing and getting an oil change.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never to confuse my son's Pony League baseball game with a
turning point in history.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never to spend more to play golf than the cost of a nice meal
out. Never to spend more to take the family to a professional
sporting event than to take them to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to be named in a paternity suit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to refer to myself in the third person. Steve really hates
that. Steve thinks it very pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to hang on the rim. Nor to show up the pitcher. Nor to
excessively celebrate a touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never to use androstenedione. I prefer to get my bulk the
old-fashioned way, one super-sized value meal at a time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to invite Bobby Knight over for an evening of
''Pictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to pay any more attention to college football recruiting
than I do to soybean futures.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to sign a deal with Nike to put a swoosh on my word
processor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never to go anywhere without my restrictor plate securely
bolted in place.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not to ask any athlete after a crushing defeat, ''How does it
feel?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Never to forget that the good guys still outnumber the bad and
that sport is supposed to be more limerick than sermon.
</P>

 &HT;    Return of Freaknik? Neither Atlanta nor celebrants making plans
yet
 &HT;    (ATTN: Florida, Texas editors.)
 &HT;    By Jennifer Ffrench-Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Freaknik, the street party Atlanta loves to hate, cost
the city more than $1 million in overtime pay to public safety
employees this year and next Spring's price tag for the event could
be as high.
</P>
<P>
   Early next month, Mayor Bill Campbell's office will name a 1999
Black College Spring Break Planning Committee, which in is expected
to try again to rein in the raucous celebration the city has been
trying to discourage for years.
</P>
<P>
   But controlling the event is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Freaknik annually lures thousands of black college students to
Atlanta during the third weekend in April. According to figures
recently obtained from the city under the state Open Records Act,
last spring's Freaknik cost Atlanta more than $1.2 million in
overtime pay to police officers, firefighters and corrections
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, the city's efforts _ which include tough
enforcement of traffic offenses and more serious violations _ have
succeeded in reducing the crowds. Officials estimated last April's
attendance at a paltry 50,000, down from the peak of 200,000 in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the overtime pay, about $1.1 million, went to police
officers. That's more than double the $497,000 paid for Freaknik in
1995, when the city paid fewer police officers, and took a gentler
approach to enforcing traffic and other violations. This year, the
city paid 1,624 officers, firefighters and corrections officers
overtime for 43,361 hours of extra work during the event. The
city's overtime Freaknik tab for police officers in 1996 was $944,
312, Atlanta police reported. In 1997, it was $956,057, according
to police. The mayor's office said, however, the city paid from
$650,000 to $720,000 in overtime to police officers both years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 payments, authorized by special legislation passed by
City Council in May, were made instead of granting compensatory
time so that officers would stay on the job instead of taking time
off from work. Civilian employees who also worked overtime were
offered compensatory time instead.
</P>
<P>
   Next April 16-18, public safety employees will no doubt again
work thousands of hours of overtime for Freaknik, which routinely
generates complaints of loud music, public lewdness, drunkenness
and traffic gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications are that if they are paid overtime, it will
again be by way of special legislation. The mayor's budget,
currently before City Council, does not mention the event.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Lee Morris, who heads the council's Finance
Committee, said no decision has been made, but the council's
preference is to again pay overtime to public safety employees
rather than have them take comp time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As shorthanded as we are, I would rather have police officers
working,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Police Department has said it is at least 300
officers short of its authorized force of 1,874.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said funds to pay the workers would come from ``salary
savings'' built into the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We budget 100 percent of salaries for 100 percent of
authorized positions and we never fill all the vacancies,'' he
said. ``That's really where we get the salary savings that can pay
overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   DeWayne Martin, the mayor's chief of staff, said informal
conversations have started with some of the organizations and
people who served on the mayor's 1998 Black College Spring Break
Planning Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this year's Freaknik, the 1998 committee
recommended that the city discourage next year's Freaknik with
tough law enforcement and by not issuing permits for
Freaknik-related events or offering its support of any private
functions. However, an annual national job fair, sponsored by a
private company during Freaknik weekend, will continue to get city
support.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the official Freaknik website has not been
updated since last April and the Atlanta University Center's campus
buzz about Freaknik is that there is no buzz yet. Zaret Akande,
president of Spelman College student government, said students have
been preoccupied with the holidays. ``It just hasn't been an action
item yet,'' said Akande, a senior.
</P>
<P>
   But with Freaknik's adverse effect on the city's convention
business and other special events, hopes are high in Atlanta that
Florida's Daytona Beach and Galveston Island, Texas, will continue
to siphon off some of the throngs that normally descend on Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Daytona's Black College Reunion crowds swelled to
110,000, from the usual 50,000. On Galveston Island, last spring's
revelers numbered ``well over 200,000,'' up by 25 percent over
1997. Beach parties in both cities coincide with Atlanta's
Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   On Galveston Island, 50 miles south of Houston, a committee that
includes the African-American Chamber of Commerce and a group of
black ministers is deep into planning for the 1999 Kappa Beach
Party Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old event is organized by the Kappa Alpha Psi
Fraternity, but Robert Warren, director of the Galveston Island
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, said most who visit for the event
don't belong to the fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kappas have 6,000 to 8,000 members,'' Warren said. ``The
other 50,000 are followers.''
</P>
<P>
   The city was forced two years ago to begin controlling the event
as growing crowds of cruisers clogged the only two causeways to and
from the 32-mile long island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult event but we are trying to bring some
control to it and have a quality event,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston Police Chief Kim Schoolcraft said last spring's event
was akin to ``semi-organized chaos,'' with nudity, alcohol
consumption and numerous arrests for disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But it was ``thankfully violence-free,'' she said. ``There were
no shootings, stabbings or assaults.''
</P>
<P>
   Daytona Beach's decade-old event was finally recognized by that
city this year, but was marred by the death of a black youth in a
gunfight and the shooting of four police officers. It also drew
widespread complaints, similar to those commonly made in Atlanta,
of traffic tie-ups, sex in public, and littering.
</P>
<P>
   In its aftermath, angry Daytona residents have been pressing the
city to discourage the event.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, no promoters have come forward seeking support
from the bureau, said Susan McLain, director of communications for
the Daytona Beach Area Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We operate on applications, and we haven't received an
application yet, so there is nothing for us to act on,'' McLain
said. ``At this time, we are not doing anything to help it or
hinder it.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Daytona Beach officials will have to soon join
Atlanta and Galveston in bracing for the massive parties headed to
their towns. ``We all seem to suffer the same with these events,''
said Warren, of the Galveston Island Convention and Visitors
Bureau. ``We have got to have some control. You can't just allow
people to come in an operate your city for you.''

 &HT;    Legendary oak tree felled by storm
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Its branches created 100 feet of leafy canopy, its trunk was 65
inches wide. It was a century older than the United States, and
provided shade and a place to think for the likes of John D.
Rockefeller Jr. and Japanese Emperor Hirohito.
</P>
<P>
   But the Greak Oak at Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia succumbed
to the Christmas ice storm that hit portions of the South last
week. The 300-year-old tree was declared dead after its branches,
unable to support layers of heavy ice, came crashing to the ground.
All that remains is the trunk, which even before the storm was
mostly hollow and lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tree had not been doing well for years,'' said Jim
Bradley, public relations manager for Colonial Williamsburg. ``This
storm was essentially the death knell for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia and other parts of the South continued to recover from
the storm Monday, which mostly meant waiting for the lights to come
on. At one point over the holidays, more than 600,000 customers in
Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee and Louisiana were without power.
Thousands still had no power Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Oak was older than Williamsburg, whose charter dates
back to 1699. So well-known and beloved was the oak that the staff
at Williamsburg is preparing an obituary for it.
</P>
<P>
   The tree became famous in 1926 when Rockefeller and the Rev.
William A. R. Goodwin sat under it and mapped out plans to restore
Williamsburg to its 18th-century appearance. Rockefeller spent part
of each year with his wife at Bassett Hall, a plantation on the
edge of Williamsburg and home to the Great Oak.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Rockefeller died in 1960, the citizens of Williamsburg
gathered under the oak for a memorial service,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   When Emperor Hirohito of Japan visited the U.S. in the 1970s, he
wanted to see the tree, and when he got there, he sat for a while
on a bench under the huge branches.
</P>
<P>
   What's left of the tree will live on in the form of seedlings
that have sprouted from its acorns, Bradley said.

LATEST BIZ BUZZWORD MORE THAN HYPE

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: At a recent meeting, the company
president said he is fully committed to implementing something
called ``knowledge management'' during the coming year. I'm not
sure what this means. Is it another buzzword, or is there something
to it? _ M.R.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Knowledge management is not a buzzword, but it certainly
has been creating a great deal of buzz recently. Knowledge
management (often abbreviated as KM) means using today's computer
and online technologies to gather, track and, most importantly,
share a broad range of knowledge and information to help make an
organization and its employees more effective.
</P>
<P>
   KM can be used to monitor and document employee skills,
competencies and growth, and help a company carry out near- and
long-term planning. When employees have questions about projects,
programs, plans or just about any other work-related matter,
particularly those that call for some real expertise, KM can
provide the forum in which ideas can be shared and questions can be
answered.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, KM implies that employees are willing to share
their expertise. However, in some organizations, employees are
reluctant to do so. It is also not uncommon to find employees who
would rather work out a problem on their own, rather than seek help
from others. These are the kinds of matters that point to the
importance of addressing a company's culture as part of the
implementation of any KM plan.
</P>
<P>
   In order to have a knowledge management program that actually
manages to succeed, it should be accompanied by a healthy dose of
communication, training and incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every time I give one particular employee some positive
feedback, he responds with a wisecrack. I find this to be very
annoying. The obvious step is for me to stop praising him, but
that's not being fair. How can I deal with this? _ T.O.
</P>
<P>
   A: When a particular employee responds to a compliment with a
wisecrack, this is not a particularly wise thing to do. But you are
correct in assuming that it would be unfair for you to eliminate
positive feedback altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Your employee's reaction indicates that he is one of those
people who have a hard time accepting compliments. The underlying
reasons behind this type of reaction can range from basic modesty
and humility, to issues related to self-esteem, self-image and
self-confidence. You are not going to be able to change any of
these deep-seated factors. However, you may be able to change his
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Since this issue revolves around the issue of providing him with
feedback, the next time he responds to a compliment with a
wisecrack, give him some immediate feedback on this behavior. Ask
him if he is aware of what he is actually doing and let him know
that it is becoming increasingly difficult to praise him. Ask him
if there is anything he can do to change this behavior and follow
this by asking if he can make a commitment to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, whenever you give him a compliment that is not
met with a wisecrack, be sure to compliment him on this as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are getting a new manager in our department and I was
wondering about the kinds of things I can do to make a good
impression and start things on a positive note. _ G.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: First impressions are important, but ultimately your
manager's impression of you is going to be based on who you really
are and what you really can do.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important first step in dealing with the new
manager is to be highly observant. Try to obtain a clear picture of
this manager's style, objectives, standards, expectations and
general mode of operations. With this in mind, try to make sure
that your behavior is in sync with his or hers. It can be very
helpful for the new manager to see that the two of you have a good
deal in common.
</P>
<P>
   You should also seek opportunities through which you can help
the new manager. It may be in terms of providing some needed
information, or it could be carrying out a project that he or she
would like to delegate. Let this manager see by your actions that
you are a person with high levels of energy, initiative, commitment
and drive.
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to avoid complaining, criticizing or making
negative comments about the company. If there are issues that are
causing dissatisfaction, try to present some suggestions as to the
ways to correct them.
</P>
<P>
   As time goes by, first impressions tend to become vague
impressions. It is far more important for you to be sure that the
quality and quantity of your work are excellent, as this will form
your manager's lasting impression of you.

`THE PERFECT PEARL': AS `NOVA' SHOWS, IT IS RARE INDEED 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Coming! Tonight on ``Nova''! The Perils of Pearl!
</P>
<P>
   By this dire assessment, the ever-growing hazards facing oysters
and their lustrous produce are so daunting that it is a wonder any
of the gems are still on the market, but no wonder that their
prices are in the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Without the intrusion of humans, as ``The Perfect Pearl''
explains, nature would not on its own be able to satisfy the
ineffable allure of something to go with that simple black frock.
It took Japanese innovators to perfect a process known as
nucleation, once secret but described here, to create the cultured
pearls to satisfy the demand.
</P>
<P>
   The progression from mollusk to gem has never been easy. An
Australian pearl gatherer says that in his father's lifetime of
effort, ``he wouldn't have been able to put one string of perfect
pearls together.'' Oysters are sensitive creatures; they are
vulnerable to overcrowding, to high waves and sudden temperature
fluctuations, to parasites and pollution and physical stress,
particularly because the culturing process, shown close up,
requires surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The hour focuses on threats and rescues. It takes at least two
years to produce a big enough pearl to make the job worthwhile.
Most customers, we learn, settle for relatively modest Japanese
pearls, while rich showoffs go in for rare giant South Sea pearls,
which can bring unspeakable sums in New York's auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion has lately turned to black pearls, mostly produced in
remote coral atolls of Tahiti. A designer boasts of detecting at
least 40 different colors of black, the most desirable this season
being ``blackie-green.'' You can see some shimmerings tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Matching the gems by shape, color, luster and size is a
laborious specialty in itself, but evidently worth it. The world
record for an Australian South Sea necklace, set at Sotheby's in
1993, stands at $2.3 million. Check it out. You have quite a few
shopping days till Christmas.

SEVEN SURVIVING BABIES OF OCTUPLETS REMAIN IN CRITICAL CONDITION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CAROL CHRISTIAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The seven surviving babies of the octuplets born
earlier this month remained in critical condition Monday at Texas
Children's Hospital, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, Nkem Chukwu, was still resting at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital where she gave birth to children. Hospital
officials have not said when Chukwu might be released.
</P>
<P>
   The first baby, a girl, was born naturally Dec. 8 and the others
were born Dec. 20 by Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest baby _ a girl who was born fifth and whose name,
Chijindu Chidera, means ``God has my life'' _ died of heart and
lung failure at 3:23 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the surviving seven, four were breathing on their own and
were in stable condition at 9 a.m. Monday, the hospital reported.
No further update on the babies' condition was expected until this
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Breathing on their own Monday were, by nickname: Chidi, a girl,
born second; Echerem, a girl, born third; Chima, a girl, born
fourth, and Jioke, a boy, born seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Still on ventilators are Ebuka, a girl, born first; Ikem, a boy,
born sixth, and Gorom, a girl, born eighth, who had abdominal
surgery Saturday to repair an intestinal perforation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard Weisman, chief of Texas Children's Hospital's
Newborn Center, said Thursday that the babies would remain in
critical condition for many weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Chukwu and her husband, Iyke Louis Odobe, are naturalized
citizens from Nigeria. Each comes from families of eight children.
The names they chose for the octuplets reflect their heritage from
the Ibo people, one of the major ethnic groups in Nigeria. Each
child was given a formal name as well as a nickname. Chijindu
Chidera's nickname was Odera.
</P>
<P>
   The octuplets' parents, along with Chukwu's mother, visited the
babies for the first time Saturday evening about the time Odera's
condition began to deteriorate, according to a statement from Texas
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   As updates in the babies' condition are announced, they are
posted on Texas Children's Hospital's Worldwide Web site, which was
set up Dec. 20. The web site address is http://www.txchildrens.org
</P>
<P>
   The family has asked that donations be sent only to the
following address: The Chukwu Family Fund, c/o St. Luke's Episcopal
Hospital, 6900 Fannin, Suite 440, Houston, TX 77030. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the new production of ``Electra'' at the Barrymore
Theater, Zoe Wanamaker comes out onstage like a fist. ``Divine
light, sweet air, again hear my pain,'' she says in Electra's
opening speech.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny, with an upturned nose, glinty eyes, and a coat that is too
big for her, Ms. Wanamaker looks like an adult whose soul has
somehow been arrested in childhood. Because she can neither avenge
the murder of her father, Agamemnon, nor forgive her mother,
Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus, Electra remains suspended
between childhood and womanhood. ``I'm a childless woman who is
melting away,'' Electra says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a meteoric soul,'' Ms. Wanamaker said of the character
she has been playing on Broadway to standing ovations since
November. ``She's a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   The reviews for the production, Frank McGuinness' adaptation of
Sophocles' play, were strongly positive. In The New York Times,
Peter Marks called Ms. Wanamaker ``astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Electra is one of the theater's most taxing roles. She is a
passive figure around whom events swirl. (Only in Euripides'
version of the myth is Electra even present when her brother,
Orestes, finally murders their mother in revenge for their father's
death.) The part requires an actress who can transform suffering
into action.
</P>
<P>
   It is the role of Ms. Wanamaker's career, and despite the
exhaustion of eight shows a week, she is exhilarated. ``I knew,''
she said, in an interview in her Chelsea apartment. ``I knew
America would love it.''
</P>
<P>
   The agile Ms. Wanamaker, 49, jumped up to demonstrate her point,
clapped her hands, clenched her fists, giggled.
</P>
<P>
   Darting about to make tea, rolling her own cigarettes, she is
very different from the grief-riven figure at the Barrymore.
Patches of her head are shaved and reddened onstage to look as if
she has been tearing her hair out. ``I wanted her to look horrible,
like hell,'' Ms. Wanamaker said gleefully.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, Electra is in stark contrast to her mother,
Clytemnestra, played by Claire Bloom in a filmy, low-necked red
dress. ``Her mother who's abused her,'' said Ms. Wanamaker. ``She
hates her. But she's her mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wanamaker's performance is the result of a long accumulation
of personal experience. In a sense, she has been training for the
role for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has played alongside more great actresses _ Jane
Lapotaire, Judi Dench _ than any other actor in the British
stage,'' the director and playwright David Hare said in a telephone
interview from London. Ms. Wanamaker has appeared in several of his
plays.
</P>
<P>
   And as with Electra, Ms. Wanamaker has lived in the shadow of a
powerful and beloved father, Sam Wanamaker, the American actor and
director who for years campaigned to build a replica of
Shakespeare's Globe Theater in London. Ms. Wanamaker's mother was
the actress Charlotte Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wanamaker was ``an extraordinary, huge, imposing, rather
wonderful, dignified person,'' said Howard Davies, who directed Ms.
Wanamaker in ``Piaf.'' ``Zoe adored him. She wanted to follow in
her father's footsteps, make moral decisions about her work.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wanamaker died in 1993 and Ms. Holland in 1997, both from
cancer. ``There are some performances when you can scream and shout
and hang onto the curtains, and you don't feel it,'' Ms. Wanamaker
said. But her grief in this performance is authentic, she said.
``This has a lot to do with the loss of my parents.''

 NEW YORK: my parents.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Daughter of `a Strong Liberal'
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wanamaker was born in New York in 1949. The family moved to
London when Ms. Wanamaker was about 3. Her father was later
subpoenaed by the House Committee on Un-American Activities and was
subsequently blacklisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very strong liberal,'' Ms. Wanamaker said. ``When he
did `Joan of Lorraine' with Ingrid Bergman, Daddy refused to play
to a segregated theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he directed `Goodbye My Fancy,''' he continued, ``Ed
Sullivan wrote that it was a pinko production. That started it. I
don't think he was a member of the party. But a lot of people had
great hopes for the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s London was a haven for blacklisted American
artists. Sam Wanamaker became a figure to reckon with, one of the
first Method actors in England and one of the few Americans to act
in the Royal Shakespeare Company, as Iago, with Paul Robeson.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Wanamaker told her parents she wanted to be an actress,
they were horrified, she said. But she finally enrolled at the
Central School of Speech and Drama in London. ``My ambition was to
work in British repertory theater as much as I could. That was the
training my parents believed in.''
</P>
<P>
   She made her professional debut as Hermia in ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream.'' Early on, Hare directed her in a production of
``The Provoked Wife.'' ``She was the most extraordinary mixture of
self-confidence and self-doubt of any actor I've worked with,'' he
said. ``She was possessed of an extraordinary fluency in the way
she spoke. She seemed very damaged but sure of her ability to
act.''
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years on and off, Ms. Wanamaker worked in the Royal
Shakespeare Company. In ``Othello,'' she played Emilia to Ian
McKellen's Iago.
</P>
<P>
   American audiences saw her in Joe Orton's ``Loot,'' for which
she won a second Tony nomination for best featured actress. On the
television series ``Prime Suspect,'' she was Moyra Henson, an
ex-hooker who sticks with her companion despite the fact he might
be a serial killer. She had a role in ``Wilde,'' a film about Oscar
Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   But because of her perky looks, she was often cast in soubrette
roles. ``She forced her way into being what she does now,'' said
her husband, the actor and writer Gawn Grainger, ``a great classic
actress.''
</P>
<P>
   She broke through, she said, as Tessa, ``a very smart, bright
businesswoman who changed her career and started to work for famine
relief,'' in the 1992-94 BBC series ``Love Hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed my life completely,'' Ms. Wanamaker said. ``I
couldn't walk down the street'' without being recognized.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993 her father was dying. But he appeared at a fund-raising
event at the site of the new Globe. ``It was raining heavily,'' Ms.
Wanamaker told The Times of London. ``He stood there in silhouette
in the sheets of water, looking bigger than he was, thanking people
for their generosity. It was like seeing Moses and Lear in one.''
</P>
<P>
   After her father died, Ms. Wanamaker found comfort with
Grainger, an old friend whose wife had also died of cancer, leaving
him with two children, Eliza now 18, and Charlie, 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swore I'd never get married,'' she said. ``I was a child of
the '60s to whom marriage was not a groovy idea. I'd been in three
strong relationships, which were sort of marriages.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wanamaker and Grainger were married in 1994. ``I thought it
was important for the children,'' she said. ``After Daddy died
...'' She paused. ``We all confront our mortality.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of Electra came about at the suggestion of the
production's director, David Leveaux. He recalled: ``I said: `Don't
you think it's time you had a really good scream? Why don't we do
something we really want to do, something that is dangerous and a
challenge?' I wanted to see her go up and show what she's got.''
</P>
<P>
   `Too Many Greek Gods and Stuff'
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be adapted because there are too many Greek gods and
stuff in it,'' Ms. Wanamaker said. ``It gets in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In his adaptation of Sophocles, McGuinness did away with the
lofty tone of previous productions, which were influenced by
19th-century conceptions of Electra. ``What the 19th century did
was establish a heightened nobility, a loftiness in dramatic
heroines,'' said Leveaux. ``Classicism is not style, it's
necessity.''
</P>
<P>
   Her performance was inspired in part, Ms. Wanamaker said, by a
production of Strauss' ``Electra'' at Covent Garden. ``It was so
theatrical, so outrageous,'' she said. ``When Clytemnestra is
killed, there are 70 violins in the orchestra. The violins were
screaming. It is the most sustained sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wanamaker first appeared in ``Electra'' in 1997, at the
Chichester Festival. After the play was performed at the McCarter
Theater in Princeton, N.J., the producers wanted to move it to New
York. ``A lot of people turned us down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes!'' she added. But ``they all came'' to the opening.

PACKING RELIEF FOR HEALTH PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Jan. 3) 
(EDS: Ordering information is at the end of the column) 
(rl) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Medical preparations for trips to exotic places must include a
visit to a doctor or travel clinic for inoculations and advice. But
even trips to more conventional places like a spa in California or
your cousin's cabin in Colorado should involve gathering items for
first aid or other health problems that might arise.
</P>
<P>
   For many, this counsel is redundant. Some of my best friends are
hypochondriacs, and I do travel with them. I scoff when they climb
aboard with Merck Manuals bulging in their pockets, and a first-aid
kit that's the size of a carpenter's toolbox.
</P>
<P>
   If anything goes wrong, that kit is the first thing we rip open:
for sealed sterile pads to wipe wounds, small bandages for
blisters, something for diarrhea, elastic bandages, instant cold
packs and a variety of other items not always easily found,
particularly in the back country.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the one forced to carry it, the medical kit should
contain the essentials and little more. Liquids weigh a lot, so
one-shot containers of antiseptics are just fine. Be sure you have
enough rinse for contact lenses. Factory-sealed containers raise
fewer questions at customs frontiers than repacked pills or
ointments. If a group is going to be together the whole time, a
collective kit is a luggage economy. But be sure you have your own
extra pair of eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   The most important parts of the medical kit for anyone with a
chronic condition, and that means many people over 60, are hospital
records and extra copies of all prescriptions, written not for
trademark names but for generic names, and thus useful in
pharmacies everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Wolfe counsels the State Department on its employees'
travel needs as well as directing a travel clinic in Washington. He
says the first priority is gathering information to guide a doctor
who may have to treat you for the first time: X-rays or
electrocardiograms, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this information-gathering is an examination of health
insurance policies and medical evacuation coverage, he says. A
record should be made of all essential numbers, with telephone and
fax for your primary-care doctor or organization. All this should
be in carry-on bags.
</P>
<P>
   The new edition of ``Health Hints for the Tropics,'' edited by
Wolfe and published by the American Society of Tropical Medicine
and Hygiene, contains a practical list for a medical kit. Although
intended for tropical travel, the list can be amended for all sorts
of trips.
</P>
<P>
   The list is particularly helpful in providing generic names for
products as well as trade names: for example, dimenhydrinate
(Dramamine). Over-the-counter items may be hard to find under U.S.
trade names.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nonprescription items listed in the booklet are Ace
bandages, tincture of benzoin, dental floss and traveler's dental
kit, extra glasses or contact lenses, hearing-aid batteries,
thermometer, pocketknife, itch or sunburn medicine, Burow's
solution (for skin inflammation), sunscreen, insect repellent, a
mosquito net with the repellent permethrin, a water purification
device, oral rehydration salts for use in diarrhea, foot powder,
analgesics, antiseptics, laxatives, anti-diarrheals,
motion-sickness medicine, throat lozenges, antihistamines,
antacids, infant feeding materials, birth-control devices,
multivitamins and a Sawyer extractor pump for snake and insect
bites.
</P>
<P>
   The tropical-medicine group's list does not include two items I
consider useful. One is an instant cold pack. These light
5-by-4{-inch plastic packs of ammonium nitrate and water become
ice-cold when pounded or massaged. Activated, they are so cold they
are not supposed to be applied longer than 20 minutes because of
the danger of frostbite. Once activated, the packs cannot be used
again safely. They can be bought in pharmacies or from sports
specialty shops.
</P>
<P>
   As Disposable Cold Packs, they are available from Chinook
Medical Gear, P.O. Box 1736, Edwards, CO 81632, (800) 766-1365,
which sells three for $3.95 or 10 for $11.95, plus postage. This
company has a catalog of kits and individual items. On the Web, the
address is www.chinookmed.com.
</P>
<P>
   My other choice qualifies as first aid the same way that parents
of young children define ``emergency'' when they pull up the car in
areas marked ``emergency parking only.'' This item is called Brief
Relief. It is a zip-shut plastic pouch, with interior funnel, that
contains a material that congeals urine to an odorless gel. For
obvious reasons, they are favored by winter tent-campers. These are
sold in the latest Magellan's catalog in a four-pack for $9.85,
plus shipping. Magellan's, 110 West Sola St., Santa Barbara, CA
93101; (800) 962-4943.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $5 ``Health Hints'' booklet, which has 54
pages packed with information, the Society of Tropical Medicine has
just issued the 1998 edition of its directory of specialists in
tropical medicine, parasites and travelers' health. People
preparing for travel who want a reference to a specialist pre- or
post-travel can find one here; the names of practitioners and
clinics are cross-referenced by state and town.
</P>
<P>
   This book is free to those who send a 9-by-12 envelope with
$1.70 postage (for U.S. addresses). For the booklet and the
directory, send a check for $6.70 and the unstamped envelope to:
American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 60 Revere Drive,
Suite 500, Northbrook, IL 60062; www.astmh.org on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-to-Find Books
</P>
<P>
   Right now two reliable, inexpensive publications for travelers
are scarce or out of print, so the tropical-medicine booklets may
be the best game in town. The federal Centers for Disease Control's
``Health Information for International Travel,'' in its most recent
edition, 1996-97, is in modest supply at the government Printing
Office. The new edition is due sometime in May, in a new format.
The old one costs $20 from the Superintendent of Documents,
Washington, D.C. 20402, where it is publication 017-023-00197-3. It
can also be found at www.cdc.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit International Society of Travel Medicine's Clinic
Directory is now out of print, and the organization is seeking
sponsorship for a new edition.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Oil Co., as part of an auto-safety campaign, has urged
that all cars contain a first-aid kit with the following: bandages,
adhesive tape, scissors, blankets, latex gloves, a mouth guard (for
artificial respiration), flashlights, flares and reflectors, plus
change for a pay telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Shell has also published a series of booklets: ``Crash Course,
Simple Tips That Could Help Save Lives,'' ``Driving Dangers'' and
``Kids in the Car.'' The simple tips are worth keeping in the car.
Among other things, they give a quick explanation of artificial
respiration steps for those who have not taken an EMS course. These
booklets are available free at Shell stations, by phone at (800)
376-0200, or on the Web at www.countonshell.com.

SCHROEDER AIDE TYPIFIES THE CONTRADICTORY NEW GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN _ From the neck down, Otto Schily, Germany's interior
minister, is very much the bourgeois gentleman: pocket watch,
tailored suit, elegant cuff links, somber tie. But look up at his
mischievous eyes and unruly hair, and some of the contradictions of
the man and his country begin to come into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Schily, who represents law and order in this most ordered of
nations, is an iconoclast: a defender of the revolutionary Red Army
Faction during the 1960s, celebrated lawyer in the 1970s, founder
of the environmentalist Green Party in the 1980s, tough Social
Democrat in the 1990s and bon vivant with a love for Tuscany
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is changing. In place of the monolithic figure of Helmut
Kohl, with his taste for sausages and his unswerving dedication to
Europe and the trans-Atlantic alliance, a new class of Germans has
come to power. They are more checkered in their pasts, more nuanced
in their allegiances _ and more inclined, like Schily, to love
olive oil than wurst.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is no longer a prisoner of the Cold War. It is ever less
a prisoner of its past. It is learning, fitfully, to relax and is
now full of people like Schily, who have walked a long German road
to emancipation.
</P>
<P>
   To allies, including the United States, this change is
disorienting. It involves a departure from the scene of the
predictable German _ solid, solemn, unsurprising. But to Schily and
his colleagues it is a sign of democratic maturity.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 66, the interior minister is the doyen of the new
``Red-Green'' government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. He is
also, in his long journey from protest to power, a typical figure.
</P>
<P>
   Like the chancellor, a former Marxist, and like Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer, a revolutionary agitator in the 1960s, Schily once
flirted with the far left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not of the 1960s generation,'' Schily said. ``I had a
steady job as a lawyer and a family by then _ but I was drawn in.
And I think that even if 1968 was a failure in the end, it
contributed decisively to the birth of civil society in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   And what, then, was the Germany that predated this civil
society? ``For a long time after the war,'' he said, ``we had the
old German system of being subject to authority. Germany in the
1960s was a repressive society. It took a long time even to talk of
certain things, and perhaps it is only recently that we have
achieved a true democratic opening and overcome our fear of
change.''
</P>
<P>
   As interior minister, Schily will oversee one of the decisive
changes proposed by Schroeder's government: the scrapping of old
immigration laws based principally on German stock or bloodlines
and the introduction of legislation to enable many of the 7.4
million foreigners to become citizens. That number now includes
many children born to immigrants in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   This shift, with its implicit acknowledgment of the country's
multi-ethnic makeup, seems likely, over time, to alter Germany's
self-image. For Schily, it is a step ``of historic dimensions.''
But he says this with a relaxed smile, one that says change is in
the nature of democracy _ a normal thing, part of the ebb and flow
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   He is among the many Germans who have followed their country
from Allied tutelage to independent statehood, to the first
stirrings of unrest, to Willy Brandt's memorable call in 1972 for
``risking more democracy,'' to prosperity, unification and, at
last, the freedom that lies in the conviction that the country has
earned the right to chart its own course.
</P>
<P>
   But that freedom, for the interior minister, clearly comes with
a keen sense of responsibility. Schily is no starry-eyed reformer.
Listen to him on the subject of admitting new immigrants:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached the limits, the point where we have to say we
cannot bear any more. The majority of Germans agree with me: Zero
immigration for now. The burden has become too great. I would not
even dare publish the costs that stem from immigration. The Greens
say we should take 200,000 more immigrants a year. But I say to
them, show me the village, the town, the region that would take
them. There are no such places.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, as Germany sets about offering citizenship to
foreigners already inside the country _ who amount to about 9
percent of the population and constitute by far the largest number
of foreigners in a European state _ it is not about to open its
doors to others. Germany, for Schily, must be tolerant but not
permissive.
</P>
<P>
   The interior minister has long walked such fine lines, formed by
the tension between impulse and rigor.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a distinguished family _ his father was a prominent
industrialist and another forebear, Victor Schily, was a close
friend of Karl Marx _ he spent his adolescence during the war in
Bavaria. The family opposed Hitler, and Schily recalled the Nazis
storming into the family home in 1941 and ripping up books.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he moved to West Berlin, studied law and set up
practice in a conservative law firm. Here, in the rarefied
atmosphere of a city that became a magnet to artists and
intellectuals, he found that the idealistic view of the United
States he had formed during the war was progressively eroded by
Vietnam and by American support for what he called ``the shah's
police state in Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, 1967, he went to a demonstration in Berlin against
the violation of human rights in Iran. A student, Benno Ohnesorg,
was shot dead by police. Shocked and outraged, Schily, then 34,
decided to represent the student's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time,'' he said, ``an egg on the boot of a policeman
was officially called a breach of the peace. I felt very critical
of the whole political situation, and compelled to make a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Notoriety came from the Ohnesorg case. As the Red Army Faction
extended its insurrectionary operations, Schily emerged as a
natural choice to defend the likes of Andreas Baader and Gudrun
Ensslin.
</P>
<P>
   He did so with energy and determination, but unlike other
defense lawyers _ including Klaus Croissant and Hans-Christian
Strobele _ he was never charged with involvement in the terrorist
movement and never arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have refused,'' Schily said, ``but I still believe
that people like Ensslin deserved a defense. That was an
antiliberal time and the atmosphere was very tense. We were under
enormous psychological pressure, and I still say that these court
proceedings had no value from the point of view of the rule of law.
How can you work in court and be made to feel accused yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Glotz, dean of Erfurt University, who has long known the
interior minister, said: ``Schily accepted the cases through a
basic conviction that everyone deserves a lawyer. He was always a
radical liberal, never a supporter of terrorist methods or aims. He
also enjoyed being in the public eye, as he does now. But principle
drove him.''
</P>
<P>
   So, apparently, did ambition. A latecomer to politics, Schily
worked with Petra Kelly as a founding member of the Greens in the
late 1970s and was one of the party's three spokesmen when it first
entered the Legislature in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He had been moved to help forge the party by an interest in
ecology and a desire to open up Germany's relatively closed
political system, rather than by strong support for the pacifism
espoused by the Greens. ``We opened up a closed shop,'' he said,
``and that in itself was a critical catharsis for Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   But the sharply dressed lawyer, dealing in the real world with a
strong streak of pragmatism, was always something of an anomaly
among the tree-hugging Greens. Schily became impatient with the
party's egalitarianism _ ``Promis'' (prominent people) were always
suspect _ and with the refusal of the party's ``Fundis''
(fundamentalists) to confront the realities of the fight for
political power. He finally abandoned the Greens in 1989 and joined
the Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his relations with the Greens are uneasy, strained by his
hard-nosed statements on further immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you be liberal to foreigners who are here, and so hard
to those who want to come?'' said Cem Ozdemir, a Green legislator
of Turkish descent. ``Mr. Schily's policy is going to create the
impression of a double standard, and I fear that prejudice will be
reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   But the interior minister seems unlikely to change his stance to
placate the Social Democrats' junior coalition partners. Like
Schroeder, he knows that even in a changed Germany, the middle
ground remains important. To have struggled so long with the left
is to know the power of German conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a question of being immigration-friendly, or
immigration- hostile,'' Schily said, his eyes glinting. ``It is
merely a question of reality.''
</P>

3-D SPACE TRIPS AT CHICAGO MUSEUM 
VAN GOGH PACKAGES IN LOS ANGELES 
MAKING TIME IN COPENHAGEN
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Jan. 3)

<P>
   If the return to space by John Glenn and the start of
construction of the international space station has put you in the
mood for space travel, a new exhibition opening on Friday in
Chicago may be a good first stop. The Adler Planetarium and
Astronomy Museum's Sky Pavilion, a 60,000-square-foot wing,
contains four galleries, including an interactive 3-D theater that
simulates space travel.
</P>
<P>
   The first show, ``Journey to Infinity,'' will take visitors on a
trip to places they choose using keypads on each of the theater's
193 seats. Three computer systems are used to project
three-dimensional graphics on a 55-foot-diameter dome, giving the
sensation of flying past planets and stars.
</P>
<P>
   The system can vary with each show, as the visitors choose to go
to Jupiter, say, instead of Mars. When the audience decides what
the destination is (by ``voting'' on the keypad), one or more
members get to ``steer'' the spaceship for the group, again using
the keypads.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the theater, the Sky Pavilion offers a 3-D fly-through
of the Milky Way in the Ameritech Gallery; a computerized animated
look at the birth of the solar system in the Formations Theater;
and ``From the Night Sky to the Big Bang,'' a presentation that
deals with the history of cosmology and current theory in the
Pritzker Cosmology Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The new wing also contains the Galileo cafe and the Shooting
Star gift shop. With the opening of the Sky Pavilion, the museum's
original 1930 building is being closed for renovation. It is
scheduled to reopen in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Adler Planetarium and Astronomy Museum is on the Museum
Campus on Lake Shore Drive, with the Field Museum and Shedd
Aquarium. The Adler is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to
Thursday, until 9 p.m. on Friday and 6 p.m. on weekends. Admission:
$5, $4 for ages 65 and older and 17 and under. The Star Rider show
costs an additional $5. Through Jan. 12, there will be free
admission to the building, but not to the Star Rider show.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK:   OF OVERSTUFFED OPERAS, AND THE MET AS
VICTORIAN DRAWING ROOM
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You have to be careful about reading too much into
the reactions of audiences at the Metropolitan Opera. After all,
opera buffs are passionate sorts, prone to fleeting enthusiasms as
well as die-hard devotions. Last season, when avant-garde director
and designer Robert Wilson took a curtain call at the premiere of
his production of Wagner's ``Lohengrin,'' he was vehemently booed.
Nonetheless, when the glacially paced production with its abstract
light-shaft sets returned this fall, Wilson bravely took the stage
again, this time to cheers and bravos.
</P>
<P>
   But when the team responsible for the Met's new production of
Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' took a collective bow at the
work's premiere earlier this month, the lusty boos that erupted
were surprising and significant. Nicolas Joel's production was not
some avant-garde outrage or gratuitous updating. At least in
intention, this was a traditional ``Lucia'' with the gilded scenery
and costumed finery that Met audiences usually enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   It was simply bad, appallingly bad, a jumble of clunky,
pointlessly ornate sets and unbecoming costumes, dimly lighted and
further blurred by annoying scrims. The cast, with the respected
soprano Ruth Ann Swenson singing her first Lucia at the house,
seemed to have been given scant direction, for everyone performed
with barely concealed panic. The production was all the more
distressing coming just two weeks after the grotesquely overdone
new production by Franco Zeffirelli of Verdi's ``Traviata,'' which
most critics savaged.
</P>
<P>
   How can the Met go so wrong? This is, after all, the most
prestigious and powerful opera company in the world, with an
operating budget this year of $165 million. For a major production,
like ``La Traviata,'' the Met will spend some $2.5 million
(including everything from materials to hotel rooms for visiting
crews). But an operatic production is not just a theatrical
showcase for a concert in costume. Opera is theater, and even on a
musical level the fine singers the Met can attract need the
coaching of a strong and insightful production team to fully
realize their portrayals. The public assumes that the Met should be
able to recruit any director or designer it wants. It that not
true?
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the question recently, Joseph Volpe, the Met's
general manager, offered a typically feisty rebuttal. ``You can get
younger, talented designers and directors and let them take some
risks with 20th-century works,'' he said. ``And also for less
central works in the repertory. Not as much is at stake, and our
record here is strong.'' Hard-core, knowledgeable opera fans, he
added, will turn out for unusual repertory, and they mostly welcome
innovation and freshness.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles have mostly come from productions of the
``bread-and-butter operas,'' as Volpe called them, that appeal to
the larger public. ``When we do the `Bohemes,' the `Toscas,' the
`Traviatas,' we have to find something that will serve us for 20 or
25 years in the style that works for our public,'' he said. ``And
we need to keep the public happy, to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do these operas in a traditional way and it is more
and more difficult to find producers who can do this. It's becoming
a thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. The sumptuously grand 19th-century approach seems
increasingly incongruous as the 21st century looms. For years,
Zeffirelli had the market for the traditional cornered. Many
critics have been stupefied by his extravagant productions of, say,
Puccini's ``Tosca'' and ``Turandot.'' (The New York Times critic
Bernard Holland, describing the Imperial Palace scene in
``Turandot'' with its blindingly silvery sets and tacky opulence,
once wrote, ``If the gods eat dim sum, they certainly do it in a
place like this.'' But these Zeffirelli extravaganzas have been
luring audiences to the house for years.
</P>
<P>
   Zeffirelli's record in recent years is abysmal. Yet the Met
can't seem to stop pouring millions down ``the Zeffirelli
sinkhole,'' as the critic Manuela Hoelterhoff put it in her new
book, ``Cinderella &AMP; Company,'' an incisive and hilariously honest
examination of the Cecilia Bartoli phenomenon and the backstage
opera world. Zeffirelli, who is 75, was ``once a charming provider
of suitably flamboyant shows, including a picturesque `La
Boheme,''' Ms. Hoelterhoff writes, but has become ``a
long-in-the-tooth recycler of sequins and non sequiturs.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeffirelli's new production of Bizet's ``Carmen'' two seasons
ago was a clueless, chaotic disaster, with a menagerie of horses,
donkeys and doggies mixed into the crowd scenes. ``There were so
many overdressed Spaniards, lurching cripples, cavorting urchins
and raggedy beggars milling around the plaza,'' Ms. Hoelterhoff
writes, ``Maria Callas herself could have come and gone
unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the Met wanted a new ``Traviata,'' it turned, almost
desperately, to Zeffirelli, who was responsible for the
smotheringly opulent previous ``Traviata.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurgen Flimm, a touted German director, and designer Erich
Wonder had first been entrusted with the job, Volpe explained:
``They had a couple of good ideas, but they came in with designs
that made Paris look like Vienna. It wasn't going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   With the dates fixed, Volpe called Zeffirelli, who was initially
uninterested. ``So I said, `Franco, I really need you to do it.'''
Volpe recounted. ``He was the only one who could deliver in a short
time something that would work for the Met. I believe he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have ripped into the gaudy results. I would love to be a
fly on the wall when the female dancers dressed as cows in spotted
leotards with horned headdresses wait in the wings to enter the
decadent Act III party scene, which even Volpe admitted is over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   But, he also pointed out that audiences have been oohing and
ahhing their approval of the sets and spectacle. The Met serves
different segments of operagoers, and some patrons continue to
adore Zeffirelli's notion of grandeur.

CLINTON DEFENDS MILITARY FORCE IN IRAQ 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton Monday staunchly defended the
latest American show of military force in Iraq, saying U.S.
warplanes fired back after being attacked by Iraqi missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pilots have the authority to protect themselves if they're
threatened or attacked. They took appropriate action today in
responding to Iraq's actions,'' said Clinton, speaking about the
incident before a Social Security event. ``They attacked because
they were attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred at about 1:30 p.m. Iraq time, or 5:30 a.m
EST in the skies near Mosul, more than 200 miles north of Baghdad,
according to Pentagon officials. After being targeted by radar and
attacked with surface-to-air missiles, the U.S. crews responded by
firing missiles of their own at the Iraqi air defense site.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that U.S. and British air crews were flying
over northern Iraq as part of their routine duties to enforce
no-fly zones in the northern and southern sectors of the country,
when they were fired upon.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesmen said that all planes involved in the
operation and their crews returned to base safely.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi spokesmen said that the U.S. missiles killed four soldiers
and injured seven others. The Iraqi News Agency reported that
defense forces ``almost certainly shot down an enemy plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations dismissed U.S. arguments
that the pilots were acting in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the U.S.) said they acted in their own defense as if
Texas or Florida was attacked,'' said Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon.
``Iraq has always said that there is no way that it could recognize
the no-fly zones. They are illegal and they have not been
established by United Nations resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The military skirmish is the first since the United States and
Britain engaged in an air assault on Iraq from Dec. 16-20 in an
effort to destroy sites suspect of containing weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bombings, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein has made
increasingly belligerent comments aimed at the United States and
has refused to let U.N. weapons inspectors back into the country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that enforcing the no-fly zones was essential to
the U.S. policy of containing Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we effectively control the skies over much of a Iraq,
Saddam has been unable to use air power to repress his own people
or to lash out again at his neighbors,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The northern no-fly zone, extending above the 36th parallel, has
been in effect since the end of the Gulf War in 1991, and was
designed to protect Kurdish rebels from attacks by Saddam's forces.
</P>
<P>
   Details of Monday's incidents were sketchy and the Pentagon did
not hold any official briefings on the engagement.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that at least three SAMs were
fired at U.S. aircraft and that the pilots retaliated by firing
HARM anti-radar missiles at the air defense site.
</P>
<P>
   One report indicated that additional aircraft may have been sent
to the target for bombing runs, and U.S. officials told AP there
were at least two direct hits on Iraqi air defense sites.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon spokesman said there was no damage to the U.S.
aircraft, which included F-15s and EA-6B planes, or to two British
tankers that were along to refuel the warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the damage to Iraqi military installations
was still being assessed. &QL;

 NEW YORK: ... of grandeur. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent seasons, some of the strongest Met productions have
been in 20th-century repertory, as Volpe emphasized. Knowing that
core audiences will come, the company takes more chances. Volpe
singled out Tim Albery's abstract production of Britten's
``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' Graham Vick's vividly modern updating
of Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District'' and Mark
Lamos' spare yet imposing production of Berg's ``Wozzeck'' (which
is returning on April 17). Critics differed on these productions,
but each represented imaginative and strong work, and if the houses
were not full, audiences were overwhelmingly enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   In older but less well-known operas, the Met is also more
adventurous. No recent work better exemplifies this than Elijah
Moshinsky's production of Tchaikovsky's ``Queen of Spades'' (which
can be seen again starting on March 18). This is opera on a grand
scale, with stage-filling sets and large rosters of strikingly
costumed choristers. Yet, with its bold color scheme, daring use of
blacks and grays, and geometric designs, the production seems
modern as well. Again, critics are not unanimous about its success,
but some gave ecstatic praise, and few disputed the vision
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a vital middle ground between the traditional and
the avant-garde, represented by the 1996 production by Lesley
Koenig of Mozart's ``Cosi Fan Tutte,'' with sets by Michael
Yeargan. With its sunny colors and airy beauty, the production
wonderfully evoked the opera's setting: in the first scene, on the
shores of the Mediterranean in Naples, you could practically smell
the salt water. Yet, the look of it was spare in a way that seemed
modern and fresh. ``Cosi'' is not a bread-and-butter opera, so the
Met dares to recruit a younger, fresh talent like Ms. Koenig. But
hiring her to produce a new ``Traviata'' would have been too risky,
Volpe said. ``I don't know that she's ready for that,'' he said.
``It's a lot of pressure. Too big a gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Volpe has his own sense of the stakes involved.
Wasn't turning over the new ``Traviata'' to the creatively spent
producer and designer responsible for the old one also too big a
gamble?
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Lucia'' lacks even the redeeming quality of
Zeffirellian opulence. Joel, as the New York magazine critic Peter
G. Davis wrote, ``cannot even get a chorus on or offstage
gracefully, let alone liven the action with dramatic tension or
character development.'' Most sadly, the lead singers, at least on
opening night, seemed woefully lacking in direction, particularly
Ms. Swenson, who, at her best, is a technically exquisite vocalist.
Though several sopranos have greater coloratura agility and more
fearless brilliance, few sing with Ms. Swenson's sheer sonorous
beauty and unforced fullness of tone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, never the most compelling presence, she needs the
guidance of a good director and a sensitive conductor. In awarding
her with this touchstone role in a new production, the Met provided
neither. As the company's artistic director, James Levine cannot do
everything. In fact, he is criticized by some for doing too much.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has been singularly uninterested in Ms. Swenson's
specialty, the bel canto repertory. Perhaps Carlo Rizzi, who
conducted the ``Lucia,'' was trying mightily to support a singer
out of her depth in a daunting role, which was the view of some
critics. But, for whatever reasons, the conductor and the soprano
seemed at odds all night. The orchestra played sluggishly; the
chorus, which can be so splendid, sounded terrible.
</P>
<P>
   One hopes the company will stick by Ms. Swenson. Levine has
accomplished what he has with the orchestra by making long-term
growth his mantra. He has nurtured many Met singers with similar
patience, like the baritone Dwayne Croft, who has grown into a
major artist, and the soprano Renee Fleming, whose sublime
portrayal of the countess in the new Jonathan Miller production of
Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro'' will enter operatic lore. (``I was
there,'' wizened opera buffs will brag some day.)
</P>
<P>
   For future productions, there are encouraging signs at the
company. Lamos has been tapped for the premiere of John Harbison's
``Great Gatsby.'' Flimm will produce ``Fidelio.'' Albery will
return, this time for ``The Merry Widow,'' which Volpe promises
will not be ``all froufrou and pretty,'' but rethought and
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Martin Scorsese to take on ``Il Trovatore,'' and though
intrigued, the director said his work in film must come first,
which is too bad. You can just imagine Verdi's Gypsies steeped in
bonding rituals like a fearsome family of Mafia goodfellas.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe has even held discussions with Francesca Zambello,
excoriated for her nightmarishly surreal 1992 production of
``Lucia,'' which the new one replaces. ``We all had a bad
experience with that,'' Volpe said. ``But she is a talented artist
and should work here. We must find the right piece, however.'' You
can bet it will not be a bread-and-butter opera.
</P>
<P>
   Still, would it not have been better for the Met to stick with
the old Zeffirelli ``Traviata'' rather than replace it in panic
with another, given its empty extravagance? Around the house on
``Lucia's'' opening night, wistful talk was heard about Ms.
Zambello's production. At least it had a point of view.

   CAMBODIA-DEFECTORS (Phnom Penh, Cambodia) _ Defying
international pressure to put top leaders of the Khmer Rouge on
trial, Prime Minister Hun Sen says that they should be welcomed
``with bouquets of flowers, not with prisons and handcuffs.'' By
Seth Mydans. 1,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   TV-RACE (Undated) _ Prime-time television has rarely been as
racially divided as it is today, both in terms of casts and
audiences, a fact most striking in network television's dominant
form of entertainment, comedy. Networks, under enormous pressure to
maximize dwindling profits, have been focusing on the more numerous
and generally more affluent white households that advertisers
prefer. By James Sterngold. With graphic and sidebar,
TV-RACE-HISTORY. 2,600 words.

<P>
   IRAQ-U.S. (Washington) _ U.S. fighter jets patrolling northern
Iraq attack an Iraqi missile battery after coming under fire in
what appeared to be an attempt to provoke a new confrontation with
the United States, the Clinton administration said. By Steven Lee
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   With: IRAQ-U.N.
</P>
<P>
   HOLIDAY-SHOPPING (New York) _ When the first reports on holiday
season sales for Internet retailers were released, the results were
huge. The increases came despite glitches that forced consumers to
suffer indignities like being denied access to retailers' Web sites
and holiday gifts that did not arrive on time. The most optimistic
estimates of holiday sales came from a subsidiary of InterPublic
Group of Cos., whose survey of 1,000 consumers suggested that
online sales would reach $5 billion. By Leslie Kaufman and Saul
Hansell.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-MINISTER-PROFILE (Bonn) _ From the neck down, the German
interior minister, Otto Schily, is very much the bourgeois
gentleman. But look up at the mischievous eyes and unruly hair, and
some of the contradictions of the man and his country begin to come
into focus. The official who represents law and order in this most
ordered of nations, is an iconoclast: a defender of the
revolutionary Red Army Faction during the 1960s, celebrated lawyer
in the 1970s, founder of the environmentalist Green Party in the
1980s, tough Social Democrat in the 1990s and bon vivant with a
love for Tuscany throughout. By Roger Cohen. 1,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   ADOPTION-SIBLINGS (Boston) _ Lawyers in a Massachusetts adoption
case have asked the Supreme Court to use it to declare a new
national rule that brothers and sisters have a constitutional right
to be together. Their argument, family law experts say, is at the
forefront of a growing legal movement that is pressing to change
the focus in custody disputes from the rights of adults to the
rights of children. By William Glaberson. With photo. 1,800 words.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER-DOWNTOWN (Denver) _ The return to downtown living in
eastern cities is well-known but that it is happening in the
automobile-loving cities of the West is part of a new trend that is
expected to take hold over the next few years. One of the cities
viewed by experts as a model is Denver, where a burst of downtown
development is aimed at the returning residents, largely baby
boomers whose kids have grown and left home. By James Brooke. With
map and photo. 1,800 words.

<P>
   IMPEACH (Washington) _ He has the impeachment vote he sought
from the House. Now Rep. Henry Hyde is in search of a strategy for
an impeachment trial in the Senate. On Tuesday, Hyde and the 12
Republican congressmen he picked to manage President Clinton's
Senate trial will meet for the first time since the historic House
vote on Dec. 19 to begin mapping out the prosecution's game plan.

<HEADLINE>
FROM `NYPD BLUE' TO `SIN CITY,' THE YEAR'S BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picking the best of 1998 is a little like reliving the laughs in
``Our American Cousin,'' the play the Lincolns attended on (set
ital)that(end ital) night.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, the central point of the year in television is that it
was a lousy year for television. But good work still got done, and
there's no sense penalizing those who did it for the sins of the
real culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Most Top 10 lists for 1998 include, and maybe even begin with,
Tom Hanks' Emmy champion, ``From the Earth to the Moon,'' which ran
on HBO. Mine doesn't. I thought there was plenty to admire about
Hanks' space saga, but it was a stupefyingly slow creep skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Also missing is the year's most hyped entertainment event, the
``Seinfeld'' finale. I liked the way ``Seinfeld'' bowed out by
putting itself on trial. But Top 10? Huh-uh.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my own Top 10 list, in no particular order. And remember,
there's no point doing the conniption thing. It's only TV.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Lateline.'' For some reason, television viewers never have
liked television spoofs of television itself, unless you count the
old SCTV cult. This NBC series didn't spring to the front of the
Nielsen ratings, either, though it has earned a second shot
beginning January 6.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Al Franken stars as the schlemiel Al Freundlich,
a spectacularly uncharismatic correspondent for a
``Nightline''-type news program. Word is, Franken's character will
be de-emphasized when ``Lateline'' returns.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Sports Night.'' For some reason, television viewers never
have liked television spoofs of tel ... Oops, sorry.
</P>
<P>
   But this fall series from ABC, no better than so-so when it
premiered, gathered steam through the fall and is now regarded as a
potential classic, if only it can survive for a second season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' mocks ESPN's signature show ``SportsCenter,''
but it's not just for laughs. The show is the latest incarnation of
the TV dramedy _ half comedy, half drama and all risky.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Africans in America: America's Journey Through Slavery.''
The six-hour PBS series showed how indentured servitude evolved
into race-based slavery and haunted a nation ... well, forever.
Executive producer Orlando Bagwell amply documented his primary
point and never strayed far from it. Slavery was barbaric and, from
the beginning, was accompanied by tension and resistance.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``An Evening With the Rat Pack.'' Frank Sinatra died this
year, amid a flurry of nostalgia for his Rat Pack's boozy high
times. For one thing, there was a failed HBO movie. But the TV Land
cable channel, a kid brother in the MTV and Nickelodeon family,
found the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Never before seen nationally, ``An Evening With the Rat Pack''
was a 1965 charity concert from St. Louis with Sinatra, Dean
Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and, filling in as host, a young Johnny
Carson. It was the legends in perfect form. Sinatra, swinging
through ``I've Got You Under My Skin,'' ``Luck Be a Lady'' and
``You Make Me Feel So Young.'' Martin, treating his own hit songs
like yesterday's refuse. Davis, talented but helplessly over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Penn &AMP; Teller's Sin City Spectacular.'' Admittedly, my
oddball choice. But this FX cable series from Las Vegas is more
(set ital)alive(end ital) than 98 percent of the filler material on
network prime time.
</P>
<P>
   A sly mixture of smarts and tacky excess, the show also was a
refreshing throwback to TV's supposedly extinct variety format. The
genre has been dead so long that Penn and Teller make it seem
newborn. Maybe when you get right down to it, though, I was won
over by the appearance of Irving, the talking dog, in the show's
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Shot Through the Heart.'' This HBO movie was the astonishing
true story of best friends who found themselves on opposite sides
of the deadly sniper war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Unfettered by advertisers and almost totally immune from the
tyranny of ratings, HBO is free to make its movies right. Often
enough, it does.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, actors Linus Roache and Vincent Perez were cast
because they were right for the roles, not because of any inherent
box office appeal. And ``Shot Through the Heart'' was a grim movie
about a war few Americans understood. An uncompromising, humanistic
experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The American Experience: Ronald Reagan.'' Documentary
producers Austin Hoyt and Adriana Bosch found their defining
metaphor in one of Reagan's first jobs. He was a summer lifeguard
in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Already the future president saw himself as a rescue artist, a
frame of mind he'd later apply to the Screen Actors Guild, the
state of California, the United States and, ultimately, the
non-communist world.
</P>
<P>
   The riveting profile of the 40th president also caught the great
dichotomy in Reagan: the friendly, straightforward charmer who is
utterly unknowable. ``You're not going to figure him out,'' his son
Ron Reagan said on camera. ``That's the first thing you need to
know. ... I haven't figured him out. I don't know anybody who's
figured him out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Cold War.'' CNN's 24-hour history of the Cold War began
in September and continues into April. That's a lot of heft. But
executive producer Jeremy Isaacs (``World at War'') has crafted an
old-fashioned historical documentary that's just as brisk as it is
informative.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs doesn't believe in heavy analysis; he prefers anecdotes
with a human touch. But hour after hour, the program demonstrates
that the Cold War was scorchingly real, &LR;  and hardly bloodless.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``P.O.V.: Kelly Loves Tony.'' Bay Area filmmaker Spencer
Nakasako has something in common with the novelist Tom Wolfe.
Wolfe, in ``A Man in Full,'' and Nakasako, in this installment from
PBS' ``P.O.V.'' documentary series, bottled rough truths about the
working class deep in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   A young Laotian couple, Kelly Saeteurn and Tony Saelio, used a
camcorder from Nakasako to document their own lives for a year and
a half. Saeteurn emerged strongly on videotape as a woman stretched
almost to breaking between two cultures.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``NYPD Blue: Hearts and Souls.'' Bobby Simone (Jimmy Smits)
went gently in a stunner of an episode that might have been TV's
finest hour of power all year.
</P>
<P>
   In lesser hands, this sensitive episode could have been _
probably would have been _ unbearably maudlin. But abetted by
wonderful performances all around, the ``NYPD Blue'' team proved
that there's such a thing as death with dignity, even in the midst
of the November sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Rick Schroder joined the cast as Smits'
replacement, and ``NYPD Blue'' strode toward new directions. But an
afterglow remains from the ``Hearts and Souls'' episode. In death,
something was regained.

IN KONYA, THE FESTIVAL OF RUMI, POET OF LIFE'S DANCE

 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KONYA, Turkey _ Every year around this time, the streets of
Konya are decorated with images of whirling dervishes, the Islamic
mystics who seek to commune with the infinite through ecstatic
dance. From lampposts and bus shelters, they look beatifically down
on the throngs bustling along cold streets.
</P>
<P>
   These images mark the annual festival commemorating Jalaluddin
Rumi, who conceived the dervish dance as part of his lifelong quest
for religious rapture. He is not only Konya's most famous son, but
also a poet and visionary revered by millions as one of history's
great spiritual masters.
</P>
<P>
   For a week every December, this Anatolian city of nearly two
million becomes the world capital of the Rumi cult. Pilgrims and
tourists fill hotels and pay homage at the elaborately decorated
mausoleum where he is buried. There are lectures, exhibitions and
twice-daily performances of the hypnotic dervish dance.
</P>
<P>
   This annual event is Konya's main tourist attraction. Dozens of
shops sell porcelain dervishes, dervish necklaces, dervish tie
clips and cigarette lighters bearing what is supposed to be Rumi's
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Kernels of spirituality are still to be found here, but they
float on a sea of kitsch and political controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Rumi, who is known in Turkey as Mevlana, or ``our master,'' was
born in Central Asia in 1207. His father, himself a Muslim mystic,
fled before the advance of Genghis Khan's horde, and a few years
later the family arrived in Konya.
</P>
<P>
   Here Rumi became a passionate lover of God, and here he wrote
thousands of poems that overflow with awe at the power of love.
Although he used a religious vocabulary, he scorned the rituals and
dogma of established faiths. He believed that truth is to be found
in each human heart and proclaimed himself ``not Christian or Jew
or Muslim, not Hindu, Buddhist, sufi or zen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The door is open to everybody,'' he wrote. ``There are
hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumi's esoteric and pantheistic teachings, along with his belief
that ``worldly power means nothing,'' have irritated the political
authorities in many places. Modern Turkey is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, was
an outspoken secularist, and soon after taking power in 1923 he
banned all religious orders, which he considered bastions of
ignorance. Dervishes could meet and perform their rituals only in
secret until 1954, when their order was legalized and the annual
celebration in Konya was allowed to resume.
</P>
<P>
   But the dancers who perform in Konya every December are members
of a folklore troupe, not true dervishes seeking to transport
themselves ``hundreds of miles from the mind,'' as Rumi wished.
They dance on a basketball court before large and evidently
appreciative crowds, their white skirts billowing as they twirl.
</P>
<P>
   What they offer is as much show as spiritual inspiration. That
is the way the government, which remains highly suspicious of
Islamic brotherhoods, wants it.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Turkish Army is a bulwark of secularism, and its
sensitivity to what it considers creeping fundamentalism was on
graphic display here at the beginning of this month's celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of a Konya district, Ismail Oksuzler, spoke at the
opening of an Islamic art exhibition and told his audience: ``Every
person will one day turn to dust, whether they are mayors,
governors or generals. All should recognize their limits.''
</P>
<P>
   That was too much for one guest, Gen. Mehmet Kenzi Sumer,
commander of the Konya garrison. Interpreting the mayor's comment
as an oblique attack on military authority, he leapt to his feet
and shouted: ``You cannot dictate my authority! You cannot insult
the Turkish Army!''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor quickly apologized and insisted, perhaps ingenuously,
that he was seeking only to reflect Rumi's ideals. Sumer refused to
accept the apology and retorted, ``Whatever is necessary will be
done about you.''
</P>
<P>
   At the museum here, which houses not only Rumi's tomb but also
his robes and original manuscripts of his poems in gloriously
illuminated Persian, some Turkish visitors complain that the
government is suppressing part of the great man's message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to cleanse myself spiritually, to learn how to rid
myself of worldly things and come closer to God,'' said a
21-year-old college student who wore a head scarf symbolizing her
commitment to Islam and who asked to be identified only by her
first name, Yadigar.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the state authorities don't want to see Mevlana as a
spiritual guide,'' she said. ``They are afraid that religious
devotion will lead people to rebel against state authority. That
bothers me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The force of Rumi's passion, especially his belief that the
intellect cannot explain the ecstasy of love, has won him devoted
followers throughout the Muslim world and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Within a century after his death, his ideas began to penetrate
the West, where they influenced cultural figures from Chaucer to
Samuel Johnson. Recently they have enjoyed a new wave of popularity
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A multimedia theatrical production based on Rumi's poems,
``Monsters of Grace,'' was performed at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music in New York this month. The painter Cy Twombly has produced a
series of Rumi-inspired paintings. A new compact disk features
Rumi's poems read by Madonna, Goldie Hawn and other celebrities.
Oliver Stone wants to turn his life into a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has answers to the great questions of our modern culture,''
said Kabir Helminski, an American scholar who has lectured widely
on Rumi's philosophy and was in Konya for this month's celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do have my reservations about some of the distortions of
his legacy. Some people consider him an exponent of mystical
eroticism, or a kind of wild-man spirituality. They take his
ecstatic spirit but ignore the discipline that should accompany
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumi looked forward to his death as ``the time of joyful
meeting,'' and it came upon him on Dec. 17, 1273. Clergy of all
faiths wept behind his funeral cortege. According to a contemporary
account, a Greek Orthodox priest said in his tribute, ``Rumi is the
bread that everyone needs to eat.''

 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cashmere-covered world of Bijan is one of many
contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the chairman of the company, Bijan Pakzad,
could not be more ubiquitous. His face is plastered all over
magazine advertisements and Manhattan billboards, where he appears
with Michael Jordan and Bo Derek, smirking and vamping. On the
other, he holds no fashion shows for his men's clothing line, is
all but absent from the fashion press, and permits into his store
only people who have first made appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Bijan, as he prefers to be called, will not discuss who his
customers are, yet a wall of his opulent Fifth Avenue store is
covered with clocks, each bearing the name of one of his most loyal
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   And Bijan, who counts discretion among his attributes, seems
almost singularly obsessed with money; he constantly cites the fat
bank accounts of his clients, the high prices of his goods and his
own wealth. Indeed, one of his advertising slogans is, ``The
costliest men's wear in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff members in his store seem equally versed in his design
equation: wealth equals importance; importance equals a need to
shop for clothing in the confines of a private store, and clothing
purchased there must live up to a reputation for exclusivity in the
form of very expensive fabrics, hand-tailoring and mink lining
where it is least expected. Then, there are the prices. Bijan and
his staff revel in the fact that his $15,000 vicuna coat, $350 set
of ties and $65,000 luggage set with crocodile trim are prohibitive
to most.
</P>
<P>
   ``One one-tenth of one percent of the world's population can
afford to shop in such splendor,'' boasted Steve Stalder, a Bijan
salesman who has worked in the store for 17 years. ``When these men
walk into the room, people tremble.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rhetoric inspires giggles and the prices gasps, the
esthetic _ upscale Beverly Hills dentist, as one fashionista put it
_ is almost a footnote to the whole operation.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Bijan does not subscribe to trends in
men's wear, sticking instead with classics like windowpane wool
suits and cashmere sweaters in a plethora of colors. Accents
include the odd electric blue python jacket, from a fashion genre
best described as early midlife crisis. ``My point is to be simple
and classic,'' Bijan said in a telephone interview from his
headquarters in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   His flamboyance and eccentricities attract snickers _ this is a
man who had $20 million worth of diamonds braided into Bo Derek's
hair for a perfume advertisement, then hired armed guards to stand
outside a Beverly Hills hotel while she slept. And his lack of
shows and editorial coverage means that many in fashion have no
idea what he is selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bijan? I don't have any clue,'' said Valerie Steele, a
professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology. ``As far as I can
make out, the image is someone who makes perfume and fashions for
rich people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Bijan also deserves credit for perseverance. In an age where
superexposed designers, beloved by editors, can nonetheless be
financial failures (think Isaac Mizrahi), he has managed to keep a
very 1980's concept up and running. He has done so in large part by
being among the first and most successful designers to take their
name and reproduce it in a fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   He came to this country from Iran in 1971 with some family
money. ``I came here with the thought to be a designer,'' he
explained. ``But I found no one could carry my designs to reality.
So I became a manufacturer. Then, I needed a showroom. I decided to
do it my own way. It is very snobby, by appointment only, but I
thought if I showed my clothes with taste and quality for a few
thousand people, I would be successful.'' His Beverly Hills store
opened in 1976, New York in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But it is scent that drives the business. Bijan, his signature
perfume and his only product for women, is expensive, but at $65
for the eau de parfum, it is an indulgence many women have gone for
since it was introduced in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   There is also his DNA line, Bijan light, and the Michael Jordan
fragrance, for which he holds the license, which is sold in places
like the Sports Authority. Of the $150 million in revenues he
claimed to have made last year (the company is privately held and
its finances cannot be checked), two-thirds came from fragrance
sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Letting cosmetics and scents bankroll the house is now the
oldest trick in the book _ Christian Dior sells more bottles of
perfume in one week than dresses in a year, and Ralph Lauren and
Calvin Klein long ago realized that the road to profitability is
paved with citrus and musk _ but Bijan is among its pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signature fragrance is considered a classic,'' said
Annette Green, the president of the Fragrance Foundation. ``He is
different in a way, because he was not like Ralph or Calvin, who
are fashion designers to the masses. No one ever heard of him. He
did some very clever things to get himself recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be spending more than $30 million a year in
advertising, often doing an entire campaign that runs only once. In
a business driven by new products, constant advertising is a must.
And while Bijan is no Chanel No. 5, the fragrance is still among
the top 20 sellers in many stores, Ms. Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Beauty Trends division of the NPD Group,
consumer researchers, when Michael Jordan's fragrance hit the
shelves in October 1996, it ranked among the top 20 after just
three months of sales. For the first nine months of 1998, it
generated about $5 million and still ranks 30th among more than 170
prestige men's fragrance brands tracked by the group. All of this
is without the support of the high-profile clothes that usually
drive cosmetics sales _ the idea being that people who love
designer items but can never hope to afford them can access the
name through a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   As quiver-inducing as the Bijan customers may be _ and,
according to the wall of clocks, they include Stevie Wonder, Bill
Blass, Stephen King and a myriad of kings and princes from the
Middle East _ it seems that they, too, sometimes need fashion tips.
</P>
<P>
   For these men, there are six closets of clothing, each
representing one color. Butter-yellow shirts, pale yellow wool
jackets, gold ties, a cashmere jacket in a sunshine hue. ``If you
were a gentleman who is too busy thinking about your business and
does not have the confidence to dress,'' Stalder said, ``this
helps.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three-piece single-breasted suits in fine wool, and
many items are lined with this year's scarf print of choice, one
that features swords inspired by Bijan's personal Napoleon-era
collection.
</P>
<P>
   The store has all the touches one would expect _ opera music,
doors that swing open automatically and lead to a showroomlike
space where men can model their new outfits, a wine cellar, a $2
million chandelier hanging above a theatrical staircase.
</P>
<P>
   So, who is all this stuff aimed at? ``It is probably a very
affluent older gentleman who isn't worried about what celebrity is
wearing what to a party,'' said Bruce Pask, the associate fashion
director for GQ magazine. ``He doesn't know about trends and
doesn't care about them.'' (Things sometimes turn sour with even
the best customer _ Bijan is suing the Sultan of Brunei over
payments for a line of fragrances.)
</P>
<P>
   Brett Neubig, his spokesman, describes Bijan this way: ``He is
difficult, but he has every right to be. He pushes the creative
envelope. The first time he took me around the store, I had chills
all over my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for him, there was plenty of warm cashmere around.

SADDAM FINDS NEW ENEMIES AMONG FORMER FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With IRAQ-U.S.) 
(rl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As delicate negotiations over a new
international policy on Iraq go on behind the scenes here,
President Saddam Hussein is complicating his situation in the
Security Council with a stream of bellicose statements directed
both at his enemies and at friends like Russia, France and his Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Iraqis are sending mixed signals about their
remaining ties with the United Nations, which administers a huge
relief program in the country. Iraq has already said it will never
allow arms inspectors back, but it has generally cooperated with
aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, however, Iraqi officials have refused to allow
U.N. relief experts to survey damage done to civilian sites by U.S.
and British air attacks on Iraq almost two weeks ago. Some U.N.
officials say they believe that this is because damage to civilian
buildings was very light, countering Iraqi claims of more damage
and casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Since the attacks, Iraqi officials have couched their verbal
assaults in racial and anti-Jewish terms, saying ``Anglo Saxons''
dominate the arms inspection system and that President Clinton and
Prime Minister Tony Blair of England are under the influence of
``Zionist cliques.'' The Iraqis threatened to shoot down U.S. and
British aircraft, and Monday they tried to hit U.S. planes with
surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has also started denouncing the French, who have gone out
of their way to help Iraq here. The attacks began after both
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said the
Iraqi leadership bore responsibility for the bombing by refusing to
cooperate with arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   French officials, who are willing to move swiftly to lift an oil
embargo and other sanctions against Iraq, have also infuriated
Saddam by proposing that oil income be monitored by the United
Nations indefinitely so it cannot be spent on prohibited weapons.
Saddam wants a no-strings-attached escape from the sanctions
imposed after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi ire is also being directed at Arab nations. A tone of
frustration mixed with desperation has surfaced in speeches by
Saddam and his ministers, who attack Arab leaders for backing away
from Iraq when they should, in Iraq's view, be lining up to break
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Arab support has been slipping away from Saddam. On Monday, the
Iraqis received two more blows. First, a meeting of Arab League
foreign ministers scheduled for Wednesday at the request of Yemen,
one of Iraq's strongest allies in the Arab world, was postponed
until Jan. 24 at the request of several Persian Gulf nations,
including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers were to plan a meeting of Arab leaders to discuss
Iraq. In a second blow, Egypt appeared to put an end to Iraqi hopes
for a high-level meeting, at which Saddam's government intended to
press its demand that the Arab League defy international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Arab League diplomats say they have tried to exert a moderating
influence in the region and do not want to be drawn into support of
Saddam in his defiance of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not realistic to think that some fraternal Arab
countries are going to take part in a summit attended by
high-ranking members of the Iraqi leadership,'' an Egyptian
government spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Cairo, President Hosni Mubarak took direct aim at Iraqi
leaders in an interview with the government newspaper Al Gomhuriya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opposed the air attack,'' Mubarak said, ``because in the
final reckoning, it is the people of Iraq who pay the price. We
sympathize with the Iraqi people because we know that our brothers
and sons in this fraternal country can do nothing about it and the
regime in power is the root of all problems.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday and Monday, Iraqi officials appeared to threaten an
end to the ``oil for food'' program under which they are allowed to
sell up to $5.2 billion in oil every six months to buy goods like
medicine, food and essential equipment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh backed away from
comments on the subject he made to AP television on Sunday, saying
he was talking about Iraq's future plans once sanctions were
lifted, when there would be no need for the program. But another
ministry repeated the threat to end the program sooner, Bloomberg
News reported from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has never liked the ``oil for food'' program, which he
rejected for more than five years after it was proposed by the
Security Council. But it was allowed to continue uninterrupted by
the Iraqis during the recent bombing raids.
</P>
<P>
   John Mills, spokesman here for U.N. relief programs in Iraq,
said Monday that the Iraqis exported 17.6 million barrels of oil
from Dec. 19 to 25, the largest amount in any weekly period. The
exports were worth $145 million; the oil sold for $8.23 a barrel, a
record low price. When the program began in 1986 the price was
about $18 a barrel.

GIANTS WONDERING ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Nothing empties faster than a locker
room on the day after a team's final game, and Monday, the Giants
kept their routine, charging out of their Giants Stadium quarters
and scattering to points from Fort Lauderdale to Fort Worth and
from Fort Collins to Fort Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' haste was also symbolic. This is not a season these
Giants wish to dwell on, even if it ended with a 5-1 rush,
including a four-game winning streak, to an 8-8 record.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Giants closed with a series of individual and team
accomplishments, most of the players expressed a desire to use the
season as a motivating example of what not to do next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely proud of everybody for hanging in there because
it was rough for a while,'' defensive end Michael Strahan said.
``But I hope everybody remembers that it was rough. It's hard to
win games. Things never just fall into place. We forgot that as a
team this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be what this year is good for, to remind us of what
happens when we stand around waiting for something good to happen.
It's not a very satisfying outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest team in the National Football League for two
consecutive years, the Giants seem eager to shed that title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to grow up and mature,'' Coach Jim Fassel said.
``The older, veteran-type players are going to have to take a more
dominant role. It's got to be a more seasoned team.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel also promised changes and stated the obvious, that his
offense, which was ranked 29th in the league before Monday night's
game between Pittsburgh and Jacksonville, had to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel will be looking to improve a few areas, such as tight
end, where the Giants will continue what has been a decadelong
search for a pass-catching threat. It is likely they will also add
another running back, either through free agency or the college
draft. And the anticipated return of center Brian Williams should
put in motion some other modifications on the line.
</P>
<P>
   At quarterback, Fassel did not name Kent Graham his starter for
next year, saying he needed time to evaluate the entire season. But
Fassel added that his reticence on the subject should not be
misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take that as a lack of confidence in Kent,'' Fassel
said. ``A lot of people think of Kent as a career backup. I don't
happen to think that way. You can't evaluate on perceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Fassel and the Giants' general manager, Ernie
Accorsi, are digging in for potential upheaval brought on by free
agency. The Giants hope to sign the unrestricted free agents Chad
Bratzke, a defensive end, and Corey Widmer, the middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Widmer's signing is anticipated since there have been meaningful
negotiations. Bratzke and the Giants have not talked, and since
Bratzke had a career-high 12{ sacks this year, it is possible he
may attract an offer from another team that is too rich for the
Giants, who have a number of other needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants would also like to keep safety Percy Ellsworth, who
is a restricted free agent likely to attract attention, too.
Without Ellsworth, the Giants have no veteran free safety should
they want to replace Tito Wooten, who had a subpar season and who
did not intercept a pass.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, his coaches and the Giants' front office will sit down
next week to make most of those decisions, though some decisions _
such as ignoring the free agency of guard Greg Bishop and the
decision to send the third-string quarterback Mike Cherry to the
N.F.L.'s World League _ have already been made.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Giants closed 1998 happily, upsetting Denver in
the middle of an undefeated December, but the final result _ a
non-playoff year for a defending division champion _ was
disillusioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got it turned around, which I'm really glad for,'' Fassel
said. ``But we didn't do enough and that's always the bottom
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan best described the mix of emotions most Giants were
experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll leave here today still feeling good about the last four
games,'' he said. ``But I'm pretty sure when I get home and I'm
watching the playoffs on television it's going to hit me _ hey, we
should be there playing, too.''  &QL;

A MAN WHO DARED TO WRITE ABOUT A GEISHA'S MIND
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ To write ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' the
fictional reminiscences of a geisha in Kyoto during the 1930s and
40s, Arthur Golden, a 42-year-old father of two, and an American at
that, had to cross three great boundaries: gender, nationality and
history. He had to imagine what it would be like to be a 9-year-old
girl sold to a geisha house. He had to understand what the same
character at 15 would feel when she faced the nasty old man who had
just made the highest bid in an auction of her virginity. He also
had to know the smallest details of her daily life: how she would
apply her makeup and create her elaborate hairstyle.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' will have been on The New
York Times' best-seller list for 58 weeks. It has been translated
into 26 languages, and Steven Spielberg plans to direct the movie
version. All this, despite the fact that the book, regardless of
the implications of its title, is not about sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of the geisha is frequently misunderstood in the
West,'' Golden said in an interview at his home in Brookline, Mass.
``Geisha are not prostitutes. They have no training about sex.''
The geisha's job is to entertain groups of men with drinking games
and witty remarks, so they can ``avoid being a bunch of bleary-eyed
guys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She giggles at jokes, makes you think you're charming,'' he
added. Geisha are not available for brief sexual encounters, though
in the past young girls were sold to the highest bidder for
deflowering in a rite known as a mizuage. But a geisha may have a
long-term sexual relationship with a danna, a wealthy man who
supports her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memoirs of a Geisha'' is about 9-year-old Chiyo, a girl with
unusual gray-blue eyes, who is sold by her destitute father to an
okiya, or geisha house. She is initiated into the geisha's rigorous
rites, lessons in dancing and playing the shamisen, a banjo-like
instrument, and in the art of the tea ceremony. She learns to flirt
by flicking her kimono to give a glimpse of her wrist. All the
while, she is bullied by an exquisite and rivalrous geisha,
Hatsumomo.
</P>
<P>
   Chiyo falls in love with the chairman of a giant electric
company, but he remains aloof from her. Eventually, she is rescued
by another geisha, Mameha. Chiyo, now called Sayuri professionally,
undergoes a mizuage, when her virginity is sold to Dr. Crab, who
collects blood samples from virgins he has deflowered. But by the
novel's end, Sayuri is one of the most renowned geisha of her time.
</P>
<P>
   Golden first got the idea for ``Memoirs'' in 1982 when he was
working at an English-language magazine in Tokyo. A Japanese
colleague was the son of a famous industrialist and a geisha.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an open secret,'' Golden said. ``Having grown up on the
edge of an empire myself, I was fascinated by his illegitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden is a member of the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which owns the
controlling stock in The New York Times Co. His mother, Ruth S.
Holmberg, is a sister of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the company's
chairman emeritus. She is chairwoman of the company that has
published The Chattanooga Times, currently being sold by the
family, which owned it for more than a century. (Despite the family
connection, the Chattanooga company is not affiliated with The New
York Times Co.)
</P>
<P>
   Golden spent his childhood in Chattanooga, far from the center
of Sulzberger family life in New York. Golden grew up, he said,
with a sense of ``awe'' about The New York Times, but also knowing
members of the paper's top management by their first names. He
visited his grandmother, Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, at her country
house, Hillandale, in Stamford, Conn. ``I was a little kid still
running around in my bathing suit all day long, and President
Truman came and had tea with my mother and grandmother while I
played with his grandchildren at the pool,'' Golden said.
</P>
<P>
   Golden attended Harvard University and then earned a master's
degree in Japanese history at Columbia University, planning to
become a college professor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, on a trip to Beijing to study Chinese, he met Trudy
Legge, a graduate student from the University of Washington. Her
father was a union organizer in Pittsburgh, her mother, a nurse.
``I sat her down and told her about my family,'' Golden said. ``She
said she thought, `Oh no, this will never work!' '' They married in
1982 and have two children, Hays, 14, and Tess, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Today the family lives in a blue-green shingled house built in
1896. Above the living room mantel is a painting of a swan-necked
woman by William James, the son of the philosopher and nephew of
Henry James.
</P>
<P>
   Golden said he had considered working for The New York Times.
``I decided in the end not to do it,'' he said. ``I wanted to write
on my own. Now, I had taken my life in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying a nonfiction book about Japan, he decided to write
a novel. He checked out library books on writing and re-read his
favorite authors _ Nabokov, Dickens and Jane Austen. He enrolled in
the creative writing program at Boston University, where he got
another master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 he began researching geisha and discovered ``a
subculture with its own strange rules.'' He wrote 750 pages in the
third person, then ``got a call from a friend of my
grandmother's.'' The friend knew a geisha, Mineko Iwasaki, who
agreed to an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Iwasaki was 42, retired, and married with a child. When she
was 19, her virginity was sold for a record price at the time,
around $850,000 in today's dollars. Ms. Iwasaki was able to give
Golden crucial details about the daily rituals of geisha, though he
did not base the character of Sayuri on her, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Most women become geisha because they are drawn to the classical
arts, Golden said. When the profession was at its height in the
1930s, there were some 800 geisha in the Gion district of Kyoto.
Today only about 80 geisha remain.
</P>
<P>
   After Golden's interviews with Ms. Iwasaki, it took him three
more years to write a second draft of his book. All the while he
worried that his family, with its strong work ethic, would
disapprove. Then, when he showed the draft to friends, they told
him the book was ``dry,'' Golden said. ``My reaction was a weeklong
anxiety attack.''
</P>
<P>
   He decided to make the main character a child, so the reader
could share her sense of wonder at each new experience. And, he
said, he decided to ``enter her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid to try to impersonate a woman,'' he said, but he
added: ``I knew I can fake the past. It turns out the same skill
goes into faking another gender.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the book, he describes in intimate terms the way a geisha
applies her makeup, first a cream of nightingale droppings to her
face, then wax. After that, thick white makeup, and garish dots of
red blush on the cheeks. Her hair is combed with camellia oil and
hot wax, then pulled tight and, for the apprentice geisha, wound in
a bun around a piece of red silk in a style called ``a split
peach.'' To preserve her hairstyle, she sleeps with her neck on a
wooden cradle called a takamakura.
</P>
<P>
   Golden also describes in detail her elaborate kimonos. There is
one of ``scarlet and yellow, which showed leaves scattered in a
field of golden grasses.'' Another has ``silver birds flying
against a night sky, with a mysterious landscape of dark trees and
rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he finished the book. It was sold to Alfred A. Knopf for
$250,000. The Washington Post called it ``a breathtaking
performance twice over, once by its bewitching central figure; and
once by the masterful puppeteer who has given her life.'' Michiko
Kakutani praised it in a weekday review in the The New York Times
as ``a finely observed picture of an anomalous and largely vanished
world.''
</P>
<P>
   One dissenting note was in The New York Times Book Review. ``If
Golden had chosen to write the biography of a geisha rather than
her fictional autobiography, he might have achieved a lot more by
settling for hardly less,'' the reviewer, John David Morley, wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Writing ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' Golden said, was like waging a
war. Sometimes, he felt like a ``general looking down at the
battlefield, trying to make a strategic decision,'' he said. At
other times, he was ``the guy in the trenches with the rifle.'' But
10 years, 3 drafts and 2,300 raw manuscript pages later, Golden
seems to have won his war.

TWO HUICHOL INDIAN MEN CHARGED WITH KILLING SAN ANTONIO REPORTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUADALAJARA, Mexico _ Two Huichol Indian men were formally
charged Monday with the slaying of San Antonio Express-News
reporter Philip True, whose body was found Dec. 16 in the rugged
central Mexico mountains where he was on a 10-day hike.
</P>
<P>
   The two men, Miguel Hernandez and Juan Chivarra, were accused of
strangling True because they were angry he had entered land sacred
to the Huichol without permission and was taking pictures of
people, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they have had a lot of outsiders come and take
pictures and make money from them,'' Horacio Vega, the 28-year-old
chief of the Jalisco state prosecutor's homicide division, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the two attacked True as they hiked together on a
stretch of trail near the village of San Miguel Huastita on Dec. 6.
After tripping the backpack-wearing reporter from behind, Vega
said, one of the suspects pinned True's legs while the other
strangled him with a kerchief.
</P>
<P>
   Vega said the arrested men said True, an avid jogger in good
physical condition, offered no resistance during the attack,
although he was conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and Chibarra were paraded before reporters on a back
patio of the police investigator's offices in downtown Guadalajara,
the capital of Jalisco.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, slightly built and shabbily dressed, were forced to
stand alongside True's recovered backpack and 35-millimeter camera,
which investigators said they recovered near the suspects' houses,
while television cameras whirred and newspaper photographers
clicked.
</P>
<P>
   Neither suspect made eye contact with reporters nor answered
their questions. After a few minutes, officials escorted the men
away for a crosstown trip to prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not accustomed to speaking,'' Vega said in response
to a Mexican journalist's question whether the men had been ordered
not to say anything to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said officials were still looking for some of True's
belongings and were investigating the pregnant wife of one of the
suspects, who authorities say was present at the time True was
killed, Vega declared the crime largely solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have (the coroner's) finding (of murder) and the confessions
of two people,'' Vega said Monday. ``That's proof enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as often happens with police investigations in Mexico,
the True case has taken several baffling turns in the 13 days since
his body was found by relatives, friends and colleagues who had
launched a frantic search for him.
</P>
<P>
   The coroner who performed autopsies on True's remains in
Guadalajara announced on Dec. 17 that he had been murdered, then
refused to elaborate. The coroner, Mario Rivas Souza, was quoted in
the Mexican press as saying he was told by superiors to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a second autopsy, performed Dec. 20 in Mexico City by
forensic specialists from the federal attorney general's office and
attended by an expert from the FBI, were promised by last weekend
but have not yet been released.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's forensic expert, Emma Lew, referred questions Monday
to her superior, who referred them to an FBI spokesperson, who
didn't return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   A high-level official in the Jalisco state attorney general's
office said off the record last week that True had died
accidentally, falling down in a drunken stupor and freezing to
death. And other officials in Mexico City gave similar accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the state prosecutor's office arrested the Huichol
suspects for the reporter's murder. Although the San Antonio
Express-News was told of the arrests on Christmas Day, Vega said
that Hernandez and Chibarra were arrested the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Vega says he has no knowledge of what he called ``rumors'' of
True's accidental death. And he said that the conflict in the
reported times of the Huichols' arrests is explained because they
were only ``formally'' detained on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Vega said that the original autopsy report found a high level of
alcohol in True's body and the presence of a drug, which he did not
name. He said he could not explain how True would be heavily
intoxicated at 8 a.m., the time which authorities say he was killed
on Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
   True was known by friends to be a moderate social drinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what happened that night, because he didn't have
any companions with him,'' Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   An experienced hiker, True had often taken solo treks through
Mexico and elsewhere over the years. The walls of True's Mexico
City home are filled with photographs of peasants, many of them
Indians, that he had photographed. &QL;

MEXICO ARMY PROTESTER GOES LOUDLY INTO HIDING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GINGER THOMPSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Sheltered from view by bushes on the side of the
highway that runs north from Mexico City to Toluca, Lt. Col.
Hildegardo Bacilio Gomez got out of an old Chevrolet Cavalier
looking more like a banker than a man on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Short and chubby, the officer wore pressed navy blue pants, a
tie and shiny, patent leather shoes. His round face was
cleanshaven; his hair neatly trimmed. And even though he said he
felt his life was at risk, he talked mostly in triumphant tones
about how he and his fledgling dissident military movement had
sparked a national debate that could lead to public scrutiny of the
long-secretive Mexican armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a transcendental movement,'' he said. ``It is like a
snowball that cannot be stopped once it starts to roll down a
hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a week after leading a highly unusual
demonstration by more than 50 uniformed soldiers to protest what
they contend are human rights abuses within the military justice
system, Bacilio Gomez, an army surgeon and father of six, has
abandoned his home. He is spending the holidays in hiding, but not
in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the march, a rare display of internal dissent
within the armed forces, officials of the high military command
denounced Bacilio Gomez, 43, as a traitor and a self-serving
criminal, who faces numerous charges of disobedience and
insubordination. The military's chief prosecutor ordered the
officer to appear for questioning about his movement, the Patriotic
Command to Raise the People's Consciousness. And later, a warrant
was issued for Bacilio Gomez's arrest on charges of desertion.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon said he is convinced that he would be tortured or
even killed if he turned himself in, so he fled his home and has
attempted to make his case in the press.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of relatives and friends, he faxes communiques
almost every day to news agencies in Mexico City. He meets secretly
with reporters, often picking them up on isolated corners, without
any bodyguards or escorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to continue to fight,'' he said, in an interview
along the Toluca highway over the weekend. ``I am going to continue
convincing people that if there is no justice for a military
officer, for a surgeon, for an educated man, for a father who lives
an honest life, then there will be no justice for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacilio Gomez, who has served in the armed forces 23 years, and
was sent to medical school by the armed forces, acknowledged that
he has been charged with a dozen military crimes, but he contends
that the charges against him are false. His problems began, he
said, on Sept. 1, 1996, when he left his army post at the Central
Military Hospital in Mexico City to treat an emergency patient in
the private clinic he has operated for the last 10 years, which he
is not prohibited from doing as a military doctor.
</P>
<P>
   His superior officers charged him with insubordination, jailed
him for three days and cut his military pay to $150 from about
$1,500 a month. Each time the surgeon tried to protest the charges
against him, he said, new charges were added.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take away your salary, your uniform, your job and your
dignity,'' Bacilio Gomez said. ``Imagine what that does to your
mental state.''
</P>
<P>
   In two letters, he said, he sought the help of the Mexican
secretary of defense, Gen. Enrique Cervantes. In the most recent
letter, dated Sept. 28, Gomez wrote that more than 80 percent of
the soldiers in military prisons are innocent or were sentenced in
unfair trials, and he urged the general to create a special
commission to review his case and the cases of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us are soldiers who lived a normal life and behaved in
a civil and acceptable way,'' he wrote, ``but because of some
misunderstanding, or a poorly applied rule, or vengeance, we have
been transformed, emotionally destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter ended with these words: ``Justice cannot wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Cervantes did not respond, Bacilio Gomez said. The surgeon began
meeting with other soldiers who were accused of crimes and were
facing military trials to plan a demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else could we do?'' he said. ``They had us on our knees.
We had to march or we were going to die from frustration.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the afternoon of Dec. 18, Bacilio Gomez and about 50 other
soldiers and officers, most of them in dress uniform, marched down
the Reforma, one of the city's most prestigious boulevards. They
carried Mexican flags, a banner with the image of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, the patron Saint of Mexico, and placards criticizing the
army high command.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the march, Bacilio Gomez met with officials from
the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution to present a list of
demands, including a call to abolish military courts. The party has
expressed support for what the movement is fighting for. The
dissident officers demand that armed forces personnel be judged in
civilian courts, just like any other citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the ministry of defense did not respond to requests
for an interview about the dissident group. In statements to the
news media last week, the military's top prosecutor, Rafael Macedo
de la Concha, lashed out at the protesters, saying that he would
launch an investigation into each person who marched. And in news
releases, the prosecutor said that Bacilio Gomez's conduct could be
considered ``new and grave crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This office feels the need to remind those military officers
that we must put before our own personal interests the sovereignty
of the nation, loyalty to institutions and the honor of the army,''
Macedo wrote, ``values that Lt. Col. Bacilio Gomez ignores.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the dissident movement also say that Basilio Gomez's
actions appear self-serving. At the start of his protest, the
surgeon asked the government to let him retire from the military
and to guarantee him safe passage to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Roderic Camp, a scholar at Claremont McKenna College in
California who has written a book on the Mexican military, said
that although the movement is small and its leaders have dubious
motives, the group's protest has resonated because it is the first
organized display of internal dissent within the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five decades, Camp said, individual officers who
spoke out against abuses were often stripped of their rank and
thrown in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a brigadier general, Jose Francisco Gallardo,
was jailed on charges that he misappropriated military supplies,
including horse feed. The charges arose a few weeks after the
general wrote an article calling for the appointment of an
ombudsman to serve as an advocate on behalf of soldiers on issues
like promotions, salaries and pension funds and to support officers
accused of military crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the general, 50, received two 14-year prison
sentences, over the protests of national and international human
rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Camp also noted that there is almost no civilian scrutiny of the
Mexican armed forces. The secretary of defense and the secretary of
the navy are both active-duty officers, appointed by the president,
but only once in recent history has a military secretary been
removed from office before the end of the six-year term, Camp said.

US WARPLANES HIT MISSILE BATTERY; FOUR IRAQIS DIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ US warplanes fired on an air defense battery in
northern Iraq Monday, killing four soldiers, injuring seven and
possibly setting the stage for a new phase of low intensity
skirmishes between the United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton defended the air strike _ which produced the
first Iraqi casualties since a four-day US-British bombing campaign
ended December 19 _ as an ``appropriate'' response after
surface-to-air missiles were fired at US jets patrolling the
northern a ``no-fly zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They attacked because they were attacked,'' Clinton said of
the US pilots. The White House denied Iraqi reports that an
American pilot was shot down during the operation, insisting that
all Americans involved in the attack returned safely to their base
at Incirlik, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi action underscores Saddam Hussein's willingness to
endure further air strikes as he tests US resolve in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very well be that we are entering a new phase of low
intensity exchanges,'' said a State Department official who has
been involved in Iraq policy for years. ``But we have demonstrated
that we can strike very, very quickly and that should be enough to
keep Saddam worried.''
</P>
<P>
   In another challenge to Washington's containment policy, Baghdad
restarted a massive oil smuggling operation from Basra through Iran
less than two weeks after US missiles struck the city's refineries,
according to an administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad claimed it was justified in firing on the US plane
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq has always said that there is no way that it could
respond to the no-fly zones,'' said Iraq's UN ambassador, Nizar
Hamdoon. ``Why should there be such a breach of Iraq's sovereignty?
Why should Iraq stand idle.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Iraqi military added later that an ``enemy''
US warplane was struck by Iraqi surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested Washington was trying to cover up the loss ``in
order to provide its pilot an opportunity to infiltrate if he is
alive or give its agents an opportunity to bring back his body if
he is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true,'' White House national security spokesman David
Leavy said in response to the Iraqi allegations. ``Our air crews
returned to their bases safely. This is just more propaganda from
Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Saddam's motives are to break out of his box, then he got
his answer today,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have maintained a no-fly zone over
northern Iraq since 1991 to shield the country's minority Kurds
from Iraqi aggression. A second no-fly zone that stretches from the
southern suburbs of Baghdad to the Kuwaiti border was established
in 1992 to protect Iraq's Shiite minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we effectively control the skies over Iraq, Saddam has
been unable to use air power against his own people or lash out
against his neighbors.'' Clinton said Monday. ``We will continue to
enforce the no-fly policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the US halted its bombardment of Iraq, Baghdad has
repeatedly sought to test Washington's willingness to defend the
no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Iraq directed anti-aircraft fire near two British
Tornado fighter jets conducting patrols in southern Iraq, according
to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   And on Sunday Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said Iraq
would target British and US planes patrolling the zones.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's exchange was by far the most significant incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government said ``several enemy formations'' entered
Iraqi airspace at 10:25 a.m from US military bases at Incirlik. A
second wave of US jets entered the country at 1:37 p.m. and ``fired
criminal missiles against one of our sites'' outside the town of
Mosul.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said the Iraqis fired first.
</P>
<P>
   A White House source said that a team of F-16 and F-15 fighters
jets ``came across a SAM (surface-to-air missile) battery that
illuminated our F-16s'' with their radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a hostile Iraqi action, an act of aggression against
US aircraft,'' said a Pentagon spokesman, Col. Richard Bridges.
``The US took appropriate action under their rules of engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The aircraft acted in self-defense and attacked the
ground-based missile launch site with HARM (High-Speed Anti
Radiation) missiles and precision-guided munitions,'' added Major
Tony Kemper, a spokeswoman for the US-European Command based near
Stuttgart, Germany. ``There was no damage to coalition aircraft and
all crew returned safely to Incirlik airbase.''
</P>
<P>
   As Iraq raised the military stakes in its confrontation with the
United States, it backed off from a threat to eject 400 UN
humanitarian aid workers and end the so-called oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Iraq's trade minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said the
agreement must end soon along with eight years of crippling
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq will not live with the oil-for-food program forever,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old deal _ conceived by the United States and
Britain as a humanitarian exception to the UN embargo _ allows Iraq
to sell $10.4 billion worth of oil each year to purchase food and
medicine and to repair basic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say Iraq has intensified its efforts to circumvent
the UN sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad has called on Arab leaders preparing for a summit in
Cairo next month to trade with Iraq in violation of the embargo.
And Iraq has re-established a smuggling route along the Shatta al
Arab Persian Gulf waterway that straddles the coasts of Iraq and
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official that tracks Iraq's smuggling
activities said the illicit trade -- suspended during the
US-British air campaign -- has resumed with one to two oil tankers
traveling in and out of the port of Basra each day.
</P>
<P>
   Before the strikes, the official said, between two to three
tankers ferried oil out of Basra each day en route to Iran,
accounting for some 250,000 metric tons of oil during the month of
November.
</P>
<P>
   The source said it is too early to determine whether the renewed
smuggling indicates that American bombardment failed to erode
Iraq's capacity to circumvent an eight-year-old oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see the ships go in an out,'' the official said. ``But
it's still too early to say what the long-term impact will be. We
have struck at the source and I would expect a greatly reduced
amount of smuggling over the long haul.''

6-year-old sister, called Gloria by the courts, and a foster
mother. Hugo and Gloria are so close that, when Hugo has difficulty
making himself understood, Gloria sometimes speaks for him. Their
troubled biological parents were declared unfit to raise them, so
they are, for each other, all that remains of their original
nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   But that is to change within days. Under an order from the
highest court in Massachusetts, Hugo and Gloria are to be
permanently separated on Jan. 2. Like at least 35,000 brothers and
sisters across the country who are sent to different foster or
adoptive homes every year, they are to be raised far from each
other. Gloria, who was adopted three years ago by their foster
mother, is to stay here. Hugo is to move in with an aunt in New
Jersey who successfully fought the foster mother for the right to
adopt him.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo's lawyers, who have worked to keep Hugo and Gloria together
in the foster mother's house, have asked the Supreme Court to
review the case and use it to declare a new national rule that
brothers and sisters have a constitutional right to be together.
Their argument, family law experts say, is at the forefront of a
growing legal movement that is pressing to change the focus in
custody disputes from the rights of adults to the rights of
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start to make that paradigm shift, looking at it from
the point of view of the child, a natural next question would be:
Do children have a right to remain with their siblings?'' said
Martin Guggenheim, who is an expert on family and children's law at
New York University Law School and is not involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   R. Susan Dillard, one of Hugo's lawyers at the Massachusetts
Committee for Public Counsel Services, which is financed by the
state, said Hugo's lawyers were fighting not only to try to keep
Hugo and Gloria together but also to establish a principle that
might stop other brothers and sisters from being separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common experience,'' Ms. Dillard said, ``tells us sibling
relationships are at the heart of what our identity is.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the Supreme Court selecting for full review any
one of the scores of cases filed every month are small. But some
legal experts say the issue this case raises is one that is arising
frequently as American courts are asked to adapt to changing
attitudes about the family, like a growing consensus among child
welfare experts that brothers and sisters should be kept together
whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many courts in recent years have said they give special
consideration to sibling relationships. But only a handful of
judges have begun to suggest that brothers and sisters have the
same type of constitutional right to be together as parents and
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I think the Supreme Court will have to decide this
kind of case,'' said Frank Vandervort, managing attorney of the
Child Welfare Law Resource Center at the University of Michigan Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   Because the case has already been through two appeals courts,
the fight over Hugo provides an unusual look at the painful choices
judges everywhere are making daily in what are usually closed
family court proceedings. Published court decisions in
Massachusetts describe what a Boston juvenile court judge called a
``heart wrenching'' choice over what to do about Hugo.
</P>
<P>
   To the children's foster mother, Enid L., as she has been called
by the courts, the case raises a common-sense question. ``Why would
you want to separate a sister and a brother?'' she asked as the
children played outside on a gray December day.
</P>
<P>
   A 53-year-old former school kitchen worker who now earns her
living as a foster parent, Ms. L agreed to meet a reporter on the
condition that she and the children be identified only by their
pseudonyms.
</P>
<P>
   According to the court opinions in the case, the children's
father was a substance abuser with a history of domestic violence
and child neglect. Their mother, the court opinions said, suffers
from paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo, the courts said, has a series of problems, including slow
development of speech and motor skills, that may be the result of
his mother's use of cocaine while she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo's parents wanted the aunt in New Jersey, the father's
sister, to gain custody of Hugo. The aunt, a 43-year-old police
administrator's aide in New York City, has a teen-age son with
similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Boston juvenile court judge, Stephen Limon,
acknowledged that Hugo might be traumatized by the move away from
his sister. But in the long term, Limon ruled, it would be in
Hugo's best interest to live with the aunt, who had demonstrated
that she could care for a child with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a state appeals court overruled that decision, saying it
was based on mere speculation. Then, this fall, the Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court reinstated Limon's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the seven judges of the Supreme Judicial Court
reviewed the complex facts of Hugo's short life and his strong ties
to Gloria. But, as appeals courts often do in dealing with cases
concerning the placement of children, the court concluded that
trial judges are in the best position to make decisions based on
the facts before them. The court did not mention the constitutional
assertions made by Hugo's lawyers, but said it was important for
trial judges to retain flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not persuaded in this complex area of familial
relationships that the judge should have given presumptive weight
to the sibling relationship,'' the court's decision said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Courts across the country have considered arguments like the
ones Hugo's lawyers are making, but have issued differing rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo's lawyers argue that siblings should be deprived of their
right to be together only if there is clear and convincing evidence
that separation would be in their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the same test the Supreme Court has said must be
met to deprive unfit parents of their constitutional rights to
their children. The court has said that parents have a right not to
be separated from their children unless there is clear and
convincing evidence they are unfit. The court said that ``liberty''
right was derived from the 14th Amendment's guarantee that people
cannot be deprived of ``life, liberty or property without due
process of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo's lawyers argue that brothers and sisters, too, have a
``liberty interest'' in being together. They should be separated,
the lawyers say, only if there is compelling evidence that would be
in their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Drogin, a court-appointed lawyer for Hugo's father,
said it would hamstring social service officials and the courts to
say siblings have constitutional rights to be together. ``Why
siblings?'' she asked. ``Why not grandparents? Why not uncles and
aunts?''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo's aunt declined to be interviewed. When asked, Ms. Drogin
said the aunt had decided not to adopt Gloria for ``personal
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   For child welfare officials, Hugo's case points out the
extraordinary difficulty that issues of sibling placement present.
The Massachusetts Department of Social Services has sided with
Hugo's lawyers through the case. But in an interview, Kristen
Apgar, the department's general counsel, said she did not agree
that the courts should declare that siblings have a constitutional
right to be together. That, she said, would add a new layer of
legalism to a complex process and would slow down adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the small group of children's rights attorneys nationally,
Hugo's case is already being discussed. Patrick Murphy, the public
guardian in Chicago, heads an office that represents 37,000
children annually and handled a case several years ago arguing that
siblings have a right to be together under the Constitution's First
Amendment guarantee of free association.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he would ask for permission to file a
friend-of-the-court brief if the justices decide to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said it was important for the courts to clearly state
that the Constitution gave brothers and sisters special rights,
especially when parents have been declared unfit. ``All they have
left then are their siblings,'' he said. ``Take that away as well,
and you are punishing them for the sins of their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   But in New Mexico, Angela Adams, chief children's court attorney
for the state's Department of Children, Youth and Families, said
Hugo's case was a perfect example of why family court judges needed
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   To declare that siblings have a constitutional right to be
together, Ms. Adams said, would almost certainly mean that some
children would end up in homes that might not be best for them
individually.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Hugo and Gloria appear to have little sense that they
are at the center of a battle that could change the law and their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   When they came in from playing, Hugo's mop of brown hair was
wild. He was too excited to say much. But Gloria, as usual, talked
for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   With little prompting from a reporter, she talked about how they
like to play with toy race cars together. ``We be riding them and,
and we get dizzy,'' she said breathlessly.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, according to a schedule agreed to by the
lawyers, there was a meeting that included Gloria, Hugo, the aunt
and a teacher. At the meeting, Hugo was given a crayon and paper
while the adults explained that soon Hugo would be living with his
aunt.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, one of Hugo's lawyer's said, whether Hugo
understood what that meant, or whether he understood too well.
Hugo, the lawyer said, just kept coloring.

BAY STATE AUTO INSURANCE RATES MAY RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Auto insurance rates will rise next year for the first
time in five years, with the increase in the average premium of
$835 expected to be in the 1 to 4 percent range, sources said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   An increase, even a small one, would represent a victory for the
auto insurance industry in one of the most contentious rate fights
in state history. The industry had requested a 15.5 percent rate
hike, but Attorney General Scott Harshbarger and the Division of
Insurance's own State Rating Bureau said rate cuts of as much as 12
percent were warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt is expected to issue her
formal decision later this week, but administration sources decided
to release news of the rate hike early. One source said Governor
Paul Cellucci, who held a press conference to announce the 1998
rate cut, won't have anything to do with this announcement.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the auto insurance industry said he would have
no comment until the actual decision is released, although he did
point out that rates this year are at the same level they were in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's office had no comment, but other auto insurance
watchdogs were critical of the reported rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre Cummings, consumer program director for the
Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, said a solid case had
been made during this year's rate hearings for holding 1999 rates
stable or cutting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they're talking about a rate increase is a
disappointment for consumers,'' she said. But she added that a 1
percent increase _ about $8 on an average premium _ wouldn't be
that big of a blow.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen J. D'Amato, the former head of the State Rating Bureau,
said any increase is unwarranted. ``Insurers are currently giving
large discounts off of 1998 rates and the commissioner's own State
Rating Bureau recommended decreasing rates next year by more than
10 percent. In this context, any rate increase at all is
unreasonable and may well be appealed,'' D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato resigned his post earlier this year, sending a letter to
Cellucci in which he warned that Ruthardt was too cozy with the
insurance industry. Harshbarger subsequently asked Ruthardt to
recuse herself from the hearings because of a private meeting she
held with an industry official.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is the only state that sets all aspects of auto
insurance rates, although insurers here have competed for customers
in recent years by offering discounts off the state-set rates.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the real impact of Ruthardt's decision may not be
the decision itself, but what effect it has on the appetite of the
insurance industry to continue offering the discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several years, group and safe driver discounts
have been plentiful. Discounts have run as high as 20 percent at
some companies, offering savings far in excess of what Ruthardt has
ordered with her rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials have said they would have to see whether
Ruthardt offered any rate relief to the industry before announcing
whether the discounts would continue in 1999 and at what size.
</P>
<P>
   But industry watchdogs say the fact that auto insurers have been
offering hefty discounts off the state-set rates means Ruthardt has
set rates too high in the past. ``There's fluff in the system
somewhere,'' Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the ``fluff'' has been company reserves
that have been tapped to remain competitive with other companies
offering discounts.
</P>
<P>
   State officials were tight-lipped about key elements of
Ruthardt's decision. For example, they declined to say how she
ruled on a Harshbarger request for financial sanctions against the
industry for failing to provide accurate data on executive
salaries. They also declined to say whether Ruthardt went along
with an industry proposal to begin dismantling the subsidies that
benefit urban drivers.

ARCH-MOBILEMEDIA DEAL UNDER A CLOUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arch Communications Group's planned acquisition of troubled
pager giant MobileMedia Corp. could run afoul of a group of the
company's bondholders, who say they may have enough votes to
scuttle the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly looks like we are very close,'' said George
Putnum III, president of New Generation Advisers, a Boston
investment firm representing the bondholders.
</P>
<P>
   Putnum said some bondholders have rebelled against Arch's
proposal, which followed MobileMedia's bankruptcy filing in early
1997, because it is ``grossly unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems that a number of other viable options have not
been considered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A merger with Arch, based in Westborough, Mass., would create
the No. 2 US paging company with more than 7 million subscribers
and $800 million in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Arch deal, MobileMedia's unsecured creditors including
bondholders would be paid with Arch stock and stock options. But
the options to buy Arch stock at $2 a share are ``essentially
worthless,'' Putnam said. Arch shares have been trading well below
$2, which means it would cost less to purchase the shares outright
than to exercise the options. Arch planned to use the money paid by
bondholders to help finance the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a bit of economic sense,'' for the
bondholders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam said the $479 million acquisition plan was favored by a
small group of creditors who own Arch securities. ``They are sort
of calling the shots right now,'' but their desires ``are not
consistent with the desires of the creditor group as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   While some bondholders are balking, four major creditors agreed
to support the deal by promising to step in and buy shares not
purchased by other bondholders. They are Credit Suisse First Boston
Corp. of New York; Whipoorwill Associates Inc. of White Plains, New
York; Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. of Milwaukee; and W.R.
Huff Asset Management Co. of Morristown, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   MobileMedia _ one of the nation's largest electronic paging
companies and a chief rival of Arch _ filed a petition for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection Jan. 30, 1997, following large
acquisitions that plunged the company into debt. In October, the
company reported a $5.72 million loss, according to public filings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fort Lee, N.J. company has done a good job in turning
its business around, Putnum said, and could find ``more favorable
terms'' in another buyer or as a standalone company.
</P>
<P>
   Arch shares closed at 1 5/32, down 9/32, on Nasdaq. Shares have
declined about 71 percent since the merger was announced Aug. 20.
MobileMedia shares were delisted by the Nasdaq in June 1997.

PATRIOTS PLAYERS, COACH LOOKING AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It's the spineless season, when some players
point fingers at game plans and coaching staffs when things go bad,
overlooking the fact that it is they _ not the balding, middle-aged
men dressed in Patriots garb _ who play the games.
</P>
<P>
   After a decisive loss to the Jets in the Meadowlands Sunday,
there were comments from New England players about being
``outplayed'' and ``outcoached,'' and references to the Jets having
what the Patriots used to have. So with the playoffs arriving this
weekend, maybe it did take a Steve Sidwell or an Ernie Zampese or a
Pete Carroll to take players aside Monday and tell them that they
should watch what they say and keep any problems they have
in-house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Sidwell said (Monday),'' offered defensive end Willie
McGinest, ``this league is made up of people pointing fingers. When
things aren't going well, coaches point fingers at players and
players point fingers at coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this organization and team, that's something we try and
stay away from. We try to stay together as a family and a team. And
pointing fingers at each other is something that happens. Sometimes
a guy can be having a normal conversation and someone hears it and
it gets out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was not the case after this loss. Players were speaking
loudly and clearly.
</P>
<P>
   And so defensive end Ferric Collons, a quiet, bright man of 6
feet 7 inches and 310 pounds, was the one who sprinkled a dose of
reality on his teammates Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the deal,'' Collons said. ``Nobody wants to lose.
Nobody wants to lose in that fashion. But the goal of any season is
to get into the dance, and we're in the dance. Everything that's
happened in the last 17 weeks is gone and done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated the way we played. I hated the outcome of Sunday's
game, but it's over and done with and now we have to concentrate on
beating Jacksonville there.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding comments that the Patriots were flat and didn't come
to play, Collons said, ``You're a professional and you come to play
every week if you're a good team. And we're a good team who got
beat on that given day and they were a better team on that day. But
don't say you didn't come to play. You come to play. We lined up
and got beat. We took a bad situation and made it worse. We didn't
adjust properly as players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for everybody, but all of that `flat'
(expletive) is (expletive).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a (expletive) excuse is what that is. We're a very good
football team. You know how it goes on any given day in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning a supposed lack of preparedness, Collons said, ``If
you get beat deep or you miss a tackle or you get knocked off the
(expletive) ball, that has nothing to do with your (expletive)
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Line up, be a man, look in the (expletive) mirror and say you
were outplayed Monday. You might not like some of the situations
you were put in, but it's your job. You make the most of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to cover for anyone in this (expletive)
building, but that's (expletive). We got outplayed Monday. It's not
a matter of I don't like this or I don't like that. Line up, buckle
up your chinstrap, and be a man about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The moral of this story is don't tell Ferric Collons that
coaching is the issue. There are many other Patriots who feel the
same way. And those who don't feel that way won't be blurting it
out after tough losses anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard anything about players criticizing game plans
or confidence in the game plan,'' said wide receiver Shawn
Jefferson. ``Every week it's good. It's up to the players to
execute it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any players were looking over to the Jets' sideline,
longing for what they once had, Jefferson said, ``No. I don't think
the players are saying that. If they are, they should look deep
down within themselves and see what they're doing wrong. I think
we're a close team and we stick together in all situations. We're
going to go out and have a great game this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, still standing after his weekly bludgeoning by the
media and fans, was asked again what happened. Why couldn't the
Patriots have given it more of an effort?
</P>
<P>
   ``When the plays don't happen and you're taking it, taking it,
and taking it, there's nothing to get excited about,'' said
Carroll. ``It's the old chicken and the egg. Is it the plays that
create the excitement or the excitement that creates the plays?
When you play this many games, you have to play well to create the
excitement. When we don't get the sack when we're free on the rush
. . . there were too many plays that we didn't take advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did not view film of the New York game Monday;
instead they began studying Jacksonville, their first-round playoff
opponent Sunday. McGinest said the team has put the Jets game
behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to use that game as a steppingstone,'' said McGinest.
``We have to turn it positive heading for the playoffs. Nobody's
record matters anymore. If you lose, you go home. And if you play
well, you go on.''

JUDGE SADIE SHULMAN, AT 107; FIRST WOMAN ON A MASS. BENCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Judge Sadie Lipner Shulman, the first woman judge
commissioned in Massachusetts, died Wednesday in Johnson City,
Tenn. She was 107.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Shulman was sworn in as an associate justice of the
Municipal Court of the Dorchester District of Boston by Governor
Frank G. Allen on Dec. 17, 1930. Emma Fall Schofield was named a
judge at Malden District Court the same day. To settle the delicate
matter of who would have the honor of being the first woman judge,
Mrs. Schofield signed the appropriate papers first and Judge
Shulman was given the first commission, as special justice at the
Dorchester District Court.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the first woman to preside over a court in
Boston, she was the first woman named assistant corporation counsel
of the City of Boston, a post she held from 1926 to 1930. She was
also the first woman president of the Boston University Law School
Alumni Association.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City, she graduated cum laude from Boston
University Law School in 1911, when she was 20. She was admitted to
the bar the following year.
</P>
<P>
   She endowed a scholarship for women at Boston University Law
School, where the women's lounge is named in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   In a profile published in the Globe on Dec. 17, 1965, when she
was observing her 35th year on the bench, she was described as ``a
motherly woman who looks more suited to bouncing grandchildren on
her knee than meting out justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not what is called a `tough' judge,'' Judge Shulman said,
``but I'm severe when I need to be severe. I pride myself in
thinking I'm a pretty jood judge of human nature and I think I've
developed that over the years. You base your decisions on the
evidence and not on being `tough' or `soft.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Shulman received widespread publicity in April 1964, when
she directed that five juveniles, ages 13 to 15, be taken to a
Dorchester funeral home to view the body of a woman the 13-year-old
was charged with killing when they were joyriding in a stolen car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It occurred to me,'' Judge Shulman said at the time, ``that
these boys take a look at this women, 48 years old, whose life had
been nipped out, that it would make a lasting impression on then,
that they never again would take a car or get behind the wheel
without thinking of the consequences, that they had to be shocked
into the realization of what they had caused to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, when she was observing her 40th year on the

CAMBODIA'S LEADER SAYS TOP KHMER ROUGE DEFECTORS WILL BE SPARED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Defying international pressure to put top
leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial, Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Monday that they should be welcomed ``with bouquets of flowers, not
with prisons and handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing to greet two of the last Khmer Rouge holdouts _ Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea _ at his home on Tuesday, Hun Sen said a
trial would reopen old wounds and possibly lead to instability.
Both men, who defected on Saturday, were at the very top of the
Khmer Rouge hierarchy from 1975 to 1979, when the group ruled the
country and more than a million people were executed or died of
starvation, disease and overwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look ahead to the
21st century with a clean slate,'' Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the last of the movement's leaders to give up the
struggle, and Hun Sen did not rule out a future Khmer Rouge trial,
saying it was an issue for the judiciary _ which he controls _
rather than the executive branch to decide.
</P>
<P>
   The defections of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea leave only one
major figure at large, Ta Mok, known as ``the Butcher,'' who seems
to be as unpopular among his comrades as he is among his enemies.
Hun Sen said Monday that he would extend no welcome to Ta Mok.
</P>
<P>
   The main Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died in April. If the last
two defectors, along with earlier ones like the former Khmer Rouge
foreign minister, Ieng Sary, are not brought to trial, Ta Mok _ if
he is captured _ could be the sole Khmer Rouge figure to be held
accountable for the deaths and misery the movement caused.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's remarks Monday were not the way he has talked in the
past. In June 1997 he signed a letter requesting help from the
United Nations in preparing for a trial for Khmer Rouge leaders on
charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   In a weekend interview, Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N. official who
monitors human rights in Cambodia, said Hun Sen had repeatedly
assured him that he planned to proceed with a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I agree completely that there must be justice,' ''
Hammarberg said. `` `I promise you that no one will be spared.' He
told me this several times.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of struggle against political opponents, it is only
in the last two months that Hun Sen has achieved full control of
Cambodia's government. His stance Monday seemed to reflect a desire
to avoid a situation that could get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his words echoed a feeling among many Cambodians
who are exhausted from decades of conflict and prefer not to stir
up the demons of their past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a wound does not hurt, you should not poke at it with a
stick to make it bleed,'' Hun Sen said. ``If we put these two men
in prison, will this benefit society or lead to civil war?''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment clashes with a contrary feeling among many
foreigners _ and many Cambodians as well _ that a wound cannot heal
until it is treated, even if the cure is painful.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers say a ``culture of impunity,'' with its
roots in the unresolved cases of Khmer Rouge leaders, is to blame
for much of the country's lawlessness and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said in
Washington that after a trial Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea could be
pardoned in the interest of national reconciliation if that is what
Cambodians choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to allow these men to return to society as if one of the
worst massacres of the 20th century never took place _ that's
unthinkable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, experts are preparing an outline of
charges and legal procedures that could be used if a tribunal is
created. One possibility would be to create a special court in a
third country, like those trying people charged with committing
genocide and other crimes in Rwanda and Yugoslavia. Another would
be for Cambodia to set up its own special court with international
help.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen brushed aside all outside advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cambodia we know how to heal ourselves using our own
medicines,'' he said. ``If we try mixing in foreign medicine it
will not cure Cambodian diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The interests of the nation and the people do not
require a trial or conflicts among ourselves, but national
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers here largely support this stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambodia should discard sentiments of vengeance,'' said the
daily Rasmei Angkor. ``Even if we killed Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea, the lives of those who died would not be returned to us. The
best thing now is for all Cambodians to come together and love each
other so we can find real peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Noun Chea, 71, who was ``Brother Number Two'' under Pol Pot, and
Khieu Samphan, 67, who was the official head of state, joined a
community of defectors in the remote town of Pailin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Both had spent most of their lives as revolutionaries, alongside
Pol Pot. Khieu Samphan, the public face of the movement, returned
to Phnom Penh once before, in 1991, and was attacked by a mob
organized by Hun Sen's government. Nuon Chea was the man whose idea
of creating a primitive agrarian society led to the forced
evacuation of the cities and the massacres of the country's
educated classes.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of former Khmer Rouge leaders are now nominally
within government control in Pailin and elsewhere and are available
for capture and trial, after more than two years of defections.
</P>
<P>
   But Hun Sen said the two latest defectors should be greeted with
an embrace for giving up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not come tomorrow with the political and military
agenda of the Khmer Rouge,'' he said. ``They will come as simple
citizens, bringing their wives and children and grandchildren.
There's nothing for anyone to worry about.''

MUSEUM DEFENDS ARTIFACT ACQUISITION PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and e coding; Vermeule is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Museum of Fine Arts, responding to a Boston Globe
report that it has acquired scores of classical antiquities in
recent years that may have been plundered from grave sites, Monday
said it exercises ``appropriate diligence'' when it acquires
artworks.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornelius C. Vermeule III, the retired curator who oversaw
most of the acquisitions, said Monday that he does not know whether
some of the objects might have been freshly looted from grave sites
when the museum acquired them.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, a former MFA director said the museum seldom
raised questions about the origin of antiquities it acquired. And
two antiquities dealers who have sold objects to the museum said
they cannot always say that objects they sell have not been
recently looted.
</P>
<P>
   With assistance from 11 archeologists, the Globe studied 71
classical artifacts the museum acquired, by donation or purchase,
between mid-1984 and mid-1987. Only 10 had a history of any prior
owner. The remaining 61 had no history at all, strong
circumstantial evidence, the scholars said, that they had recently
been looted by grave robbers, mostly in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-paragraph statement, the MFA said that when it
considers acquiring objects for its collection, the artifacts are
reviewed ``to ensure that their addition to the Museum's collection
is both legal and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brief statement, the MFA chose not to take issue with
what the Globe reported. Asked about that late Monday, Dawn
Griffin, the MFA spokeswoman, said the museum does not agree that
it acquired the artifacts without exercising due diligence.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule, the MFA's classical curator for four decades until his
retirement in 1996, did not return telephone calls before the Globe
report. But in a brief telephone interview Monday, Vermeule said
the MFA ``tried to do due diligence'' before acquiring artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it was possible that some of the 61 undocumented
artifacts might have been freshly looted, Vermeule replied, ``I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule took issue with MFA director Malcolm Rogers for
consistently refusing to discuss the acquisitions, even though his
predecessor, Alan Shestack, acknowledged in an interview last week
that the MFA had been less than rigorous in ensuring that artifacts
it acquired were not recently plundered. Shestack was director from
1987 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum and Malcolm Rogers should talk about these things.
Otherwise it will look like we've been bounding through the
marketplace picking up everything in sight,'' Vermeule said.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported that the museum acquired the undocumented
objects after it committed itself in 1983 to observe international
standards designed to slow the plunder of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Bondioli Osio, the president of Italy's Interministerial
Commission for the Recovery of Art, expressed frustration Monday at
cases like that involving the MFA, saying his government cannot
mount a successful legal claim without having evidence of where and
when an artifact was looted.
</P>
<P>
   As one way to minimize the demand for looted artifacts, Italy
recently began making year-long loans to US museums of classical
antiquities that are much more important and valuable than most
museums could afford to purchase, according to Bondioli Osio.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA now faces a likely lawsuit from the government of
Guatemala, seeking the return of a collection of pre-Columbian
artifacts the MFA acquired in 1988. The museum's lawyer has
acknowledged that he knew the objects were illegally exported from
Guatemala. But the MFA has insisted that they were legally imported
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe also reported that Turkey's government is pressing for
the return of the top half of a ``Weary Herakles'' statue whose
bottom half is in a Turkish museum in Antalya.
</P>
<P>
   Murray C. McClellan, a Boston University classical archeologist,
said he views the fact that the MFA did not take issue with the
Globe's story as an indication that the museum might take greater
precautions in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll see whether they really do exercise due diligence,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said the potential lawsuits, by Turkey and Guatemala,
would amount to a tragic waste of resources. But given the museum's
statement, he said, ``I would be shocked if they would make a major
blunder, like Guatemala or the Herakles, again.''

SPORTS COLUMN: GRAHAM MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER FOR GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Far more polite than he typically is
going after the quarterback, Michael Strahan waited patiently for
Kent Graham to throw another bone of humility to the assembled
reporters yesterday in the Giants' post-season locker room before
reaching through the crowd to hand the quarterback a white slip of
paper containing two telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Stay in touch, the Pro Bowl defensive end was saying. You're my
man, until I hear otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, if he's the starting quarterback, I'm fine with
that,'' Strahan said. ``One thing you can say about Kent, this is
not a guy who is going to go sit in the back of the bus. He's going
to drive it. He's a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether he is a Super Bowl-caliber quarterback,
or even good enough to be the Giants' 1999 starter, was one Jim
Fassel later managed to avoid, as if his coaching life depended on
it. That it well might made it all the more prudent for Fassel to
step up to his lectern, avoid the rush to judgment, take a good,
hard look at every available option downfield.
</P>
<P>
   That means free agency, the draft, a trade or an unexpected
discovery in space. It does not rule Graham out as next season's
starter, or in. Like everyone else, he'll have to wait to find out
if the Giants can do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to assume anything about anybody,'' said Fassel,
having learned from experience, the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel stuck by his man this season, gave Danny Kanell an
11-week-long benefit of the doubt, and it cost him the playoffs.
The Giants punted, fumbled and threw away winnable games at
Oakland, Tampa Bay, Washington and Dallas. Their fast late-season
finish under Graham seems to have shifted the direction of the
quarterback debate, if not the momentum of the franchise. The
support is now there for Graham, within the Giants' locker room and
without, in the way it was there for Glenn Foley at this time last
year with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the uproar in tabloid city when Bill Parcells started
that mistake-prone loser, Vinny Testaverde, over Foley last summer
in the Jets' second preseason game? Foley was dazed, his fans
confused, but Parcells was admitting in his own loving, autocratic
way that he didn't know what either guy could do over the course of
16 games. He believed in Foley but only enough to give him a
chance, which didn't amount to half a season. Foley got hurt,
returned to play poorly. Parcells called for Testaverde, for
sturdiness over spunk. What ensued was an assault on the Jets'
sorrowful history that is still in Hollywood-like rewrite.
</P>
<P>
   The smart coach knows enough to take no one without all-pro
credentials for granted, be it under the pressure of his personal
obsession, or that of his own front office. Parcells answers only
to the part of himself that is tortured by losing, but Fassel, for
all his positive reviews, may soon have to convince his superiors
that the Giants, as he put it, are ``showing progress.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew of those five head coaches who barely got their headsets
off after season-ending games before getting the ax. It wasn't long
ago that Dom Capers had Carolina and Ray Rhodes had Philadelphia in
the playoffs, where the Giants went briefly last year. More than
ever, coaches are ``under the scrutiny of win now,'' Fassel
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't mail me the letter, fax it to me,'' he added. ``In
today's society, we want everything right now. It's where are you
going to be in two or three years, and that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year will be Fassel's third. The news media and fans have
the luxury of going with the flavor of the last six weeks. The
coach will eventually be held accountable if another quarterback
flops on his watch. Fassel effectively deployed Kanell to get out
from under Dave Brown, and similarly used Graham to unseat Kanell.
But five victories to finish a season already drained of
expectation are not enough for a career backup to claim the future.
Not when the coach's job, his first, is heading into the inevitable
post-honeymoon phase.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's situation is made stickier because he has a win-now
defense that should be healthier and better next year. Can the
Giants find someone more talented than Graham or at least
competitive with him in a Testaverde-Foley way before they commit
their first-round pick in the draft? If not, is Graham good enough
to get the Giants into the playoffs while Fassel develops an heir?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can keep me off the field, I'm for that,'' Strahan said,
recalling those exhausting afternoons with Brown, with Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   These proud Giants defenders don't ask for much. They do deserve
better. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Monday that the Social
Security Administration had completely fixed all its computers so
that elderly people would receive their monthly benefit payments on
time, without interruption, in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In his most extensive remarks on the subject since July, Clinton
said that elderly people ``can rest easy'' because the Social
Security agency had repaired its computers to deal with the year
2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   He did not address the situation at other agencies judged by the
White House to be inadequately prepared for the year 2000. These
include the Pentagon, the Energy Department and the agency that
runs Medicare and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem arises from early computer programming
that often used only the last two digits of the year, making 2000
indistinguishable from 1900 to computers. If the problem is not
corrected, experts say, computers could produce inaccurate data or
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Monday that the year 2000 challenge was ``a
stunning problem'' for computer programmers. But he said: ``The
millennium bug will not delay the payment of Social Security checks
by a single day. The Social Security system is now 100 percent
compliant with our standards and safeguards for the year 2000. To
make absolutely certain, the system has been tested and validated
by a panel of independent experts. The system works, it is secure,
and therefore older Americans can feel more secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the computer repairs were a symbol of the policy
changes that had to be made to renovate Social Security and keep it
solvent for the baby boom generation. He again invited Congress to
work with him on this task.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security Administration was known to be ahead of
other agencies in dealing with the year 2000 problem. Social
Security's chief information officer, Kathleen Adams, said she and
her colleagues had been working on the problem since they
discovered it in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the White House Office of Management and Budget
said this month that six other agencies were ``not making adequate
progress.'' The six include the Pentagon, the Energy Department and
the Department of Health and Human Services, which runs Medicare
and Medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Office of Management and Budget said, only 61
percent of the government's ``mission critical'' computer systems
have been fixed. There are nearly 6,700 such systems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's narrow focus Monday, in his first such speech since a
call to action in July, disappointed many experts on the year 2000
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., who heads the House Subcommittee on
government Management, Information and Technology, said: ``What
about the departments and agencies that have started their
remediation efforts only within the last few years? The Departments
of Energy, Health and Human Services, Defense, Transportation and
State are all failing in their Y2K repair efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Robert Cohen, a spokesman for the Information
Technology Association of American, a trade group for the computer
industry, said, ``Holding up an example of success shows President
Clinton takes this issue seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Several independent consultants said that what the country
really needed from Clinton was a commitment to make regular reports
on a handful of industries like power, telephones and banks, whose
problems could affect all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security is an easy shot,'' said Ian Hayes, president
of Clarity Consulting in South Hamilton, Mass. ``President Clinton
is not giving any reassurance to people who know a lot about the
subject.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton has set March 31, 1999, as the deadline for federal
agencies to have fixed and tested major computer systems to deal
with the year 2000 problem. But in a report issued on Dec. 8, the
Office of Management and Budget said the Pentagon's progress was
``too slow to meet the March 1999 goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials said they were worried about
thousands of tiny computers and computer chips embedded in
laboratory equipment and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Federal health officials said that fixing computers was their
top priority. While scrambling to repair computers, Medicare
officials said they would miss several statutory deadlines for
changes made by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. One of these
changes would reduce amounts that elderly people pay for hospital
outpatient services, including diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Even if federal agencies repair their computers, they still must
deal with state agencies, some of which are far behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, for example, is run jointly by the federal government
and the states. A state Medicaid program receives tens of thousands
of electronic claims from health care providers each year. If their
computers cannot cope with the year 2000, their Medicaid payments
may be delayed.

 &HT;    Georgia teachers don't fare well in skills tests, report shows
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia is among a majority of Southern states
certifying new teachers who score as low as the bottom quarter on a
national basic-skills teacher test, according to a new report on
raising standards for middle schools in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The report, focusing on the relationship between teacher quality
and the South's low 8th-grade student achievement in math and
science on a prominent national test, found that Georgia is one of
eight Southern states allowing students to be admitted with scores
that are lower than 75 percent of test-takers' scores nationally in
reading and writing on a basic-skills entrance exam used by teacher
programs in 11 states in the region. The required minimum scores in
Georgia are above only 16 percent of the test-takers' scores
nationally in reading, 20 percent in writing and 29 percent in
math. Among states studied by the Southern Regional Education Board
(SREB) for the report, only Virginia, North Carolina and Delaware
set all three minimum scores on the test above the 25th percentile.
The highest is Virginia, which requires a minimum passing score
that is higher than 54 percent of scores nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia will raise its minimums on the test, called Praxis I, in
two years to levels at least as high as those in North Carolina and
Delaware. States in other parts of the country using the test set
standards no higher than the South, overall.
</P>
<P>
   Because the test began in Georgia in mid-1997, virtually none of
the 10,000 middle school teachers already in Georgia's classrooms
took it. Improving teacher-education programs, as the Board of
Regents and the Professional Standards Commission are both
attempting to do, only affects about 5 percent of the teachers
coming into the system each year.
</P>
<P>
   To raise standards for current teachers, the report recommended
that middle school teachers lacking a subject-matter major or
minor, such as in math or science, go back to college to earn its
equivalent within five years. It also recommended that every middle
school develop a staff-development plan built around the school's
student-achievement scores.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, at least, gets a gold star for not allowing
elementary-education certificates to cover beyond the fifth grade,
according to the SREB, an Atlanta-based board that advises 16
governors from Delaware to Texas on education policy. Across most
of the South, elementary education certificates cover or overlap
the middle grades, allowing at least a third of all middle-grade
teachers in SREB states to have only elementary-education
background.
</P>
<P>
   Still, middle schools are not rigorous enough, both in the
teachers' subject knowledge and in the way teachers are assigned
outside their academic specialty, said Lynn Cornett, an SREB senior
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Middle schools ``do a lot of team teaching, block schedules, all
those newfangled ideas, but they don't use them to focus on
academic content, and improving the academic achievement of
students,'' Cornett said.

PRIME-TIME TV'S GROWING RACIAL DIVIDE FRUSTRATES INDUSTRY'S BLACKS

   LOS ANGELES _ Last year ``Seinfeld,'' the top-rated television
show in white households, ranked 50th in African-American homes,
according to Nielsen Media Research, while the comedy ``Between
Brothers,'' No. 1 in black households, ranked 112th among whites.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, according to Nielsen, in the first two months of the
current prime-time season, ``The Steve Harvey Show,'' a comedy,
ranked No. 1 in black households and 118th in white households,
while ``Friends,'' the No. 1 comedy and No. 2 show in white
households, ranked 91st among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Prime-time television has rarely been as racially divided as it
is today, both in terms of casts and audiences, a fact most
striking in network television's dominant form of entertainment,
comedy. Networks, under enormous pressure to maximize dwindling
profits, have been focusing on the more numerous and generally more
affluent white households that advertisers prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Because whites rarely watch shows, particularly sitcoms, with
largely black casts, the networks broadcast relatively few with
black or even integrated casts in prime time, the three-hour block
from 8 to 11 p.m. that is the most lucrative and competitive
portion of television programming. Given the growing popularity of
cable, the four major networks, ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, plus the
upstarts, WB and UPN, have seen their share of overall viewers
reduced to less than 60 percent, but cable's audience is fragmented
by dozens of channels, and the networks still reach the largest
audiences by far.
</P>
<P>
   The growing racial divide reverses a trend toward greater
integration of actors and toward the production of more crossover
shows in the 70s and 80s, when path breaking series with heavily
black casts like ``Good Times'' and ``The Cosby Show'' achieved
great popularity. In addition, many of the current shows featuring
blacks are increasingly bunched together and segregated from the
rest of the prime-time schedule.
</P>
<P>
   This has led to bitter feelings among many black producers,
writers and actors, who say they are often asked to make their
shows less overtly black in a largely vain effort to attract white
viewers. These requests often take the form of demands to ``broaden
the appeal'' of the shows, code for adding more white characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a concerted effort by white executives to
place white faces on black shows,'' said Steve Harvey, whose show
is on the WB network. ``We have had to place white faces on our
show this year. We didn't ask for it. It came down on us. We happen
to like those characters, and they've worked out well. But how
often do you find it going the other way? There's never an
expectation that a white show needs a few more black faces.''
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, members of other minority groups, including
Hispanics and Asian-Americans, have complained that they are
underrepresented on prime time. Blacks have been fighting for
representation the longest, while there are now a growing number of
Spanish-language programs aimed at Hispanics, as well as the
black-oriented cable channel, BET.
</P>
<P>
   As much as they might prefer a different dynamic, a number of
television executives, all white, said they were business people,
not social reformers, and they maintained that there was generally
little resistance from audiences to the trend of racial
polarization, and thus little incentive to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody's crying out for integrated shows,''
said Sandy Grushow, the president of 20th Century Fox Television,
which produces shows for several networks. ``By pursuing
advertisers and demographics rather than a mass audience, the
networks have declared they don't need blacks in their audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Some network executives say they have tried to change the
situation, citing examples like ``The Hughleys,'' a new ABC sitcom
about a black family that moves from the inner city to a white
suburb; ``The Gregory Hines Show,'' which ran on CBS last year but
failed; and Fox's ``Getting Personal,'' a show with an integrated
cast, which also was unable to find an audience. And the executives
point out that the record is not so bad in some programming
categories. Among one-hour dramas, for instance, popular shows like
``Homicide,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``ER''
have prominent black characters.
</P>
<P>
   But comedies account for roughly three-quarters of prime-time
fare, and the racial divide is most evident on these shows. ``The
Steve Harvey Show,'' for instance, was watched by about 2 million
black households, 17 percent of the total for blacks, but 923,000
white households, 1.1 percent of total white households.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the situation reflects reality for most
Americans: Dramas frequently involve the workplace, where
integration has become more prevalent, while comedies often focus
on home life, which is more segregated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the divide has perplexed many within the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a sociologist, so I don't know what it indicates,''
said Jamie Tarses, the president of ABC Entertainment. But she
added: ``In the business I'm in, what we're trying to do, it makes
sense for us to reach as wide a place as we can. We're not trying
to reach a niche audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Many blacks in television argue, however, that more shows would
cross the racial divide if marketed more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks assume white America is much more racist than
they've been proven to be in other areas,'' said Ralph Farquhar, a
producer of shows like ``Moesha,'' ``South Central'' and ``The
Sinbad Show,'' all part of a new generation of black shows
introduced in the last decade. ``How do you explain the popularity
of the NBA or rap music? There's crossover if there's an effort to
create the exposure. It's a marketing problem. But they don't want
to do that. So there's a chitlin circuit on TV.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The problem was highlighted in Hollywood last summer in a
much-discussed incident involving the comedian Dave Chappelle and
his producer, Peter Tolan, an Emmy award winner, who were finishing
a sitcom for the Fox network. The pilot had Chappelle, who is
black, appearing at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on amateur night.
Fox executives called a meeting and said that though they liked the
show, they wondered if there wasn't some way to ``broaden its
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a chilling moment for Chappelle and Tolan, who took that
to mean adding more white actors. Peter Roth, then president of the
Fox network, later acknowledged the request but said it was among
several things he asked for, and not ``simply about inserting white
faces into the show.'' Still, Tolan and Chappelle refused, and the
project was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The prime-time schedules of the networks have been criticized at
times for the lack of diversity in their casts. The most successful
lineup on television, NBC's Thursday night block of comedies, is
overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a Top 10 show without a lot of white people
watching your show,'' said Andy Borowitz, an executive producer of
``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' a popular show, now off the air, that
starred Will Smith. He said had he had faced relentless pressure to
add white members to its heavily black cast. ``The knee-jerk
response at the network was, maybe we need more cast members on the
show. They never said white, but, curiously, all the characters
they proposed were white. They believed a white audience wouldn't
watch a black show.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Alligood is a senior vice president for special markets at
BBDO New York, the advertising agency, and a student of white and
black viewing patterns. ``It is definitely more difficult in prime
time to bring whites to black shows than it is to bring blacks to
white shows,'' he said. ``A show doesn't stand a chance once it's
labeled a black show. The fact is, fewer and fewer shows cross over
each year.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not always been this way. In the 70s and 80s there were
several popular and critically acclaimed shows, especially
comedies, with largely black or multiracial casts and very mixed
audiences. The list included shows like ``All in the Family,''
``The Jeffersons,'' ``Sanford and Son,'' ``Maude,'' ``Good Times''
and later ``The Cosby Show,'' ``A Different World'' and ``Diff'rent
Strokes.'' These were shows that, while reflecting some aspects of
black culture, deliberately set out to appeal to a broad, racially
mixed audience. By contrast, some of today's black-theme shows are
regarded as so strongly rooted in black youth culture that they
have a far narrower appeal.
</P>
<P>
   That tradition continues in many kinds of television programming
today, like sports, where athletes, announcers and audiences cross
racial barriers. Children's programming, as a matter of course,
tends to include cast members of several races and attracts mixed
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But prime time seems to be different. In the first two months of
the television season, only three shows, none of them comedies,
ranked in the Top 10 for both white and black households, ``NFL
Monday Night Football,'' ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``CBS Sunday
Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Lear, producer of some of the earlier breakthrough shows,
including ``All in the Family'' and ``The Jeffersons,'' pointed to
fierce competition from cable channels and dwindling network
profits as a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about short-term results; it's all about the bottom
line in a way it wasn't before,'' Lear said. ``But there are no
villains, I don't think. Nobody elected for things to go this way.
It's grown up around us, and the networks feel they have to live
with it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The modern worlds of black and white prime time began in the
late 1980s, when the upstart Fox network pursued black audiences
because there was far less competition in that niche from the major
networks. Fox produced shows that delved into black street and
youth culture, attracting a new generation of black writers,
producers and actors. Many of them then made similar shows for WB
and UPN networks, which at first followed the same strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But now that they have a foothold, the three networks have all
begun to focus on the more affluent and larger white audience. WB,
which carries the greatest number of shows with black casts, has
placed nearly all of them in one Thursday night lineup. UPN is
about to put most of its black shows together on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Ancier, president of entertainment for WB, said the
black-oriented comedies appeared to fare poorly when sprinkled
throughout the schedule, in part because whites were not tuning in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That lack of crossover is one of the more confusing things
going on right now, and it's troubling,'' Ancier said. ``I hope
that by doing segregated blocks, we haven't enhanced that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tarses of ABC said her network was trying to fight the
trend, within bounds. The network consciously developed ``The
Hughleys'' for that reason, she said. ``We wanted an
African-American show on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Many black producers hold out marketing as the answer.
</P>
<P>
   While arguing that ``we should have shows that revel in our own
culture, definitely,'' Yvette Lee Bowser, a producer who created
``Living Single,'' formerly on Fox, and ``For Your Love,'' on WB,
said such shows could still be open to a larger audience. ``I think
we should not be so narrow-minded as to think that no one from a
different race should watch those shows, or that they should be
marketed just to that one group. This industry should not make the
assumption that because a show has a black cast it is only for
black people, but they do.''
</P>
<P>
   While a number of black producers pointed out that black music
frequently reached a crossover audience, several television
executives said differing economics made it more difficult for
black shows to do the same and reap profits. Ted Harbert, the
former chairman of ABC Entertainment and now a producer, said that,
compared with record albums, television shows cost too much to
survive without a very broad audience. A sitcom can cost upward of
$500,000 an episode, while records rarely cost that much to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shows that have no crossover appeal cost just as much as a
show that does,'' Harbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Valentine, president of UPN, said he was shifting his
network's focus away from black shows because of these economic
realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been a predominantly black focus here,'' he said.
``There was a very strong belief that it was an audience that was
underserved in terms of programming. As in any business you want to
go where there's an underserved audience. But I believe you have to
broadcast, not narrowcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the networks had to program specifically for one
audience or the other, Valentine replied, ``I don't think it has to
be that way, but it certainly is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Television's portrayal of blacks has certainly had its ups and
downs, from stereotype-laden comedies like ``Amos 'n' Andy'' to
advances like the late-60s series ``Julia,'' starring Diahann
Carroll. It seemed to have reached a new stage in 1984 with the
premiere of ``The Cosby Show,'' on NBC. The show, about a family of
black professionals, the Huxtables, ran for eight years and
achieved huge success, attracting a multiracial audience, often
topping the ratings and spawning another successful show, ``A
Different World,'' about the Huxtables' daughter, going to college
and rooming with a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cosby Show'' was criticized in some quarters for depicting
a nonrepresentative upper-middle-class family, but others argued
that it exhibited positive values widely held in the black
community that were too often overlooked on television. (Cosby and
his co-star, Phylicia Rashad, are now in a CBS sitcom, called
simply ``Cosby,'' in which they play a working-class couple.)
</P>
<P>
   But many blacks feel that the beachhead established by ``The
Cosby Show'' has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me that when the show ended, the entertainment
industry, television in particular, pretended it had never
happened,'' Ms. Rashad said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Fales-Hill, the executive producer of ``A Different
World,'' said her show reflected a different era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a kind of freedom that existed then that doesn't
exist on the networks now,'' said Ms. Fales-Hill, whose new show,
``Linc's,'' about a black bar in Washington, is on the Showtime
cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Her old show addressed difficult issues like racism, the Los
Angeles riots, AIDS and perceived bias in the media, she pointed
out. ``If I pitched that show today, I'd be laughed out of the
room,'' she said. ``It's a different time.''

 &HT;    Kickers may be ace in hole for Tennessee, FSU
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ As their teams prepare for the Fiesta Bowl,
Tennessee's Phillip Fulmer and Florida State's Bobby Bowden face a
million uncertainties. But they both are sure of one thing: If the
game comes down to a field goal, they like their chances.
</P>
<P>
   The game for the national championship features two of the
nation's best kickers, Tennessee's Jeff Hall and Florida State's
Sebastian Janikowski. They are opposites in personality, but in
sticking the ball between the two yellow posts when the pressure is
on, they are dead, solid identical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Florida State likes their guy, and they should,'' said
Fulmer, Tennessee's coach. ``But when the game's on the line, there
is nobody I would rather have out there than Jeff Hall. He's proven
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, from Fulmer's hometown of Winchester, Tenn., is the
definitive clean-cut boy. A devout Christian, Hall leads the team's
Bible study and does not sample the abundant night life along
Knoxville's Cumberland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But he makes the kicks with the game on the line. On Sept. 5 he
made a 27-yarder as time expired to beat Syracuse 34-33.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 19, he made one of the biggest field goals of his life,
a 41-yarder in overtime to beat Florida 20-17. After the game, his
teammates went out and celebrated breaking a five-year drought
against the Gators. Hall celebrated in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home, had a bowl of Wheaties and went to bed,'' said
Hall, who still wears his junior-high T-shirt under his game
jersey. ``I was exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't let Hall's Dudley-Do-Right image fool you, his
teammates say. There is nothing laid-back about him when it comes
to winning. He is not above getting in another guy's face if he
sees them dogging it. That is one reason why the Tennessee players
voted Hall one of their co-captains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual for a kicker to be a captain, but in Jeff's
case, he earned it,'' said linebacker Al Wilson, who is also a
captain. ``Captains should be leaders, and Jeff is a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski, however, is a horse of a different color. He's not
built like a kicker (6 feet 2, 255 pounds), and he didn't grow up,
as Hall did, kicking footballs and dreaming of playing in college.
An outstanding soccer player, he came to the United States from
Poland in 1994 and enrolled at Seabreeze High in Daytona Beach,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Janikowski to get the knack of kicking a
football, and it didn't take long for word to filter out about the
kid with a cannon for a left leg.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Hall, Janikowski has proved to be a more fun-loving
sort in his two years at Florida State. On Nov. 22, the fun got out
of hand when he was charged with battery after an altercation with
a male cheerleader at a local bar. The two men gave different
versions of the event, and eventually the assistant state attorney
decided not to prosecute the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, Janikowski was asked to leave a Tallahassee night
club, and when he refused, police were called. He pleaded no
contest and paid $295 in court costs. Bowden did not suspend
Janikowski but forced him to do extra running after practice, along
with other undisclosed punishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a stupid thing,'' said Janikowski, who turned down
a lucrative offer to play soccer in Argentina. ``But everybody
makes mistakes, and now I've got to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski might have some growing up to do in his personal
life, but as a kicker he's as solid as a rock. This season he made
27 of 32 field goals, including 10 of 13 from 40 yards or more. He
has a career long of 56, but observers say he once nailed one from
77 yards in practice.
</P>
<P>
   But his greatest value to Florida State could be as a kickoff
specialist. Forty-seven of his 79 kickoffs this season have gone
for touchbacks. That means that 59.5 percent of the time after a
kickoff, the other team has taken possession on the 20-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great weapon,'' said Mickey Andrews, Florida State's
defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   And what if the game, and the national championship, did come
down to a last-second field goal?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love it,'' Hall said. ``When I was a little boy
kicking in my back yard, I used to pretend I was making kicks to
win the national championship for Tennessee. I've prepared all my
life to be in this kind of situation. I'd love to have the chance
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Janikowski is taking a more pragmatic approach. Unlike Hall, he
does not have fantasies of making the winning kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, because if you miss it you're going to be in the
newspapers all over the United States, and I don't want that,'' he
said. ``I'd rather score a touchdown.''

 &HT;    Rogers' first school was hard knocks
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacksonville, Fla. _ Charlie Rogers was 19 years old and a
target in the summer of 1995. Lucky for him, he was a moving one.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow a man's threats toward his sister, and his mother's
warning that her son would protect them, brought a dozen men
holding guns to the door of Rogers's home in Cliffwood, N.J. The
police came to the rescue, but the men returned the next night to
the alley behind the home and fired a shot intended for Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it hit Rogers' cousin in the back as Rogers ran
alongside him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard them say, 'What's up now?' `` Rogers recalled Monday.
``I guess they thought they'd shot me.''
</P>
<P>
   What's up now is that Rogers is a senior star for the Georgia
Tech Yellow Jackets preparing to play his final college game Friday
in the Gator Bowl. He shows no signs of a heavy history, of friends
and family members being carted off to jail.
</P>
<P>
   He's a warm-hearted, positive guy off the field, and on the
field he's one of the main reasons behind Tech's 9-2 season and its
berth in the New Year's Day game against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever he saw an adult (while growing up), it was always,
'Yes, ma'am,' and, 'No, sir,' `` said Kim Rogers, Charlie's mother.
``He never raised his voice.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Rogers was in the 10th grade, his mother was in
jail. He moved in with his aunt, looked after his younger brother
and sister and kept going to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody actually made me go to school,'' Rogers said. ``But I
was determined to make it to college.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother got out when Rogers was in his senior year, and by
then, he had turned poor grades into good ones and had college
recruiters knocking on his door. Rogers chose Georgia Tech because
coach George O'Leary wanted him as a runnng back and most schools
wanted to convert the 5-foot-9, 175-pounder into a defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   While playing running back for Tech, Rogers also has returned
kickoffs and, this season, punts. When the Yellow Jackets needed
help at wide receiver this year, he moved into the slot and learned
a new position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably pound for pound one of our toughest players,''
O'Leary said. ``He's a great competitor, and what he does is very
contagious. . . . He's done a magnificent job, what he's done with
himself, his maturity. I've been happy to see him grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was elected a team captain for the season by his
teammates, receiving the most votes of the three. Defensive end
Jesse Tarplin describes Rogers as an ``inspiration;'' he was
talking about his size, not his background, which is something his
teammates might not even know.
</P>
<P>
   For Rogers, however, getting here from there is what his success
has been all about. Just ask his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been so determined,'' Kim Rogers said. ``I'm so proud of
him I don't know which way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Rogers is hoping for a shot at the NFL,
probably returning kicks, where his speed and elusiveness help and
his size doesn't hurt. Otherwise, he plans to finish school and
live in Atlanta. His mother wants to move the family wherever
Charlie is, eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the city,'' Rogers said. ``People down here are
friendly, not like home, where people are in a race to go places.
It's not as hostile as home.''
</P>
<P>
   And for his finale as a Yellow Jacket, Rogers said he wants to
go out with a bang _ the kind that widens eyes and gives hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be remembered as a good player,'' he said. ``A
tough guy who made plays when plays needed to be made. Somebody who
worked hard, and, I guess, a positive guy.''

 &HT;    'Bloody Monday' in NFL as 5 coaches lose jobs
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a quiet moment in training camp last summer, Seattle
Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson acknowledged that he was one of
several NFL sideline bosses entering the 1998 campaign with the
``sword of (Damocles) hanging over our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Erickson and four others discovered that
disconcerting threat to security actually was a guillotine, as the
heads of head coaches rolled in record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Owners moved swiftly to demonstrate to disgruntled fans that
losing would not be tolerated _ and to establish an early pecking
order in the shallow pool of possible replacements. In addition to
Erickson, the casualties were Dom Capers of Carolina, Baltimore's
Ted Marchibroda, Ray Rhodes of Philadelphia and Dave Wannstedt of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The last four all were dumped within an hour of the start of the
business day Monday. Only his West Coast location bought Erickson a
temporary reprieve of a few hours. The decisiveness of owners on
what one suddenly unemployed assistant coach described as ``Bloody
Monday'' was unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Five coaches had not been fired on one day since the NFL and AFL
merged, in 1970. Although the wholesale purge might have been an
aberration, it magnified a disturbing trend. Over the last two
decades, the average NFL coaching tenure has been reduced by about
40 percent, from five seasons to roughly three years. Only six
coaches have been with their current teams since before 1995.
Kansas City's Marty Schottenheimer is the lone NFL coach who has 10
years tenure with his current franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like they trotted out the firing squad,'' former NFL
coach Chuck Knox said about the Monday massacre, ``and the blood
started running. Everybody in the business knows it's a job with no
security, but you don't expect something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, however, the only dismissal that rated as even mildly
surprising was that of Wannstedt, whose Bears were competitive for
much of the season. ``It's a tough job in a tough city,'' said
Wannstedt, who appeared stressed the past month and confided to a
friend last week that the uncertainty of his status was an
increasing strain.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT'S NEXT?
</P>
<P>
   _ Dom Capers: Among the leading contenders to replace Ray Rhodes
in Philadelphia, or could possibly return to Pittsburgh as
defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dennis Erickson: College background and limited NFL contacts
will make it difficult for him to find work in the league in '99,
even as an assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ted Marchibroda: At age 67, his coaching days are over, and
he's likely to be offered _ and accept _ some sort of front-office
position with the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ray Rhodes: Despite a poor record the last two seasons, could
be a candidate in Green Bay and won't have problem landing a
coordinator's job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dave Wannstedt: Respected long-time defensive coordinator will
catch on as assistant, maybe in Miami, and get the opportunity to
start rebuilding his reputation.

BLACKS HAVE HAD GOOD TIMES AND BAD ON PRIME-TIME TV 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TV-RACE) 
(nk) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prime-time television has had an uneven record in employing and
depicting blacks. Early shows like ``Beulah'' and ``Amos 'n' Andy''
have been heavily criticized for the caricatures they presented,
but it took years for black actors to find better roles.
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly unsettling incident in the 1950s, the
popular black singer Nat (King) Cole was unable to attract a
corporate sponsor for his short-lived variety show, reportedly
because of fears that Southerners might boycott the sponsor's
products.
</P>
<P>
   One breakthrough came in 1965, when Bill Cosby, already popular
with white audiences as a comedian, co-starred on ``I Spy'' and
eventually won three Emmys. In 1968, Diahann Carroll, who had
already established crossover appeal as a singer and star of
Broadway musicals, appeared in a popular series, ``Julia,'' about a
black nurse struggling to raise her child after her husband, a
pilot, had been killed in Vietnam. One of the first televised
interracial kisses occurred in 1968, on ``Star Trek,'' when Captain
Kirk embraced Lieutenant Uhura.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1970 the black comedian Flip Wilson started a successful
variety show.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s were a time of enormous ferment, with a number of shows
that had prominent black characters, including ``All in the
Family'' beginning in 1971, ``Sanford and Son'' in 1972 and ``The
Jeffersons'' (which had prime time's first interracial couple, the
Willises) in 1975. ``Roots,'' the powerful mini-series about
slavery, was broadcast in January 1977, with 130 million people
watching at least some portion.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1984, ``The Cosby Show'' had its premiere in what
became in many ways the high-water mark for broad acceptance of
shows with predominantly black casts or themes. For many weeks
during its eight-year run, it was the most heavily viewed show in
the country.

<P>
   DENVER _ From her fifth-floor apartment in a freshly converted
flour mill, Dana Crawford surveyed the abandoned railroad yards at
the core of downtown Denver and envisioned lofts and more lofts.
</P>
<P>
   As carpenters built 350 apartments and bulldozers opened utility
trenches for 3,500 more, Ms. Crawford, a developer, waved to a
cluster of vacant red-brick warehouses near the freight tracks and
predicted, ``All these warehouse buildings will be turned into
lofts.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a one-mile radius of Union Station, Denver's beaux arts
historic core, the city is halfway through a decade-long downtown
investment of $1 billion in three sport stadiums, an aquarium and
urban shopping complexes.
</P>
<P>
   Following retail and entertainment, downtown is now embarking on
an additional $1 billion in residential construction. A total of
1,334 apartments are now being built or converted downtown, more
than the total of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's move toward downtown living is part of a national
trend, according to a new study of 24 large American cities by the
Brookings Institution and the Fannie Mae Foundation research
groups. In a reversal of a trend that started after World War II,
in which inner cities lost population, each city forecast growth in
the number of people living downtown.
</P>
<P>
   By 2010, the study reported, downtown populations are expected
to quadruple in Houston, to 9,500 people, to more than triple in
Cleveland, to 21,000, and to nearly triple in Denver, to 9,250.
Growth is also expected in bigger cities, with Chicago's downtown
population forecast to increase by a third, to 152,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the migration downtown is especially striking in Denver, a
sprawling city of houses and low-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denver fits the pattern of a Western automobile city, so for a
Sun Belt city, what is happening here is very inspiring,'' said
Brad Segal, an urban consultant who is on the board of the
International Downtown Association, an organization of city
planners specializing in downtowns. Noting that delegations from
cities as diverse as Albuquerque, N.M., and Baltimore have recently
toured downtown Denver to get ideas, Segal added, ``Most of the
cities I work in want to be like Denver.''
</P>
<P>
   Planners caution that the move downtown, here and elsewhere, is
a minitrend in the face of continuing suburban expansion. Indeed,
while the city of Denver's population grew by 2 percent, or 12,000
people, since 1980, to about 500,000 people, its suburbs grew by a
third in the same time, adding 505,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But looking ahead, Segal and other urbanists believe that
demographics and accumulated wealth are pointing to radical
transformations in American downtowns in the coming decades.
Virtually all the people moving into downtown Denver do not have
children living at home. They are singles, childless couples or
older people, the ``empty nesters'' whose children have left home
for college and careers.
</P>
<P>
   By 2010, 72 percent of American households will not have
children at home, said Dao Nguyen, a research analyst who helped
prepare the Brookings study. He added, ``That could be a boon for
cities.''
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the fastest-growing population segment in coming
years is forecast to be households of people 54 years old and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomers' watermelon is going through the demographic
snake,'' Segal said, ``but there is also this watermelon of
wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the continuing transfer of wealth from the World
War II generation to the baby boomers, a new change in tax is
expected to help ``empty nesters'' cash out of the suburbs. Last
year, a change in federal tax laws raised to $500,000 from $125,000
the portion of earnings from the sale of a primary residence that
is free of a capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``An older couple can put half the money in a downtown
apartment, and save the rest for travel or a second residence,''
said Larry Grace, regional vice president of Trillium Corp., a
major downtown developer here.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on this phenomenon, developers for Trillium plan to
break ground next year for 700 apartments, the first of as many as
4,000 that are to be built over the next decade on 50 acres behind
Union Station.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment demand is there. A recent survey of a sample of
the 110,000 people who work in downtown Denver found that 60
percent of those surveyed were interested in living downtown.
Waiting lists immediately form when renovation projects are
announced under a city program to provide downtown apartments at
rents affordable for working-class and middle-class people.
</P>
<P>
   On the free market, prices have soared. In one decade, what was
once known as Lower Downtown has been transformed from skid row to
a neighborhood called LoDo that is Denver's second-most-expensive
housing market, after Cherry Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get $3,000-a-month rent,'' Mike McPhee said of
renting his 1,900-square-foot LoDo apartment earlier this year when
he moved to a smaller place. ``The real estate agent brought in
five different guys, none of whom had any trouble with that kind of
rent.''
</P>
<P>
   McPhee's price was $19 a square foot a year. In 1987, John
Hickenlooper, a downtown pioneer, rented commercial space in an
adjacent building for $1 a square foot a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales prices for finished LoDo lofts have jumped from $82 a
square foot in 1990, when Mrs. Crawford did the first loft
renovation here, to $300 a square foot on some of the higher-priced
lofts.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the neighborhood's cachet, the new residents
include Leo Kiely, president of Coors Brewing Co., and David
Bailey, president of Norwest Bank of Colorado. Frederick Mayer, who
made his fortune in oil and gas in the early 1980s, just completed
building a multimillion-dollar town house in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone can live anywhere they want, and they choose to
live in Lower Downtown, it's a statement about how the city is
changing,'' said Jim Olson, a Seattle architect and the designer of
Mayers town house.
</P>
<P>
   LoDo's runaway appeal comes from a constellation of factors:
declining urban crime, rising congestion of suburbs, a powerful
regional economy and a host of entertainment venues within walking
distance, including dozens of new restaurants, a 9,300-seat theater
complex, a new baseball stadium for the Colorado Rockies, a new
football stadium for the Denver Broncos and a basketball and hockey
stadium for the Nuggets and the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Crime, long a barrier to moves by older people into city
centers, has dropped in Denver, as in much of the nation. Here it
declined 25 percent in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the safest police districts in Denver,'' said
Peggy Houser, who was out on a recent evening with her husband,
John, a retired businessman, to watch the lighting of Union Station
for Christmas. ``It is a real neighborhood. We see a lot of people
on the street we know.''

   As highway commuting distances lengthen, some Denverites dream
of the walkable city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got rid of one car,'' said Larry Kravetz, the owner of
a small securities firm, who now walks from his new loft to his
office, five blocks away. ``We feel like we are on vacation the
whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kravetz who moved his family to LoDo this summer from a southern
Denver suburb, sounded a note increasingly heard here, describing
the suburbs as ``sterile.''
</P>
<P>
   Six blocks from his loft, Joyce Meskis, owner of the Tattered
Cover bookstore, agreed. ``A city's soul activities,'' she said,
``the art center, the theaters, the museums, the main library _ all
of that usually centers around the urban core.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a LoDo resident could choose one recent week from
among the following cultural activities, all within walking
distance: book signings by three authors at the Tattered Cover, a
performance of the musical ``Rent'' by a touring cast at the Denver
Center for the Performing Arts, a performance of ``The Nutcracker''
by the Colorado Ballet and ``600 Years of British Painting,'' a new
exhibit at the Denver Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pavilions, a $107 million urban shopping and
entertainment complex, opened on the 16th Street pedestrian mall
downtown. Covering two blocks, it offers 40 shops, 15 movie screens
and dining at the Hard Rock Cafe and Wolfgang Puck.
</P>
<P>
   Redolent with history, this neighborhood of three- and
four-story red-brick buildings was built on the site of Denver's
first gold rush settlement, 140 years ago. LoDo's transformation
has been helped by Colorado's economic boom. Through August, the
state ranked third in the nation, after Nevada and Arizona, in the
number of residential housing permits issued in proportion to
population.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled in part by high-technology expansion, the office vacancy
rate in downtown Denver has plummeted to 7.5 percent today from 30
percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   While metropolitan Denver's unemployment rate has dropped to 2.8
percent, not all boats have been raised. With gentrification, the
adult homeless population in LoDo has largely shifted a few blocks
to the north, where the police generally do not bother people
drinking on stoops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people increasingly know that they are not welcome
downtown if they are not carrying a Gap shopping bag,'' said David
DeForest-Stalls, director of the Spot, a center for street youths
and runaways. ``If they want to keep from being frisked every 10 to
15 minutes, they need to stay out of downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that he was offering an alcohol and drug-free center for
young people, DeForest-Stalls criticized the heavy concentration of
bars in LoDo, adding, ``It's ironic to see Denver's pride in
creating an alcohol mecca.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Noel, a Colorado historian, sees downtown Denver
returning to its historic roots, as a noisy, sometimes raucous,
people-filled urban village.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the eve of Prohibition, Larimer Street had 60 saloons,''
said Noel, a professor who has studied Denver's entertainment
habits, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that tourists now come from Wyoming and Kansas to visit
LoDo, he added, ``It's going back to the old idea of Denver as the
drinking capital for the hinterland.''

 &HT;    Those rechargeable batteries eventually pose a disposal problem
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Look closely at the owner's manual that came with that
new rechargeable Christmas gizmo _ cell phone, electric razor,
cordless drill, whatever _ and you'll see an unobtrusive, but firm
warning: The battery inside is an environmental hazard, and it must
never be thrown in the trash, even after it wears out.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, probably, never notice the warning in the first
place. Those who do, depending on how the manual reads, may be left
wondering: How do you get rid of the things? And what's the hazard,
anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The answers, briefly: See the last paragraph in this story to
find out where to toss the batteries. And the hazard is that
chemicals from old batteries can leach from landfills, polluting
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, says Stanley Carpenter, a public policy professor
at Georgia Tech, companies that sell such rechargeable gadgets
aren't doing a good job of letting people know these facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you read in the manuals that you need to dispose of
these batteries, nobody knows what that means, where to take it,
what to do,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics seem to bear him out. About 335 million
rechargeables are purchased annually, but only 23 percent are
disposed of properly, the Environmental Protection Agency
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter tried to get information on batteries from a
manufacturer recently, to no avail. ``It's upsetting,'' he says.
``I was literally screaming into the phone, because all I got was
menus with options, and nothing worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers and instruction manuals do offer ways to dispose
of the batteries. Kristie Madara, a spokeswoman for Atlanta-based
BellSouth Cellular, says the company tells customers to return
batteries to stores, where they'll be picked up for recycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These batteries are not going to explode or catch on fire,''
she says. ``But if you get enough in a landfill, it's bad from an
environmental standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, most people don't read owner's manuals, says Julie
Vandersea of the Gainesville, Fla.-based Rechargeable Battery
Recycle Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The RBRC has launched a drive to make the public more aware of
the issue. And it's encouraging retailers to make it clearer that
consumers shouldn't just chuck the batteries into the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   To find out where to drop off old batteries, call
</P>
<P>
   1-800-822-8837, or go to http://www.rbrc.com/cgi-local/zip.pl on
the Internet.

MUSEUM DEFENDS ARTIFACT ACQUISITION PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and e coding; Vermeule is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Museum of Fine Arts, responding to a Boston Globe
report that it has acquired scores of classical antiquities in
recent years that may have been plundered from grave sites, Monday
said it exercises ``appropriate diligence'' when it acquires
artworks.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornelius C. Vermeule III, the retired curator who oversaw
most of the acquisitions, said Monday that he does not know whether
some of the objects might have been freshly looted from grave sites
when the museum acquired them.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, a former MFA director said the museum seldom
raised questions about the origin of antiquities it acquired. And
two antiquities dealers who have sold objects to the museum said
they cannot always say that objects they sell have not been
recently looted.
</P>
<P>
   With assistance from 11 archeologists, the Globe studied 71
classical artifacts the museum acquired, by donation or purchase,
between mid-1984 and mid-1987. Only 10 had a history of any prior
owner. The remaining 61 had no history at all, strong
circumstantial evidence, the scholars said, that they had recently
been looted by grave robbers, mostly in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-paragraph statement, the MFA said that when it
considers acquiring objects for its collection, the artifacts are
reviewed ``to ensure that their addition to the Museum's collection
is both legal and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brief statement, the MFA chose not to take issue with
what the Globe reported. Asked about that late Monday, Dawn
Griffin, the MFA spokeswoman, said the museum does not agree that
it acquired the artifacts without exercising due diligence.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule, the MFA's classical curator for four decades until his
retirement in 1996, did not return telephone calls before the Globe
report. But in a brief telephone interview Monday, Vermeule said
the MFA ``tried to do due diligence'' before acquiring artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it was possible that some of the 61 undocumented
artifacts might have been freshly looted, Vermeule replied, ``I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule took issue with MFA director Malcolm Rogers for
consistently refusing to discuss the acquisitions, even though his
predecessor, Alan Shestack, acknowledged in an interview last week
that the MFA had been less than rigorous in ensuring that artifacts
it acquired were not recently plundered. Shestack was director from
1987 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum and Malcolm Rogers should talk about these things.
Otherwise it will look like we've been bounding through the
marketplace picking up everything in sight,'' Vermeule said.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported that the museum acquired the undocumented
objects after it committed itself in 1983 to observe international
standards designed to slow the plunder of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Bondioli Osio, the president of Italy's Interministerial
Commission for the Recovery of Art, expressed frustration Monday at
cases like that involving the MFA, saying his government cannot
mount a successful legal claim without having evidence of where and
when an artifact was looted.
</P>
<P>
   As one way to minimize the demand for looted artifacts, Italy
recently began making year-long loans to US museums of classical
antiquities that are much more important and valuable than most
museums could afford to purchase, according to Bondioli Osio.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA now faces a likely lawsuit from the government of
Guatemala, seeking the return of a collection of pre-Columbian
artifacts the MFA acquired in 1988. The museum's lawyer has
acknowledged that he knew the objects were illegally exported from
Guatemala. But the MFA has insisted that they were legally imported
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe also reported that Turkey's government is pressing for
the return of the top half of a ``Weary Herakles'' statue whose
bottom half is in a Turkish museum in Antalya.
</P>
<P>
   Murray C. McClellan, a Boston University classical archeologist,
said he views the fact that the MFA did not take issue with the
Globe's story as an indication that the museum might take greater
precautions in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll see whether they really do exercise due diligence,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said the potential lawsuits, by Turkey and Guatemala,
would amount to a tragic waste of resources. But given the museum's
statement, he said, ``I would be shocked if they would make a major
blunder, like Guatemala or the Herakles, again.''

 &HT;    JOURNAL: MISSILE COMPONENTS AND IRAQI RESILIENCE LEGACIES OF
TRIP TO IRAQ

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD _ I'll be coming home from Iraq with a charred and
twisted piece of U.S. federal property.
</P>
<P>
   It's a flat, grooved ring about three inches across. I found it
in a deep muddy crater where a cruise missile had landed a couple
hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   This scrap is just a minuscule portion of the more than 400
missiles that slammed into this country over four days this month.
Maybe it's the part I paid for with my tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It will remind me of how strange it feels to stand in the rubble
of someone's house, or by somebody's grimy hospital bed, and ask
him what he thinks about the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, they say that they were in bed or walking down the
street when the missile hit. They say that America is evil and will
some day be vanquished. What else can they say?
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot American journalists here and Iraqis generally
feel that they can talk to the American people through us.
</P>
<P>
   Only two people refused to talk to me. One eventually opened up
and we shook hands. The other was headed to pray at a mosque. He
warned his fellow worshipers that we were trying to figure out
their prayer time so we could bomb them. His friends apologized to
us for his rudeness.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are a lot of infuriating things about working in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   People know the government line and generally toe it
vociferously. Just in case they might not, the Ministry of Culture
and Information tries to assign ``guides'' to each of us. You can
get away from them, but most of our drivers are also part of the
network and, if they are not, you could get them in trouble by
ordering them any place too risky.
</P>
<P>
   Our hotel, the Al Rasheed, is watched at all hours by men in
blazers who stand in the lobby and parking lot. During the
bombings, I twice needed special permission before they would open
the gates and let me leave the building.
</P>
<P>
   And, the government of Iraq has not always been a gracious host.
Remember the ``human shields'' of the Gulf War?
</P>
<P>
   But, if America were attacked, would we let a bunch of people
from the attacking country, many of them with satellite telephones
that can call home easily, wander around and assess the damage to
targets?
</P>
<P>
   And, I wonder how we would treat our enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Here, a family invited me to dinner even as so-called ``smart''
bombs rumbled in the distance. They offered to let me sleep there
if my hotel lost power.
</P>
<P>
   A bride and groom took time to tell a group of us why they would
get married amid all of this. Then, they invited us to the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   I made the 11-hour car trip from Amman, Jordan to Baghdad with a
couple of other reporters and a wealthy Iraqi businessman. He
offered his contacts and advice to smooth our border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Noticing that we had brought three cases of Pepsi Cola, known to
be popular with Iraqi border authorities, he gave us an approving
fatherly grin, ``Ahh, Pepsi. That is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road, he asked us why Americans were attacking Iraq and
surmised for himself that they want to control the Persian Gulf. As
for Saddam Hussein, Iraqis could not oust him even if they wanted
to, he said. And, ``they don't want to,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He had decided to return to his family because, he explained,
Iraqis would rather die together than separately.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, we were crossing the barren Iraqi desert, lined
with patches of short brush and the occasional large picture of
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jordanian driver of our big GMC slapped a cassette into
the tape deck, pop singer Meredith Brooks opened our travels in
beleaguered Iraq with the line, ``I hate the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   We did not know that the casualties would be relatively low and
that these cruise missiles could demolish one building while barely
scarring the one next door.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I never felt in danger during the attacks. Watching the
explosions from my hotel window or with crowds on the sidewalk,
they always seemed isolated, even when shock waves blew my hair
back.
</P>
<P>
   I just tried to follow the Iraqis' lead. In good times, they
live under a severely restrictive regime and crippling economic
sanctions. In the bad times, they have all that and missile
attacks, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, in helplessness or resilience, they go on buying their ice
cream, playing billiards, getting married and treating their guests
well.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Iraqis were busy buying Christmas trees. I have
this missile part I found. After all, it brought me here. Maybe it
will make me think about the Iraqis even after I leave them behind
in the desert.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American fighter jets patrolling northern Iraq
attacked an Iraqi anti-aircraft missile battery on Monday after
coming under fire themselves, the Clinton administration said
today.
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish appeared to mark an attempt by Iraq to provoke a
new confrontation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq announced that it had repulsed an attack and ``probably
shot down'' an enemy aircraft. But the Pentagon dismissed the
claims, saying that all 27 American and British aircraft operating
in or near northern Iraq on Monday had returned safely to their
base in Incirlik, Turkey, after firing in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred just two days after Iraq declared it would
fire on any aircraft flying in the ``no flight'' zones that the
United States and its allies created over northern and southern
Iraq after the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991. The aim was to
protect minority groups then under attack by forces loyal to
President Saddam Hussein. These patrols have been routinely flown
since then.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Iraqi anti-aircraft artillery fired ineffectually
near two British fighter-bombers flying in the southern zone, but
on Monday the Iraqi forces fired relatively sophisticated
surface-to-air missiles that can threaten even the best American
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and Pentagon officials said they believed Saddam
was testing American and British resolve after four nights of air
and missile strikes against military and industrial targets across
Iraq, which ended on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being cowed by the attacks, Iraq has responded with
intensifying belligerence. It has threatened to cut off all
cooperation with the United Nations and, on several occasions in
the last nine days, has flown its warplanes into the ``no flight''
zones, apparently hoping to draw American jets into an attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has drawn up contingency plans for renewed strikes,
and many officials in Washington say they believe a renewed
military confrontation is virtually inevitable in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton justified Monday's strike as self-defense and
vowed that American and allied jets would continue to enforce the
``no flight'' zones. But he stopped short of threatening Iraq with
larger strikes if it continued to threaten American or British
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``They attacked because they were attacked, and they did the
appropriate thing,'' Clinton said of the pilots during remarks at
the Old Executive Office Building. ``We will continue to enforce
the `no fly' zones.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain and France created the ``no flight''
zone in northern Iraq in 1991 to protect the Kurdish minority that
has long suffered under Baghdad's rule. Iraqi aircraft are barred
from flying in the zone, which covers the area north of the 36th
parallel.
</P>
<P>
   The ``no flight'' zone over southern Iraq was created a year
later to protect Shiite Muslims who have been waging a low-level
insurgency against Saddam. In 1996, the southern zone was extended
from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd parallel, just south of Baghdad.
In addition to aircraft, the southern zone also prohibits the
movement of tanks and other armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's skirmish occurred just after 1 p.m. in Iraq, or 5 a.m.
ET, when Iraqi forces fired at least three surface-to-air missiles,
or SAMs, at F-15 and F-16 fighter jets flying near the city of
Mosul, about 220 miles north of Baghdad, according to Pentagon
officials.
</P>
<P>
   At least one F-16 responded immediately with radar-seeking
missiles, meant to force the missile battery to turn off its radar,
sending the SAMs harmlessly off course. Three F-15's then
counterattacked a few minutes later with six 500-pound,
laser-guided bombs, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pentagon has not yet fully assessed the damage, the
attack appeared to have destroyed the missile battery, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, the Iraqi government denounced the strikes as an
``aggressive and vicious'' act, saying the Americans had attacked
first and been driven off. A statement released through the
official Iraqi news agency said four soldiers had been killed and
seven wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since September 1996 that Iraq had fired
at allied aircraft patrolling the ``no flight'' zone over northern
Iraq, though there have been several occasions in the north and
south when Iraqi air defenses aimed radar beams at them. On June
30, an American F-16 fired a missile at a battery that had aimed
radar at four British jets patrolling southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pentagon's view, the use of surface-to-air missiles
represented a serious escalation of the on-again-off-again
hostilities between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has several Soviet-era missiles, including the SA-3, the
type that shot down the U-2 flown by Francis Gary Powers over the
Soviet Union in 1960. Officials said the missiles fired on Monday
appeared to be SA-3s.
</P>
<P>
   During more than 400 cruise missile strikes and 250 combat
sorties over four nights this month, Iraq did not fire its SAM
missiles, the Pentagon said, evidently fearing retaliation by
American and British weapons able to hone in on the batteries'
radar signals.
</P>
<P>
   During those strikes, the Americans and British repeatedly
targeted SAM sites, but with mixed success, since the batteries are
mobile and can be hard to spot. According to the Pentagon's last
public assessment of damage, only half of 16 SAM sites attacked
were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said it was impossible to divine
Saddam's motives for attacking on Monday, but they speculated that
he might be hoping to increase international sympathy and erode
support for sanctions against Iraq by enduring additional attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought early on that he wanted us to attack him again,''
one official said. ``There's a school of thought that says Saddam
believes that the more we take military action against him, the
more the world tires of sanctions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States and its allies cited U.N. resolutions adopted
in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War to justify enforcing the
``no flight'' zones, but the Security Council itself has never
explicitly authorized them.
</P>
<P>
   France stopped patrolling the northern zone in 1996 and refused
to recognize the extension of the southern zone to the 33rd
parallel, though its Mirage jets still support the operations in
the zone below the 32nd parallel.
</P>
<P>
   The zones are by no means sanctuaries. In August 1996, Saddam's
ground forces rolled into the northern enclave to intervene in a
civil war between Kurdish factions, and the Clinton administration
could do little expect fire four dozen cruise missiles against
air-defense targets in the south.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton defended them on Monday. ``The `no fly' zones have
been and will remain an important part of our containment policy,''
he said. ``Because we effectively control the skies over much of
Iraq, Saddam has been unable to use air power to repress his own
people or to lash out again at his neighbors.''

FASHION NOTES AND NEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARYLOU LUTHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; New Koos Boutique Planned &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Koos van den Akker says his fashion business has been
resuscitated and he will be able to open a new Madison Avenue
boutique, thanks to his earnings from QVC, the television shopping
channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The QVC tie-in also saved me from poverty,'' said van den
Akker, the Dutch-born designer whose artistic patchwork jackets and
coats are worn by clients like Ellen Burstyn, Sherry Bronfman and
Julie Belafonte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years ago,'' he said, ``my partner died. I had tax
problems. I lost the boutique I'd had for 20 years at 68th and
Madison because the building was sold and I couldn't afford the new
owners' rent. I couldn't even afford the rent on my apartment. I
ate pizza for a year. I was literally on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Van den Akker credits Veronica Vickers for his re-entry into the
fashion world he entered so propitiously in 1963 as a Christian
Dior apprentice in Paris. First his money manager, now his partner,
Ms. Vickers helped him open a store at 215 West 10th St., near
Bleecker Street, three and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, along came QVC with a proposition to create a
secondary line, Koos, translating his costly fabric collages into
printed fabrics, thereby transforming a $1,400 jacket into an
$87.50 made-in-China copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first TV collection appeared on Halloween,'' he said, ``and
I had to sell $500,000 worth in an hour in order to fulfill their
projections. The 10 styles sold out in 27 minutes, so they want me
back in April.''
</P>
<P>
   Van den Akker said the less expensive designs have not
jeopardized his regular collection. He said that customers who pay
$900 to $1,400 for jackets and up to $2,500 for coats do not object
to seeing copies. ``If they can buy one of my scarfs on QVC for $30
and it's $235 in my store, they buy both,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No Squinting for Barbie Fans &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The marketers at Mattel have a new idea: They are offering
Barbie sunglasses by Alain Mikli _ not for Barbie, whose 40th
birthday will be celebrated March 9, but for all the adults who
have ever owned one of the more than a billion Barbie dolls sold
since 1959. At least that's the goal of Adrienne Fontanella,
Mattel's general manager of worldwide licensing, who sees the new
glasses as ``capturing the essence of Barbie: chic, glamorous and
playful.''
</P>
<P>
   That means glasses with Barbie elements like pink lenses and
frames with side pieces modeled after Barbie's legs. The
sunglasses, at $165, will be at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus
and Barneys New York in time for the birthday hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In Love With Pretty &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley, designers and owners of Tuleh,
believe in the selling power of pretty. They say they have doubled
their business since March and that they owe it all to clothes that
are ``heartbreakingly romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women from Boston to Beverly Hills are responding to things
that make them look pretty,'' said Patner, who likens the clothes
(suits at $1,800, evening dresses to $3,000) to wearable flowers.
Many Tuleh florals are in motifs reprinted by Ascher in London from
original screens once used in haute couture. Best sellers include a
rose chiffon printed with green roses, a pink gardenia and a bird
print.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've struck a chord with many women,'' Patner said, citing
customers as diverse as those who patronize Bergdorf Goodman and
Liberty of London; the singers Monica and Deborah Cox, who wore the
clothes in a Vibe magazine spread; Cameron Diaz, who wore them in
Entertainment Weekly, and Marisa Tomei, ``who wears our clothes all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Patner, a former magazine stylist and women's fashion director
at Bergdorf Goodman, and Bradley, a former freelance designer for
Calvin Klein and Anne Klein, say their latest look at pretty will
be seen at the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 24. On whom? ``We're not
supposed to reveal that,'' Patner said.

REMAINING VIGILANT IN AN ONSLAUGHT OF TOXIC THREATS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Ky., Tenn.)   (jw) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Saturday night, the Glass House dance club in
nearby Pomona was packed with 800 people enjoying the holidays when
the local police, federal agents and members of a Los Angeles
County hazardous materials team walked in and stopped the music.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost midnight and for the next four hours no one was
allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes earlier someone had called 911 and reported what
has suddenly become a common threat across the Los Angeles area in
the holiday season: The caller said the lethal bacteria anthrax had
been released in the club.
</P>
<P>
   But like the other half-dozen anthrax threats made this month by
mail and telephone, the report at the Glass House was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems to be the wacko's flavor of the month,'' said
FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi. ``It used to be you called in a bomb
threat. Everybody gets freaked. You shut down the operation. The
perp got his kick. This is just the 1998 version.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, nearly 3,000 people were evacuated and
detained for hours after anthrax threats were received at
courthouses, schools, stores and, most recently, the Glass House.
Colorado, Kentucky and Tennessee have also been subject to anthrax
threats in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Los Angeles authorities are reassessing how they handle
such calls, searching for the best balance between protecting the
public and not wasting time and money on hoaxes. There is talk of
scaling back the response the next time someone calls in and
mumbles he or she has released anthrax into the air. They are quick
to add that each situation will have to be evaluated and treated
individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to fine-tune our response,'' said Dr. Laurene
Mascola, chief of the acute communicable disease control unit of
the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. ``We're
trying to treat it like any other hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   Mascola said the authorities may stop their practice of
detaining people for hours while they search a threatened building
and instead send people home if there is no clear evidence of
danger. At the night club, the authorities took the names and
telephone numbers of all the patrons and then handed out pamphlets
on anthrax and the proper way to decontaminate at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That adds to people's anxieties and it's positive feedback for
the people who are doing the hoax,'' she said. Anthrax is not easy
to spread or catch and it is not contagious from person to person.
If it were released there would be plenty of time to administer
medical treatment to anyone infected.
</P>
<P>
   Mascola said she and her staff have had to spend considerable
time answering questions about anthrax instead of concentrating on
less sensational and every day problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I sleep with my wife?'' a man asked her after being
detained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I give it to my horse?'' someone else asked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, finding the right balance between shrugging off a prank
caller and responding to a possible emergency is not always easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't afford to ignore one,'' said Robert Blitzer, who
recently left the FBI after directing its section on domestic
terrorism. ``You must attend to each and every one of them even
though you know that most will turn out to be hoaxes. Because the
one time you don't, it might be wrong, and there's no margin for
error.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the authorities say they believe that the Los Angeles
area threats are not related and appear to be the work of a litter
of individual copy cats.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Ruda, a hazardous waste expert with the Los Angeles City
Fire Department, speculated that anthrax may have been chosen for
the hoaxes because talk of chemical warfare has been in the news
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The first threat came in a letter to a woman, apparently in a
domestic dispute, Ruda said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For thirty five cents, the price of a phone call, they're
tying up all this manpower,'' said a disgusted Jim Nishida, a
supervisor in the Los Angeles County Fire Department's hazardous
material division. ``We can't be doing this continuously.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 2:30 p.m. Dec. 18, a call was received at the clerk's
office in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Woodland Hills. The caller
said ``there may be anthrax in our air conditioning system''
recalled Dolores Molina, a court manager.
</P>
<P>
   The call was transferred to the U.S. Marshal's Service, which
decided to evacuate the 90 people in the building, including court
staff, janitorial workers, probation department workers and members
of the public.
</P>
<P>
   They proceeded calmly to a parking lot, which was roped off with
yellow caution tape.
</P>
<P>
   No one was allowed to leave until about 10:30 p.m., she said,
while a hazardous materials team took sample of the air in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   As the team worked inside, Ms. Molina and her co-workers were
given blankets, pizza and donuts and a portable toilet was brought
in.
</P>
<P>
   The week before, an old-fashioned bomb threat was phoned in and
Ms. Molina said the workers viewed the anthrax incident as more of
a hassle than a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the employees,'' she said, ``were saying they were
disgusted they had to go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, nearly 2,000 people were evacuated from the
Superior and Municipal Court buildings in Van Nuys after someone
called 911 shortly after 11 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   They were detained until about 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to always treat a threat as real,'' said Mark
Whaling, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
``Monday morning quarterbacking will eat us alive if we make a
mistake.''

WHERE FOOTLIGHTS ILLUMINATE WOMEN'S WORK
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yes, there are exceptions. ``Art,'' on Broadway, was
written by a woman. ``Wit,'' off-off-Broadway, was written by a
woman, as was ``Stop Kiss,'' which recently opened to enthusiastic
reviews at the Joseph Papp Public Theater.
</P>
<P>
   And, last season, two female directors were honored with Tony
awards _ Julie Taymor for ``The Lion King'' and Garry Hynes for
``The Beauty Queen of Leenane.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of Women's Project and Productions, a nonprofit
theater dedicated to presenting plays by women, there is still a
long way to go before female playwrights and directors reach parity
with men in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   It is with this sense of inequity that Julia Miles founded the
Women's Project 20 years ago. This fall, the project acquired a
199-seat off-Broadway playhouse, Theater Four on West 55th Street,
and produced its first play of the season there, ``The Knee Desires
the Dirt'' by Julie Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very, very much looking for a home,'' Ms. Miles said.
</P>
<P>
   And this season the playwright Wendy Wasserstein joined the
board of the Women's Project because, she said, there was still a
need for a female-centered theater. ``If there was a season without
women's plays, I don't know how many producers and critics would
say, `Where were the women?''' Ms. Wasserstein said. ``Julia Miles
will say that, and that's still important. Someone's got to look at
a picture and say, `Why aren't there women in this picture?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miles has been asking that question since she started the
Women's Project as an offshoot of the American Place Theater. ``I
looked at our roster and, of about 72 plays that we had done, only
about eight were written by women,'' Ms. Miles recalled. ``I was
shocked at this, that the thing I cared most about _ theater _ was
really lacking in female voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Since she began leading her theater group, Ms. Miles said, the
situation has improved; 26 percent of the plays staged today are
now written by women, up from 7 percent, she reported, and 20
percent are directed by women, up from 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Project, which became independent in 1987, has more
than 450 members, including Anne Bogart, Olympia Dukakis, Maria
Irene Fornes, Joyce Carol Oates, Anna Deveare Smith and Paula
Vogel.
</P>
<P>
   Among its better-known productions are ``A ... My Name Is
Alice,'' directed by Joan Micklin Silver and Julianne Boyd; a
musical version of Willa Cather's ``O Pioneers!'' by Darrah Cloud
and Kim Sherman, and ``Abingdon Square'' by Ms. Fornes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though an increasing number of women are artistic directors
of institutional theaters, Ms. Wasserstein said, they do not seem
to feel a sense of mission about promoting the work of female
playwrights. ``You don't have people who are committed to saying,
`I will do more plays by women,''' Ms. Wasserstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.5 million purchase of the Women's Project's new theater,
a former dye works from the 1800s that had been used as theater
space for various productions, was made possible with a $1 million
bank loan; a $500,000 gift from Sallie Bingham, a board member, and
another $500,000 from the board, foundations and the New York City
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that women have a voice and it can be very, very
different when they look at something,'' said Pat Schoenfeld, a
former chairwoman of the project's board who continues to be an
active member. ``And they need to be encouraged. They need to feel
there is a place where they can feel comfortable developing their
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to producing three plays a season, the Women's
Project runs a playwrights' lab in which writers read and critique
one another's work, and a forum to develop directing skills. The
project, which has an annual budget of $800,000 and a full-time
staff of six, also conducts symposiums and after-play discussions.
``To put on a play, you need a whole community of people,'' Ms.
Miles said.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Project's season continues with ``The Chemistry of
Change,'' by Marlane Meyer, which begins performances Feb. 10, and
``The Exact Center of the Universe,'' by Joan Vail Thorne, which
starts March 23.

COMMENTARY: HENRY HYDE'S BOSNIA INQUIRY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In 1994, when Bosnia was nearly crushed by the
attacking Serbs, President Clinton decided to make no objection if
Croatia violated a U.N. embargo by letting arms go through to the
Bosnians.
</P>
<P>
   Our ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, was told to say _ if
President Franjo Tudjman asked whether we objected _ that he had
``no instructions'' on the point. Tudjman asked, got the answer and
let the arms through. They made a crucial difference in saving
Sarajevo and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later The Los Angeles Times told the story,
emphasizing that some of the arms had come from Iran. Sen. Bob
Dole, the prospective Republican candidate for president, demanded
an investigation. Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed a special
subcommittee with a $1 million budget. He named as chairman Rep.
Henry Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   There was in fact no mystery to investigate, and no failure.
Galbraith and others involved testified freely about what they had
done _ without regrets, because the policy had been a great
success. Bosnia survived. So did the new Muslim-Croat Federation
brought into being by the United States. The military balance
shifted against the Serbs, making possible the Dayton Accords. They
paved the way for the expulsion of Iranian agents from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry Hyde was determined to find something that could be
called wrongdoing. So the committee pursued, among other things, a
report that Galbraith had dated an American journalist while he and
she were in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Both were single, so the most prurient bluenose could not have
objected. But committee investigators deposed Galbraith's secretary
and a member of his staff to get details of the relationship _
until a lawyer objected.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith was also questioned about how he had been told what to
say to Tudjman. A White House assistant had telephoned, he said,
passing on word from Anthony Lake, the president's national
security adviser, to say that he had ``no instructions.'' The
assistant added that Lake had said it with a smile and a raised
eyebrow, Galbraith testified, saying that he had made a note of
that.
</P>
<P>
   The committee then questioned Lake and his assistant, and they
said they could not remember the smile and raised eyebrow. Hyde and
his committee, implying that Galbraith had made that up, referred
his testimony to the Justice Department for criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Why mention that two-year-old investigation now? Because it
shows how petty, nasty and partisan Henry Hyde was in a situation
where no wrong had been done. His purpose was to find something _
anything _ to discredit the Clinton Administration in an election
year. If individuals were hurt, their reputations damaged for no
reason, so be it. Casual McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   When the House Judiciary Committee started its impeachment
inquiry, the Washington press corps trotted out its usual
adjectives for chairman Hyde: grandfatherly, nonpartisan. In
reality, Hyde performed exactly as he had in 1996: as a relentless
partisan.
</P>
<P>
   When Salon, an Internet magazine, broke the news that Hyde had
had a five-year affair with a married woman starting when he was
41, Republican leaders reacted with outrage, demanding an FBI
investigation of how the truth had been told. They can dish it out,
but they think they should be immune to such attacks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The press made little of Hyde's hypocrisy in that episode. Nor
has it done much with the discovery that Rep. Bob Barr, a leading
advocate of impeachment, and Trent Lott, the Senate majority
leader, spoke to a virulent racist group: something more deplorable
than anything President Clinton has done.
</P>
<P>
   But the public understands. I think that is one large reason why
an overwhelming majority continues to support Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans did not like the vengeful partisan tone of the
impeachment process. They did not like Kenneth Starr's bullying of
Monica Lewinsky and her mother, or his prying into the most private
side of their lives, or his publishing of gratuitous sexual detail.
They understood that breaking down the wall between private and
public life is the hallmark of tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   In all of this the American sense of fair play was offended. And
as Joe McCarthy learned, you offend that at your peril.
</P>

MENTOR GRAPHICS RAISES BID FOR QUICKTURN DESIGN SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mentor Graphics Corp., the maker of software for work stations,
has raised its unsolicited takeover bid for Quickturn Design
Systems to $14 a share in cash, matching the price offered by a
rival, Cadence Design Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If the offer, which is set to expire on Jan. 11, is accepted,
Mentor would seek only 14.9 percent of Quickturn's stock, the
maximum amount it said could be owned without setting off a poison
pill defense. Quickturn said on Monday that its board was studying
the offer and urged shareholders not to act until it had made a
recommendation. Mentor, which made its first hostile offer in
August, is still seeking to negotiate a deal with Quickturn to buy
the rest of the shares for the same cash price.
</P>
<P>
   Quickturn, which is based in San Jose, Calif., and sells
specialized computers that can emulate a new chip before it exists
in silicon, has rebuffed Mentor's advances before. Mentor earlier
this year proposed a friendly transaction, but that deal was
rejected. So on Aug. 12, Mentor offered shareholders $12.125 a
share in cash in an unsolicited bid for Quickturn. The value of the
deal then totaled $209.5 million for the 97 percent of the
company's shares Mentor did not already own. But within two weeks
Quickturn rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The company's president, Keith R. Lobo, said the offer came ``at
a moment of weakness for Quickturn's stock price and a moment of
desperation for Mentor's design-verification strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickturn soon found another partner. On Dec. 8, Cadence Design
Systems agreed to acquire Quickturn in a stock swap valued at $14 a
share, or $253 million. Cadence, also based in San Jose, and
Mentor, based in Wilsonville, Ore., are rivals in the market for
the software used to make computer chips. Mentor responded by suing
Quickturn and its board, saying Quickturn breached its fiduciary
duties by neglecting to wait for a higher offer from Mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor's president and chief executive, Walden C. Rhines, said
on Monday that ``there has not been much cooperation by the
management of Quickturn,'' although the sweetened offer is his
company's first step to completing a merger. Any combination with a
company other than Cadence would be expensive for Quickturn, which
must pay Cadence $17.58 million in breakup fees if that merger is
called off.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters, Mentor and Quickturn have been
locked in a patent litigation battle. Mentor last year acquired a
small French company that offers a product similar to Quickturn's
but cannot market the product in the United States. The
International Trade Commission ruled that Mentor was infringing on
a series of Quickturn patents, and the Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit rejected Mentor's appeal.

ON SIX CAMPUSES, IT'S UNDERGRADS, START YOUR ENGINES
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.C., Va., S.C.)   (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Beneath the Smith Engineering Building at the
University of North Carolina campus here, a dozen gear geeks (and
proud of it) are redefining the term ``student-athlete.'' Their
bodies are sculpted along the lines of chess-club members rather
than the ripped physiques of football players. They are more adept
at handling screwdrivers than basketballs.
</P>
<P>
   But they are pioneers in a new college sport that is just as
important as football and basketball in this part of the country:
auto racing.
</P>
<P>
   Their racing team, the 49ers of the University of North Carolina
at Charlotte, is one of six collegiate teams in the country, all in
the Southeast, and intent on expanding the definition of sport. The
49ers, along with Duke, Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina
State and North Carolina A&AMP;T, have formed the Intercollegiate Auto
Racing Association (ICAR), and are revving their motors for a
second year.
</P>
<P>
   They are student-athletes in the real sense of the word: Their
racing grew out of their education. All are full-time engineering
students. All were attracted to UNC-Charlotte by a special
concentration in motor sports offered as part of the school's
Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering program.
</P>
<P>
   They came to western North Carolina because it is widely
considered the birthplace of the sport. From its beginnings in the
hollows of North Carolina as a cat-and-mouse game between
bootleggers in hot rod Chevys and revenue officers intent on
confiscating their cargo, stock-car racing is now the United
States' fastest-growing sport.
</P>
<P>
   On the NASCAR circuit, attendance has doubled to more than 6
million people a year in the 1990's, and television ratings are
second only to the National Football League. And North
Carolina-Charlotte sits at the sport's epicenter _ nearly three
dozen of the teams on NASCAR's top Winston Cup circuit are within a
30-mile radius.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Nashville is if you're a musician,'' said Jon
McIntire, a freshman from Ottawa, Kan. ``If you want to get into
big-time racing, you come down here.''
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, automobile racing shares the same standing as archery
and rodeo _ which is to say none. It is not one of the
association's 22 sanctioned sports, nor is it subject to NCAA rules
and regulations. It is separate from the athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty obscure as a collegiate sport,'' said NCAA
spokesman Wally Renfro of the racing league. ``But recognition
starts at the institutional level. If you're going to have a sport,
you need enough schools to compete against. So if enough of our
members decided this was a viable thing, there's a possibility it
would be recognized. Right now, it's more of a fringe sport than an
emerging one.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' practice field is an oil-stained garage. Their
equipment? It ranges from a $10 screwdriver to a $20,000
data-acquisition system, a computer that diagnoses everything from
winning aerodynamics to a driver's command of a steering wheel.
Still, these athletes have professional dreams _ of being stock-car
drivers, or engineers or crew chiefs in charge of making
automobiles race faster around asphalt ovals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to take what's in your head, get up underneath the car
and put it to work on the set up,'' said Josh Watkins, a sophomore
who is the crew chief _ like being a captain _ in a down-home
summation of college racing. ``Then, hopefully, get it the around
the track faster than the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether even the best stock-car drivers _ such as the
indisputable king, Richard Petty, or the current sensation, Jeff
Gordon _ are athletes in the truest sense of the word is an ongoing
debate among sports aficionados. The student racers don't care to
participate in that debate. They can laughingly refer to themselves
as ``gear geeks'' or ``motorheads.'' But like other intercollegiate
athletes, they have brought dedication and devotion to their sport.
</P>
<P>
   Most have grown up around race tracks, driving on the Go Kart
circuit or working in garages on cars that race on dirt. They all
still dream of rolling onto Victory Lane, but will settle for
getting there alongside the race car rather than behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``God puts some of us on earth to drive them; the rest of us to
work on them,'' said David Kapp, a 1996 graduate of the program,
who has parlayed his college experience into a job as an engineer
at Hendrick Motorsports, which has 250 employees including the
reigning Winston Cup champion, Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   They race against other colleges on tracks ranging from
one-fifth to three-eighths of a mile at places like nearby Concorde
Motor Speedway or Orange County Speedway in Roxboro, N.C. (By
contrast, the superspeedway in Charlotte is 1.5 miles.)
</P>
<P>
   They drive what are called Legends cars _ five-eighths-scale
models of 1932 to 1934 Fords and Chevys that are equipped with
1200-cubic-centimeter motorcycle engines and run atop hard, wide
tires that prevent them from rolling over. The speeds range from 50
to 80 mph, sometimes increasing to 100 mph on a long straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win a race just because you have a good set of hands
on the wheel,'' said Dr. Bob Johnson, chairman of North
Carolina-Charlotte's Department of Mechanical Engineering Sciences,
who runs the auto racing team. ``You have to know about setting up
a car. It is all about dynamics. This has everything to do with
experiential education.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a very expensive education. The cars _ each team has
one _ cost $13,000, maintaining and rebuilding can cost up to
$20,000 a year.The schools carry insurance coverage for the
students, but it's up to the race teams to transform nasty crashes
on Turn Two into a practicum on making their cars go faster.
</P>
<P>
   Local contracting companies, auto-parts stores, friends and
family are solicited for donations to augment the school's funding.
There are plans to go after national sponsors, but for now the
college league resembles the sport's nascent days when teams relied
on borrowed tools, elbow grease and backyard know-how to get them
around the track.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, crowds at the Saturday morning races have ranged from
several hundred to several thousand. There is a qualifying lap,
three heats to determine the starting order and, finally, the main
event _ three heats of anywhere from 15 to 20 laps of side-by-side
racing.
</P>
<P>
   The student racers know what the crowds come for.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see us wreck and tear up the car,'' said Watkins,
the crew chief who is also one of the 49ers' three drivers. ``We do
tear them up, too. Sometimes, the greatest driving skill isn't
exactly on display.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 49ers' car is currently under complete
reconstruction after a smash-up last month during the fall
exhibition season with Duke. Team members, of course, insist that
the accident was the Blue Devils' fault.
</P>
<P>
   But now they have their work cut out for them if they are to
defend the inaugural Intercollegiate Auto Racing Association
championship, beginning in February. The circuit will expand to six
races and the title race will be run at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
Call it the Rose Bowl of stock-car racing.
</P>
<P>
   But the real checkered flag for the students is keeping their
racing dreams alive. The engineering department here has created an
advisory board of professionals from Hendrick Motorsports, Petty
Enterprises and the other big-time racing teams. There are
internships and part-time jobs available. ``The point is to get
your foot in the door, whether it's sweeping floors or busting
tires,'' says Watkins, who works part time for one of the NASCAR
teams.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, those racing dreams are spoken of with an older
voice and in a startling accent. Johnson neither twangs nor drawls
when he talks about stock-car racing. He is a New Yorker who looks
out the window of his office here and can see a banked,
quarter-mile oval sitting majestically where an old running track
now lies.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that Hollywood has discovered racing, as has
Madison Avenue. Earlier this month, the Smithsonian Institution
recognized the sport's cultural contribution to the nation by
sponsoring a symposium in Washington as part of NASCAR's 50th
anniversary. With an accent closer to New York egg cream than
Southern iced tea, Johnson asked a question certain to prompt
future discussion throughout academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not good hard racing on college campuses?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Why not?

SEAHAWKS FIRE COACH DENNIS ERICKSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ He was the hometown guy, working for local
ownership, a combination Seahawk fans seemed to favor. But Monday,
Dennis Erickson was told to get a new address.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson, 51, was fired as head coach of Seattle's National
Football League team, a day after the Seahawks lost 28-21 to Denver
and finished out of the playoffs for the 10th consecutive season _
the league's longest such streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Everett, Wash., native was hired four years ago because he
seemingly won big wherever he went. He had coached the University
of Miami to two national championships. He was let go because he
didn't win enough in four seasons in the NFL. His Seahawk teams
finished 8-8, 7-9, 8-8 and 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of stuck at this 8-8 hurdle,'' Seahawks president
Bob Whitsitt said.
</P>
<P>
   While there had been month-long speculation suggesting that
Erickson would lose his job, Whitsitt said the decision regarding a
coaching change was his alone and was made Sunday night, with input
from owner Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt said Erickson's firing was ``based on a three-year
evaluation,'' a time period that covers Allen's two-year ownership
and negotiation to purchase the team.
</P>
<P>
   The club executive declined to give specifics over the move,
though he seemed to agree there was a lack of quality Seahawk
victories during the Erickson regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to see continual improvement,'' Whitsitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson was informed of the decision by Whitsitt in a
mid-morning meeting at the team's headquarters. The silver-haired
coach then met with his assistant coaches, spoke with a few players
and somberly attended a press conference just before 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Seattle,'' Erickson said. ``I came here for a reason.
I came to get this thing turned around. And to a point, we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson said he wants to coach again. He planned to take a few
days off at his Redmond home before starting a job search.

6 TEAMS TO OPEN SEASON WITH PAYROLLS NEAR $80 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles began last season with a major league
record payroll that was a shade under $70 million and ended it with
a payroll of $72 million. Six teams are expected to open the 1999
season with payrolls that eclipse those totals.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, Yankees, Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, Los
Angeles Dodgers and Texas Rangers have already surpassed $60
million and are on their way to payrolls starting at close to $75
million and ranging close to the mid-$80 millions.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and the Yankees, who were second to the Orioles this
year with season-ending $65.8 million payrolls, are expected to be
1-2 in the season-opening salary standings. Of the six teams beyond
$60 million, they face the toughest hit in salary arbitration, a
procedure that will be played out over the next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at a payroll of about $82 million,'' Kevin
Malone, the Dodgers' general manager, said by telephone from Los
Angeles Monday. He said the Fox ownership had not placed a ceiling
on his payroll, but he added, ``I'm trying to be as cost efficient
as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner does not place artificial limits on his
player budget either, though he seems to be more cost-conscious
than in his earlier years as the Yankees' principal owner. The
Yankees should wind up with a payroll of about $81 million.
</P>
<P>
   Based on incomplete returns _ payrolls are incomplete because
not all players have signed for 1999 _ the Orioles are at $78
million for 21 players, the Braves $71 million for 20, the Indians
$69.6 million for 20, the Dodgers $67 million for 18, the Yankees
$66 million for 17 and the Rangers $61.5 million for 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' payroll was ballooned by their signing of Kevin
Brown to a seven-year, $105 million contract. Brown has a $10
million salary next year and also receives a $5 million signing
bonus up front. In determining payrolls, both the clubs'
labor-relations office and the Players Association prorate signing
bonuses over the life of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kept the payroll flat since I got here,'' said Malone,
who became general manager late in the season. ``When I came in, I
was looking at a payroll of 72-73. It went up with the Kevin Brown
signing, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides signing Brown, Malone has made some major trades,
dealing Bobby Bonilla and Charles Johnson and adding Todd Hundley
and Mel Rojas. He is not finished trading because he wants to shed
some salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to move about $5 million,'' he said. ``I don't have
to, but I believe I'm going to move some money. I have six starting
pitchers and two starting shortstops. I've got surplus. If I move
one of each, I'm talking about $5 million coming off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have five players eligible for salary arbitration,
including three of those starting pitchers and one of the
shortstops. The pitchers are Ismael Valdes, Carlos Perez and Darren
Dreifort. The shortstop is Mark Grudzielanek. The fifth player is
outfielder Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who uncharacteristically have signed no other
team's free agents this off-season, face salary arbitration for the
first time with Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera and for the second
time with Andy Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year of eligibility last year, Pettitte went from a
$700,000 salary to a negotiated $3.75 million salary and earned a
$50,000 bonus. Jeter and Rivera had their contracts renewed last
year at $750,000 each and very likely will seek salaries close to
$4 million. Pettitte could try for something close to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the three players wind up gaining a collective total of $13
million, that would put the Yankees at $79 million. Another $2
million or so for Jorge Posada, Ramiro Mendoza, Ricky Ledee and
Shane Spencer would take the payroll to $81 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will not be one of the teams that surpasses the
Orioles' record. They have 14 players signed for a total of $50
million and expect to be somewhere in the $60 millions. They face
salary arbitration with Edgardo Alfonzo, Hideo Nomo, Rey Ordonez,
Turk Wendell and two newcomers, Armando Benitez and Roger Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   With the upsurge in payrolls at the upper end, the disparity
with payrolls at the lower end will grow next season. But the
Montreal Expos, whose $8.3 million payroll was the lowest for the
1998 season, figure to start next season with a higher payroll,
though by how much remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos have five players signed for a total of $7 million. Of
course, they could trade Rondell White and instantly lop off his $3
million salary.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Pirates had the second-lowest payroll last season
at $13.7 million, but they have dabbled in the free-agent market
this off-season and have 14 players signed for a total of $16
million. &QL;

ITALIAN COMPANIES SEEK TO SPIN OFF PROPERTY HOLDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Several of Italy's biggest companies have said in recent
months that they are considering spinning off large chunks of their
real estate holdings to increase profit and returns for their
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Enel, the state-owned utility, says it is studying how to spin
off $3.6 billion in property, which is now managed by a wholly
owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia, the national phone carrier, has hired Salomon
Smith Barney to help it create one or more subsidiaries to manage
$5.4 billion in real estate holdings.
</P>
<P>
   One of Italy's largest banking groups, Banca Intesa SpA, a
result of a merger between Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino
and an investment bank, Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, wants to
separate $1.6 billion in real estate holdings, either by creating a
subsidiary or handing them over to a real estate investment trust.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is spilling over into Italy's government holdings. The
Defense Ministry recently hired investment bankers to evaluate its
real estate; the government social security agency tendered offers
for an evaluation of its assets with a view to improving returns.
</P>
<P>
   All are following a trend set recently by a big insurer,
Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni, or INA, which spun off an
85 percent stake of its property arm, Unione Immobiliare, or Unim,
in November and listed the shares on the Milan exchange. Unim owns
and manages properties in Milan and Rome worth $2.9 billion. INA
says it will divest itself of its remaining 14.6 percent stake in
Unim within 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are following a European trend, which until now
was centered on financial service companies. Since 1996, Sweden's
largest bank, SE Banken, has spun off a company called Diligentia
with $2.2 billion in assets, while a group of Finnish state-owned
banks and insurance companies parked real estate assets in a
company named Sfonda. The French insurers AXA SA and Assurances
Generales de France have sold real estate assets to raise capital
and reduce exposure to property markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bricks used to be the European refuge,'' said Paola Giannotti
de Ponti, head of Italian investment banking at Salomon Smith
Barney. ``But with markets demanding higher revenue from assets, we
are seeing a focus on the capacity to generate returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the activity here is the result of the Italian
government's drive in recent years to sell state-owned businesses.
These companies, faced with the unaccustomed need to generate
greater returns, have been hiring investment banks to devise
strategies for putting huge real estate holdings to work.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as interest rates plunged, pushed down by the need to
prepare for a single European currency, Italian businesses sought
to squeeze more competitive yields from real estate holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for higher yields arose from a history of poor
management. Under past state ownership, valuable properties often
housed government agencies at rents below market level; vacancies
were widespread and, thanks to government coddling, there was
little competitive drive for higher rents or fresh investment.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of INA, most Italian companies are still in
the study stage. Yet experts agree that over the next several years
that could be followed by a wave of spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   John Carrafiell, head of real estate in Europe at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, which managed the Unim spinoff, said Italian companies
were plowing through a multistage procedure that involves
identifying properties, understanding the alternatives, including
selling properties, spinning them off to shareholders as separate
companies, or parking them in joint ventures. Carrafiell said most
companies ``are still in stage one or two, mainly because the
information is just not there.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investment banks, which invented real estate investment
trusts, are cashing in. In addition to managing the Unim spinoff,
Morgan Stanley recently acquired a $155 million portfolio of
nonperforming real estate loans from Istituto Bancario San Paolo
and is seeking profit by issuing bonds against them.
</P>
<P>
   INA's reasons for leading the pack are many, experts say, and
among them is the fact that its real estate was already held in a
property-management division. But INA was prompted to take Unim
down the stock market path because of its own high capitalization.
With the Unim spinoff, INA shed $2.9 billion in shareholder equity
out of $7.5 billion at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Unim became the largest listed property company in
Italy and the fifth-largest in Europe, ranked by market
capitalization. INA, for its part, saw its return on equity soar to
7.9 percent from 4.6 percent, and demand for its shares surged.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some analysts note that the flip side was a
relatively low return on equity for Unim, whose share price did not
exactly take off after the spinoff, increasing about 6 percent
through last week. Still, they say, this could be attributed in
part to lukewarm interest from British and U.S. investment funds,
whose experience with market-lagging REITs in the United States has
been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   James Pierce, an Italy analyst at Fox Pitt Kelton, a London
investment bank specializing in banking and insurance, thinks
Unim's performance will improve, benefiting from its withdrawal
from government influence and the recruitment of professional
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, analysts like Pierce say that Italy's property market
is just now emerging from a protracted recession, with revived
building activity and the first signs of rent and value increases
since the 1980s. In Milan, the financial capital, office rental
rates saw the first increase in 1998 in eight years, though they
remain 30 percent below their 1991 peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask whether it's been a success,'' Pierce said, ``the
answer is yes.''

A MOBILE MCNABB WINS PRAISE AS TOP PRO PROSPECT
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, not given to rash
statements, calls Donovan McNabb the country's best college
football player. Michigan's Lloyd Carr offers that McNabb is
impossible to trap with four defensive rushers. Steve Spurrier of
Florida talks about the accuracy of McNabb's arm and expects him to
be the first quarterback taken in the National Football League
draft.
</P>
<P>
   But McNabb's special ability is only part of his story. His easy
smile and friendly, self-effacing manner also have contributed to
his stature as one of central New York's most popular athletes
ever.
</P>
<P>
   At his final home game, against Miami, McNabb received standing
ovations from the crowd at the Carrier Dome both at the game's
start and end. Graybeards had to hark back to Ernie Davis' career
at Syracuse in the early 1960's to find a comparable fan reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the fans could have cheered any longer or any
harder for one guy,'' Syracuse Coach Paul Pasqualoni said Monday,
as the Orangemen began preparation for their Orange Bowl game here
Saturday night against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is as well-loved a kid in the community as any we've had,''
Pasqualoni added. ``He's been a role model for every kid in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb has amassed 8,389 passing yards, has run for another
1,561 and has accounted for 96 touchdowns, enough to make him a
projected No. 1 pick in the NFL draft despite an abundance of
quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The other prospects include Tim Couch, the Kentucky junior who
has said he would turn pro if he was the draft's No. 1 pick; Daunte
Culpepper of Central Florida, Michael Bishop of Kansas State and
Cade McNown of UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier, coach of the Florida Gators, said that if he were a
pro coach, he would be delighted to draft McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can escape people,'' Spurrier said. ``You can't hardly
tackle him, you can't sack him, and he's an excellent passer.''
</P>
<P>
   Though turning professional is just a game away for McNabb, a
6-foot-3-inch, 220-pounder, he played down much of the speculation
about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is all I'm thinking about right now,'' he said.
``Winning this game is why I'm down here.'' Asked later whether he
has mentally sized up his quarterback draft competition, he said,
``I'm really not worried who's in it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Doug Johnson is in it, then I'll think about what he's
doing,'' he said, referring to the Florida quarterback. ``But if
they're not Gators, then I'm not worried about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he acknowledged he would be interested in playing for the
Chicago Bears, who have the No. 7 pick. They have indicated a keen
interest in him, in part because he is from nearby Dolton, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   If a recommendation from Pasqualoni counts for anything, more
than the Bears will be interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has everything you'd look for in a quarterback,''
he said, ``especially in this day and age where everybody is
interested in the mobile quarterback _ the guy who can make a play,
keep a play alive and use good judgment. I see him doing better
than all those guys in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Pasqualoni has grown accustomed to seeing the elusive McNabb
make something grand out of what had looked like nothing.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite: Against Virginia Tech this season, fourth-and-8
with the Orangemen losing by 4 points and the game clock nearing
zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go back to throw the ball,'' Pasqualoni said, recalling the
sweetness of the play. ``He knows the protection in the blitz so
well that he hits the one lane that was available. He takes off and
runs for 42 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, to top it off, McNabb threw 13 yards for the touchdown
that won that game, a victory that was pivotal in Syracuse's
winning the Big East Conference title and gaining the Orange Bowl
bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him do so many wonderful things,'' Pasqualoni said.
``Sometimes I say to myself, `How did he do that?' But I'm never
surprised by what he is able to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gators realize he is more than a handful, said cornerback
Tony George. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think discipline is going to be a real key in this game,''
he said. ``A guy that's so dangerous like him, you have to stay in
your lanes and be careful not to be caught out of position. He'll
be up the field on you if you do. I plan on having to use my eyes a
lot to pick up a little tendency here and there if I can.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, however, is not likely to give too much away. Despite
playing four years of football and two years of basketball, he
graduated in four years, with a degree in speech communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he runs the huddle with all the confidence in the world,''
the senior guard Scott Kiernan said. ``It's a pleasure to be there
with him. He knows what he's doing and everybody loves him.''  &QL;

82 DETAINED IN HUMAN-SMUGGLING OPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Eighty-two illegal immigrants from Cuba, Haiti and
Jamaica were dropped off at eight locations between Key West and
West Palm Beach over the last three days in a flurry of smuggling
that takes a page from the drug trafficking in the seas off South
Florida, federal officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 82 illegal immigrants detained over the weekend were
46 Cubans, 30 Haitians and six Jamaicans, including 12 minors,
officials said. One group of 18 Cubans landed on the shore in Miami
Beach's trendy South Beach section.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Border Patrol officials said organized alien smugglers
using high-powered speedboats were believed to be involved in all
but one of the incidents, the highest number of landings the Border
Patrol has seen in a 72-hour period. They said the boats, which
have been used increasingly in the past year, take smaller groups
of people and require more landings than larger vessels, but can go
faster and blend in better to elude law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest benefit is that they can more or less disguise
themselves in the general boating population,'' said Keith Roberts,
a Border Patrol spokesman here.
</P>
<P>
   Speedboats are a staple of cocaine smuggling _ they rendezvous
with airplanes for drug airdrops, and also make delivery runs
between Bahamian islands like Bimini to ports and marinas along
Florida's east coast.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said some of the alien smugglers, who
sometimes also use the Bahamas by having their human cargo dropped
off there by larger boats for pickup by a speedboat, use drug
trafficking methods because they often smuggle drugs too. Of 21
pending federal prosecutions of alien smugglers in South Florida,
Roberts said, at least six cases involve defendants also connected
to drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Border Patrol, which handles the illegal immigrants
who make it to shore, had no year-end figures available, the U.S.
Coast Guard, which handles those caught at sea, reports a doubling
in the number of immigrant interceptions from last year. So far in
1998, 998 Cubans and 1,345 Haitians have been intercepted at sea,
compared with 406 Cubans and 587 Haitians in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard spokesman, Petty Officer Jeff Murphy, said one
theory for the rise, which was registered mostly in the second half
of the year, was that because of hurricane destruction in the
Caribbean, ``more and more people might be willing to risk it all''
and leave for the United States. Still, the numbers are far below
their crisis proportions in 1994, when more than 37,000 Cubans and
24,000 Haitians crossed the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the United States, which used to indiscriminately
welcome those escaping Fidel Castro's Cuba, repatriates Cubans
found at sea, just as it does Haitians and others. Those who make
it to land, however, are less likely to be deported, and many
Cubans still attempt the crossing. Increasingly, they have resorted
to smugglers with boats better equipped for the journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, it was anything that would float,'' Murphy said.
``We're seeing more and more sophistication in their approach.''
</P>
<P>
   But the smuggling fee _ which Border Patrol officials said
averages about $1,500 but can reach $8,000 or higher _ does not
guarantee a safe passage. Earlier this month a speedboat carrying
21 Cuban immigrants capsized near the Florida Keys and 14 people
drowned. Two men, both of Cuban descent, have been charged with
alien smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts of the Border Patrol said one factor contributing to the
high number of incidents this month was that organized smugglers
``traditionally'' _ and erroneously _ assume that U.S. borders are
lightly staffed during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that better coordination with local law enforcement
offices has led to more reports of suspicious activity from boaters
and people walking along the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be an overall heightened awareness,'' he said.

HOUSE MANAGERS SEEKING STRATEGY FOR IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He has the presidential impeachment he sought from
the House. Now Rep. Henry Hyde is in search of a strategy for an
impeachment trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
and the 12 other Republican congressmen he picked to join him in
managing President Clinton's Senate trial will begin mapping out
the prosecution's game plan, meeting for the first time since the
historic House impeachment votes of Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   With some of the group already disagreeing over whether there is
a need to call witnesses, and with very little precedent to guide
them, the managers face a host of thorny issues, and are obviously
not yet ready to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate will most likely receive the formal charges
next week after the 106th Congress convenes, Senate rules allow the
White House time to respond to the charges, and the managers time
to respond to that reply. All this, lawmakers say, could take two
to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When they gather on Tuesday in the same conference room of the
Rayburn House Office Building where Republicans on the Judiciary
Committee drafted the articles of impeachment, the managers will
review Senate procedural rules, assign responsibilities and debate
which witnesses to summon, if any.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, for example, may want to call Monica S. Lewinsky to
testify about her relationship with Clinton, a House Republican
aide said on Monday, even though two influential Republican
senators, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,
have said doing so would be unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managers are now before a Senate jury,'' the aide said,
``and a jury needs to see some live faces. If nothing else, we
could have Monica attest to the fact her testimony is true and she
stands by it.''
</P>
<P>
   All 13 managers are lawyers, and so it is perhaps no surprise
that they differ sharply as to the best approach. Rep. George W.
Gekas of Pennsylvania, who was a manager in the Senate impeachment
trial of Federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings in 1989, said there was no
need to call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make the case that there is already testimony
under oath, in grand jury testimony and affidavits,'' Gekas said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who is a former U.S.
attorney, envisioned calling as many as 15 witnesses in a
month-long trial. ``You diminish the impact of the evidence if it's
simply stipulated instead of given in live fashion,'' Hutchinson
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hyde's greatest challenges may be melding the hard-edged
courtroom approach brought by the three former federal prosecutors
on his team with the experience he and two other managers have
gained from previous Senate impeachment trials of federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The managers say they also are well aware of the public's
desire, shared by most senators, to avoid a drawn-out proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``A senator's attention span is probably less than an average
juror's, so we'll need to simplify, simplify, simplify,'' said Rep.
Bob Barr of Georgia, a manager who is also a former U.S. attorney.
``We have to pick out the best pieces of evidence and not throw
everything up on the wall. If we get bogged down into making this
into a complicated case, we'll lose votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said on Monday he does not
understand why a trial should take more than a matter of days. ``I
don't see any point in calling a lot of witnesses,'' said Cochran.
``We all know what the evidence is. Let the president make his
defense and offer any motions, and then let's start voting.''
</P>
<P>
   But the House managers have only limited control over the
proceedings. The White House can present its own witnesses and
evidence, and a majority of senators can vote to end the trial at
any point.
</P>
<P>
   And with Senate Democrats and Republicans openly debating the
merits of a censure _ apparently in recognition of the current
conventional wisdom that there are not the 67 votes needed to
remove Clinton _ the managers worry the plug might be pulled on
their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really all guesswork,'' said Gekas.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, uncertainty extends even to preliminary procedural
steps. Hyde expects to formally present the two impeachment charges
against Clinton _ perjury before the federal grand jury and
obstruction of justice _ to the Senate sometime next week, after
the 106th Congress convenes on Wednesday, but he does not know
exactly when.
</P>
<P>
   That decision rests with Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, who has been consulting with the Senate Democratic
leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Hyde's aides have been meeting quietly with Lott's
chief of staff, David Hoppe, and one of Daschle's top aides,
William V. Corr, to discuss the outlines of a trial schedule and
other logistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just talking through how it could proceed, what
documents the House has,`` said one Senate Democratic aide.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who worked for Jenny Crowe-Innes 10 years ago knew that
there were times when they could find her lying in pain on the
floor with a migraine headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I would just lay there on my office floor until
someone came in to either take me home or to the emergency room,''
recalled Ms. Crowe-Innes, who owns an executive search company near
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The incapacitating attacks eased five years ago, after a
neurologist suggested that Ms. Crowe-Innes try a new class of
migraine drugs known as triptans. They work faster and are more
effective than existing migraine medications. Ms. Crowe-Innes takes
Imitrex, the leading triptan, which works so well and so fast _
usually within 20 minutes _ that she does not mind paying some $73
for a two-dose shot. Imitrex is made by Glaxo Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've experienced that pain, you'd pay almost anything
for something to relieve it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After going for decades with few available migraine drugs, the
25 million Americans who suffer these monster headaches now have a
wide choice of new remedies. Three additional triptans have been
introduced within the last year _ Glaxo Wellcome's Amerge, Maxalt
from Merck &AMP; Co., and Zomig from Zeneca Pharmaceuticals _ with
Pfizer set to release yet another in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The new drugs are staking out a potentially huge market, one
that Cowen &AMP; Co. estimates will grow to $3.5 billion from $1.6
billion in the next three years. Such growth would not be all that
surprising: Slightly less than half of all migraine sufferers in
the United States have seen a doctor in the last year and pain
relievers are very popular drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, doctors say that few benign conditions are as
debilitating as a migraine, further raising drug makers' hopes. At
the same time, some pharmaceutical companies are spending freely on
consumer advertising for the new drugs, a strategy that has
previously created much larger markets in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sales of migraine drugs have so far not lived up to
expectations. Triptan sales are expected to rise only 15 percent to
20 percent next year, after soaring 72 percent in 1996 and 27
percent through September, according to IMS Health, an industry
consultant. Sales growth has been stalled by a glut of free triptan
samples that have temporarily replaced new prescriptions and by a
similarity in effectiveness among the new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pharmaceutical companies were completely misguided when it
came to migraine drugs,'' said Dr. Neil Raskin, a professor of
neurology at the University of California at San Francisco. ``They
thought they could expand the market, but that hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   More important, many consumers _ and even some doctors, drug
makers say _ do not fully understand what a migraine is. It is an
excruciatingly painful headache that often leaves its victims
almost completely debilitated. Along with a headache, migraine
sufferers often feel nauseated and weak, and frequently experience
an acute sensitivity to light.
</P>
<P>
   While migraines usually begin gradually, they are sometimes set
off by food _ notably red wine, cheese or chocolate _ and
frequently accompany a change in the body's hormones, causing women
to experience them three times as frequently as men.
</P>
<P>
   Most migraine sufferers have typically mistaken the pain as a
sinus headache and have used over-the-counter medications to ease
the other symptoms. Rarely does that work, leaving some people to
suffer for days before the pain finally passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our biggest goals is to educate patients on how to
delineate a migraine headache from a common headache,'' said
Stephen O'Quinn, senior clinical program director for migraines at
Glaxo Wellcome. ``Patients have to be able to recognize that they
have a migraine and need prescription medication. They have to
understand that migraine headaches are a disease.''
</P>
<P>
   To educate patients and doctors, Merck, Zeneca and Glaxo
Wellcome have begun marketing blitzes. Turn on any television
channel, and chances are that there will be a commercial for
Imitrex or Zomig or an ad for no specific brand that illustrates a
migraine's symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a nearly 83 percent share of the migraine drug market
in the United States, Glaxo Wellcome has spent $28.6 million _ 58
percent of the industry's total expenditures for consumer migraine
ads _ to expand the brand's sales, according to Competitive Media
Reporting.
</P>
<P>
   To make its Zomig brand a contender, Zeneca has spent $20.4
million through August to promote the brand, roughly 39 percent of
the drug's sales through that period. The ads have paid dividends:
Zomig has picked up 6.6 percent of market share _ largely at Glaxo
Wellcome's expense _ since its introduction last January.
</P>
<P>
   Merck, meanwhile, has yet to spend a nickel on consumer ads to
promote Maxalt, and has no plans to start, according to company
executives. Instead, the company has flooded doctors' offices with
brochures and tapes, hoping to educate physicians about migraines
and the benefits of Maxalt's dissolvable tablet.
</P>
<P>
   Merck's strategy may deliver the most results, analysts said,
given that until most people understand what a migraine is, the
majority of cases will remain untreated.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Advertising has indeed prodded some migraine sufferers to see
their doctors, but some patients have been notoriously stubborn.
Doctors say that many of these people had parents who suffered from
migraines and insist on following their example by locking
themselves in a dark room until the headache stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason why more people don't seek medical help is because
migraines are episodic,'' said Dr. Richard Lipton, a neurologist at
the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. ``When the
pain subsides, many sufferers believe that's the last migraine
headache that they will ever have. They don't seek treatment until
they need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients who do arrive at their doctor's offices may encounter
another obstacle to treatment. Unable to recognize a migraine
headache's textbook symptoms, some doctors often order a barrage of
invasive tests and scans to rule out such medical horrors as cancer
or brain tumors, drug companies say. Patients often abandon the
treatment before a correct diagnosis can be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some physicians will want to make sure that the cause of the
headache is not organic,'' said Gerardo Torres, associate medical
director for Zeneca Pharmaceuticals. ``But doctors who are not well
trained may do unnecessary tests. The management of migraines is
not taught in most residencies.''
</P>
<P>
   To expand the migraine market, the makers of triptan need to
revamp their marketing strategies, some industry analysts argue.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the ads for Zomig and Imitrex. Campaigns for both drugs
portray a woman grimacing with her hand to her head _ Madison
Avenue's universal symbol for headache _ only to be replaced by an
image of the same women, vibrant and vital, after she has taken one
of their migraine pills.
</P>
<P>
   While the ads may convince some people, they are just as likely
to confuse as help. Analysts contend that the entire slant to these
campaigns should be scrapped, beginning with the word ``migraine,''
a clinical term that some people will never fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Migraine should be repositioned as superheadache,'' said David
Saks, a managing director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``There's no question
the condition is undertreated, but people need to be told to take
these medications when the headache begins, to stress possible
prevention. People have traditionally been more than willing to pay
money to relieve pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition in this market has begun to grow nasty. Most
neurologists say there is little difference in efficacy between the
triptans, but that has not stopped the drug makers from pointing
some out.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any Glaxo Wellcome sales representative about Imitrex or
Amerge and expect to get an earful. Not only does Imitrex, in its
injection form, relieve some migraines within 10 minutes _ the
fastest of any triptans _ Amerge remains in the bloodstream for
more than six hours to prevent additional attacks. The other
triptans remain in the bloodstream for only two to four hours.
</P>
<P>
   A potential drawback with the Imitrex injection is that it costs
$73 wholesale for a two-dose shot. The Glaxo Wellcome sales
representative will not volunteer that information, but the Merck
representative probably will. Maxalt costs $11.25 wholesale a
tablet, the lowest of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects are also a potential problem, and include lack of
energy, nausea, dizziness or tightness in the chest or throat.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that the efficacy among the triptans is relatively
close, drug makers have provided several methods of taking the
medication. Usually, how a drug can be taken is merely an added
convenience to consumers, but with migraines it has fast become a
volatile marketing point.
</P>
<P>
   One big advantage Merck has pushed is Maxalt-MLT, a wafer that
dissolves in a patient's mouth without water. Glaxo Wellcome offers
Imitrex as a shot, nasal spray and tablet. Zeneca will soon offer
Zomig in a wafer and nasal spray.
</P>
<P>
   Even though triptan sales have slowed, the companies are
confident that the market will pick up, and Glaxo Wellcome and
Zeneca are both exploring the use of celebrities to promote their
migraine drugs in commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Most migraine sufferers who have tried the triptans have quickly
become loyal to their particular brand, doctors say. Given Glaxo
Wellcome's stranglehold on the migraine market, it is unlikely that
any company will be able to upend its dominant share. But doctors
do see a need for several triptans on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some migraine sufferers couldn't take any of the other
medications,'' Raskin, the neurology professor, said. ``With the
triptans, they usually find one that will work for them. The
trouble is that all the drug makers decided to stay in a narrow
channel. As long as they keep putting out these look-alikes, we'll
never have drugs that are 100 percent or even 90 percent
successful.''

STATE TAX CREDITS IMPROVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As you wrap up your financial affairs for the
year, take note of new or improved state tax credits to whittle
away your tax bill for 1998, according to the California Franchise
Tax Board.
</P>
<P>
   The state tax collector also unveiled an electronic payment
system to be used for the first time in 1998 to make filing taxes
less painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to help,'' said Denise Azimi, spokeswoman for the
Franchise Tax Board in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   But an association of certified public accountants believe these
are just small concessions when the state had the opportunity to
grant bigger relief. This year, a state bill that would have
changed many California tax laws to mirror the tax breaks on the
federal level didn't pass, according to the California Society of
CPAs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have conformed a lot of the really neat (federal) tax
changes featured in the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998
that we don't get for California,'' said David Flamer, a Los
Angeles CPA and taxation committee member of the California Society
of CPAs.
</P>
<P>
   The failed bill, state Assembly Bill 1469 by former
Assemblywoman Deborah Ortiz, D-Sacramento, would have protected
innocent spouses in tax audits, erased time limits for tax refunds
for the mentally disabled, increased the capital gains exemption
allowed in home sales, given relief to destitute taxpayers and
added a flexible rollback feature on Roth IRAs, among other perks
now available federally.
</P>
<P>
   However, the tax relief effort for Californians isn't dead. A
similar senate bill was introduced this month.
</P>
<P>
   As for improvements in 1998, the state dependent exemption
credit will be raised from $68 to $253 for each dependent. That
means dependents _ generally children but it could be an elderly
parent _ can save you a lot more money in 1998. For a family of
five, the savings is more than $500.
</P>
<P>
   The Renter's Tax Credit is back after a six-year hiatus. Single
taxpayers can take a $60 credit if they have adjusted gross incomes
of $25,000 or less. Married couples with adjusted gross incomes of
$50,000 or less can take a $120 credit. But if the credit reduces
taxes to below zero _ say, you owe $40 but with a $60 credit the
state now owes you $20 _ you won't get money back. Before, you'd
get refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the bad news. Californians would have been able to take a
lot more federal tax breaks if AB 1469 had passed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the ``innocent spouse'' provision would protect a
divorced partner from unfair treatment in a tax audit if the other
spouse took care of all the taxes and made the majority of the
money in the household. For the mentally disabled, such as
Alzheimer's sufferers, federal law gets rid of a time limit within
which they can get refunds from the government if they
inadvertently overpaid in taxes. The state doesn't give this
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Another federal perk that the state does not give relates to
capital gains in the sale of a home. Under federal law, if the
homeowner is forced to sell his or her home within a short period
of time due to job changes or health reasons, they won't qualify
for the full capital gains discount, but they do get a partial
break. State laws don't offer the partial discount.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz's bill also would have given the Franchise Tax Board
flexibility to cut a deal with delinquent taxpayers who don't have
any money to pay _ a power the IRS now holds.
</P>
<P>
   And while state tax laws do conform to most of the federal Roth
IRA provisions _ tax deductions aren't allowed but withdrawals are
not taxed _ it is less flexible about when to take Roth IRA income
to be taxed after being rolled over from other retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes for 1998 include the ability to pay
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, folks who filed their state returns through the
Internet and by phone had to mail in their checks. But this year,
the Franchise Tax Board will allow taxpayers to authorize their
financial institutions to electronically pay the state. For
refunds, folks who file electronically will get them faster _
within 10 days, or even sooner with direct deposit.

EARLY HOLIDAY FIGURES SUGGEST ONLINE RETAILERS EXCEEDED
EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN and SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holiday sales for Internet retailers, released Monday, revealed
a huge season _ even stronger than predictions that earlier this
month had seemed overblown, initial reports suggested.
</P>
<P>
   And while the the data were preliminary, they sent many
E-commerce stocks soaring as the market got its first glimpse of
the Internet serving a mass retail market.
</P>
<P>
   The increases were realized despite glitches that forced
consumers to suffer indignities like being denied access to
retailers' Web sites and holiday gifts that did not arrive on time
as promised.
</P>
<P>
   The most optimistic estimates of holiday sales came from a
subsidiary of InterPublic Group of Companies, whose survey of 1,000
consumers suggested that online sales would reach $5 billion. That
would be four times the total sales last year on the Internet
between Thanksgiving and Christmas and twice expectations for this
year of $2.3 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Consulting Group and Shop.org, the industry group for
electronic retailers, said that year-over-year sales grew 230
percent in the holiday season that just ended. Apparel sales were
particularly strong, growing to $300 million, from under $100
million in 1997, The Boston group said. In addition, the average
order was $55, up 6 percent over last year's average.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all these projections were very preliminary _ most
retailers will not release actual sales figures until mid-January _
and even the most optimistic would be far less than 1 percent of
estimated $2.6 trillion in retail sales in the United States for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   To put Monday's E-commerce estimates in perspective, Wal-Mart
Stores, the world's largest retailer, did $118 billion in sales in
1997 _ more than 23 times the most optimistic estimate of all
holiday retail sales on the Internet this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those facts led many analysts to remain skeptical of the wave of
euphoria generated by Monday's data.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not enough evidence to justify'' InterPublic's $5
billion estimate, said James McQuivey, a senior analyst at
Forrester, an independent market research firm that specializes in
Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the strong showing did not exactly cause jaws to drop.
If an established company like IBM had reported such increases, it
would have been the business equivalent of an Elvis sighting. But
Internet sales have been growing rapidly all year.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Wainwright, chief executive officer of Reel.com, an online
video store that was recently purchased by Hollywood Entertainment,
explained: ``Our business is up seven times from last year. But
that is not a surprise really. December is up 25 percent from
November, and November was up 40 percent from October.''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, examining just percentage rates of growth can be
misleading because online retailers started with such a small
revenue base compared with their brick-and-mortar peers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the numbers, the first of the post-holiday season,
clearly confirmed strong Internet shopping growth and the World
Wide Web's potential for further expansion. Seizing on the data,
investors snapped up shares of more Internet companies Monday,
sending them to new heights. SkyMall Inc., for example, an
in-flight catalog and Internet retailer, announced Monday that
online sales of $1 million for the fourth quarter of 1998 would be
triple its sales in the same period in 1997. Its shares jumped
$18.875 to $31.44 after touching $48 earlier in the day on heavy
trading of 24.6 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Amazon.com, the giant on-line bookseller, jumped
$27.125 to $351.9375, and even promises of Internet sales produced
winners. Active Apparel, a maker of women's wear, saw its share
price increase 145 percent, to $3.0625 on Monday after it launched
a Web site to which it said it would eventually add a line of men's
swimwear.
</P>
<P>
   But while the shares of electronic retailers appeared to rise
broadly, it was unclear whether small electronic merchants
benefited from the holiday on-line frenzy experienced by the
largest Internet retailers. Boston Consulting Group tracked only
the leading electronic retailers in 17 gift categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seasoned merchants had room to shine,'' said Wendy Brown,
AOL's director of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Of most significance to potential investors and E-commerce
watchers, was the growth of new online shoppers. Ms. Brown said
that a review of AOL's holiday figures showed that ``at any given
point, 20 percent of the people online are there for the first
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Female shoppers also made a strong showing this Christmas. An
InterPublic subsidiary, the Marketing Corporation of America, found
that while women still trailed men in total number of Internet
purchases, they were 9 to 11 percent more likely to make multiple
purchases, spending $168 per month, on average, versus the $125
spent by men.
</P>
<P>
   The significant shift in the demographics of Internet shoppers,
from male, typically technologically savvy users to a mass market
may have its own price tag, however, in the form of higher
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mass market users are far less forgiving of technology-related
glitches,'' said Nicole Vanderbilt, senior analyst of digital
commerce for Jupiter Communication, a New York-based market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The as-yet unanswered question is whether online retailers this
season provided the kind of pleasant and convenient shopping
experience that would make first-time experimenters comeback for
more. Certainly, they knew what was a stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Christmas was a make-or-break period,'' said Joe Kraus,
senior vice president and co-founder of Excite, a portal and search
engine. ``It's like the first time you go to a restaurant. If the
food and service were good, you'll come back. If the food is cold
and the waiter is rude, you'll never go there again.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the Internet clearly provided convenience as promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a newborn baby so I couldn't leave the house,'' said
Deborah Kamali, a gynecologist in Princeton, N.J.. ``I could be in
my pajamas, breast feeding a baby and still go shopping on line.''
</P>
<P>
   She ended up buying her son a video from Amazon.com and her
husband a leather jacket from J.Crew and a cellular phone from
AT&AMP;T. The Internet, she said, provided all the satisfaction of
walking the aisles of a well-stocked store. ``It's great,'' she
said. ``You can spend hours searching for movies and disks and
books.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Jupiter's Ms. Vanderbilt said that, already, ``there have
been some missteps by retailers during this critical period.'' She
added, ``And we are just starting to hear the rumblings about what
went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Several sites, including barnesandnoble.com and Macys.com, had
trouble processing customers' orders because of heavy traffic.
Perhaps worse, several retailers, including Amazon.com, failed in
their promises to deliver gifts by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   To make a splash with consumers, 800.Com Inc, an online
electronics, music and video store, offered three movies or CD's
for $1 as a promotion in November. Suddenly, the site was swamped.
It received some one million unique visitors this month to date _
400 percent over its target, said the company's president, Greg
Drew. The result was a two-day period during which the site had
trouble processing orders. Drew estimates that some 50 percent of
the CD's and movies ordered were delivered to customers after
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was better to have people wait a week or two
than be disappointed,'' Drew said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiley consumers did find ways around the Internet's
shortcomings. For example, Abby Tannenbaum, an editor in Manhattan,
realized her gifts would be delivered late anyway, so saved
shopping time by waiting until after the holiday rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to order a book from Amazon the day before Christmas,
and it was way too slow,'' Ms. Tannenbaum said. ``So I waited until
yesterday, and it was fine.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For months now, you've gotten up at the crack of
dawn to sit at your computer, scribbled notes on scratch pads and
napkins, and kept plugging away late into the night at the work
that will bring you the fame and fortune you've dreamed about _ a
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of overwhelming joy fills you when you type the closing
``Fade out.'' Your script, you think, has the sophisticated comic
dialogue of a Preston Sturges comedy within a structure worthy of
Robert (``Chinatown'') Towne.
</P>
<P>
   You address a manila envelope to an agent, seal the script
inside, and drop it into the nearest mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh, you may have jumped the gun there, according to Richard
Walter, screenwriting chairman at the University of California, Los
Angeles, film school and author of several scripts and fiction and
nonfiction books.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest mistakes screenwriters make is to send their
scripts before they're ready to send, said Walter, author of
``Screenwriting: The Art, Craft and Business of Film and Television
Writing'' and ``The Whole Picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When your script is finished, you don't send it to an agency;
you don't send it to a production company,'' he said. ``You send it
to friends whom you love and you trust to see whether or not it's
ready to show to an agent or production company.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling a script, according to Walter, is as easy as one-two: 1)
Get an agent; 2) wait.
</P>
<P>
   Below are Walter's suggestions for getting your script from page
to film _ and a fat check in your wallet:
</P>
<P>
   _ Register the first draft _ and all subsequent drafts _ with
The Writers Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   _ Once family and friends confirm that your script is ready,
send a short query letter to an agent that includes no more than
one sentence about yourself and another briefly describing your
script.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the agent is interested, send the completed script _ not a
treatment or synopsis, but the whole script.
</P>
<P>
   _ If agent or producer suggests rewrites, do it if you agree
creatively and continue to maintain 100 percent of the rights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Then, sit back and wait. Don't bug the agent with calls
seeking updates on the status of your script. ``If (the agent)
wants to represent the work, (the agent) will do all the work,''
Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most of all, keep plugging away. Don't expect things to happen
overnight. ``Writers do not fail in Hollywood. They just give up,''
he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As recently as a few weeks ago, it seemed as if
America's corporate giants need not worry too much about the
Internet. After all, if upstart companies that specialize in online
commerce were ever to realize investors' much-hyped expectations
for future profits, Fortune 500 members could always just buy them.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. The recent explosion in share prices of companies
linked to the online world has been so spectacular that the market
value of some Internet companies is rapidly eclipsing that of more
established competitors, even when the online companies still lag
badly in terms of profits and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Internet lodged another such milestone, this time
shaking some core assumptions in the finance industry. The market
value of San Francisco-based discount broker Charles Schwab reached
$25.5 billion, putting it ahead by a nose of the industry
standard-bearer and Wall Street heavyweight, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
which investors now say is worth $25.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Market value can change dramatically day to day, and investors
still value one big investment bank, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
above Schwab. But Schwab's helicopterlike ascent is unprecedented,
analysts said, both in its speed and perhaps in its challenge to
the way Wall Street treats the online craze.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that just two weeks ago, the market was awash with
unconfirmed rumors that Merrill might consider buying Schwab to
give it a presence online, a possibility that now seems far-fetched
given the huge increase in Schwab's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Merrill has to be concerned about this,'' said Richard
Strauss, securities industry analyst for Goldman Sachs. ``There is
significant value in Merrill for many reasons. But the Internet is
clearly something that they have to make a top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has been swept up in the Internet stock frenzy. America
Online, perhaps the best-known Internet entertainment and commerce
company, recently surpassed Disney in market value. Amazon.com has
a market value well above the combined value of two leading rivals,
Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders. Investors value Ebay, the new Internet
auction company, at more than five times Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, unlike Merrill and other rivals, has transformed itself
from a traditional retail broker, albeit one that specialized in
discounted fees, into a company that does most of its business
online. Merrill, meanwhile, has delayed plans to offer a limited
online trading service to some customers until early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley and Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, Wall Street
houses that like Merrill have a more diverse array of businesses
than Schwab, have substantial online operations. But only a small
part of their revenue is Internet-related.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, moreover, dodged a bullet from new rivals like E-Trade
and Ameritrade, services that focus exclusively on cut-rate, online
stock trading. Even as online trading has soared as a percentage of
total stock trading, Schwab has maintained its market share of 30
percent of online trading, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has watched the revenue it derives from each trade
slide as investors switched to less expensive trading through its
Web site. As recently as late last year, Schwab earned $63 on every
trade it handled, and now that average has fallen to $53. But a
sharp increase in the quantity of trades has more than made up for
that loss, and profits are rising at a rapid clip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schwab did a great job to turning the Internet to its
advantage when it could easily have become a victim,'' said Bill
Burnham, online commerce analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston.
``Now, any fears that they will be superseded by the Internet have
subsided. They are the leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts warn that the lopsided valuations placed on
companies with the suffix ``.com'' has the classic symptoms of a
financial bubble and will likely prove fleeting. Some say the same
about Schwab's sudden rise, and indeed its valuation by some
traditional measures seems extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab trades at 65 times its projected profits next year, a
ratio more familiar to the speculative Internet world than the
brokerage community. Merrill trades at 16 times its forward
earnings. That's despite the fact that Merrill manages $1.4
trillion in client assets, three times what Schwab manages.
Merrill's revenues in the last year totaled $17.5 billion, seven
times Schwab's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just does not make that much sense for Schwab. These lofty
multiples get applied to Internet companies that are not mature and
are thought to have an enormous growth path ahead of them,'' said
Guy Moscowski, a brokerage stock analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
``I don't see how you apply that kind of thinking to Schwab. It has
been around for 25 years and has a more mature business.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, officials at Merrill say they are not about to
overhaul their strategy because of daily changes in stock prices.
``We have a long term strategy that is global, that has been very
successful in growing clients' assets, revenues and market share,''
said Jim Wiggins, a Merrill spokesman. ``We are sticking to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Merrill chose to do so, it might have a hard time
mimicking Schwab's heavy Internet focus. Schwab has always sought
to provide brokerage services at a low cost. That makes the company
more vulnerable to competition from purely Internet companies than
from full-service brokers like Merrill, which compete in providing
advice and financial planning services to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Merrill has a network of 14,000 brokers who would
likely resist any move by Merrill management to shift a large
proportion of the firm's business online. ``Just from a structural
position, it's incredibly difficult for Merrill to rush into the
Internet business,'' Burnham said. ``They would have a huge
political issue.''

PARCELLS MOST PLEASED WITH JETS' LAST FOUR GAMES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ This was a Monday unlike most Mondays for Bill
Parcells. There were no signs of exhaustion after a night of
tossing and turning. Instead there was an upbeat air surrounding
the Jets coach.
</P>
<P>
   This was a proud moment for Parcells, who reflected on a season
that he hoped is far from over. Sunday's 31-10 victory over the
Patriots _ the Jets' third straight against his former team _ did
not change the team's playoff position (a bye week followed by a
home-field game on Jan. 10). But the dominating performance
elevated the club's confidence and continued to show Parcells that
it is becoming a matured, battle-hardened group.
</P>
<P>
   So Parcells gave the players three days off before they are
summoned on Thursday. But he warned them not to celebrate on New
Year's Eve because there will be practice on Friday. The regular
season is over, the playoff run has begun.
</P>
<P>
   When someone mentioned the words Super Bowl, Parcells said:
``It's in the back of your mind. That's the prize.''
</P>
<P>
   This season marked the third time Parcells has led a woebegone
team he inherited into the playoffs in only his second season. The
first stint was with the Giants in 1983, followed by the Patriots
in 1993. But he has no favorites, he suggested, even though he
continued to talk about the Jets in terms he rarely has used after
only two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anything that will serve us better than the
last four games _ on the road, comebacks, a game that people said
didn't matter,'' Parcells said. ``There is no game you're not
trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   In those last four games, the Jets beat Seattle, Miami, Buffalo
and New England. ``We had to come back against Seattle,'' Parcells
said. ``We had to go on the road to tough places, to Miami and to
Buffalo.'' And referring to the regular-season finale, against New
England, he said: ``We had to sustain the energy even though a lot
of people were saying it is not that important. And we did it.''
</P>
<P>
   But was this Jets team more satisfying than the others? Is there
a common denominator?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, unless it's gathering the right kind of players
for the coaching staff,'' he said. ``You give the players a good
design and then get them to execute it. It's not just simple
preparation, it's working out, the conditioning program, getting
them ready all the time. If they don't do it, they have no chance.
It doesn't mean you won't get it done over the course of four or
five games, but I told this group, `If you don't do it all the
time, you have no chance.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his first playoff appearance with the Patriots was
a proud moment. They had started the season 3-6, they were trailing
the Vikings at halftime by 21-3 in Game 10 and they came back to
win their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   If he knew back in 1983 with the Giants what he knows now, he
said, ``I don't think I would have had as much wasted energy.
You're not set in your ways.'' He pointed out that he knew in
advance last week how much the Jets would practice for the Patriots
since his team had played the previous Saturday. He is able to
maximize scheduling based on his experience.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the perception that he was held back in personnel
decisions under George Young with the Giants and the Patriots'
owner Robert K. Kraft, Parcells contends, ``I never felt
constrained in either of my jobs. With the Giants we picked up
players I wanted _ Dave Duerson, Everson Walls _ and at New England
we got Keith Byars in the middle of the season, Jerome Henderson,
Otis Smith. By and large, wherever I was I never felt limited in
that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, here Parcells' title is head football coach and chief
football operations officer _ and that only hints at the power and
influence he wields over the Jets, through every square foot of the
offices as well as the artificial turf.

   PRELIMINARY REPORTS SHOW BRISK ONLINE SALES
</P>
<P>
   The first reports on holiday sales for Internet retailers showed
results that surpassed even what earlier this month had seemed to
be hyped-up preseason predictions. The increases came despite
glitches that forced consumers to suffer indignities like access
denial to Web sites and despite holiday gifts that did not arrive
on time as promised.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are preliminary, and even the most optimistic
prediction would be far less than 1 percent of the $2.6 trillion in
retail sales in the United States for the year, leading many
analysts to remain skeptical about the wave of euphoria generated
by the data.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET STOCKS SURGE, TOO
</P>
<P>
   The burgeoning use of the World Wide Web for shopping and stock
trading lifted shares of Internet-related companies. The Nasdaq
composite index, which is heavily weighted toward technology
stocks, rose 17.27 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,180.30, its fourth
record in six sessions. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.76
points, to 9,226.75, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell
eight-tenths of a point, to 1,225.49.
</P>
<P>
   PRICES OF TREASURIES REBOUND
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices posted their biggest gain in four weeks as
month-high yields and expectations for low inflation in 1999
attracted buyers. The yield of the benchmark 30-year bond fell to
5.15 percent from 5.21 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL SECURITY CLEARED FOR 2000
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called the year 2000 challenge ``a stunning
problem'' for computer programmers but said the Social Security
Administration had fixed its computers so that elderly people would
receive their monthly benefits without interruption in 2000. He did
not address the situation at other agencies judged by the White
House to be inadequately prepared for the year 2000, including the
Pentagon, the Energy Department and the agency that runs Medicare
and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   SICK CALLS COST TWA MILLIONS
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines flight attendants who called in sick over
the holiday weekend caused widespread flight cancellations, the
airline said, which cost the company millions of dollars. TWA said
Monday that service was returning to normal.
</P>
<P>
   RCN TO COMBINE ONLINE OPERATIONS
</P>
<P>
   RCN, which provides telecommunications services in the
northeastern United States, said it would combine its four Internet

from extending new loans to LG Semicon, punishing it for rejecting
a proposal to give Hyundai Electronics control of their merged

SYNCOR'S SHARES DIP 4.5 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Syncor International Corp. lost 4.5 percent of its
stock value Monday on news that it expects a revenue drop of up to
$15 million after losing a contract to a smaller rival.
</P>
<P>
   Syncor closed at $24, down $1.125.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst L. Mitra Ramgopal of Schroder &AMP; Co. in New York said
Syncor didn't go after the contract aggressively because it didn't
want to slash prices to gain market share at the expense of
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Syncor, a provider of radioactive isotopes used in illuminating
body organs for diagnosis, lost the Novation contract to
Nycomed/Amersham. The $15 million revenue loss is equivalent to 4
percent of Syncor's annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Novation is the purchasing organization representing the
hospital members of VHA Inc. and University Health Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Syncor currently has $112 million in business from VHA as a
group, and from the individual members of VHA and University
Health.
</P>
<P>
   Syncor moved quickly to assure investors that it expects to
retain much of that business. Brad Nutter, Syncor's chief operating
officer, said Syncor is confident of keeping the majority of the
business because many of these hospitals currently use Syncor's
management software system and Syncor is more convenient for
hospitals to use on account of its much larger distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   Syncor has 118 pharmacy centers nationwide compared with 26 for
Nycomed. Also, Syncor has the exclusive distribution rights to
Cardiolite, a popular cardiac-imaging agent that represents 40
percent of its sales to VHA and UHC.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1996, when Syncor lost a similar contract, it still
managed to retain 80 percent of the business, Nutter said.

BASE'S FORMER MARINE OF THE YEAR CHARGED WITH HAVING SEX WITH

<TEXT>
<P>
   A veteran Marine sergeant at Whidbey Island (Wash.) Naval Air
Station who was named the base's outstanding Marine of the year for
1996 faces a general court-martial on charges he had sexual
relations with a 14-year-old family friend.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Kenneth Poppy, 28, was charged under four counts of the
Uniform Code of Military Justice after a five-month investigation
by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and Marine officials,
said Marine spokesman Maj. Stephen Kay.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were filed in October, but not confirmed until
Monday after a formal request by the Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Poppy, an eight-year career Marine, is assigned to the Marine
Air Training Support Group at the Oak Harbor base and works at the
aircraft intermediate maintenance department.
</P>
<P>
   Poppy received the Oak Harbor Rotary Club's Marine of the Year
award on Oct. 11, 1996, after a selection process to evaluate
outstanding military performance and civic contributions among the
base's military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   A native of California, Poppy graduated from boot camp and
combat training in 1990 before receiving advanced training in
aircraft maintenance. He served as a maintenance technician for a
Marine F/A-18 squadron before coming to Oak Harbor in 1995. He was
cited by the Rotary Club as top Marine for participating in the
annual Toys for Tots drive and for volunteer work with the
Washington Trails Association helping maintain hiking trails at
state parks.
</P>
<P>
   Poppy is charged with one specification of Article 120 of the
military code, for having carnal knowledge of a person under the
age of 16; one specification of Article 125, for an act of sodomy;
and 2 specifications of Article 134 of the military code for
indecent acts.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on all four counts, Poppy could receive a maximum
sentence of 49 years in prison, reduction in rank to private,
forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge,
Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having an affair with a child is not right,'' Poppy's
estranged wife, Corrine Caulfield, said in a phone interview. ``I
hope the military system works the way it is supposed to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding against Poppy stems from an alleged relationship
between the sergeant and a 14-year-old family friend in the summer
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Caulfield said she and Poppy separated last January after she
learned her husband had been having an affair with another adult
female. Several months later the other woman approached Caulfield
with allegations of relationships with a third adult and the
14-year-old. Both women then took the information to Marine Corps
officials at Whidbey Island, who in turn requested a probe by naval
criminal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Poppy remains assigned to Whidbey Island and is not being
confined pending the court-martial, which is scheduled to open Jan.
8 at Camp Pendleton, Calif., Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Don King, Kay's military lawyer, declined comment Monday.

MONTEVERDI AND NONO: COUNTERPART COMPOSERS OF VENICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monteverdi's narrative of chivalry, battle and death, ``Il
Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda,'' had its first performance
in Venice in 1624. Exactly 300 years later, Luigi Nono was born in
the same city. But those long centuries can seem to collapse into
simultaneity when one hears the music of these two composers,
especially in performances as vital as those on two new releases: a
pairing of the ``Combattimento'' with another of Monteverdi's
compact dramas, ``Il Ballo delle Ingrate,'' from Rinaldo
Alessandrini and his Concerto Italiano (Opus 111, OPS 30-196), and
an anthology of Nono pieces covering the entire 40 years of his
creative life from Peter Hirsch and the Ensemble United Berlin
(Wergo, WER 6631).
</P>
<P>
   One of Monteverdi's discoveries in ``Il Combattimento'' was the
thrust that can come from instruments repeating a note, and that
same thrust is there in the latter part of Nono's ``Canti per
Tredici'' of 1955, a barrage of ``songs for 13 (instruments).'' Or
try listening to Nono's ``Canciones a Guiomar'' right after
Monteverdi's ``Ballo delle Ingrate'': There is the same tone of
magnificent lament, achieved in much the same way, by a slow
soprano soaring alone, just touching her accompaniment, which in
the Monteverdi is scored for strings and in the Nono largely for
percussion. Or again, the two violins of Nono's late ``Hay que
caminar'' Sonando speak a language of intimate feeling in sound
that Monteverdi's violins in ``Il Combattimento'' are also
enunciating.
</P>
<P>
   Writing of the fourth and earliest piece in the Nono collection,
``Polifonia _ Monodia _ Ritmica,'' Hirsch offers the apt image of
``a song as if over the clatter of weapons.'' He might be
describing Monteverdi's battle piece. ``Il Combattimento'' is a
miniature opera of the horse-to-horse and hand-to-hand fight
between two characters in Tasso's epic ``Jerusalem Freed'':
Tancredi, a Christian knight, and Clorinda, an infidel whom
Tancredi finds, in his moment of victory, to be a woman in armor.
Their duel has been, all along, a metaphor of sexual conquest
(though this may be small comfort to them), and it has been
followed all along by an anonymous narrator passionately describing
the challenge, the clash of arms, the breathless pause, the
culminating stroke and the final death.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of difficult love _ love pulled taut by war,
expressed in music pulled taut by the constraints of a new creative
language _ was Nono's also. And for both composers, the expression
of that love is the more startling for being pure, unsentimental.
It asks, in the music of both, for a similar pure intensity in
performance, and its demands here are met. Angelika Luz, in
``Canciones a Guiomar,'' and Elisa Franzetti, as Clorinda and the
spokeswoman for the ungrateful ladies of ``Il Ballo,'' sing with
minimal vibrato and maximal keenness. They venture forth with
complete confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Singing of love in a time of artistic and armed revolution, Nono
found himself in the position of the narrator of ``Il
Combattimento,'' required to bear witness. Both are war
correspondents of the emotions, and their uneasy position outside
the action they describe can be justified only by the closest
possible attention.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Abbondanza, as Monteverdi's narrator, conveys that
attention, and he is ably supported in his extreme tempos and
sudden shifts by Alessandrini's instrumental ensemble. This is an
exciting account of an exciting piece. ``Il Ballo delle Ingrate'' _
an ironic court entertainment, written for a marriage and showing
the luckless fate in hell of love-spurning ladies _ is less
continuously gripping, but equally well done.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nono's attention, Hirsch and his team speak loudly for
it. There have been a lot of Nono releases since the composer's
death in 1990. This is one of the best.

CAMBODIA'S LEADER SAYS TOP KHMER ROUGE DEFECTORS WILL BE SPARED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (repeating for all needing)  (rl) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Defying international pressure to put top
leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial, Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Monday that they should be welcomed ``with bouquets of flowers, not
with prisons and handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing to greet two of the last Khmer Rouge holdouts _ Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea _ at his home on Tuesday, Hun Sen said a
trial would reopen old wounds and possibly lead to instability.
Both men, who defected on Saturday, were at the very top of the
Khmer Rouge hierarchy from 1975 to 1979, when the group ruled the
country and more than a million people were executed or died of
starvation, disease and overwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look ahead to the
21st century with a clean slate,'' Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the last of the movement's leaders to give up the
struggle, and Hun Sen did not rule out a future Khmer Rouge trial,
saying it was an issue for the judiciary _ which he controls _
rather than the executive branch to decide.
</P>
<P>
   The defections of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea leave only one
major figure at large, Ta Mok, known as ``the Butcher,'' who seems
to be as unpopular among his comrades as he is among his enemies.
Hun Sen said Monday that he would extend no welcome to Ta Mok.
</P>
<P>
   The main Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died in April. If the last
two defectors, along with earlier ones like the former Khmer Rouge
foreign minister, Ieng Sary, are not brought to trial, Ta Mok _ if
he is captured _ could be the sole Khmer Rouge figure to be held
accountable for the deaths and misery the movement caused.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's remarks Monday were not the way he has talked in the
past. In June 1997 he signed a letter requesting help from the
United Nations in preparing for a trial for Khmer Rouge leaders on
charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   In a weekend interview, Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N. official who
monitors human rights in Cambodia, said Hun Sen had repeatedly
assured him that he planned to proceed with a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I agree completely that there must be justice,' ''
Hammarberg said. `` `I promise you that no one will be spared.' He
told me this several times.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of struggle against political opponents, it is only
in the last two months that Hun Sen has achieved full control of
Cambodia's government. His stance Monday seemed to reflect a desire
to avoid a situation that could get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his words echoed a feeling among many Cambodians
who are exhausted from decades of conflict and prefer not to stir
up the demons of their past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a wound does not hurt, you should not poke at it with a
stick to make it bleed,'' Hun Sen said. ``If we put these two men
in prison, will this benefit society or lead to civil war?''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment clashes with a contrary feeling among many
foreigners _ and many Cambodians as well _ that a wound cannot heal
until it is treated, even if the cure is painful.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers say a ``culture of impunity,'' with its
roots in the unresolved cases of Khmer Rouge leaders, is to blame
for much of the country's lawlessness and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said in
Washington that after a trial Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea could be
pardoned in the interest of national reconciliation if that is what
Cambodians choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to allow these men to return to society as if one of the
worst massacres of the 20th century never took place _ that's
unthinkable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, experts are preparing an outline of
charges and legal procedures that could be used if a tribunal is
created. One possibility would be to create a special court in a
third country, like those trying people charged with committing
genocide and other crimes in Rwanda and Yugoslavia. Another would
be for Cambodia to set up its own special court with international
help.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen brushed aside all outside advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cambodia we know how to heal ourselves using our own
medicines,'' he said. ``If we try mixing in foreign medicine it
will not cure Cambodian diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The interests of the nation and the people do not
require a trial or conflicts among ourselves, but national
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers here largely support this stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambodia should discard sentiments of vengeance,'' said the
daily Rasmei Angkor. ``Even if we killed Khieu Samphan and Nuon
Chea, the lives of those who died would not be returned to us. The
best thing now is for all Cambodians to come together and love each
other so we can find real peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Noun Chea, 71, who was ``Brother Number Two'' under Pol Pot, and
Khieu Samphan, 67, who was the official head of state, joined a
community of defectors in the remote town of Pailin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Both had spent most of their lives as revolutionaries, alongside
Pol Pot. Khieu Samphan, the public face of the movement, returned
to Phnom Penh once before, in 1991, and was attacked by a mob
organized by Hun Sen's government. Nuon Chea was the man whose idea
of creating a primitive agrarian society led to the forced
evacuation of the cities and the massacres of the country's
educated classes.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of former Khmer Rouge leaders are now nominally
within government control in Pailin and elsewhere and are available
for capture and trial, after more than two years of defections.
</P>
<P>
   But Hun Sen said the two latest defectors should be greeted with
an embrace for giving up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not come tomorrow with the political and military
agenda of the Khmer Rouge,'' he said. ``They will come as simple
citizens, bringing their wives and children and grandchildren.
There's nothing for anyone to worry about.''

   WASHINGTON _ The State Department said on Monday it hoped that
the ``apparent surrender'' of two former Khmer Rouge to the
Cambodian government would lead to some form of justice.
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by the department said the United States
would work to try to ensure that there would be ``accountability
for Nuon Chea and Kheiu Samphan, as well as for the other, most
senior, Khmer Rouge leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust that no actions will be taken by any party that could
preclude achieving this goal,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia forswore vengeance against
the two men Monday, saying he would welcome them at a meeting in
his home on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In April, only days before the death of Pol Pot, the senior
leader of the Khmer Rouge, the United States began trying to plan
to capture him and his associates. After his death, the United
States asked the U.N. Security Council to set up a tribunal to try
surviving Khmer Rouge leaders on charges of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a panel appointed by U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan traveled to Cambodia to research how best to create such a
tribunal. Its report is expected next month.

YOUNGER GOTTI REJECTS PLEA BARGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John A. Gotti, the man accused of being the powerful
acting boss of the Gambino crime family, heeded the advice of his
imprisoned father and rejected a plea bargain Monday that would
have sent him to prison for up to eight years, close associates of
Gotti said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations collapsed after months of intensive bargaining with
federal prosecutors, defense lawyers said. ``There is no deal,''
Gerald Shargel, a lawyer for Gotti, said Monday. ``Negotiations are
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends of Gotti, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said his decision was heavily influenced by his father,
John J. Gotti, who is serving a life prison term without the
possibility of parole after being convicted in 1991 on charges of
being the Gambino family boss.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's associates said the son's lawyers recently met with the
elder Gotti at the federal penitentiary in Springfield, Mo., and
that the former Gambino boss advised his son to turn down the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Shargel said he notified government lawyers Monday afternoon
that the younger Gotti would not accept what prosecutors said was a
final proposal for a reduced sentence in return for a guilty plea
to reduced charges: six and a half to eight years in prison and a
$1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   And while it is still possible that the government could make
another offer, Shargel said it seemed unlikely. ``As far as I am
concerned, and apparently as far as the government is concerned,
the negotiations are over and this case will be tried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By standing trial in a broad racketeering case, Gotti, 34, will
face a possible prison sentence of 20 years and confiscation of
about $10 million of his assets if he is convicted. Prosecutors
contend that the assets, including two luxury homes on Long Island,
real estate in Queens and $358,000 in cash that was seized from a
safe, were obtained with profits from criminal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's rejection of the deal also means that seven
co-defendants, including three men whom prosecutors identified as
high-ranking capos, or heads of Gambino family units known as
crews, will go on trial. Lawyers and law enforcement officials said
those defendants had been prepared to plead guilty to lesser
charges, but those deals fell apart when Gotti rejected the offer
made to him.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had insisted that all eight defendants accept what
was termed a global agreement under which they would all plead
guilty to racketeering allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the officials said, such a deal was almost completed
over the weekend. One defendant, John D'Amico, 64, who
investigators say is a Gambino capo, was scheduled to plead guilty
Monday in U.S. District Court in White Plains, N.Y., but the
hearing was canceled when Gotti turned down the deal offered to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney
for the Southern District of New York, whose office is prosecuting
Gotti, declined to comment Monday on the breakdown in bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Ms. White's office had refused to
consider individual pleas from Gotti's co-defendants because doing
so would have undercut the evidence against Gotti, the lead
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Gotti said his trial lawyers, Shargel and Bruce
Cutler, recently reviewed the government's final plea terms with
the elder Gotti, who is recovering from throat cancer surgery in a
prison hospital. According to the associates, Gotti, 58, told the
lawyers to inform his son that he opposed the deal and believed his
son would be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler and Shargel declined to comment on their discussions with
the elder Gotti. ``All I can say,'' Cutler said, ``is that the son
wants to fight the case and clear his name, and the father believes
he will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Another defense lawyer, James LaRossa, said plea deals for the
other seven defendants had collapsed. ``There will be a trial,''
said LaRossa, who is representing Gregory DePalma, 66. Prosecutors
have identified DePalma as an acting Gambino capo.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Gotti was indicted in January on charges that he had
led an organized-crime enterprise that had engaged in extortion,
illegal gambling, loan sharking and labor racketeering. Most of the
original 23 defendants in the case have pleaded guilty to reduced
charges.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the defense team said most of the remaining
eight defendants had agreed to deals after reviewing the evidence
implicating them, including 7,000 electronically intercepted
conversations. The evidence against Gotti, prosecutors said,
includes testimony by one Mafia defector and taped conversations in
which his co-defendants talked about his role in extorting more
than $1 million from Scores, a strip club in Manhattan, and of
turning over to him $50,000 in protection payments from a
construction company.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state experts on organized crime said the proposed
deal would have been a significant victory in a long campaign by
the FBI and prosecutors to undermine the Gambino family, which
until the early 1990s was the nation's most influential Mafia
group.
</P>
<P>
   And imprisoning the younger Gotti, the experts said, would have
sent a far-reaching message: All Mafia leaders are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   It would also have weakened the influence of the Gottis in the
Gambino family, law enforcement officials said. Investigators
contend that the son has been safeguarding his father's financial
interests and trying to insure that a share of the crime group's
profits is funneled to the Gottis. He is under house arrest in
Oyster Bay on Long Island and free on $10 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   Although the younger Gotti had the title of acting boss bestowed
on him by his father and was a ranking leader in the family,
investigators said, he looked out mainly for his own and his
father's financial interests. And, until recently, the
investigators said, a three-man committee was responsible for most
of the family's day-to-day activities and its links to the New York
metropolitan region's four other mob families.
</P>
<P>
   The convictions of the elder Gotti and other high-ranking
Gambino leaders in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to the
Gambino family's being supplanted by the Genovese crime group as
the nation's largest and most potent Mafia faction. Both groups use
the New York area as their base of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the Gambino family is far from finished, with
an estimated 150 inducted or sworn members and extensive profits
from illegal gambling, loan sharking and labor racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   If he had accepted a plea deal, Gotti would have spared the
government a long, complex trial and the nagging possibility of an
acquittal because of several questionable prosecution witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who have studied the evidence said the prosecution's
pivotal witnesses would confront fierce cross-examination and would
have to admit that they had agreed to testify against Gotti only
after making deals to avoid harsh sentences for violent crimes and
multimillion-dollar frauds.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to begin in February in White Plains. But
Shargel said Monday that he would ask for a delay because of his
involvement in another trial that is under way.

CAMBODIA'S LEADER SAYS TOP KHMER ROUGE DEFECTORS WILL BE SPARED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Adds background about Hun Sen, comment from opposition
party) (rl) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Defying international pressure to put top
leaders of the Khmer Rouge on trial, Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Monday that they should be welcomed ``with bouquets of flowers, not
with prisons and handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing to greet two of the last Khmer Rouge holdouts _ Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea _ at his home on Tuesday, Hun Sen said a
trial would reopen old wounds and possibly lead to instability.
Both men, who defected on Saturday, were at the very top of the
Khmer Rouge hierarchy from 1975 to 1979, when the group ruled the
country and more than a million people were executed or died of
starvation, disease and overwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should dig a hole and bury the past and look ahead to the
21st century with a clean slate,'' Hun Sen said.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the last of the movement's leaders to give up the
struggle, and Hun Sen did not rule out a future Khmer Rouge trial,
saying it was an issue for the judiciary _ which he controls _
rather than the executive branch to decide. Hun Sen himself, a
former Khmer Rouge commander, broke with the movement in the 1970s.
Historians have said there is little evidence that he was directly
involved in the mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   The defections of Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea leave only one
major figure at large, Ta Mok, known as ``the Butcher,'' who seems
to be as unpopular among his comrades as he is among his enemies.
Hun Sen said Monday that he would extend no welcome to Ta Mok.
</P>
<P>
   The main Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, died in April. If the last
two defectors, along with earlier ones like the former Khmer Rouge
foreign minister, Ieng Sary, are not brought to trial, Ta Mok _ if
he is captured _ could be the sole Khmer Rouge figure to be held
accountable for the deaths and misery the movement caused.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen's remarks Monday were not the way he has talked in the
past. In June 1997 he signed a letter requesting help from the
United Nations in preparing for a trial for Khmer Rouge leaders on
charges of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   In a weekend interview, Thomas Hammarberg, the U.N. official who
monitors human rights in Cambodia, said Hun Sen had repeatedly
assured him that he planned to proceed with a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I agree completely that there must be justice,' ''
Hammarberg said. `` `I promise you that no one will be spared.' He
told me this several times.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of struggle against political opponents, it is only
in the last two months that Hun Sen has achieved full control of
Cambodia's government. His stance Monday seemed to reflect a desire
to avoid a situation that could get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, his words echoed a feeling among many Cambodians
who are exhausted from decades of conflict and prefer not to stir
up the demons of their past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a wound does not hurt, you should not poke at it with a
stick to make it bleed,'' Hun Sen said. ``If we put these two men
in prison, will this benefit society or lead to civil war?''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment clashes with a contrary feeling among many
foreigners _ and many Cambodians as well _ that a wound cannot heal
until it is treated, even if the cure is painful.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights workers say a ``culture of impunity,'' with its
roots in the unresolved cases of Khmer Rouge leaders, is to blame
for much of the country's lawlessness and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Jones, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said in
Washington that after a trial Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea could be
pardoned in the interest of national reconciliation if that is what
Cambodians choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``But to allow these men to return to society as if one of the
worst massacres of the 20th century never took place _ that's
unthinkable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, experts are preparing an outline of
charges and legal procedures that could be used if a tribunal is
created. One possibility would be to create a special court in a
third country, like those trying people charged with committing
genocide and other crimes in Rwanda and Yugoslavia. Another would
be for Cambodia to set up its own special court with international
help.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen brushed aside all outside advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cambodia we know how to heal ourselves using our own
medicines,'' he said. ``If we try mixing in foreign medicine it
will not cure Cambodian diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The interests of the nation and the people do not
require a trial or conflicts among ourselves, but national
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers here, which are generally obedient to Hun Sen,
largely support this stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambodia should discard sentiments of vengeance,'' said the
Cambodian-language daily Rasmei Angkor. ``Even if we killed Khieu
Samphan and Nuon Chea, the lives of those who died would not be
returned to us. The best thing now is for all Cambodians to come
together and love each other so we can find real peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party led by Sam Rainsy expressed a contrary
view. ``We believe that the evidence is sufficient to hold them in
custody, according to national and international law, pending a
trial for crimes against humanity,'' a party statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Noun Chea, 71, who was ``Brother Number Two'' under Pol Pot, and
Khieu Samphan, 67, who was the official head of state, joined a
community of defectors in the remote town of Pailin on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Both had spent most of their lives as revolutionaries, alongside
Pol Pot. Khieu Samphan, the public face of the movement, returned
to Phnom Penh once before, in 1991, and was attacked by a mob
organized by Hun Sen's government. Nuon Chea was the man whose idea
of creating a primitive agrarian society led to the forced
evacuation of the cities and the massacres of the country's
educated classes.
</P>
<P>
   A large number of former Khmer Rouge leaders are now nominally
within government control in Pailin and elsewhere and are available
for capture and trial, after more than two years of defections.
</P>
<P>
   But Hun Sen said the two latest defectors should be greeted with
an embrace for giving up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not come tomorrow with the political and military
agenda of the Khmer Rouge,'' he said. ``They will come as simple
citizens, bringing their wives and children and grandchildren.
There's nothing for anyone to worry about.''

RAP STAR ARRESTED FOR HAVING A CAR IN HIS CAR
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Long Island-based rap musician known for his
colorful antics was arrested Sunday night in Manhattan and charged
with criminal possession of a weapon after the police said they
found a loaded, unregistered .45-caliber pistol in his 1995
Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   The musician, Trevor Smith, who goes by the stage name Busta
Rhymes, faces up to seven years in jail if he is convicted of the
weapons charge. His arrest comes a week after his new album made
its debut at No. 13 on Billboard magazine's top-100 sales list.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 26, whose frenetic stage persona and cartoonish costumes
set him apart from ``gangsta'' rap musicians who have been
criticized for promoting violence, was stopped by the police on the
West Side Highway near 18th Street. Gerald Odom, 25, Smith's road
manager, was riding in the musician's car at the time. Neither man
has a criminal record, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling Smith over for changing lanes three times without
signaling, Officer Anthony Curtin looked in the back seat of
Smith's car, prosecutors said. Using a flashlight, he was able to
see a gun sitting in an open bag, they said. Odom was searched and
found to be carrying a small bag of marijuana, the police said. He
was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana and criminal
possession of a weapon, the .45-caliber pistol.
</P>
<P>
   The rap musician, the son of West Indian immigrants who moved to
Long Island from Brooklyn in the early 1980s, told Curtin, `` `I
got robbed twice _ that's why I have the gun,' '' prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's lawyer, Robert Kalima, would not comment on the
specifics of the case but said the rap musician was innocent. ``We
are investigating what occurred,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The arraignment of Smith, who has a part in ``The Rugrats
Movie'' and is scheduled to be host of Black Entertainment
Television's countdown of best videos of the year on New Year's
Day, caused a brief stir in the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building
on Monday. While court officers scratched their heads and struggled
to pronounce Smith's stage name, some younger female court
employees seemed to stir with excitement at the thought of seeing
him.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving assurances that Smith would appear in court
again, Judge Thomas Farber released both men on their own
recognizance and ordered them to return on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had anything to say as he left the courtroom, Smith
grinned and said, ``Peace now.''

 Bank Stock Believer  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stead has two traits rare among mutual fund managers:
the shrewdness to sense when stocks could fall and the bluntness to
say so.
</P>
<P>
   Stead manages SIFE Trust Fund, the 37-year-old Walnut Creek fund
that specializes in bank stocks. Six months ago, when bank shares
were near the end of a three-year run that had seen some stocks
triple in value, he Stead  &LR; sounded the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Bloomberg News in June, Stead warned that
global financial turmoil threatened to trigger an across-the-board
plunge in equities that could hit bank stocks especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what happened. From the end of July to the middle
of October, as economic collapse in Asia and Russia spilled over
into U.S. markets, major bank stock indexes lost more than a
quarter of their value, significantly worse than the fall in the
broader U.S. stocks indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Stead's fund didn't escape the mayhem. It dropped about 23
percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, bank stocks have climbed back as investors' fears
about global financial panic receded. That's helped SIFE regain
more than half the ground it lost.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stead says, bank stocks could continue to gain.
</P>
<P>
   The British-born fund manager still casts a skeptical eye on the
stock market as a whole. The global economy remains shaky, Stead
stressed in a recent interview. Problems around the world are
likely to take a toll on the profits of U.S. companies, he
believes.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the recent rebound from the steep drop, some
banks still represent decent values, he said. With interest rates
at low levels and exposure to global problems limited, bank
earnings should grow in the high single digits in 1999, Stead
he &LR; predicted, far above profit growth projected for the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to be invested, you want to be over-weighted in
the financial sector,'' he said. ``There are still some good buys
available.
</P>
<P>
   Stead said the fall in bank stocks ``was absolutely necessary.''
But, he added, ``as time goes by, investors will come to realize
that the sell-off was overdone.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks that the bank merger juggernaut will continue,
boosting share prices as institutions look to cut costs and build
sprawling networks.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a roller-coaster market for bank stocks, SIFE's total
return for the first 11 months of 1998 was positive, though barely
so. The fund eked out a 0.25 percent return when dividends and
capital gains are added in. That's a big comedown from the heady
annual returns of 27.7 percent or more from 1995 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some 40 mutual funds specialize in financial stocks, according
to Morningstar, the Chicago company that tracks funds. So far this
year, they have gained 4.40 percent, less than the average 7.38
percent rise of all stock mutual funds and way below the 24.12
percent rise in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   But, over a longer period, financial funds have excelled. In
recent years, as banks benefited from a healthy economy, low
interest rates and improved efficiency in their own operations,
their stocks soared.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, the average annual 24.86 jump in
financial sector funds handily beat the average 11.07 rise of all
mutual funds and nearly matched the increase rise &LR; in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   With a little more than $1 billion in assets, SIFE is now a big
player in the bank stock market, though it's still dwarfed by
mutual funds operated by groups such as Fidelity Investments and
John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Stead, who is in his mid-40s, joined SIFE in 1995 after a
17-year career as a banker with Citibank and Bank of America in
Latin America and Asia. SIFE's manager picks stocks with the help
of Scott Edgar, his research director, and analyst/ trader Laurie
Buntain.
</P>
<P>
   Working out of a low-slung brick building in a Walnut Creek
office park, the three look for banks that are both profitable and
safe _ meaning they provide a 15 percent return on equity and have
plenty of funds set aside to cover potential loan problems.
</P>
<P>
   Using those criteria, Stead and his team have put together a
list of 100 banks they would like to own. Then they look at price.
Of the 100, about 42 are trading below their real value based on
earnings potential.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest positions in SIFE's portfolio are giant regional
banks focused on consumers plus small- and medium-size businesses.
His favorites include Fleet Financial Group, which operates in New
England and the Northeast; and North Carolina's Wachovia Corp.,
based in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Other big holdings include Bank of New York Corp. and State
Street Corp., both of which occupy specialty niches as fund
custodians and administrators for other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Of the giant New York banks with extensive foreign operations,
Chase Manhattan Corp. is the only institution in which SIFE
maintains a big position. Chase, Stead said, is more in the
regional than money-center banking mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservative and cautious is what we want,'' Stead said.
</P>
<P>
   While Stead believes bank stocks still have a little more
mileage in them, he's quick to acknowledge their vulnerability to
the business cycle. Sometime in the not too distant future, he
warned, the economy will slow, causing loans to go sour and making
revenue hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   When times are good, bankers claim they've got all potential
risks under control. Stead thinks that's nonsense, and he points to
the loans some banks made to speculative investment funds or to
borrowers in such trouble spots as Russia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stead: ``Time and again, there are those who try to
convince others, `This time, it's different.' Well, it's never
different.''

 Scholarships May Be Taxable  &HT;       
 By Arthur M. Louis  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; QUESTION: &LR;  I recently completed graduate school. I was fortunate
enough to receive scholarships and grants this year totaling more
than $15,000. I've been told that I might owe taxes on some of the
money. Please say it isn't so. But if it is, what is taxable and
what isn't?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANSWER: &LR;  Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller says
you won't be taxed as long as you were a candidate for a degree and
all the money you received was used strictly to pay tuition, fees
and other required school expenses. That includes money spent on
books, supplies and equipment necessary to complete your course of
study.
</P>
<P>
   Any money used to pay what the IRS considers ``incidental''
expenses is taxable. That includes room and board _ even in a
university-operated dormitory. It also includes travel expenses
between home and school.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if you got any money with a quid pro quo attached _
for example, a stipulation that you perform research or laboratory
work in the future _ that money is taxable.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a Late Start
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am 57 years old and live from paycheck to paycheck. Aside
from an investment fund in which my employer sets aside $480 per
year for my retirement, I have no investments, assets, savings or
anything. Is it too late for me to think about accumulating the
money I'll need for retirement?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: It's not too late _ but at this point you can't expect
spectacular results. You indicate that you have trouble saving
money _ but to build a substantial retirement fund you must save as
much as you can as early as you can. Age 57 is not the ideal time
to start.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco financial planner Norm Boone suggests that you
continue working beyond age 65 _ even beyond 75, if you are up to
it. The longer you wait for Social Security, the larger your
monthly payments will be. In the meantime you will continue to
receive a salary that might allow you to build other sources of
retirement income.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you ought to divert some of your salary to a Roth
Individual Retirement Account, which you can set up at a bank or
other financial institution. You can contribute up to $2,000 a year
to a Roth, and any money you earn from your investments will be
tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ask your employer to increase his retirement
contributions. It's nice that he has a retirement fund _ many
companies don't _ but the $480 a year he sets aside for you each
year is peanuts. If he won't increase the payments, perhaps he will
let you contribute part of your paycheck to a tax-deferred savings
account. It won't hurt to ask.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Savings
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am self-employed. I would like to set up a Medical Savings
Account to help cover medical expenses for myself and my family. My
broker said they don't offer this kind of account. Can you tell me
how to proceed?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can set up a Medical Savings Account through Merrill
Lynch _ to name just one broker _ or through an insurance company.
Ask an insurance agent to find a provider for you. Or, if you would
rather deal directly with an insurer, you might want to check out
the offerings of Medical Savings Insurance Co., of Indianapolis,
which appears to be the leading MSA vendor in California. Its
toll-free telephone number is (888) 696-9663.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Savings Accounts, created by Congress in 1996, are a
great deal for consumers. They allow self-employed individuals or
employees of small companies _ those with fewer than 50 workers _
to set aside tax-exempt funds to pay medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for an MSA, you must be covered by high-deductible
health insurance. Congress specified high-deductible insurance
because it wanted to encourage small businesses to start these
programs. High-deductible insurance costs less than low-deductible
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   As of January 1, the minimum deductible that qualifies for the
MSA program will be $1,550 per year for single individuals and
$3,050 for families. The maximum amount a family may deposit in a
MSA each year is 75 percent of the amount of the deductible. For
singles, the limit is 60 percent.

<P>
   You can use the funds in your MSA to pay your deductible
expenses. Once you exceed the deductible, the insurance kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   The money you deposit in an MSA is exempt from taxes, and any
earnings in your account accumulate tax-free _ just as they do in a
Roth Individual Retirement Account. You can invest the money in
stocks, mutual funds, bonds, money-market funds _ whatever suits
you.
</P>
<P>
   Another neat feature, if you are self-employed, is that you can
deduct a portion of the premiums you pay for health insurance. For
the 1998 tax year, the deduction is 45 percent, and for 1999 it
rises to 60 percent. This deduction is not available to members of
group MSA plans.
</P>
<P>
   There is no time limit for using the money in your MSA. If you
are lucky enough to enjoy good health, the money can remain in your
account year after year.
</P>
<P>
   If you wish, you may withdraw funds to pay nonmedical expenses.
However, you must pay taxes on these withdrawals at your regular
tax rate. If you are less than 65 years old, you also must pay a 15
percent penalty.

 Farmers Cautiously Optimistic About Orange Crop  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
As temperatures rose yesterday, California's Central Valley orange
growers were in a sunnier mood after initial inspections showed
that last week's big chill may have spared more of their crop than
they first feared.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of catastrophic losses, farmers were cautiously
optimistic that they might be able to salvage 50 percent or more of
their crops. That could be good news in the long run for consumers,
who nevertheless face a short-term spike in orange prices at the
supermarket as soon as today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think consumers still can expect to pay prices ranging from
$1.50 to $2 a pound,'' said Grant Hunt, president of Grant J. Hunt
Co., an Oakland fruit and vegetable broker. Preliminary estimates
have pegged damage at $591 million &UR;  &LR; from the winter freeze that
plunged temperatures into the mid-20s for four consecutive nights.
</P>
<P>
   Citrus farmers in the hardest-hit counties _ Kern, Tulare and
Fresno _ estimated that the freeze damaged 50 to 70 percent of
their navel oranges. In some cases, farmers suffered total losses.
</P>
<P>
   Growers in those counties know they already have lost 100
percent of their lemon crop. But that has not had an impact on
lemon prices because the majority of the state's lemon crop is
grown in Southern California, which was not as hard hit as the
Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   As orange growers cut into sample oranges this weekend, they
found that more fruit had survived with little or no damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I`m hearing more optimism from growers I know who say 50 to 70
percent of the crop is good,'' said Nick Hill, general manager of
the family owned Green Leaf Farms east of Fresno. ``They're opening
up the fruit and not seeing as much internal damage as they thought
there was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill was only ``cautiously optimistic'' that a large portion of
his own 1,000 acres of oranges were fine.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Brown, whose family's farm in Orange Cove in Tulare County
did not fully recover from the freeze of 1990 until this year, also
was hopeful that he lost only half his crop, but he won't know for
another three or four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just really hard to tell,'' Brown said. ``We're trying to
see how we can minimize the loss. I'm hopeful we don't have a full
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   On the wholesale market, orange packers were asking 60 to 70
percent more for oranges harvested before the freeze, said Hunt,
who also is chairman of the Produce Marketing Association, an
international trade association for fresh-produce and floral
producers, distributors and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale buyers balked at yesterday's prices of $22 a box, or
38 pounds, for small oranges, and $31 per box for larger oranges.
That could cause prices to subside by 20 percent by the end of the
week; however, without knowing the extent of crop damage, Hunt
said, ``it's still too early to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some supermarkets, which had sales as low as 33 cents
per pound for oranges, may hike retail prices as soon as today.
Chains such Safeway, Lucky's and Albertsons had no immediate
comment on how the freeze would affect retail citrus prices.
</P>
<P>
   Steve DelMasso, vice president of Bay Cities Produce Co. in
Oakland's produce market, said the price of juice oranges from
Texas rose about 30 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you'll see the retail effect to (consumers)
until maybe Thursday or Friday,'' he said. ``And they don't need to
buy an orange. Maybe they'll buy an apple.''
</P>
<P>
   He also cautioned that farmers and packers in coming weeks will
be under pressure to sell as many oranges as they can, so consumers
can expect dry or poor quality oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Roth, president of Cecelia Packing Corp. in Orange Cove,
said that despite the optimism, freeze damage will cut severly into
the $12 million to $15 million in revenue that had been expected
from this year's orange crop, which normally would be packed
through summer. Roth said he expects to lay off 100 of the 116
plant employees until the next orange harvest starts in October
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will have a snowball effect'' on the local economy, Roth
said. ``That payroll runs close to a million and a half dollars a
year.''

EASTERN MASSACHUSETTS MAY GET FOUR NEW AREA CODES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Less than a year after consumers endured the cost and
confusion of adding two new area codes in eastern Massachusetts,
state officials are now laying the groundwork for adding four more.
</P>
<P>
   Officials confirmed Monday that hearings will begin next month
on the best way to increase the number of area codes in eastern
Massachusetts from four to eight. The area-code expansion could
take place in a little over a year.
</P>
<P>
   The officials portrayed the planning process as a safeguard in
case efforts to conserve phone numbers and avoid the need for new
codes are not sufficient, but other sources familiar with the
process say the odds are strong that new area codes will be needed
by the end of 1999 or early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over how the new area codes should be created is
likely to be even more controversial than it was with the 781 and
978 codes. The problem is particularly acute in Boston, since
carving a new area code out of 617 would probably require the city
to be split between two different area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Besser, head of the state Department of Telecommunicatons
and Energy, said she is still hopeful that conservation measures
and new technologies will significantly delay the need for new area
codes. But she said it was prudent to lay the groundwork now so
that if the conservation measures fail to work the state is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be prepared. We don't want to be scrambling late
next year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two other sources said the conservation picture is bleaker than
Besser is admitting and the likelihood that the new area codes will
be needed is strong. The sources said the Federal Communications
Commission has limited what states can do to ease the phone number
crunch and technological solutions to the problem are still only
theoretical.
</P>
<P>
   The number crunch is not easy to understand. There is strong
consumer demand for second phone lines, faxes, pagers, and cellular
phones, but not enough to exhaust the supply of numbers in the
existing area codes.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is the way phone numbers are distributed to
companies competing in the local phone market. A company needs at
least one exchange code _ the first three digits of a seven-digit
phone number _ in each rate center in which it is competing. A rate
center is the geographic area on which rates are based.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers are released in blocks of 10,000. So a company wishing
to compete in each of the 202 rate centers in eastern Massachusetts
would draw more than 2 million numbers, even if it needed only a
couple hundred.
</P>
<P>
   The system of distributing numbers originated when AT&AMP;T was the
only phone company in existence and could parcel out numbers to
consumers as needed. Now that there are hundreds of
telecommunication companies competing for customers, numbers are
being gobbled up in a wasteful manner. The system is in overload.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' dilemma is not unique. California has more than
20 area codes and nearly all of them are in jeopardy of running out
of numbers. Over the last five years, 82 new area codes have been
added nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not using numbers as efficiently as we should, but it's
really nobody's fault,'' said James Deak, the Lockheed Martin IMS
official in charge of area code relief planning for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   All four eastern Massachusetts area codes _ 617, 781, 508 and
978 _ have been declared in jeopardy of running out of numbers, and
rationing of numbers has been in place since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Besser said she wanted her agency to investigate ways
to conserve numbers and issue corrective orders by midsummer. But
the problem has proven more difficult than she initially thought,
both because the agency lacks the resources and expertise to
evaluate conservation measures and because the FCC is trying to
address the problem on a national level.
</P>
<P>
   Besser said her agency will continue to explore number
conservation measures, particularly issuing numbers in smaller
increments and reducing the number of rate centers so companies
would need fewer numbers to compete. The problem with rate center
consolidation is that it would require a revamping of local calling
areas and a restructuring of the entire rate system for local
calls.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, next month the agency will start hearings on
how to create four additional area codes. Last year, the state
decided to split 617 and 508 to create 781 and 978. It could do
that again, thus creating eight relatively small area codes and
allowing people to continue dialing calls as they do currently.
</P>
<P>
   The other approach, and one that is slowly gaining favor around
the country, is to overlay the new area codes over the existing
ones. That would mean any new number issued would be in the new
area code but existing customers would keep their old numbers and
area codes.
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage to this approach is that consumers would have
to dial at least 10 numbers on every call and neighbors on the same
street could have phone numbers with different area codes.

MUSEUM DEFENDS ARTIFACT ACQUISITION PRACTICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, i and e coding; Vermeule is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Museum of Fine Arts, responding to a Boston Globe
report that it has acquired scores of classical antiquities in
recent years that may have been plundered from grave sites, Monday
said it exercises ``appropriate diligence'' when it acquires
artworks.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornelius C. Vermeule III, the retired curator who oversaw
most of the acquisitions, said Monday that he does not know whether
some of the objects might have been freshly looted from grave sites
when the museum acquired them.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, a former MFA director said the museum seldom
raised questions about the origin of antiquities it acquired. And
two antiquities dealers who have sold objects to the museum said
they cannot always say that objects they sell have not been
recently looted.
</P>
<P>
   With assistance from 11 archeologists, the Globe studied 71
classical artifacts the museum acquired, by donation or purchase,
between mid-1984 and mid-1987. Only 10 had a history of any prior
owner. The remaining 61 had no history at all, strong
circumstantial evidence, the scholars said, that they had recently
been looted by grave robbers, mostly in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-paragraph statement, the MFA said that when it
considers acquiring objects for its collection, the artifacts are
reviewed ``to ensure that their addition to the Museum's collection
is both legal and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the brief statement, the MFA chose not to take issue with
what the Globe reported. Asked about that late Monday, Dawn
Griffin, the MFA spokeswoman, said the museum does not agree that
it acquired the artifacts without exercising due diligence.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule, the MFA's classical curator for four decades until his
retirement in 1996, did not return telephone calls before the Globe
report. But in a brief telephone interview Monday, Vermeule said
the MFA ``tried to do due diligence'' before acquiring artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it was possible that some of the 61 undocumented
artifacts might have been freshly looted, Vermeule replied, ``I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermeule took issue with MFA director Malcolm Rogers for
consistently refusing to discuss the acquisitions, even though his
predecessor, Alan Shestack, acknowledged in an interview last week
that the MFA had been less than rigorous in ensuring that artifacts
it acquired were not recently plundered. Shestack was director from
1987 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum and Malcolm Rogers should talk about these things.
Otherwise it will look like we've been bounding through the
marketplace picking up everything in sight,'' Vermeule said.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported that the museum acquired the undocumented
objects after it committed itself in 1983 to observe international
standards designed to slow the plunder of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Bondioli Osio, the president of Italy's Interministerial
Commission for the Recovery of Art, expressed frustration Monday at
cases like that involving the MFA, saying his government cannot
mount a successful legal claim without having evidence of where and
when an artifact was looted.
</P>
<P>
   As one way to minimize the demand for looted artifacts, Italy
recently began making year-long loans to US museums of classical
antiquities that are much more important and valuable than most
museums could afford to purchase, according to Bondioli Osio.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA now faces a likely lawsuit from the government of
Guatemala, seeking the return of a collection of pre-Columbian
artifacts the MFA acquired in 1988. The museum's lawyer has
acknowledged that he knew the objects were illegally exported from
Guatemala. But the MFA has insisted that they were legally imported
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe also reported that Turkey's government is pressing for
the return of the top half of a ``Weary Herakles'' statue whose
bottom half is in a Turkish museum in Antalya.
</P>
<P>
   Murray C. McClellan, a Boston University classical archeologist,
said he views the fact that the MFA did not take issue with the
Globe's story as an indication that the museum might take greater
precautions in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we'll see whether they really do exercise due diligence,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said the potential lawsuits, by Turkey and Guatemala,
would amount to a tragic waste of resources. But given the museum's
statement, he said, ``I would be shocked if they would make a major
blunder, like Guatemala or the Herakles, again.''

 California to Rule On Kaiser's Viagra Policy  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The State Department of Corporations will announce by the end of
the week whether the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan can exclude
Viagra and other sexual dysfunction remedies from the list of drugs
it normally covers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will be closely watched by six other California
health insurers that have similar applications pending. Like many
insurers nationwide, they fear that Viagra and other so-called
lifestyle-enhancing drugs will add millions in new expenses at a
time when the whole system is under pressure to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
   In what amounts to the bureaucratic equivalent of a tease,
Corporations Commissioner Dale E. Bonner said yesterday he has made
up his mind on the issue, but was keeping his counsel for the next
few days while he makes sure his reasoning is defensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This department has never allowed a (health) plan to exclude
coverage for a prescription drug that is deemed medically
necessary,'' Bonner said. ``On the other hand, we have to look at
the reality we live in, with wonder drug after wonder drug coming
onto the market, creating a lot of concern for the health plans and
for the enrollees, who expect a cure for everything they get.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's tantalizing comments came during an interview on a more
mundane but related issue.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, he announced that the Department of Corporations had
ended an investigation into whether Kaiser management had pressured
its doctors not to prescribe Viagra between April, when the drug
came on the market, and September, when Kaiser agreed to put it on
the list of drugs it routinely pays for.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser admitted no wrongdoing but agreed to pay the state
$250,000 to cover the cost of the investigation. Kaiser also agreed
to notify any members who had to pay for their Viagra prescriptions
during the five-month period in question that they can ask the
health plan to consider reimbursing them for the pills, which cost
about $64 for an eight-pill monthly dose.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time in the past or in the future will the health plan
interfere with doctors' discretion to prescribe Viagra,'' Kaiser
spokesman Tom Debley said yesterday in response to the settlement
with the state.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of what Kaiser did or didn't do between April
and September clearly pales before the issue of whether insurers in
California will routinely have to pay for Viagra and similar drugs
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser was the first California health plan to ask the state for
permission to stop paying for Viagra which, it has estimated, could
add a dollar to the monthly cost of each of the 5.5 million people
it insures in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking whether the cost of these drugs should be borne
by the user or spread across the entire member base,'' said Debley.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser has put the same question to other states in which it
operates. So far, Debley said, 12 states, including Massachusetts,
Colorado and Oregon, as well as the District of Columbia, have
allowed it to stop paying for Viagra. Two states, New York and
Connecticut, have ordered it to keep paying for the potency pill.
And California and Washington are still mulling the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner, whose role as commissioner of corporations gives him the
authority to make the decision for California insurers, said he
would not be influenced by what other states have done. But a
source close to the issue said Kaiser is expecting Bonner to rule
that it must pay for Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Six other insurers have similar requests pending before the
Department of Corporations. They are: Blue Cross of California,
PacifiCare, Cigna, HealthNet, Aetna and Greater Pacific.

HELP WANTED IN THE NFL: 5 COACHES ARE FIRED
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the date: Dec. 28, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There has never been another like it in the history of the
National Football League because in a six-hour period Monday, five
head coaches lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In what is being called Bloody Monday by team executives and
coaches around the league, the dismissals were carried out for a
variety of reasons, ranging from not living up to high expectations
to failing to keep a tight rein on players.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches dismissed were Dom Capers of the Carolina Panthers,
Ray Rhodes of the Philadelphia Eagles, Dennis Erickson of the
Seattle Seahawks, Dave Wannstedt of the Chicago Bears and Ted
Marchibroda of the Baltimore Ravens. With the earlier resignations
of June Jones from the San Diego Chargers to coach at the
University of Hawaii and the opening created with the expansion
Cleveland Browns, there are seven coaching vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not include other possible firings, perhaps
Washington Redskins Coach Norv Turner among them. Bruce Coslet's
job with the Cincinnati Bengals supposedly had been in jeopardy,
but General Manager Mike Brown asked him to return Monday despite a
3-13 record. It is unlikely the Green Bay Packers Coach Mike
Holmgren will return next season. He may opt to leave for a more
lucrative _ and powerful _ combination of general manager and
coach. Holmgren could end up with the San Francisco 49ers, and if
that happens, Coach Steve Mariucci could be coaching in Cleveland
next season.
</P>
<P>
   People around the NFL were stunned by the number of dismissals
in such a short burst of time, the day after the regular season
ended except for the Jacksonville Jaguars-Pittsburgh Steelers game
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was unbelievable,'' said Ernie Accorsi, the New York
Giants' general manager. ``I've never seen anything like it. No one
has.''
</P>
<P>
   Why so many coaches? There is a theory that the quick success of
men like Bill Parcells with the New York Jets and Dan Reeves with
the Atlanta Falcons _ both having turned sorry franchises into
division winners in only two years _ has lowered the patience level
of owners. An owner thinks: If Parcells can take a 1-15 team to
12-4 in the football equivalent of the blink of an eye, why can't
my coach?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bittersweet moment,'' said the Ravens' owner, Art
Modell. ``I'm saddened by what I had to do today, but I look
forward to winning again. I didn't come from Cleveland to Baltimore
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of Parcells, Reeves and the Denver Bronocs' Mike
Shanahan _ all with total control of their respective organizations
_ means that there will probably be an increase in such dual
positions. The NFL is about copying trends, and that is the biggest
one going now.
</P>
<P>
   But there were particular factors in each of the firings.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers' Capers was coach of the year in 1996, when he led
them to a 13-5 record and National Football Conference West title.
But 7-9 and 4-12 seasons followed. He was seen as a disciplinarian
when he first got the job, but there were several major problems
that marked his tenure. Quarterback Kerry Collins was cut. This
month running back Fred Lane was benched for one game after
grabbing his crotch while celebrating a touchdown. Linebacker Kevin
Greene was suspended for a game after attacking an assistant coach,
Kevin Steele, on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The problems in Seattle and Chicago were poor drafting and not
making the most of talent. The Seahawks' Erickson went 8-8, 7-9,
8-8 and 8-8, despite the team having acquired high-priced free
agents like running back Ricky Watters, linebacker Darrin Smith,
guard Brian Habib, center Kevin Glover and punter Jeff Feagles.
Those players cost the owner, Paul Allen, some $15 million in
signing bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears' Wannstedt made several questionable personnel moves,
including signing quarterback Rick Mirer, and before this season,
the coach was stripped of much of his power.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens' Marchibroda had a strong bond with some of his
players, but much more was expected than six victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' Rhodes, coach of the year in 1995, worked with four
different general managers in four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to be truthful with yourself, I think I
have to say that I made some mistakes early on,'' said the Eagles'
owner, Jeffrey Lurie. ``I think I should have been a lot more
determined to make sure we had a very strong player personnel
department as the top priority, day one, and insisted on changes
when I bought the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets and Giants have strong contenders for head coaching
positions. The Jets' defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick, and the
Giants' defensive coordinator, John Fox, will probably be
considered by many teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns interviewed the Minnesota Vikings' offensive
coordinator, Brian Billick, Monday, and the expansion team is
expected to speak to the Bronocs' offensive coordinator, Gary
Kubiak, on Tuesday.

BRUINS STAY ON THE ROAD TO RUIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Bruins are only halfway through this four-game
swing, but so far it has all the earmarks of the road trip from
hell.
</P>
<P>
   After a less-than-stellar performance in a loss to the Islanders
Saturday night, followed by logistical nightmares during the
journey here, the Bruins' fortunes got even worse Monday night as
they were clobbered by the Capitals, 5-1, at the MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's third straight loss matched its longest losing streak
of the season (Oct. 19-24 to Phoenix, Anaheim, and New Jersey), and
it was just the third time this season that the Bruins have given
up five goals (they're 0-2-1 when they do so).
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight game, the Bruins dug themselves a hole
in the first period. In the 4-2 loss to the Islanders Saturday
night, Boston had to fight back after falling behind, 2-0. Monday
night, the hole was even deeper as the Bruins trailed, 3-0, heading
into the first intermission as Washington outshot Boston by a
whopping 18-8.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's first goal came less than half a minute into the
contest, with Peter Bondra benefiting from a fortuitous bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Michal Pivonka, down in the left corner with Jason Allison,
attempted to throw the puck out to Bondra. His pass went off Ray
Bourque before finding its mark on Bondra's stick. Bondra, off to
the right of goalie Byron Dafoe, fired a shot that went off the
netminder's shoulder, bounced up high, then glanced off Dafoe's
back before falling into the net at the 24-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals boosted the advantage to two at 11:28 on a goal by
Ken Klee. James Black set up the score with a pass to Klee at the
right point that the defenseman one-timed into the net for his
fourth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the momentum would swing Boston's way despite the
score. After fending off a superb Washington power play that
yielded five shots but no goals, the Bruins thought they had pulled
within a goal at 15:32. Anson Carter won a battle along the boards
in the neutral zone and skated the puck down the right side into
the circle. He saw Steve Heinze heading for the net so he gunned
the pass there.
</P>
<P>
   Heinze beat goalie Rick Tabaracci with a forehander inside the
right post, but a replay overturned the score, as Heinze was ruled
in the crease before the puck's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals made it 3-0 when they scored just 39 seconds after
the disallowed goal. Andrei Nikolishin, in the right corner, dished
the puck between the legs of linemate Brian Bellows to Sergei
Gonchar, who was alone in front and banged in a forehand shot at
16:11.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to find a spark, coach Pat Burns scrambled his
lines, putting Joe Thornton with Dmitri Khristich and Sergei
Samsonov. That combination resulted in a goal, with Thornton
setting up Khristich at 10:50 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich took Thornton's pass and tried a backhander that
Tabaracci stopped but couldn't contain. Khristich kept whacking
away, and on his fourth try, he finally got it underneath the
goalie and across the line for Boston's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   But less than four minutes later, the Capitals made it a
three-goal lead again, with Steve Konowalchuk beating Dafoe from
the left post. Bondra, in the right circle, dished the puck down
low to Pivonka behind the net to Dafoe's left. Pivonka fired the
puck through the crease to Konowalchuk for the 4-1 lead at 14:40.
</P>
<P>
   Black made it 5-1 at 11:34 of the third. Klee fired the puck out
from the right corner and Black stuck his stick out, deflecting it
under the crossbar and over Dafoe.

STERN AND HUNTER DIFFER ON WHETHER PLAYERS SHOULD VOTE ON OFFER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There will be no more negotiations, tweaking of deals
or give and take. No trap doors or escape hatches. This was
Monday's message from David Stern, commissioner of the National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Stern spent the day suggesting that the players should vote on
the owners' final offer, which was presented on Sunday, and he
challenged anyone to discredit the offer as a take-it-or-leave-it
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to shift the burden to Billy Hunter, the union's
executive director, Stern made it clear in often prickly and
acerbic tones that the only way to salvage the season would be for
Hunter to accept the proposal and prevent an owners' vote on Jan. 7
that could leave the league as the first major professional sport
to cancel an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting the offer on Sunday, Hunter said he believed there
was still room for movement, still time to talk. He has chosen not
to put the matter to a vote by the players and continues to doubt
the doomsday scenario that has been depicted by Stern and Russ
Granik, Stern's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint conference call Monday with Granik. Stern derided
Hunter, saying: ``He didn't believe that the NLRB would dismiss the
unfair labor practice, and he didn't believe Dean Feerick would not
side with them, and he didn't believe the owners would lock out,
and he didn't believe we would lose regular-season games, and he
didn't believe that we would miss Christmas Day, and he didn't
believe we would cancel the All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So his analysis of this is right on target,'' Stern added.
``So he'll leave it, once more, for the fate of 415 players, most
of whom have worked together with this league for the last number
of years to get it to where it is. And on Jan. 8, he'll turn to his
players and say: `Guess what? I was wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then Granik continued, ``Or maybe he'll say, `Gee, maybe they
didn't mean it on Jan. 7.' But by then, it will be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter was not blinking Monday. He said he would not put the
owners' proposal to a vote and maintained that the two sides are
too close and the stakes are too high for a cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it objectively, there's no question that our
players would suffer,'' Hunter said in a conference call of his
own. ``By the same token, I don't think that the NBA owners are
prepared to blow up something that they've spend 56 years building.
Now, they may, out of arrogance and power, they may thumb their
nose at us and cut off their heads to spite their face. But the
reality is, the downside is so great, that I don't know if the NBA
would ever recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have 29 franchises that in the aggregate are worth
probably $5 billion to $6 billion, so are you going to jeopardize
your $6 billion investment and the upside to that particularly when
we're so close at the table? And over a few million? When you say
the downside is severe for us, it's just as severe and grave for
the owners. They may be independently wealthy and may be able to
survive it, but I don't think they'll be able to put the league
back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Granik acknowledged that the NBA would be a far
humbler and much different league if the season is canceled _ some
stars would be gone and ticket prices may be lower and television
deals might change _ but that the league would live to entertain
again.
</P>
<P>
   Although the league will mail out its new proposal, neither
Stern nor Granik were optimist that the season could be saved
unless Hunter and the players' 19-member negotiating committee
performed an about-face and presented the current deal to the union
for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with the players negotiating committee
Monday, Hunter said they were unanimous in their agreement that the
owner's proposal was not a good enough deal to present to their
members. Hunter said he was convinced that at least 80 percent of
the union's 400-plus members would vote against the current
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Some players are not so sure there would be a lop-sided outcome.
As former union president Buck Williams said, ``I think it would be
tight, right down the middle.'' Other players, like Karl Malone,
have called the owners' offer fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been given the trust by the players,'' Hunter said.
``And we intend to exercise that.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' negotiating committee, led by president Patrick
Ewing, contains a cross-section of players but is a group that has
been criticized for its attachments to agents like David Falk. Four
of its most prominent members, Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, Dikembe
Mutombo and Juwan Howard are Falk clients. This core has left
league officials to wonder if they have the best interest of the
masses at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Although the league improved its offers in the area of revenue
shares, maximum salaries, salary-cap exceptions, the rookie scale
and minimum wages, the union says the numbers are workable but
feels handcuffed by the elimination of opt-out clauses, the
disappearance of guaranteed licensing fees and the loss of Bird
rights _ which allow teams to re-sign players for whatever amount _
for players in the last years of their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter is certain that if the negotiating committees _ both
for the owners and players _ can huddle in the same room before
Jan. 7 that a deal can get done to save the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong possibility an agreement can be reached,''
Hunter said. ``We've done everything that we believe is
conceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern and Granik sound anything but inclined to meet with the
union again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate any further negotiations,'' Stern said.
``We have nothing left to give. If the players have something to
tell us, we'll take it back to our labor committee, but the
likelihood is that the season will be canceled on Jan. 7.'' &QL;

POWER HOUSE: ARIZONA NUCLEAR PLANT'S OUTPUT IS TOPS IN NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINTERSBURG, Ariz. _ The reactor is shut down, but it glows
brightly anyway, filling the water with a shimmering blue
incadescence.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Cerenkov effect _ particles moving faster than
the speed of light, escaping from uranium-laden fuel rods.
</P>
<P>
   Physics 101, but spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous glances are exchanged on a catwalk just 30 feet above
the containment pool. Below the visitors, workers on a movable
platform are refueling the core, gently lowering fresh rods into
the reactor's dark heart.
</P>
<P>
   Not many have ventured this far. The containment building at
Unit 3 of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station has 7-foot
concrete walls, reinforced with steel rods as thick as a man's
forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors enter through a bank-vault style air lock, after
donning protective clothing _ smocks, rubber gloves and booties,
hoods and hard hats. Radiation detectors dangle from their necks. A
technician tells them in flat tones not to touch anything, or
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the reactor building, security is tight. To enter the
compound, visitors pass through three checkpoints, supersensitive
metal detectors and a bomb sniffer. Armed guards roam the halls.
</P>
<P>
   It all sends an incontrovertible message: This is the real deal.
Mother Nature's laws are being bent here, and nobody's fooling
around.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Palo Verde, they sell fission and fission accessories.
</P>
<P>
   And business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Palo Verde's three units generated more electricity
than any power plant of any kind in the United States _ 29.5
billion kilowatt &UR; hours. That's 2 billion kilowatt hours more than
the Grand Coulee Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Verde should produce 30 billion kilowatt hours in 1998, a
first for any U.S. power plant.
</P>
<P>
   Production costs at Palo Verde have dropped almost in half, from
2.49 cents per kilowatt hour in 1990 to 1.33 cents in 1997. A
kilowatt hour is the amount of electricity it takes to light 10
100-watt light bulbs for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Operation and maintenance costs also have plummeted, to $325
million in 1997 from a high of $422 million in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Verde _ 50 miles west of downtown Phoenix _ promises to be
productive until its 2026 decommissioning date, and perhaps beyond,
but other plants aren't having the same success.
</P>
<P>
   As the electricity industry is deregulated, the nation's nuclear
power industry is shrinking. The harsh economics that come from
competition won't leave room for plants that are poorly run or
don't generate enough power to cover their costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there will be some plants that shut down,'' said
Bill Stewart, who is widely credited with turning
middle-of-the-road and underachieving Palo Verde into an industry
star. Stewart ran Palo Verde from 1994 through 1996 and now heads
generation for Arizona Public Service Co., which owns 29.1 percent
of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single biggest (factor) is the economics,'' Stewart said.
``Smaller plants tend to have more difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers bear him out. Although more than 100 nuclear power
plants are operating across the nation, no new plant has been built
since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Half the nation's nuclear plants are scheduled to be
decommissioned by 2020, and there are no new plants on the drawing
boards. About 27 units will be closed before their time, mainly
because of economics, &UR; according to projections by the Energy
Information Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although two nuclear plants have been acquired by new owners
(one was Three Mile Island's undamaged twin), they were sold for a
fraction of their original value. The sale prices also were
inflated because they included the price of fuel contracts.
</P>
<P>
   So what does this mean for the future of nuclear power?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who claims to have a crystal ball on this one is a
charlatan,'' said Alan Nogee, energy program director for the Union
of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very uncertain, and the reason is you have a huge range
in performance in the U.S. nuclear fleet, and you also have plants
that have changed very quickly, from good performers into poor
performers, and a few that have gone the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nogee said plants can be goosed into better production over the
short term at the cost of long-term health.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really need to demonstrate that kind of improvement for a
period of years, before we're willing to take it to the bank,''
Nogee said, ``especially in a deregulated environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Before more plants can be built, Stewart points out, the
public's perception of nuclear power must be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The industry got off to a good start in the early 1970s, with
promises of cheap, clean energy for generations to come. But then
came accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl in
1986. The public lost faith in nuclear power, if not the
willingness to gobble electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Although nations like France, Japan and China have accepted
nuclear power as a necessity, Americans are still wary, and have
the luxury of abundant fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   But there is hope for the nuclear industry, especially with
growing pressure to reduce greenhouse gases and protect the
environment, said Leighann Marshall, a Nuclear Energy Institute
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuclear power plants are the largest source of emission-free
energy we have in this country,'' Marshall said. ``They also happen
to be the second-cheapest source of energy we have.'' Coal is the
cheapest.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have been slow to embrace nuclear power plants
as an alternative, mostly because of the high-level radioactive
waste they produce in the form of spent fuel rods. Many aren't
willing to trade one environmental problem for another.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, experts say, is that the Department of Energy has
dragged its feet in building a permanent storage facility for
high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, Nev. The issue also
has turned into a political quagmire, as Nevada's elected officials
have battled against the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a technical problem, it's a political problem,''
Marshall said. ``Other countries are (storing waste), and they're
doing it very successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the industry is changing. Companies with
expertise and purchasing clout are expected to acquire nuclear
plants with an eye toward turning a profit. And a breed of newer,
cheaper, smaller nuclear plants could spring up after deregulation
shakes out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In about 10 years, I wouldn't be surprised, for example, to
see someone, somewhere, propose building a new plant on the same
site of an old plant,'' Nogee said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Palo Verde is producing at record power levels.
Refueling outages are shorter than ever, and the plant is running
more efficiently with fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from the 1980s, when the plant was being
criticized for cost overruns and its $9.3 billion price tag, and
APS was raising electric rates to cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Though he likes to spread the credit around, insiders attribute
much of Palo Verde's success to Stewart, who was brought in from
Virginia Power in 1994 to pull Palo Verde out of the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, APS was doing a corporate ``re-engineering,'' a
politically correct term for layoffs. Stewart, a no-nonsense
executive who learned the trade on nuclear submarines in the 1960s,
convinced top management to end the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palo Verde was kind of semi in the ditch, both operationally
and regulatory wise,'' Stewart said, ``and people were being lined
up to be let go. My initial efforts were just to stop all that, you
know, let's take stock of where we are and what the heck we are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, said he ended all the ``sidebar circus stuff'' and told
workers, ``We all know we have to get the units up, we all know we
have to do a good job. And you're free to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, I'm not bringing in a bunch of my buddies to help
me. I'm going with you. You guys, you know you have your jobs, and
if you want 'em you got 'em and just help make this thing work.''
</P>
<P>
   The results have been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   While Palo Verde's production has gone up, costs have gone down.
Since 1994, when Stewart joined APS, the utility's rates have
decreased 8.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plant has received two straight top rankings from the
Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, and has fallen off the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Stewart) is one of those rare individuals,'' said Jim Rhodes,
who worked with Stewart at Virginia Power and now serves as chief
of the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to really have knowledge of the details . .
. but also can keep (the) big picture in mind at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is hard to do.'' &QL;

 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Massachusetts courts gave the pseudonym Hugo P. to
a 4-year-old boy who has a mischievous smile and a wrenching life
story that his court-appointed lawyers hope will persuade the U.S.
Supreme Court to change children's rights law in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo lives in a frayed neighborhood here with his bubbly
6-year-old sister, called Gloria by the courts, and a foster
mother. Hugo and Gloria are so close that, when Hugo has difficulty
making himself understood, Gloria sometimes speaks for him. Their
troubled biological parents were declared unfit to raise them, so
they are, for each other, all that remains of their original
nuclear family.
</P>
<P>
   But that is to change within days. Under an order from the
highest court in Massachusetts, Hugo and Gloria are to be
permanently separated on Jan. 2. Like at least 35,000 brothers and
sisters across the country who are sent to different foster or
adoptive homes every year, they are to be raised far from each
other. Gloria, who was adopted three years ago by their foster
mother, is to stay here. Hugo is to move in with an aunt in New
Jersey who successfully fought the foster mother for the right to
adopt him.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo's lawyers, who have worked to keep Hugo and Gloria together
in the foster mother's house, have asked the Supreme Court to
review the case and use it to declare a new national rule that
brothers and sisters have a constitutional right to be together.
Their argument, experts in family law say, is at the forefront of a
growing legal movement that is pressing to change the focus in
custody disputes. The legal test is always the best interest of the
child, but these experts say the courts are being asked to examine
cases less from the perspective of adults who are warring over
children, and more from the point of view of the children
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start to make that paradigm shift, looking at it from
the point of view of the child, a natural next question would be:
Do children have a right to remain with their siblings?'' said
Martin Guggenheim, who is an expert on family and children's law at
New York University Law School and is not involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   R. Susan Dillard, one of Hugo's lawyers at the Massachusetts
Committee for Public Counsel Services, which is financed by the
state, said Hugo's lawyers were fighting not only to try to keep
Hugo and Gloria together but also to establish a principle that
might stop other brothers and sisters from being separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common experience,'' Ms. Dillard said, ``tells us sibling
relationships are at the heart of what our identity is.''
</P>
<P>
   The chances of the Supreme Court selecting for full review any
one of the scores of cases filed every month are small. But some
legal experts say the issue this case raises is one that is arising
frequently as American courts are asked to adapt to changing
attitudes about the family, like a growing consensus among child
welfare experts that brothers and sisters should be kept together
whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   Social service agencies and many courts in recent years have
said they give special consideration to sibling relationships. But
agencies say that in tens of thousands of cases every year, it is
often not practical to keep siblings together in adoptive homes.
There are many reasons for this, including the special care needs
of some children. But only a handful of judges have begun to
suggest that brothers and sisters have the same type of
constitutional right to be together as parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I think the Supreme Court will have to decide this
kind of case,'' said Frank Vandervort, managing attorney of the
Child Welfare Law Resource Center at the University of Michigan Law
School.
</P>
<P>
   Because the case has already been through two appeals courts,
the fight over Hugo provides an unusual look at the painful choices
judges everywhere are making daily in what are usually closed
family court proceedings. Published court decisions in
Massachusetts describe what a Boston juvenile court judge called a
``heart wrenching'' choice over what to do about Hugo.
</P>
<P>
   To the children's foster mother, Enid L., as she has been called
by the courts, the case raises a common-sense question. ``Why would
you want to separate a sister and a brother?'' she asked as the
children played outside on a gray December day.
</P>
<P>
   A 53-year-old former school kitchen worker who now earns her
living as a foster parent, Ms. L agreed to meet a reporter on the
condition that she and the children be identified only by their
pseudonyms.
</P>
<P>
   According to the court opinions in the case, the children's
father was a substance abuser with a history of domestic violence
and child neglect. Their mother, the court opinions said, suffers
from paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo, the courts said, has a series of problems, including slow
development of speech and motor skills, that may be the result of
his mother's use of cocaine while she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo's parents wanted the aunt in New Jersey, the father's
sister, to gain custody of Hugo. The aunt, a 43-year-old police
administrator's aide in New York City, has a teen-age son with
similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Boston juvenile court judge, Stephen Limon,
acknowledged that Hugo might be traumatized by the move away from
his sister. But in the long term, Limon ruled, it would be in
Hugo's best interest to live with the aunt, who had demonstrated
that she could care for a child with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a state appeals court overruled that decision, saying it
was based on mere speculation. Then, this fall, the Massachusetts
Supreme Judicial Court reinstated Limon's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the seven judges of the Supreme Judicial Court
reviewed the complex facts of Hugo's short life and his strong ties
to Gloria. But, as appeals courts often do in dealing with cases
concerning the placement of children, the court concluded that
trial judges are in the best position to make decisions based on
the facts before them. The court did not mention the constitutional
assertions made by Hugo's lawyers, but said it was important for
trial judges to retain flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not persuaded in this complex area of familial
relationships that the judge should have given presumptive weight
to the sibling relationship,'' the court's decision said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Courts across the country have considered arguments like the
ones Hugo's lawyers are making, but have issued differing rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo's lawyers argue that siblings should be deprived of their
right to be together only if there is clear and convincing evidence
that separation would be in their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the same test the Supreme Court has said must be
met to deprive unfit parents of their constitutional rights to
their children. The court has said that parents have a right not to
be separated from their children unless there is clear and
convincing evidence they are unfit. The court said that ``liberty''
right was derived from the 14th Amendment's guarantee that people
cannot be deprived of ``life, liberty or property without due
process of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo's lawyers argue that brothers and sisters, too, have a
``liberty interest'' in being together. They should be separated,
the lawyers say, only if there is compelling evidence that would be
in their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Drogin, a court-appointed lawyer for Hugo's father,
said it would hamstring social service officials and the courts to
say siblings have constitutional rights to be together. ``Why
siblings?'' she asked. ``Why not grandparents? Why not uncles and
aunts?''
</P>
<P>
   Hugo's aunt declined to be interviewed. When asked, Ms. Drogin
said the aunt had decided not to adopt Gloria for ``personal
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   For child welfare officials, Hugo's case points out the
extraordinary difficulty that issues of sibling placement present.
The Massachusetts Department of Social Services has sided with
Hugo's lawyers through the case. But in an interview, Kristen
Apgar, the department's general counsel, said she did not agree
that the courts should declare that siblings have a constitutional
right to be together. That, she said, would add a new layer of
legalism to a complex process and would slow down adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the small group of children's rights attorneys nationally,
Hugo's case is already being discussed. Patrick Murphy, the public
guardian in Chicago, heads an office that represents 37,000
children annually and handled a case several years ago arguing that
siblings have a right to be together under the Constitution's First
Amendment guarantee of free association.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he would ask for permission to file a
friend-of-the-court brief if the justices decide to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said it was important for the courts to clearly state
that the Constitution gave brothers and sisters special rights,
especially when parents have been declared unfit. ``All they have
left then are their siblings,'' he said. ``Take that away as well,
and you are punishing them for the sins of their parents.''
</P>
<P>
   But in New Mexico, Angela Adams, chief children's court attorney
for the state's Department of Children, Youth and Families, said
Hugo's case was a perfect example of why family court judges needed
flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   To declare that siblings have a constitutional right to be
together, Ms. Adams said, would almost certainly mean that some
children would end up in homes that might not be best for them
individually.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Hugo and Gloria appear to have little sense that they
are at the center of a battle that could change the law and their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   When they came in from playing, Hugo's mop of brown hair was
wild. He was too excited to say much. But Gloria, as usual, talked
for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   With little prompting from a reporter, she talked about how they
like to play with toy race cars together. ``We be riding them and,
and we get dizzy,'' she said breathlessly.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, according to a schedule agreed to by the
lawyers, there was a meeting that included Gloria, Hugo, the aunt
and a teacher. At the meeting, Hugo was given a crayon and paper
while the adults explained that soon Hugo would be living with his
aunt.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, one of Hugo's lawyer's said, whether Hugo
understood what that meant, or whether he understood too well.
Hugo, the lawyer said, just kept coloring.

THE LIKELY PROSPECTS FOR PLAYOFF UPSETS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 12 head coaches who stride into the National Football League
playoffs are thankful. They look around and see other coaches cut,
slashed and discarded. Five of their peers were fired Monday, and
that devastating feeling of being dismissed is not unfamiliar for
most of those in the playoff group. For all 12, there is concern
for their profession, for their brethren, juxtaposed against the
excitement over Super Bowl championship possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing disappointment with excitement is the nature of coaching,
where even a good thing, under wicked scrutiny, can look
discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the current crop of playoff coaches listen to
the banter that surrounds them, they will think this: The New York
Jets will play at Denver in three weeks for the American Football
Conference championship and Atlanta will travel to Minnesota for
the National Football Conference championship. Denver will beat the
Jets and Minnesota will solve Atlanta, and that will be your Super
Bowl XXXIII matchup _ Denver versus Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody else? Please, don't even bother to show.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of predictions flow this way, of course, because of the
seedings. The Jets and Atlanta are seeded No. 2, and Denver and
Minnesota are seeded No. 1. Denver (14-2) in the AFC and Minnesota
(15-1) in the NFC own the best records in their conferences and are
favorites. They surprise no one. They are expected to shine. They
should crush those lower-seeded teams. The 16-game regular season
was supposed to separate the playoff teams from the weaklings and
then, too, reveal who is supreme among the supreme.
</P>
<P>
   Upsets, however, make playoff football the most fun.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Denver won in the playoffs at Kansas City and at
Pittsburgh and then shocked Green Bay in Super Bowl XXXII. Two
years ago in the playoffs, Jacksonville won at Denver. Three years
ago, Indianapolis won at Kansas City. Four years ago, in the AFC
championship game, San Diego won at Pittsburgh. Five seasons ago,
in the NFC championship game, Dallas won at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight years ago, Baltimore beat Dallas in Super Bowl V.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-years ago, the Jets beat Baltimore in Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   Upsets. They make playoff football the most fun.
</P>
<P>
   Who will surprise this time? Which lower-seeded teams have a
chance to turn the 1999 playoffs upside down? Four come to mind:
</P>
<P>
   1. Buffalo (seeded No. 4 as the wild-card team) _ This is a nice
10-6 team. Actually, the Bills could easily be 11-5, except for
that controversial pass-interference call in the end zone on a
desperation pass at New England that set up the Patriots' winning
touchdown. No matter. The Bills can run the ball, play solid
defense and have an X factor in quarterback Doug Flutie. Rob
Johnson is the best backup quarterback in the playoffs. Receiver
Eric Moulds is special.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo plays its first-round game at Miami and, if it wins
there will likely play the Jets at Giants Stadium in New Jersey.
The Bills are hoping for a third attempt against the Jets, who won
their first two meetings. They are confident that they match up
well against the Jets and can finally solve them. If the Bills
reach the Super Bowl and win it, what a shock. Especially after
their powerhouse teams lost four straight Super Bowls. Winning it
with this less-heralded group for Buffalo would be dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   2. Arizona (seeded No. 6 as the wild-card team) _ The Cardinals
(9-7) are in the playoffs for the first time in 16 years. That is
nearly surprise enough for them. But why not more? They can win at
Dallas. Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer is playing with style and
pizazz. The Cardinals know the Cowboys: the teams are division
rivals who play twice a year every year, so Dallas is not a team
that scares the Cardinals. If Arizona beats Dallas, it will have to
play at Minnesota in a game that at first glance will be way over
its head. But first things first: just winning that first playoff
game. The Cardinals have not won a playoff game since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   3. and 4. The Jets and Atlanta (both seeded No. 2) _ How about
both upsetting their conferences and reaching the Super Bowl. That
sounds absolutely bizarre. But the Jets are 12-4, and the Falcons
are 14-2. Both are physical teams with stout defenses and strong
running games that can throw the ball deep. Both own the element of
surprise in strategy and in style. That makes both of Super Bowl
caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Buffalo, Arizona, the Jets and Atlanta offer the best
scenarios for playoff upsets. These four teams will bother to show.
They might even make the show. They will help make playoff football
the most fun.

IT'S NEARLY 2000! BUT FIRST, WE PRESENT THE SPONSORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Forget New Year's Eve 1998. Just two days shy of
another new year, almost everyone seems to be talking a lot more
about where they'll be and what they'll be doing when the really
interesting one rolls around. Fortunately, the people who brought
you the spiffy new Times Square have been busy taking some of the
hard work out of that epochal eve, at least when it comes to
choosing the proper accessories.
</P>
<P>
   The bubbly should be Korbel. The video camera should be
Panasonic. The credit card should be Discover. Get the idea?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, at a news conference to herald a New Year's Eve that
was 367 days away, corporate giants stood with Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and claimed their ``official'' status in the Times Square
2000 celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Even the famous ball that drops from One Times Square is not
immune. Giuliani announced that Waterford Crystal, the ``official
crystal'' of the celebration, would design an elaborate new ball to
replace the old aluminum one.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors were chosen by the Times Square Business
Improvement District and by Countdown Entertainment, a marketing
company that represents the owners of One Times Square, from which
the ball is dropped. The corporate money will help pay for the
celebration on New Year's Eve 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Several sponsors refused to reveal Monday how much they paid for
the honor, but said it was worth almost any price. Christopher
McGillivary, president of Waterford Crystal USA, said the Times
Square celebration would undoubtedly be one of the best advertising
opportunities in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most special moment for the millennium is certainly going
to be in New York City, and we wanted to be part of it,''
McGillivary said Monday. ``Not in a crass and commercial way, but
in a very meaningful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Korbel Champagne Cellars is taking its designation as the
``official champagne'' so seriously that early next year, it will
unveil ``the world's largest champagne bottle'' and dispatch it on
a nationwide tour that will end in midtown Manhattan on Dec. 31,
1999. It will stand 4 feet 6 inches high, weigh 350 pounds and
contain the sparkling wine.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the city's emergency services units will be needed to
uncork it on that special night, when New York hopes to lead the
world in greeting 2000, is unclear. Such details are not important
when you're talking millennial big.
</P>
<P>
   To that effect, Giuliani also announced the creation of a
millennium committee to plan the Times Square celebration and many
others that will take place during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will solicit private donations to pay for the
events outside Times Square, which Giuliani said would cost ``in
the millions.'' The actor Ron Silver will head the committee,
called NYC 2000. Members will include Cristyne Lategano, the
mayor's communications director; Bruce Teitelbaum, his chief of
staff, and Tamra Lhota, a fund-raiser for Giuliani during his 1997
campaign and the wife of Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota.
</P>
<P>
   Silver predicted Monday that the celebrations would ``set a tone
and leave a legacy for the next 100, even 1,000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Big wine bottles aside, the tone will not be tacky, organizers
said Monday. ``A lot of companies have offered huge amounts of
money to do something fancy,'' said Jeffrey Straus, president of
Countdown Entertainment. ``But we said, `No way.' People have come
to Times Square every New Year's Eve to watch a ball being lowered
down, and that's what the celebration will be all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Straus said the Home Shopping Network, the ``exclusive
direct-response television retailer'' for the celebration, would
sell a special line of dolls named ``Millennia.'' Doubletree Guest
Suites, the ``official hotel,'' would provide suites for corporate
sponsors on the big night.
</P>
<P>
   Korbel, Straus said, would change the labels on 16 million of
its bottles, temporarily replacing its family crest with the Times
Square 2000 logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sponsors understand that they are helping to make this
event great,'' Straus said. ``They know that it's the event that
comes first.''

TRADE GROUP SEEKS TO STIMULATE ADVERTISING ON LOCAL TV 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thomas P. O'Neill, the former House speaker, and the
humorist Finley Peter Dunne were fond of asserting that ``all
politics is local.'' Now the Television Bureau of Advertising is
seeking to extend that saying from the voting booth to the cash
register.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau, the New York-based trade association that represents
local television broadcasters, is undertaking what is being
described as its first large-scale effort aimed at marketers and
agencies to promote the benefits of running commercials locally
rather than nationally.
</P>
<P>
   A television, print and direct-mail campaign by Fitzgerald &AMP; Co.
in Atlanta, now getting under way, carries the theme ``Local TV: A
better connection.'' The campaign, with a combination of $1.2
million in paid spending and donated commercial time valued in the
millions of dollars, is the first work from Fitzgerald, owned by
the Interpublic Group of Companies, since being awarded the account
after a review several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local television is not on the radar screen,'' Ave Butensky,
president of the association, said in a telephone interview Monday.
``It needs to be more visible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers have so many choices,'' he added. ``We want to see
what we can do to create awareness.'' Additional details about the
campaign are to be discussed at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coen, who predicts ad spending trends for McCann-Erickson
USA in New York _ part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of
Interpublic _ forecasts that spending by national advertisers for
commercials on local broadcast stations will increase 4 percent in
1999 from 1998. By comparison, he estimates national spending on
cable television will rise 12 percent next year compared with this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Coen also predicts that spending by local advertisers on
television commercials will grow 5 percent in 1999 from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign comes as the cable television industry is
intensifying attempts to capitalize on gains in viewership by
persuading advertisers to increase budgets designated for cable or
to switch spending to cable from broadcast. That is particularly
true on the local level as so-called interconnects seek to make it
easier to buy time on cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Butensky said, however, that the campaign's message ``is not a
broadcast-cable issue.'' Rather, he added, the purpose is to focus
on what he called the strong points of ``localism,'' especially
``the ability to reach your best customer _ geographically,
demographically, psychographically _ with local television because
of greater program selection and targeting abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some soap products do better in soft-water markets than in
hard-water markets and vice versa,'' he said. ``General Motors may
need to say something to potential customers in California
different from potential customers in Detroit. And power drills
sell better in Texas than in New York; in New York, I kiddingly
say, you call the super.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign delves into those distinctions in several ways. One
commercial and a companion print ad, playing on the use of regional
expressions, carry the headline ``It's hard to sell `pop' to people
who drink `soda.''' Another headline advises: ``Nothing helps you
speak to a community like local TV. Except maybe a giant
loudspeaker anchored to the roof of your car.''
</P>
<P>
   A commercial elaborates on that idea by showing a man on a
bustling city street, standing outside a large office building. He
shouts into a bullhorn a conversation meant for a Dr. Kessler
inside the building, describing an embarrassingly personal medical
condition. As the details echo for blocks around, a newsstand
operator, passers-by _ and soon after, the police _ make clear
their dismay and displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want to talk to someone, why talk to everyone?'' the
spot asks. ``Use local television to really connect with your
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial borrows a page from popular films like ``There's
Something About Mary'' in that some moments may lift the eyebrows
of tradition-minded viewers. There is a brief discussion of bodily
functions, for instance, and a sight gag involving a blind man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a comical approach, an absurd situation,'' Butensky said,
``meant to be farcical.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, in tests by Fitzgerald the spot ``had the
highest recall scores'' of any idea the agency put forth.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run in the trade publications Advertising Age,
Adweek, Brandweek and Mediaweek. Promotional materials will also be
mailed to executives at agencies and client companies responsible
for planning national ad budgets.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials are being sent this week to members of the
bureau, which includes more than 500 local television stations,
owners of station groups and advertising sales representatives who
sell local commercial time. So far, Butensky said, more than 300
stations in more than 130 local markets have agreed to donate time
to run the spots.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they can stimulate interest by billing the commercials as
the debut of a series called ``There's Something About Local TV.''

`INSIDE STUFF' SUCCUMBS TO THE OLD STUFF
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On pre-lockout nights at NBA Entertainment in
Secaucus, N.J., satellite dishes and fiber-optic links used to pull
in every game. ``Loggers'' charted each dunk, 3-point shot, rebound
and no-look pass to help producers create features for NBC, TNT and
TBS's studio shows and programs like ``Inside Stuff,'' highlights
and repackaged versions of the games for more than 100 global
markets and home videos such as the annual National Basketball
Association championship tape.
</P>
<P>
   Not much of that is happening now, as NBA Entertainment has
shifted to feeding oldies footage and classic games to hungry
international markets (and the new NBA Store on Fifth Avenue) and
Women's NBA features to ``Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's video arm is also developing an IMAX film shot
during last season's finals, an animated series and an all-NBA
channel for DirecTV (which would probably carry fresh sitcoms like
``Honey, My Cell Phone's Stuck to My Ear,'' starring Patrick Ewing,
if it were in operation today).
</P>
<P>
   And the troupe of loggers remains employed, dipping into history
by charting plays from games played during Commissioner Larry
O'Brien's reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not as busy as we'd like to be, but we're not sitting
around,'' said Adam Silver, senior president of NBA Entertainment.
``We're also developing a potential promotional plan to restart the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The flood of NBA highlights that was a reliable element of local
and national sportscasts has evaporated, forcing producers to show
more college basketball, National Football League and National
Hockey League clips. The bank-busting free-agent signings in
baseball filled time for a while, and the American Basketball
League got more highlight play until it died last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an hourlong `SportsCenter,' there were 10, 12, 14 minutes
of NBA highlights, so it's a good chunk,'' said Norby Williamson, a
senior coordinating producer of ESPN. ``We're not sitting around
saying, `How are we going to fill the time?' This has forced us to
reinvent ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the time devoted to the NBA is taken up with lockout
news, but there are few negotiation visuals and not much news. So
besides adding highlights from other sports, ``Sportscenter'' has
filled time with a five-part interview with Bob Knight, the Indiana
basketball coach; a series on the greatest NFL wild-card playoff
games, and more player features.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've turned up the burners on college basketball,'' said John
Terenzio, executive producer of Fox Sports News. ``Normally, we're
not that intense on college basketball until after Jan. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   FSN has chosen not to add more hockey highlights, but has
shifted to weeknight NFL analysis, up from three nights last year.
It also landed a coup last week _ a rare interview with
Commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lockout forced us to be a better news organization,''
Terenzio said.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-hour CNN/SI has survived the lockout, despite being a
giant maw for highlights. ``I think this gives us an opportunity to
do more storytelling,'' said Steve Robinson, the managing editor.
Losing NBA clips has let the cable service add more feature
packages and highlights from other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in spite of all the polls and surveys that show people
couldn't care less about the lockout, I'm sure people miss seeing
the highlights,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   If the season is canceled _ the NBA Board of Governors could
vote to do so on Jan. 7 _ producers may have to be at their most
creative in February, when the NFL dries up, and baseball spring
training games have not yet begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``With no NBA, February will be as slow as can be,'' Terenzio
said.
</P>
<P>
   This has also been a slow time for NBA announcers. After a
year's hiatus, Marv Albert has been awaiting his return to
basketball ``I can't wait,'' he said. ``I'm very anxious. I really
miss it. It looks like there's finally a sense of urgency.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories of '58
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago Tuesday, Bob Wolff provided one of the radio
calls of Baltimore's 23-17 overtime victory over the New York
Giants in the NFL title game. ``My seat was low and on the 20-yard
line, so I couldn't see the yard lines too well,'' Wolff, the
sports anchor of Long Island's News 12 station, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, all the action took place at the other end of the
field,'' Wolff said. ``But what jumped out was Johnny Unitas'
pinpoint passing. It looked like he'd never miss. His confidence
and authority grew and grew.''
</P>
<P>
   David Plaut, producer of a terrific NFL Films documentary on the
game (which has been seen on ESPN and ESPN2), said: ``I was only 5
in 1958, and all I cared about was Superman and Zorro. But a game

   NBC's TV feed was unavailable, but the documentary used film
shot by two companies from opposite sides of the stadium, allowing
Plaut to show plays from reverse angles. The vintage film was
accompanied by the verbal passion of players like Sam Huff, the
candor of Frank Gifford and the wit of Art Donovan, who recalled
telling Gino Marchetti, his Colts teammate, ``If we lose this, what
a mistravesty of justice.'' Marchetti said, ``You're right,
fatso.'' &QL;

HURD HATFIELD, 80, ACTOR KNOWN FOR DORIAN GRAY ROLE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hurd Hatfield, the handsome actor forever identified with the
title role in the 1945 movie version of Oscar Wilde's novel ``The
Picture of Dorian Gray,'' died on Dec. 25 at a friend's home in
Monktown, Ireland. Since the 1970s, he had been living in
Rothcormack, Ireland. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hatfield had a long and varied career as a character
actor onstage and in films, his signature role was Dorian Gray, the
sensualist who remained eternally youthful while his portrait in
the attic aged and revealed his decline in graphic detail. The
portrait, a vision of a decomposed Dorian Gray that appeared as a
sudden burst of color in a black-and-white movie, was painted by
Ivan Albright.
</P>
<P>
   When Hatfield auditioned for the director Albert Lewin, he began
by announcing, ``I don't belong here,'' then read a passage from
the Wilde novel and furiously threw it across the room. His
arrogance may have helped win the role. The movie also starred
George Sanders, Donna Reed and Angela Lansbury. After ``Dorian
Gray,'' Hatfield was often called upon to play villains.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his elegant and often acerbic manner on and off
screen, it was sometimes assumed that he was British. Actually, he
was born in Manhattan (as William Rukard Hurd Hatfield). He began
his career with the Dartington Hall company run by Michael Chekhov
in Britian.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he appeared on Broadway with Rex Harrison and Lilli
Palmer in Christopher Fry's ``Venus Observed,'' directed by
Laurence Olivier. He often acted in works by Shakespeare, playing
the title role in ``Julius Caesar'' in the premiere production at
the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., and on
Broadway he played Don John in John Gielgud's 1959 ``Much Ado About
Nothing'' He also portrayed Lord Byron and Don Quixote in Elia
Kazan's original production of Tennessee Williams' ``Camino Real,''
and starred Off Broadway in Leslie Stevens' ``Bullfight.''
</P>
<P>
   His films included ``Dragon Seed,'' ``Diary of a Chambermaid,''
``The Left-Handed Gun,'' ``King of Kings,'' ``El Cid,'' ``Mickey
One'' and ``King David.'' In 1986 he played the grandfather in the
film version ``Crimes of the Heart.'' On television he had the
title roles in ``The Count of Monte Cristo'' and ``Don Juan in
Hell'' and was a frequent guest star on Ms. Lansbury's ``Murder She
Wrote.''
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Hatfield toured Germany, Northern Ireland,
Russia and Latvia in Lawrence and Maggie Williams' play, ``The Son
of Whistler's Mother,'' a one-man show about James McNeill
Whistler. John Cullum had the role Off Broadway when the play was
titled ``Whistler.'' In July 1997, Hatfield made a personal
appearance at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in connection with an
exhibition of Albright paintings (including the artist's picture of
Dorian Gray) and a screening of the Hatfield movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very young-looking until a year ago,'' said Ms.
Williams, and added that people remembering ``Dorian Gray'' often
would ask him if he had a portrait of himself in his attic.

WILLIAM R. PERL, 92,   BUILT SEALIFT RESCUE OF JEWS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William R. Perl, who as a young lawyer in Vienna organized a
waterborne rescue operation that carried thousands of Jews from
Nazi-occupied Europe to Palestine, died Dec. 24 at his home in
Beltsville, Md. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Years after his operation, which he called the Action, Perl
estimated it had carried 40,000 Jews aboard cattle boats, rundown
freighters and sailboats on 62 clandestine voyages to Palestine
from Romania, Greece, Yugoslavia and elsewhere in southern Europe.
The sealift employed subterfuges, including forged documents, to
defy the British, who governed Palestine under a League of Nations
mandate and sought to block large-scale Jewish immigration in hopes
of maintaining influence in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Prague, the son of a textile merchant, Perl received a
law degree from the University of Vienna and during the 1930s was
active in the militant Zionist movement led by Vladimir Jabotinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He began his rescue operation in 1937. A year later, after
Hitler had taken over Austria, he was summoned by Adolf Eichmann,
then a lieutenant in the SS, who stuck a pistol in his back,
demanding to know the whereabouts of a fugitive Jew. Perl did not
give Eichmann any information but instead interested him in a plan
to remove Jews from Vienna through sailings to Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   When Eichmann ultimately rejected the proposal, Perl went to the
German Finance Ministry in Berlin and, suggesting that he had the
backing of Nazi authorities, received permission to exchange German
marks for British pounds that would be used to bribe Greek seamen
involved in clandestine sailings.
</P>
<P>
   Perl told Ralph Blumenthal of The New York Times in 1990 that
the most painful part of his work had been selecting the healthiest
evacuees for the scarce shipboard space. He said he was still
haunted by the image of a sick Hungarian woman and her family whom
he had barred from a transport. ``I convicted them to death,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perl was arrested in Greece in 1940 _ at the behest of the
British, he believed _ and put on a train for Berlin. But he cut
his wrists as the train approached Yugoslavia, was taken off as he
had intended and was eventually sent back to the Greek authorities.
He later escaped to Portugal and then Mozambique, where in 1941 he
obtained a visa for the United States. After that, his operation
carried out few missions; it ceased entirely in August 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Perl enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army soon after Pearl
Harbor. He became a lieutenant colonel in military intelligence,
serving in Europe, then joined the Army staff at the war crimes
tribunal after the German surrender. He was the chief interrogator
of German SS men who had been involved in the massacre of 72
American prisoners of war at Malmedy, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he received a doctorate in clinical psychology
from Columbia University and then served with the Army in Munich,
counseling soldiers. On retiring from the military in 1958, he
became a psychologist for the District of Columbia's welfare
department, taught at George Washington University and maintained a
private practice in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Perl ultimately became an official of the militant Jewish
Defense League. In November 1976, a Federal jury in Baltimore
convicted him of conspiring to shoot out the windows in the
apartments of two Soviet Embassy officials in Hyattsville, Md, in
protest of the treatment of Soviet Jews. The conspiracy conviction
was overturned on appeal, although Perl was sentenced to three
years' probation for a related firearms conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Perl recounted his rescue efforts in ``The Four-Front War: From
the Holocaust to the Promised Land'' (Crown, 1979), in which he
denounced not only the Germans but also the British government, for
blocking entry of Jews to Palestine, and what he called the
``Jewish establishment,'' for failing to take vigorous action to
save European Jewry. His second book, ``The Holocaust Conspiracy:
An International Policy of Genocide,'' was published in 1990 by
Shapolsky Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Perl's wife, Lore, who secretly converted from Roman Catholicism
to Judaism shortly before their marriage in April 1938, was
imprisoned in a concentration camp from 1942 to 1944 for trying to
hide a Jewish neighbor. Perl was reunited with her in Vienna at the
war's end. She survives him, as do two sons, Solomon, of Olney,
Md., and Raphael, of Silver Spring, Md., and four grandchildren.

DOROTHY BIRD NYSWANDER, 104, PROMOTED PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Nev.)  (rl) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothy Bird Nyswander, who was widely regarded as a primary
promoter of U.S. public health education, died Dec. 18 at her home
in Berkeley, Calif. She was 104.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nyswander was a founder of the School of Public Health at
the University of California at Berkeley after World War II.
Earlier, in the Depression, she pursued her interest in public
health at the Works Progress Administration and after the war
started, she served with the Federal Works Agency, playing an
important role in setting up nursery schools and child care centers
in 15 Northeastern states to accommodate young mothers working in
defense plants.
</P>
<P>
   Because centers could not be created fast enough, Dr. Nyswander
advocated the nationwide training of temporary foster parents who
could look after the children of working women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, she served as director of the City Health Center in
Astoria, Queens, and promoted the idea that New York City should
keep close tabs on the health of its children through records that
would follow them when they moved to new schools. Her written
analysis of the health problems of New York youngsters was called
``Solving School Health Problems,'' and is still studied in public
health education courses.
</P>
<P>
   She came to Berkeley in 1946, where she pioneered the
application of behavioral sciences in public health. She was a
professor of public health there until her retirement in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   She enjoyed good health until recently. Paul Mico, the executor
of her estate who was also a student of hers in her final year at
Berkeley, said that up until a couple of months ago, she had
continued to receive former students at her home, where she
conducted seminars.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nyswander was born on Sept. 29, 1894, the daughter of Albert
Dixon Bird and the former Margaret Collins Miller. She earned
bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Nevada and in
1926 received a doctorate in educational psychology at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nyswander was married for more than 20 years to George
Palmer, former director of research for the American Child Health
Association in New York. He died in 1971. She was also the mother
of Marie Nyswander Dole, a psychiatrist who pioneered the use of
methadone to treat heroin addicts in New York and elsewhere in the
early 1970s. Dr. Dole died in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   There are no immediate survivors.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, Dec. 29,
1998:
</P>
<P>
   As the curbsides begin to disappear under bags of tinsel and
leftover fruitcake, it is a good time to think not about what we
bring home for the holidays but about what we throw away afterward.
New York City's 7.3 million people, plus the 34 million or so
tourists who will have been through town this year, produce about
26,000 tons of refuse a day. We dutifully recycle about 2,000 tons
of that load _ an amount that should increase now that the city has
wisely agreed to weekly recycling. That still leaves a lot of the
smelly stuff, some commercial, some residential, that must be
carted off and sent elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani earlier this month announced his plans
for closing the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island, the world's
largest dump, by 2002 and rerouting residential trash through major
barge facilities in Brooklyn and New Jersey. As expected, New
Jersey let out a protesting yelp and Brooklyn prepared alternative
plans and protective lawsuits to block more garbage flowing into
their respective areas. To no one's surprise, the process has
quickly become noisy and complicated as other proposals like one at
Port Ivory on Staten Island begin to sound intriguing. However,
what may be most surprising to those watching the dumping war is
that it concerns only about half the garbage the city gets rid of
each day, about 11,000 tons. The other half is commercial trash,
including such items as restaurant leftovers that are officially
described as ``putrescible,'' which may offer a clue why many
communities do not like them being trucked day and night through
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   While the city recognizes two separate trash ``streams'' or
systems _ residential garbage and the privately hauled commercial
garbage _ the resident of Brooklyn or the Bronx who has
bumper-to-bumper trucks running through the neighborhood has a hard
time smelling the difference. Garbage is garbage, whether it comes
from a one-family house or the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Giuliani and his garbage experts, as well as
the various groups interested in this weighty matter, should be
looking at how all our tossables in black plastic bags will finally
make their way out of the city after the closing of Fresh Kills. If
marine stations are deemed best for residential garbage, why not
consider them best for other garbage as well? City officials groan
at the thought; they already have enough trash problems trying to
close Fresh Kills without reconsidering the commercial system as
well. City Hall may be able to thus compartmentalize this problem,
but in the rest of the city it is all one big 26,000-ton-a-day
issue.

D-BACKS GIVE UP ON GARCIA  
 OUTFIELDER TRADED FOR TIGERS' GONZALEZ 
</HEADLINE>
  TRADE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their thirst for improvement still unsatisfied, the Diamondbacks
continue to drink from the cask of experience, not the fountain of
youth.
</P>
<P>
   The team added another veteran presence on Monday with the
acquisition of 31-year-old corner outfielder Luis Gonzalez in a
trade with the Detroit Tigers for Karim Garcia, a 23-year-old
outfielder who was taken in the expansion draft but whose world of
promise appeared to be shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona also will receive cash considerations from the Tigers,
presumably to help with the $2.2 million
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is scheduled to receive as part of a two-year free
agent deal signed with Detroit in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who throws right-handed but hits from the left side,
had a .267 average with a career-high 23 home runs and 71 RBIs as
Detroit's primary left fielder in 1998. But he saw increasing
evidence that he would be the odd man out in Detroit, with Bobby
Higginson moving from right to left and 23-year-old Juan
Encarnacion taking over in right.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez heard rumors he might be headed to Seattle, then
Arizona stepped in ``and caught me by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy to be going to a contending team, one that
has taken a lot of steps forward in the off-season, particularly
with its pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who began his career in the National League with
Houston in 1990 and spent two seasons with the Chicago Cubs,
returns to the NL on a club full of senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers Andy Benes, Randy Johnson, Gregg Olson, Armando
Reynoso, Todd Stottlemyre and Greg Swindell, infielders Jay Bell
and Matt Williams and outfielders Steve Finley and Bernard Gilkey
all are older than 30.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is looking forward to a reunion with Finley, with whom
he played in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: When Finley takes his spot in center, will
Gonzalez be in left or in right?
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey remains a strong candidate for left field. Or he could be
part of a trade before spring training begins, or move to right if
Manager Buck Showalter decides to put Gonzalez in left.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks apparently still have interest in San Diego
left fielder Greg Vaughn, who hit a career-high 50 homers last
season to help the Padres win the NL pennant. If Vaughn joins the
club, Gonzalez could move to right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every deal we make, people ask, `Are you through yet?' '' said
Sandy Johnson, Diamondbacks assistant general manager. ``You can't
really say that we are. We're still dealing from strength.''
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona's case, strength means pitching. Left-hander Brian
Anderson and/or left-hander Omar Daal could be part of future
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's immediate future involves returning to a league in
which he feels the most comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing bad against the American League, but the pace of the
game is different in the National League and there appears to be
more strategy involved,'' Gonzalez said. ``It's more of a
scratch-and-claw, move-the-runner-over, more fundamental type of
game. I'm more of that style player.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter's evaluation of Gonzalez: ``The best way you can
describe him is that he's a baseball player, very fundamentally
sound. In terms of strikeouts and walks, he is low in strikeouts
and high in walks. He had career highs in homers and doubles last
year, and we think he is in the middle of his prime.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the departed Garcia, the question is whether he will ever
reach his prime in the big leagues? He hit .222 with nine homers
and 43 RBIs in 113 games with the Diamondbacks in 1998 and .311
with 10 homers and 27 homers with Triple-A Tucson. The left-handed
hitting Garcia was particularly vulnerable to off-speed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karim is a young player with skills. Hopefully, things will
work out for him and the Tigers,'' Showalter said. ``Karim played
hard for us. I don't know if you can say that you're disappointed
in a guy who's only 23 years old. In some people, the light goes on
at different stages of their career than others.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE EURO'S PROMISE AND PERIL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Dec. 29:
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the euro _ combining 11 European currencies,
including the German mark, the French franc and the Italian lira _
is a historic milestone on the path toward European union. It will
push European countries to adopt more similar economic policies
while depriving individual nations of significant powers they now
enjoy. At best, it will make Europe into an economic machine
rivaling the United States. At worst, it will lead to political
strife within the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of years the change will not be completely apparent
to travelers, for national currencies will continue to circulate.
But as of Jan. 1 those currencies will legally be units of the new
euro, as dimes are units of dollars. By mid-2002 the old currencies
will vanish into collectors' vaults, and only euro coins and bills
will be legal tender.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is likely to join the dollar as a reserve currency held
by central banks around the world, perhaps leading some banks to
sell dollars and thereby reduce the value of the American currency.
But the United States and other countries will benefit if the euro
helps to promote economic growth on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the change is fraught with peril. National
governments have given up substantial amounts of sovereignty to
make the change, often without real involvement by voters. Only two
countries chose to put the issue to popular referendums. It
narrowly passed in France and was defeated in Denmark, which stayed
out. Other countries approved it through parliamentary votes.
</P>
<P>
   By making it easier to do business throughout Europe, the euro
is likely to stimulate mergers, particularly in the financial
services industry. The euro may encourage countries to compete for
industries by offering tax breaks, much as the states do in
America. Finally, the euro will put pressure on governments to
relax business regulations. For example, companies may henceforth
have much greater freedom to dismiss workers.
</P>
<P>
   Such a course seemed attractive to the conservative governments
that set Europe on the path to monetary unification, but it is less
enticing to the more leftist governments that now hold sway in many
countries. Even as the euro is inaugurated, fights are brewing over
the European Union's budget, particularly its generous agricultural
subsidies, and over the amounts paid by each country. Oskar
Lafontaine, the new German finance minister, is worried about what
he calls ``unfair tax competition'' from some countries in Europe,
and wants European rules setting minimum tax levels. That might
reduce the risk of Germany's losing companies to Ireland, but it
would also lessen Europe's international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The new European central bank, legally independent from national
governments, faces the difficult job of setting a single monetary
policy for a diverse continent that could be seeing strong growth
in one region while another is weak.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Europe will be greatest in the next cyclical
downturn. There is a risk that one country or another could elect a
government that blames its economic problems on European central
bank policies over which it has no control, and threatens to
withdraw from the currency union unless changes are made. The rules
Europe has adopted say that no country can withdraw from the union
once it enters, so such a threat would create a crisis. There is no
risk of that in the immediate future. With luck, the arrival of the
euro will improve European economies, enhance European cooperation
and promote world growth.

KEEPING AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE FROM BEING FORGOT
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
By CHARLES STRUM  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time in America when New Year's Eve
belonged to one man, Guy Lombardo, who generously shared it with
the rest of us. From the Roosevelt Hotel, on radio, and the
Waldorf-Astoria, on television, he and his sweet saxophones turned
the passing of one year and the birth of the next into the biggest
thing since the adoption of the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   But Lombardo died in 1977, a month before his 48th New Year's
Eve in New York, and the band, under the direction of a nephew,
veered dangerously off the musical path that had made the Royal
Canadians the longest running dance band ever. At midnight that
year, as usual, the band played the Lombardo theme song, ``Auld
Lang Syne,'' but in a jarring disco arrangement. After that, things
were never quite the same.
</P>
<P>
   For the next decade, the Royal Canadians struggled to find their
way back. Lebert Lombardo, Guy's only surviving brother, who had
been the lead trumpeter since the 1920s, ``wasn't cut out to do
this all by himself,'' said his daughter Gina Cudahy, who with a
brother and sister own the rights to the band and its music
library. So Lebert Lombardo, who died in 1993, licensed the band to
others. Five leaders came and went. One died in midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, agents for the Lombardos heard a joyful noise in the
Midwest, went to Cleveland and met Albert Theodore Pizzamiglio,
who, for the sake of a theater marquee long ago, had become Al
Pierson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my own successful band,'' Pierson said, referring to Big
Band U.S.A., which toured the world, performing in the tradition of
Glenn Miller, the Dorsey brothers and others. ``But here was a
chance to take on a band I had always admired, a band I grew up
with.'' And imitated.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson, 66, said he became a Lombardo fan as a boy in suburban
Chicago, where he and his younger brother, Robert, and his parents,
Italian immigrants, lived over the family grocery store. On
weekends and evenings, his father, Anible, played saxophone for his
own group, Nebe's Midwest Dance Band.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with an impartial embouchure _ lips that could play a
variety of horns and reeds _ Pierson could also transcribe by ear.
So the father placed the son by the radio to snatch Lombardo
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In high school and at Illinois State University, where he
studied music and later taught, Pierson almost always had a band
ready to go. By 1974, the road called full time, and Big Band
U.S.A. took off. Home base now is Aubrey, Tex., near Dallas, where
he and his third wife, Nancy, raise Lipizzaner horses on a 50-acre
ranch. They have five grown children between them.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1989, Pierson was performing in Cleveland when the
Lombardos' business agents tracked him down, liked what they saw,
and made a deal: exclusive licensee of the Lombardo band. It's a
ghost band, but Pierson says it presents no identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardo, a famously dapper man man who liked to race
speedboats, was barely 5 feet 4 inches tall. He rarely spoke from
the bandstand, and used the baton mostly as a prop, preferring to
chat amiably with dancing couples.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson, at 6 feet 3 inches, is a bear of a man with a bushy
mustache and the genial goodwill of a staunch Rotarian. On a break
recently between a riverboat cruise on the Mississippi and an
engagement in Phoenix, he flew into New York wearing a misshapen
old sport coat and slacks and an Atlanta Braves hat that covered
more scalp than hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of myself as being Guy Lombardo,'' Pierson said.
``I'm in the spirit of Guy Lombardo, the spirit of his music, but
with my own personality. I'm friendly, I talk to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierson, who sings and plays the piano, is gregarious in front
of an audience, cracking jokes with local flavor. Before the usual
second number, a tune that was a hit for the band in 1937, Pierson
might say: ``We dedicate this to the Atlanta Braves fans out there.
The name of the song is `Boo Hoo.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since Feb. 12, 1989, when Pierson picked up the Lombardo baton,
he says he has tried not only to secure the Lombardo heritage, but
also to expand it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy only played in the U.S. and Canada,'' he said. ``The
farthest the band ever went was Hawaii.'' No more. Now the Royal
Canadians go on cruises, they have flown to 32 countries and they
play in nearly every corner of the United States _ up to 300
engagements a year.
</P>
<P>
   This is good news, because the millennium approaches, and
Pierson is determined to ring it in. Last year on New Year's Eve,
the band was in Wabash, Ind. This Thursday, it's booked at the
State Theater in New Brunswick, N.J. Next year it will be at a big
Las Vegas hotel, and probably on television.
</P>
<P>
   Although the band's popularity still confounds some critics _
they call Lombardo the ``Prince of Wails'' and poke fun at the
signature saxophone vibratos and clippety-clip rhythms _ it remains
user-friendly to any couple who want to dance cheek to cheek.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington and Lee University in Virginia not long ago, the
band was playing in one gym and a rock group was booked for
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 4,200 kids,'' Pierson said. ``By the end of the
evening they were all in our gym dancing, and the rock band had
shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   How come? ``The kids said they liked hearing the words to all
those pretty songs,'' he said.

WHO'S NO. 1 IN INTEREST? CARDINALS BEAT TOP COLLEGE TEAMS

   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Sometimes, it seems, the Fiesta Bowl can't catch
a break.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's big game will produce a national champion _ but the
game is being overshadowed in metropolitan Phoenix by the Arizona
Cardinals' dramatic and improbable playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   The talk Monday _ whether on sports radio shows or the lunchtime
chatter at Sam's Cafe _ was not the Fiesta Bowl battle a week away.
The topic? The Cardinals finally ending the NFL's longest playoff
drought.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Cardinals dominated the discussion on the
three major sports radio shows. The scene was the same on at least
one prominent talk radio show.
</P>
<P>
   At Sportsfan, a Tempe sports apparel shop near Sun Devil
Stadium, the Cardinals also had the edge, with sales of wild-card
playoff T-shirts and sweat shirts going faster than Fiesta Bowl
garb. ``It's more favoring the Cardinals,'' an employee said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question the Fiesta Bowl is taking a back seat
locally this year, said John Cannon, a Phoenix sports radio host.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl is non-existent when it comes to callers to his
show, he added. ``I've gotten two phone calls since the pairings
were announced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's no Nebraska playing in the game. No Pac-10 team, which
could spark more local interest. And the losses by key unbeaten
teams late in the season hurt the game's impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then in the last two weeks with what the Cardinals have
accomplished, it has really wiped them off the map,'' Cannon said
of the Fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   It all should be a familiar feeling for the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The game produced a national champion in 1996 _ but was
overshadowed some locally because of the upcoming Super Bowl, which
arrived in Tempe a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl produced another title game in 1987 _ the day
after Arizona State upset Michigan to win its first Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for Fiesta Bowl leaders in their yellow blazers
to publicly fret.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Shover, one of three original organizers of the bowl game,
pooh-poohs any such idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never our intention to make it the No. 1 thing in
town,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers when Fiesta Bowl Executive Director John Junker
asked him if the bowl should pick another year, besides when the
Super Bowl was coming to town, to host a national title game. ``I
said, `Are you kidding?'
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got your different audiences for the different
events,'' Shover said. ``There's never been any kind of envy . . .
there's plenty of room for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiesta Bowl spokesman Shawn Schoeffler agreed and added, ``if it
is being overshadowed, the only place in the world it is (being
overshadowed) is in Phoenix, Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro football fans aren't necessarily college football fans, he
said. ``We don't feel like the first unified college football
championship is going to be overshadowed, really, by anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Monday's Fiesta Bowl will be a flashback to when
Tempe hosted Super Bowl XXX.
</P>
<P>
   There's the pageantry of two teams fighting for a football
championship. A stadium packed with more than 70,000 screaming
fans. A game attracting international attention and plenty of hype.
It's a present for many Valley hotels, restaurants, bars and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   While there are similarities between the two events, though,
there's a huge difference between the Fiesta Bowl _ even when it
produces a national champion _ and the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Diana Ross to climb out of a helicopter during the
Fiesta Bowl's halftime. And the level of national recognition
differs, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought attention to Arizona like we've never seen
before,'' Shover said of the Super Bowl. ``Nothing can match the
NFL and the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being an original organizer of the Fiesta Bowl,
Shover played a key role in helping bring the NFL's championship
game to the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a college spirit around the Fiesta Bowl. It's a
different spirit,'' he said. When the Valley hosted the Super Bowl,
it was the NFL's game. But with the Fiesta Bowl, ``it's our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempe Mayor Neil Giuliano agreed. He said the two events are
``like night and day for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta Bowl is a breeze compared to dealing with the NFL for
the Super Bowl, he said. And the emphasis is different: ``The NFL's
motivation is profit . . . the Fiesta Bowl is much more
community-oriented. It's hometown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference: the estimated economic impact of the two
events. Fiesta Bowl officials project that this year's game will
have an economic impact of about $100 million. Super Bowl XXX had
an economic impact of about $306 million.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest difference between the two games, though, is
the people who attend. It is corporate America compared with
collegiate America.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl is an international event, and fans are a who's
who of corporate leaders lucky enough to get tickets. Most Valley
residents didn't have a prayer of attending Super Bowl XXX.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fiesta Bowl is driven by the fans of the two
universities. Each of the participating schools receives 16,000
tickets. Another 35,000 go to Fiesta Bowl annual ticket-holders,
which includes local residents.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's Fiesta Bowl may not be the most pressing thing on
the minds of Valley sports fans, it may not matter to Fiesta Bowl
organizers, said Cannon, the radio host.
</P>
<P>
   The tickets are sold. People will be in from out of town. The TV
ratings should be high. There will be plenty of national media
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Local interest could climb this week with the bowl teams in
town. But with the Cards' playoff berth, it will be a tough go, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiesta Bowl spokesman Schoeffler downplayed the impact of the
Cardinals' playoff run on the bowl game. And Fiesta organizers
realize a lot of people in the Valley are excited about the NFL
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited for them, too,'' he said. &QL;

COMMENTARY: BILL BRADLEY _ A DOLLAR, A DREAM, A BIG BOUNCE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Bradley retired from the Senate in 1996. Since then he has
taught, done television commentary and given, by his count, 140
speeches. Carrying his own luggage for the first time in 18 years,
the man who survived a career as a professional basketball player
without serious shoulder complaints developed problems with his
rotator cuff from lugging a 50-pound suitcase around airports. It
was, apparently, the weight of the books that was dragging him
down. (``You always take 10 times more than you can read.'')
Certainly it was not the wardrobe. ``You'd be surprised how
superfluous it is to change your shirt,'' he confided.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bradley is back in harness, running for the Democratic
presidential nomination, encumbered with scheduler, media handler,
chauffeur. This campaign is still a low-rent operation, the car a
1988 Lincoln with a balky back door, and his public appearances
running to labor union Christmas parties and grade-school awards
days. There is about $20 million standing between Bradley and
serious credibility as a candidate. Given his commitment to
campaign finance reform, he is hoping to get it from 20,000 donors
giving $1,000 each. He says he is working on it.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's decision to run for the presidency seems like a
reasonable political calculation even though Vice President Gore is
far and away the front-runner. About a year from now, according to
Democratic contrarians, many primary voters may wake up to the
near-inevitability of Gore's presidential nomination and suffer a
case of anticipatory buyer's remorse. Given the present level of
public cynicism about politics, the malady will probably be as
profound as it is premature, its chief symptom being a desperate
flailing around for somebody who seems better, or at least
different. It is the Bruce Babbitt/Paul Tsongas role, and it has
always been short-term employment. (Buyer's remorse is usually
followed by grudging submission.) But politics these days has a
tendency to veer off the trail at a moment's notice. Gore could run
into new and politically fatal problems over his next year in
office. Or he could be kidnapped by space aliens.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Bradley would come in. He is popular with the
media, which counts for something. (``True Confessions: We Love the
Big Lug,'' wrote William Powers recently in the National Journal.)
He has a serious campaign agenda, centering on underprivileged
children and racial unity. He is a deep thinker, the author of four
books, which is more than enough in the Senate to earn a reputation
for substance. But it is impossible to exaggerate how much his
legitimacy as a national politician rests on the fact that he used
to make his living stuffing a large round ball through a netted
hoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know who Bradley is?'' asks a teacher at Berringer High
School in Newark, N.J., where the ex-senator has come to help
publicize a student volunteerism program called Do Something.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a basketball player for the Knicks,'' says Charles
Estrada, a small, talkative boy in a wrestling team sweatshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Charles, searching his memory. ``And _ and he's
running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   The school's principal, who has dropped by to give the program a
sendoff speech, launches into a description of how when he was a
Rutgers college student, he watched Bradley play for Princeton:
``This man used to throw 40-footers into the basket, and Rutgers
could never win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley tells the students: ``The older you are, the better
basketball player you were.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not try to downplay the association _ his most recent
book is not the basic dutiful candidate's tome on how to make
government better, but a best seller about how sports teaches
character. However, he does not have to push it, either. His status
as a former New York Knick comes up absolutely all the time, and
even when it does not, it is there.
</P>
<P>
   At Berringer, the students around the room each offer an
adjective to describe themselves. ``I'm Crystal and I'm
charismatic,'' says the student body president. ``I'm Luis and I'm
shy,'' says the Do Something leader. It seems almost inevitable
that Bradley, when his turn comes, will say, ``I'm Bill and I'm
tall.'' But instead he offers, ``I'm Bill Bradley and I'm thankful
to be here,'' and urges the students to come back with anecdotes
about their efforts. ``I'll tell the stories of Do Something and
Berringer High School all over the country,'' he promises before
the group breaks up and the kids stand in line for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, whose candidacy is still officially in the
``exploratory'' stage, is likely to share the field of would-be
Gore-busters with a few other Democrats, including Senators Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota and John Kerry of Massachusetts. Wellstone
is a favorite of the left, and Kerry is a combat veteran with
access to his wife's personal fortune. But as everybody knows,
Bradley has the best shot.

WITHOUT SALO IN THE NET, ISLANDERS ARE POROUS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ There are two players the Islanders cannot seem
to win without. Defenseman Kenny Jonsson, as they found out earlier
this month, is one of them, but after Monday night's game it was
clear that goalie Tommy Salo is the other. And until Salo returns
from a broken finger in two weeks, victories could be few and far
between for the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Salo's replacement, Wade Flaherty, has allowed a few soft goals
the last two games, and Monday night he was pulled after allowing
two first-period goals in a 5-1 loss to the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty got the Islanders off to a bad start, allowing a
stoppable Terry Carkner shot between his pads to give Florida an
early 1-0 lead. After giving up another goal, Flaherty (1-4-1 with
a 3.48 goals against average) was banished to the bench, replaced
by Marcel Cousineau, who had not appeared in an National Hockey
League game since 1997. Cousineau allowed three goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers dominated the Islanders on both ends of the ice in
the first period and took a 2-0 lead on goals by Carkner and Oleg
Kvasha. Paul Laus stretched the lead to 3-0 early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps embarrassed by Laus' goal, his first in 188 games, the
Islanders began showing signs of life, getting a goal two minutes
later from Mark Lawrence. Then came a pivotal point in the game.

<P>
   Mariusz Czerkawski appeared to bring the Islanders within a goal
at 11 minutes 33 seconds of the period. But the goal was waved off
by Referee Lance Roberts, who ruled that the whistle had been blown
before the puck trickled between Sean Burke's pads.
</P>
<P>
   Carkner scored Florida's first goal at 4:53. Skating over the
blue line unmarked, he took a cross-ice pass from Ray Whitney and
unleashed a rocket that beat Flaherty between the pads.
</P>
<P>
   Kvasha, a 6-foot-5-inch wing whom the Islanders are said to
covet, scored the second goal on a power play at 17:49. He crashed
the net and whacked the puck away from Jonsson and into the goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders got a scare in the first period when Trevor
Linden, their captain, was cut above his right eye by the high
stick of Bill Lindsay, who drew a penalty. The game had to be
stopped for several minutes as the linesmen cleared off a stream of
blood. Linden, who missed five minutes in the period while the gash
was stitched up, threw a punch at Lindsay on his first shift after
the incident, and then, moments later, confronted Lindsay. They
were quickly separated.
</P>
<P>
   Laus extended the Panthers' lead to 3-0 at 4:40 of the second
period. He chipped a rebound over Cousineau for his first goal
since April 6, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, who was recently called up by the Islanders, scored at
6:16 of the second period, stretching his scoring streak to four
games. He persistently poked at the puck until it dribbled into the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Whitney scored the Panthers' fourth goal and Bill Lindsay
scored the fifth in the final seconds.

KOCH LOSES RADIO SHOW; PARTYING ON ST. BARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Koch Replaced by Dr. Laura
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's certainly not as if Ed Koch is out of a job, as
the former mayor reminded everyone who called him Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He is still gainfully employed as, among other things, a lawyer,
a newspaper columnist, a movie reviewer, a television commentator,
a university lecturer, a public speaker, an author, an advertising
pitchman and the sometimes irascible, sometimes avuncular judge of
``The People's Court,'' the daily television program.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, Koch will no longer be a radio host.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at WABC-AM radio told his agent that they had decided
to cancel his talk show, over which Koch had presided five days a
week for about eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ratings are good, so I don't think it has anything to do
with ratings,'' Koch said Monday. But his ratings have not been as
good as they once were, and the station said it planned to move Dr.
Laura Schlessinger, the host of the syndicated pop-psychology talk
show, into his 11 a.m. slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing what they think is in the best interest of the
station,'' Koch said, ``and there are no hard feelings. That's
America, and that's free enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The program director for WABC-AM said it was the station's
policy not to comment on the reasons why shows are canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the radio show means Koch loses a bully pulpit, which he
has often used for the last several years to excoriate Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani. But when informed of the show's cancellation,
Giuliani seemed almost wistful. ``You know,'' he said, ``I always
look forward to his criticisms because then I have something to
talk about at a news conference.''
</P>
<P>
   They're All There, And You're Not
</P>
<P>
   On St.-Barthelemy, nothing seems different this year, except
that the tiny island in the French West Indies is more crowded than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants are overbooked, Jeeps are overrunning Gustavia, the
island's port, and, once again, it seems as if no one is waiting
around for New Year's Eve for parties to begin.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 invitations went out from Ocean Drive magazine
in Miami for its party held Saturday night at Le Feeling, the hot
mountaintop disco in St. Bart's, where last year's party went on
till 6 a.m. This year, the line formed at 10:45 p.m. and by
midnight no one could move on the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, the rap impresario, who is staying in a
villa by night and a boat by day (because of the partying on his
boat last year, he could not rent a boat this year), danced to his
own music. So did Ronald Perelman, the chairman of Revlon, who
uncharacteristically was wearing jeans and a T-shirt. Perelman took
his own boat, the Ultima III, to the island. Penny Marshall and
Martha Stewart are said to be staying on it.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Ralph Lauren's children, Dylan and David, were dancing
the night away along with Chris Barish, the son of the Planet
Hollywood owner, Keith Barish. A party on the Barish boat (called
The Indian Achiever) is planned for Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Mottola, chairman of Sony Music Entertainment, is on a
boat called The Pegasus, but hasn't been spotted, and Clive Davis,
head of Arista Records, is planning his yearly party at his own
villa. Mick Jagger, is said to be on the yacht of Jean Pigozzi, an
Italian investor, and Ted Field, chairman of Interscope
Communications, is keeping it low until his New Year's Eve bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone keeps saying, `I'm so over it,''' said Jacquelynn
Powers, senior editor of Ocean Drive magazine. ``They say: `I don't
want to see the same people. Let's just go to dinner and go home,'
and two seconds later they say, `Where's the party?'''

 &HT;    Tearful admission: Killer was invited in for sex
 &HT;    By Bill Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JONESBORO, Ga. _ The weekend slaying of a 72-year-old
grandfather took a strange twist Monday as police announced Chester
Smith's widow tearfully admitted the killer was a hitchhiker the
couple invited to their home for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton County police Maj. Jerry Robinson said Evelyn Smith, 76,
changed her story late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   She originally told police the ponytailed, bearded man who slit
her husband's throat with a switch-blade had come to their door
asking for a glass of water and then had burst in and attempted to
rob them.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators grew suspicious after they determined Evelyn Smith
had purchased a six-pack of ``pony sized'' beer bottles that she
had claimed the man brought to their home.
</P>
<P>
   Police discovered her purchase when they reviewed a videotape
from a surveillance camera at a convenience store near the couple's
home. They expected to see the suspect buying the beer, Robinson
said, but ``the tape showed Mrs. Smith buying the beer instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The widow originally claimed the intruder forced his way into
their home and demanded money. He cut a telephone cord in the
bedroom and was about to tie them up with the cord and bedsheets
when Chester Smith bolted for safety, yelling for help, she told
police.
</P>
<P>
   The man chased Smith, knocked him down and cut his throat,
police said. Police said Smith managed to run outside. He made his
way into the kitchen through a side entrance and got a towel.
Neighbors who heard the couple's cries called 911. Arriving medics
found the mortally wounded man sitting on the kitchen stoop holding
a bloody towel to his throat, police said. Chester Smith died
undergoing surgery at Southern Regional Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The killer fled in the Smiths' 1994 light blue Mercury Sable,
Georgia license tag 385GRB; the car has grey primer paint on the
right rear panel and two large pillows in the rear seat, Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The killer is described as 30 to 40 years old, slender and about
5 feet 6 six inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said Evelyn Smith broke down when confronted with the
store's videotape and told investigators that she and her husband
picked up the man at an exit off I-75. ``They told him they would
take him home for the purpose of having sex with Mrs. Smith,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the man at their home, Evelyn Smith went to the
convenenience store and bought beer for him, returning home shortly
after 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man drank some beer, and in the bedroom told them he
wasn't interested (in sex), he wanted money and their car. The
motive was robbery, we believe, but this was not a home invasion as
it first appeared,'' Robinson .added.
</P>
<P>
   The widow could not be located Monday night for comment. Family
members said Monday afternoon they had heard nothing from police
about the suspect or details of Chester Smith's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Linda Brown, when told by a reporter police said the
killer was a hitch-hiker, said ``I don't care who he is, he had no
reason to kill my father.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other family members declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, several home invasions in the Atlanta area have
made headlines, including a particularly violent one Dec. 12; in
that crime, a couple was beaten and robbed in their home and their
Jeep Grand Cherokee stolen; the woman also was raped.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said the public needed to know the details of the Smith
case, despite their embarrassing nature, because ``we receive many
calls from people concerned that some one was walking door to door
commiting horrible, random crimes of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a random crime after all, it appears, and the
public needed to know that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said police had not decided whether Evelyn Smith would be
charged with making false statements. ``We're concerned with
apprehending this killer more than anything else,'' he said.

 &HT;    Impeachment backlash includes voters wishing to switch parties
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The political rancor over impeachment is
spreading from Washington to the voter registration offices of
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Elections supervisors in Palm Beach County and the Treasure
Coast report being surprised by high numbers of requests for party
changes, with Republican defections being a discernible trend.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent backlash against the move to impeach President
Clinton that culminated in a House vote on Dec. 19, Democrats are
adding to their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually see requests for changes die down when we get into
the holidays,'' said Theresa LePore, the Palm Beach County
elections supervisor. ``But this year has been unusually active,
and most of the changing has been from Republican to Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent figures available, from Oct. 1 to
Dec. 16 in Palm Beach County, 452 Republicans defected to the
Democratic Party and 321 Democrats turned Republican; overall, if
new residents and those who switched from other parties are
included, 867 voters joined the Democratic Party and 562 became
Republicans. The county has about 614,000 voters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's problems have inspired movement in both directions,
election officials say, as voters make statements of affiliation to
express their unhappiness with either the president or Congress.
Since the November elections, 234 Palm Beach County voters have
left the Republican Party and 185 have quit the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The viciousness with which the Republicans have behaved is
nauseating to most people,'' said Monte Friedkin, the chairman of
the Palm Beach County Democratic Party. ``There's no question
they've motivated a lot of lifelong members of their own party to
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank DeMario, chairman of the Palm Beach County Republican
Party, said the data is too preliminary to be alarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's this way six months from now, maybe there will be
cause for concern,'' DeMario said. ``But there are a bunch of
dissatisfied people on both sides. Republicans who changed sides so
rapidly probably weren't loyal anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend is apparent also in Martin County, which has about
80,000 registered voters. From Dec. 1 to Dec. 18, 13 Republicans
changed affiliations, five to Democrat and eight to non-partisan,
officials said. And since Dec. 21, 17 Republicans have become
Democrats and six others became non-partisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to get a run on changes after the House
(impeachment) vote,'' Martin elections official Emma Smith said.
``And we've had several more come in this morning in the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans jumping ship may not be a surprise, but Martin
officials also reported a few Democrats turning to the GOP. Since
Dec. 1, nine Democrats have changed to Republicans; seven more
became non-partisan.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Lucie County, which has about 131,800 voters, 130 people
switched party affiliations within the past month _ 48 more than
this time last year. Of those, 41 became Democrats, 31 became
Republicans and 58 became either independent or nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the Clinton deal has accounted for some, but I do
think some of the local politics have accounted for some,'' said
Wesley Wilcox, systems administrator for the St. Lucie elections
office.
</P>
<P>
   Small but telling samplings from elections officials around the
state and nation point to a busy season of political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is significant for this time of year,'' said Deborah Clark,
deputy elections administrator in Pinellas County, of her workload.
``During the holidays our file is usually pretty static. So this is
different from previous years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said her office recorded 75 people dropping Republican
registration between Dec. 7 and Dec. 21, at the height of the
impeachment action. Of those, 55 registered as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had about 100 people change from Republican to Democrat
in the last week to week and a half,'' said an elections official
in Polk County, Iowa, which includes Des Moines. ``Some of these
guys have been Republican for a long time. It's very unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, officials have been caught off guard by the high
volume of requests for party changes since the state has gone to an
open primary system and affiliation is less important.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unusual for us to get any requests for party
change,'' said Steve Weir, a Santa Clara elections administrator.
</P>

Fla. Palm Beach Post staff writers Howie Paul Hartnett and Lady
Hereford and The New York Times wire service contributed to this

PRINCE, WARNER BROS. COMPETING OVER `1999' 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEVA CHONIN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was dreamin' when he wrote it, forgive him if he goes astray.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the new year, the Artist Formerly Known as the
Unpronounceable Glyph Formerly Known as Prince plans to release
seven new mixes of his landmark 1982 single ``1999'' on his NPG
label.
</P>
<P>
   But the Prince of Paisley Park has competition. Warner Bros.,
which holds the copyright to the original ``1999'' master, has sent
new copies of the single to radio stations and has plastered
promotional stickers on the original ``1999'' album and ``Prince's
Greatest Hits Volume One.'' DJ remixes of the song by Roger Sanchez
and others are also expected.
</P>
<P>
   Why the dueling ``1999'' releases? Because the song _ written,
recorded and produced by a 23-year-old Prince _ is the property of
Warner Bros. No longer affiliated with the label, an older and
wiser Artist can release new versions of ``1999'' _ the EP will
have reggae and hip-hop remakes _ as long as he steers clear of the
1982 master tape.
</P>
<P>
   The Artist is peeved at Warner Bros. for what he views as an
exploitative 18-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was The Artist (or any artist 4 that matter) ever in4med that
it was in his best interest 2 sign this agreement only if he had
ownership of the master recordings, seeing that this is where the
majority of ALL future earnings would come from??'' demands a post
on the Artist's Love 4 One Another Web site
(www.love4oneanother.com). ``NO, NO, and thrice, NO!''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Warner Bros. executive Bob Merlis, the reality
is closer to yes, yes and thrice yes. ``(Prince) signed a lucrative
contract, and he had legal counsel,'' he says. ``He's our partner
in this, and he's getting royalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the outrage, then? ``I can't theorize about how he thinks,''
sighs Merlis. ``But we don't begrudge him anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, the coveted master to the original ``1999.'' Ad
agencies are reportedly in a frenzy of high-priced bidding for the
song _ though it's anybody's guess why they would want to peddle
products with lyrics such as ``Mommy, why does everybody have a
bomb?'' and ``We could all die any day.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasoning, Merlis says no commercial deals will be
struck without the Artist's permission. In the meantime, he
insists, ``We're simply letting people know the song is available.
Because if not now, when? It's logical.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Logic and music seldom mix, though, and the Artist's ``1999 _
The New Master'' EP is probably only the opening salvo in the War
of ``1999.'' The Artist, according to copyright law, is entitled to
tweak his enduring song with stratagems ranging from creating an
exact replica of the original ``1999'' album using digitized sound
to supplying new lyrics to the tune.
</P>
<P>
   The Artist's immediate plans are more staid. He will preview his
new EP on January 1 and 2 at MGM Grand's Studio 54 in Las Vegas,
with Morris Day and the Time guesting on the first night and label
mates Larry Graham and the New Power Generation on the second.
Tickets for both shows are available at MGM ticket outlets.

DEVILS' SCORING RUSH SENDS HASEK TO THE BENCH
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Midway through the first period Monday night,
the fans at Marine Midland Arena let out a chorus of mock cheers
when the New Jersey Devils dumped the puck softly toward the net,
where the Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek cradled the
slow-moving puck. Just 22 seconds into the second period, there
were no cheers, mock or otherwise, as the Sabres' coach, Lindy
Ruff, benched Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek hardly lived up to his name, the Dominator, on this rare
occasion, surrendering goals on each of the Devils' first three
shots, then another 22 seconds into the second period. After the
fourth goal, the little-used backup Dwayne Roloson skated on as the
crowd watched silently, too shocked to critique Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   The benching did little to change what was happening. The Devils
scored on almost every opportunity and built a five-goal lead
before hanging on for a 7-4 victory. That countered a 2-0 loss on
Saturday night in New Jersey and gave Hasek and the Sabres
something to think about should these teams, the two best in the
Eastern Conference, meet in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   While the Devils have improved their offense this season, it
would be hard to describe Monday night's splurge as anything more
than an oddity. The Devils' four goals came on only six shots, a
confounding statistic against Hasek, who stopped 34 New Jersey
shots two nights ago and entered the game with consecutive shutouts
and only one goal allowed in the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Morrison had a goal and two assists, all in the first
period, as Hasek surrendered three goals in a period for the first
time since Oct. 31. Dave Andreychuk had a goal and an assist, Brian
Rolston two goals, and Bobby Holik and Sasha Lakovic each had two
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek's early departure was just the third of the season for the
National Hockey League's premier goalie. Hasek has played in every
game for the Sabres this season, leaving early on Nov. 14 with a
5-1 lead and then getting pulled while trailing by 2-0 on Nov. 28
in a game at Florida. On this night, it was the Devils' Martin
Brodeur who made one acrobatic save after another as the Devils
were badly outshot by 40-18.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Devils beat Hasek both times they faced him last
season, they were wary entering Monday night's game. ``Against any
team you have to beat six guys,'' Coach Robbie Ftorek said at the
morning skate. ``Against this team the sixth man is tougher than
most.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who is 6-3-1 in head-to-head meetings, had said,
``We've got to go through him to get a win. It's a mental block,
but somebody has got to pass through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players had theories on how they would change that Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some traffic will be good,'' Ftorek said with a smirk. ``I
don't know about more because there wasn't any last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Oliwa struck first, exactly as the players planned.
Just 2:50 into the game, Scott Stevens kept the puck in at the blue
line and then Lakovic slipped the puck to Morrison behind the net.
Morrison fed Oliwa, who was parked in front of the net. With
surprising ease, Oliwa poked the puck by Hasek for his third goal
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes later, Morrison picked up the puck near center ice
after the Devils repelled a Sabres threat and skated alone along
the right side as defenseman Richard Smehlik retreated to cover
Oliwa, who was racing in from the left side. Morrison flicked the
puck low and to the right of Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   Just 1:31 later, Patrick Elias fed Petr Sykora on the left side
of the net and from an impossible angle. Sykora banged the puck off
Hasek's right skate and into the net.

IS RED WINGS' REIGN NEARING AN END?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months can be a long time in the NHL. Just ask the Detroit
Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   In June the Red Wings were skating around with the Stanley Cup
for the second straight year. This season, they have been terrible
against the better teams in the league, and if not for beating up
on the NHL's weaklings, the Red Wings would be in real trouble in
the mediocre Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``People read the paper and know what we're doing and they want
to know why,'' the Red Wings' Kris Draper said. ``With as much
talent as we have, why can't we beat Dallas? Look at our record
against teams above .500. You go home and people want to know
what's going on with your team. It's a pride factor.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad are things? Before Monday's 4-4 tie with St. Louis, the
Red Wings had lost five consecutive games. In eight losses to five
of the NHL's top teams _ Phoenix, Dallas, Boston, Toronto and
Carolina _ the Wings have been outscored 34-12. And their power
play had produced three goals in their previous 33 chances before
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Changes could be coming, mainly because Detroit management
believes complacency has set in. There even is some thought the
Wings could become involved as late bidders in the sweepstakes for
Calgary'sTheoren Fleury.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit will make the playoffs, and has to be considered a Cup
favorite until proven otherwise. But the Red Wings don't want to
wait until April to find their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the regular season, but you can't just all of a
sudden turn it on come April 1 and find your `A' game,'' general
manager Ken Holland said. ``You need to get it going at some point
in the regular season and play your `A' game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only Christmas, but at the same it is Christmas _ we've
played three months and it's three months before crunch time. We
haven't played poorly but we haven't played anything near how we
have to play to be competitive against the elite teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleury update: The Calgary Herald reported that Fleury has
rejected a $5-million-a-year offer to remain with the Flames.
Fleury had seven points as the Flames went 3-1-1 on a recent trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to put it,'' he said, ``but I think I made a
pretty good pitch for myself on this trip _ that if you want me,
here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting friends: Fighting and hockey are not exactly mutually
exclusive. But the recent wrestling match between Nashville's Mike
Dunham and Vancouver's Garth Snow was unique.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, both are goalies. For another, they were
roommates when they played at the University of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The scrap began when Dunham went after the Canucks' Brad May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go down there when Dunham went at it with May,'' Snow
said. ``You've got to protect your teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a scene reminiscent of a Washington-Boston fight earlier
this season, when goalies (and former roommates) Olaf Kolzig and
Byron Dafoe went at it. The Bruins' Dafoe, a former King, was best
man at Kolzig's wedding over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Garden party: When Dallas visited Toronto last week, Stars
goalie Ed Belfour rented Maple Leaf Gardens and invited 26 friends
to join him there for a pickup game. Belfour skated as a forward
and scored two goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a joke almost, when you think about it,'' said David
O'Connor, a building contractor from Chicago who was one of
Belfour's guests. ``I mean, we're going to skate on the ice at
Maple Leaf Gardens. I'll tell you this about Eddie Belfour: He's as
loyal a friend as you'll ever find. He's a stand-up guy, and a real
gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Why were the Kings able to acquire skilled right
wing Donald Audette from Buffalo for the meager price of a 1999
second-round draft choice? Apparently, Buffalo was trying to make
an example of Audette, who missed the first two months of the
season in a contract dispute with the Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sabres general manager Darcy Regier, the Kings'
offer typified the offers he received _ strange, considering
Audette scored a team-high 24 goals last year playing in Buffalo's
defense-oriented system. Tampa Bay was another team interested in
acquiring Audette, but refused to give up a second-round pick to
get him. Audette's history of knee problems is believed to have
driven his value down....
</P>
<P>
   When Mighty Ducks goalie Dominic Roussel beat Colorado 1-0, last
week, it was his first NHL victory in nearly three years. Teammate
Jim McKenzie was impressed: ``He stopped 45 point-blank shots. He
gets down in that butterfly and his legs look like the bumpers of a
pinball machine.'' The Ducks have been involved in five 1-0 games
this season, going 3-2....
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of goalies, Stars backup goalie Roman Turek unveiled a
new mask featuring artwork from the heavy metal band Iron Maiden,
complete with an eye dripping down a skull.... The president of
Belarus reportedly offered Vancouver holdout Pavel Bure $4 million
to play at home next season. Vancouver general manager Brian Burke
reacted angrily to the report, because Bure remains under contract
to the Canucks....
</P>
<P>
   Sabres winger Matthew Barnaby missed a recent game with a
sprained ankle. Barnaby was injured when he wrestled with teammate
Rob Ray in the Buffalo dressing room while wearing only one skate.

 &HT;    UT sets up 10-year deal for head football coach
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The University of Texas is taking steps to lock up head
football coach Mack Brown for the long term by arranging a contract
extension that will in effect give him a 10-year deal and a raise
of $100,000, for an annual total package of $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Athletic Director DeLoss Dodds said Monday that he is
briefing members of the UT Men's Athletic Council and has already
gained the verbal approval of President Larry Faulkner on the new
contract. Ultimately, the measure would have to be approved by the
Board of Regents, but that is expected to be approved without
delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to make a statement,'' Dodds said. ``We've
had a great season, and this is the right time to do this. They are
recruiting well, and things are in really good shape. They're the
answer that we're looking for, and we need to keep them happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the extension, which would take effect
Friday, Brown would have a five-year contract that adds an extra
year each year through 2004. After the fifth extension, the
contract could be allowed to expire in a natural progression,
ending in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Brown originally had a five-year package that rolled over for
two years _ the equivalent of a seven-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   A buyout of his contract by UT would cost the school $1 million
at most, Dodds said, because it would be obligated to pay only the
base annual salary of $200,000 over a maximum of five years.
</P>
<P>
   That would be less than what the school still owes former Coach
John Mackovic, who is entitled to payments of more than $1.2
million over the next two years. Since being reassigned in December
of 1997, Mackovic has already been paid more than $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Were Brown to want out of his contract, he would not have to pay
any buyout.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Brown's pay, UT will raise the salaries of
offensive coordinator Greg Davis and defensive coordinator Carl
Reese by $35,000 apiece to put them at $150,000. The seven other
assistant football coaches, as well as assistant athletic directors
Cleve Bryant and Jeff Madden, will each get $15,000 increases.
</P>
<P>
   Dodds said the school wanted to reward Brown and his staff for
the Longhorns' outstanding 8-3 season and Cotton Bowl berth as well
as to ward off offers from potential suitors. But Dodds said he
doesn't expect Brown to look hard at any of the seven vacant head
coaching positions in the National Football League, five of which
came open Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he is interested in an NFL job,'' Dodds said.
``I'm not worried about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he wouldn't be surprised if some NFL teams came
calling this week, but he would tell them all the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy here, and I'm not going anywhere,'' Brown said. ``We
feel good about what we have going here.''

gentleman. But look up at the mischievous eyes and unruly hair, and
some of the contradictions of the man and his country begin to come
into focus. The official who represents law and order in this most
ordered of nations, is an iconoclast: a defender of the
revolutionary Red Army Faction during the 1960s, celebrated lawyer
in the 1970s, founder of the environmentalist Green Party in the
1980s, tough Social Democrat in the 1990s and bon vivant with a

the Islamic mystics who seek to commune with the infinite through
ecstatic dance. From lampposts and bus shelters, they look
beatifically down on the throngs bustling along cold streets. These
images mark the annual festival commemorating Jalaluddin Rumi, who
conceived the dervish dance as part of his lifelong quest for
religious rapture. He is not only Konya's most famous son, but also
a poet and visionary revered by millions as one of history's great
spiritual masters. By Stephen Kinzer.

The conjunction plays visual tricks, producing mirages that are

telescope. Aided by more sensitive cameras and advanced computer

gravitational lenses. Scientists are learning to interpret these

has been extolled again as baseball heroes of newer generations
breezed past the home-run record the Babe held for 34 years, until
1961. But unknown to many, Ruth also left a legacy in the annals of
medical history. In fact, he was among the first patients anywhere
to receive experimental chemotherapy, and some researchers say he
was the first ever to receive a combination treatment of
chemotherapy and radiation for his type of cancer. By Lawrence K.
Altman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-IMMORTAL-CELLS (Undated) _ Life and death lie nowhere so
close together as in the human cell's counting device for limiting
how often it can divide. The device is a sort of tally stick that
gets shorter at each division. When it runs out, the cell dies. New
research on cell division demonstrates the potential to overrule
the counter and ``provide therapeutic opportunities for age-related
diseases.'' according to one team of researchers. Researchers are
pleased now that even after multiple divisions of cells, far beyond
their normal life of 50 divisions of so, the cells show no
cancerous tendencies. By Nicholas Wade.

   SCI-PRAIRIE-CHICKENS (Urbana, Ill.) _ For six decades,
conservationists in Illinois tried to save the greater prairie
chickens that once covered the state like its sea of grass.
Nonetheless, the showy little birds, beloved for their flamboyant
mating rituals, began a headlong population collapse to fewer than
50. Now a team of geneticists and ecologists from state agencies
and the University of Illinois has reversed that decline and, for
one of the first times in a wild population, documented how
inbreeding and loss of habitat reinforced each other to create what
an ``extinction vortex.'' By Jo Thomas.

   SCI-ISOTOPES-BUTTERFLIES (Undated) _ Every winter, after flying
south from the Eastern United States, millions of monarch
butterflies festoon fir trees in the mountains of Mexico, creating
one of the world's most dazzling and famous biological spectacles.
But in spite of interest in these insects, details of their travels
have largely remained a mystery. Now, three new studies herald the
arrival of a powerful new technique that can identify, sometimes to
within a few miles, where migrating animals have been. The new
technique takes advantage of different forms, known as isotopes, of
chemical elements. Biologists have begun discovering that these
isotopes, present in different amounts in different regions, can
leave a distinctive chemical signature written in the feather of a
bird or the wing of a butterfly living in that region. By Carol

   SCI-ORNISH-DIET (Undated) _ Dr. Dean Ornish advocated a diet of
virtually no fat, no sugar, no caffeine and minimal sodium and
claims it helps patients' cardiovascular systems. While he has some
supporters in the medical profession, others say this his studies
involve so few patients over such a short time that no conclusions

less. It's time to stop and smell the roses, or at least something
other than the guy sweating on the next treadmill. By Andrea
Higbie.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DRUG-SAFETY (Undated) _ When a drug harms patients, there is
no independent agency to find out what went wrong. Instead, the
government relies on doctors to report problems voluntarily, and
the job of investigating then falls to the same people who put the
drug on the market in the first place: the FDA, which approved the
drug, and the pharmaceutical company that manufactured it. In a
recent issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, three doctors
compared airplane safety and drug safety, noting that drug
reactions kill 100,000 Americans a year, vastly more than plane
crashes. They suggested that the United States needed an
independent drug safety agency, analogous to the transportation
board. By Denise Grady.

   NEW YORK _ A post-midnight subway ride from Greenwich Village to
the Upper West Side was as good a sign as any of the growing sense
of personal security in the city. There were maybe 15 people in the
car, not one of them obviously homeless and planning an all-nighter
on the No. 1 train. They were ordinary New Yorkers on the way home.
And about half of them were napping.
</P>
<P>
   That's when it hit how remarkable a scene this was.
</P>
<P>
   Would it have been likely, only a few years ago, for so many
people to let down their guard to sleep on the subway at 12:30
a.m., unconcerned about lowlifes snatching their purses or ripping
chains from their necks?
</P>
<P>
   You know the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a change,'' said Peter Ryan, 20, a student at St.
Francis College in Brooklyn. ``You used to have to watch your back
on the subway. Now I frequently doze off. I never have any
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that more New Yorkers are also reading on trains than a
few years ago, again because they can indulge in the luxury of
normal behavior that was denied them during the high-crime siege.
</P>
<P>
   You see them on the sidewalks at later hours than before. You
don't see them crossing the street quite as much because a fellow
walking their way looks wrong. You don't hear them talking so often
about how it wasn't worth the risk to make a late-night run to the
corner grocery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I noticed the change was seeing women with
Macy's bags going to Brooklyn on the subway,'' the writer Pete
Hamill said. ``They didn't used to think they could have a bag that
screamed `Just Bought' and get it home.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is the tangible, human side of the statistics showing a
sustained and spectacular decline in crime across the city. You
could also throw in, as the mayor does, all the lives that will
continue to be led because homicides are way down from the wretched
1990 high of 2,262.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a blood bath as 1998 gasps its last, New York will end
the year with fewer murders than at any point since 1963. As of
Monday afternoon, the homicide count stood at 616, tolerably below
the 636 recorded in 1964. (The 1963 figure was 549.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite the numbers, it is hard not to ask if New Yorkers
feel transported back to 1964 when it comes to crime. Do they think
they are as relatively safe now as then?
</P>
<P>
   You know that on this score, too, the answer is no.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, some people do not feel better off than even a
couple of years ago, especially outside Manhattan, despite police
statistics showing crime down in every borough.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Brooklyn is concerned, I don't feel any safer,''
said a woman who gave only her first name, Julie, as she bought
Christmas presents for her four children at the Fulton Mall in
downtown Brooklyn. ``I'm wary even talking to you, because I don't
know who'll be coming up behind me to grab my purse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask parents if they would allow their 9- or 10- or 11-year-old
children to ride the subways alone, as New York youngsters that age
(boys in particular) routinely did on odysseys of discovery in
1964. Unanimously, parents interviewed said no. Some could not have
looked more startled if asked about possibly hurling their children
down a well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't dare put my boy on the bus alone,'' the father of a
10-year-old said at the Fulton Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, 1964 itself was not such a thrill in terms of crime.
</P>
<P>
   A realization that New York was coming unglued had begun to kick
in after years of middle-class flight, a growing neglect of basic
city services, an influx of poor people from the South and the
Caribbean, and a steady rise in the welfare rolls. It was in 1964,
in Harlem, that the urban riots of that decade got rolling.
</P>
<P>
   And crime had already set out on its inexorable march. In four
short years, from 1960 to 1964, the number of homicides rose to 636
from 390 _ a staggering 63 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   But back then, the memory of a more tranquil city was still
keen, and that affected New Yorkers' sense of well-being. ``These
days, people who feel safe in Manhattan may not feel safe in the
Bronx, but in the 50s you felt safe everywhere,'' said Fred Siegel,
an urban-affairs specialist and history professor at Cooper Union.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the murder rate is not necessarily the best gauge of a
city's feelings of security. Even in the darkest days of 1990, your
chances of being killed were slim if you were middle class and
uninvolved in the crack wars. Most New Yorkers probably worry more
about being mugged, and the numbers are discouraging compared with
those of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Forget 1964 for a moment. The police department's record keeping
in those days made a joke of its statistics on nonlethal crimes. In
1966, the system was changed to reflect reality better. Reported
robberies that year totaled 23,539. The 1998 tally is at least 61
percent higher _ 37,902 and counting. There were 23,205 reported
assaults in 1966, and 28,181 thus far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: compared with 1964, you are far more likely to look
over your shoulder when you hear footsteps while walking home at 1
a.m. And you are far more likely to seek protection in ways that
were unheard of 34 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, you did not pass through metal detectors to enter
school buildings. You did not have the vast army of private
security guards that now occupies buildings throughout the city.
You did not have the many surveillance cameras, and not nearly as
many steel gates on store windows (not to mention the graffiti that
scars them).
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that in 1964 you counted on your neighbors
and your immediate community to provide a sense of security, and
now you count on all kinds of electronic devices and the police
department,'' said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's
Urban Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   True, New Yorkers are breathing easier than they did in the
early 1990s. But Hamill said: ``Anybody who came through the last
35 years will have permanent caution. I don't think anybody is
throwing out the Fox locks.''

 &HT;    Clemency rules to face open meetings challenge
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A federal judge who couldn't find much good
about the state's clandestine clemency system ruled Monday that it
is good enough to meet minimum standards set by the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is abundantly clear that the Texas clemency procedure is
extremely poor and certainly minimal,'' U.S. District Judge Sam
Sparks of Austin said in his order.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks rescinded stays of execution granted to Joseph Stanley
Faulder, a Canadian who had been scheduled for execution on Dec. 10
for the 1975 slaying of an East Texas woman, and Danny Lee Barber,
sentenced to die Dec. 9 for the 1979 slaying of a Balch Springs
woman. Their cases now go back to state district courts to set new
execution dates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite page after page of criticism of the system, Sparks said
the only phrase that mattered was ``minimal procedural
safeguards,'' the low hurdle set by the U.S. Supreme Court in a
case challenging Ohio's clemency process.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said state officials could open up the process and
silence its critics in ways that ``would not threaten the
employment of the Huntsville executioner.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles, called Sparks' ruling fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``His criticisms are well-taken and we will study those and look
at those and do the best we can with those,'' he said. ``We owe
everybody that. If there are things we can do better to more firmly
establish that we are extending minimum due process we would
obviously look at those.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez seemed uninterested in a major overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling attests to what we have been saying. We felt we
were extending minimal due process and apparently he agrees,''
Rodriguez said of Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General Dan Morales, who had his staff defend the
system despite his concerns about it, hopes the Sparks ruling leads
to serious consideration of changes, according to spokesman Ron
Dusek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clemency procedure is a separate procedure and the
attorney general believes, and Judge Sparks believes, based on his
opinion, that that separate procedure should also provide a greater
degree of due process rather than simply meeting the minimal
standards,'' Dusek said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Elliott Naishtat, D-Austin, has filed a bill that
would require the board to conduct open meetings and give reasons
for its clemency decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still clear to me that the clemency process in Texas
does not comply with either the Texas Open Meetings Act or the
explicit language in the Texas Constitution,'' Naishtat said after
Sparks' ruling. ``I look forward to proceeding with my
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin lawyer Rita Radostitz, who represented one of the inmates
who brought the case, found solace in Sparks' words if not his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly heartened by the court's criticism of the
process, and I hope that it leads to changes in the clemency
process,'' she said, adding that she may ask the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in New Orleans to decide if Sparks correctly
interpreted the Supreme Court's use of the word ``minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin lawyer Curt Sauer, representing death row inmates
mounting a state court challenge of the clemency system, was
encouraged by Sparks' suggestion that there are important issues
for state courts to decide.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled for Monday in a Travis County state
district court to consider death row inmates' claim that the
clemency process violates the Texas Open Meetings Act.
</P>
<P>
   Both condemned men com- plained that the system of deciding
whether to change death sentences to life in prison doesn't give
death row inmates a fair shot.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current process, clemency requests are reviewed by the
18-member Board of Pardons and Paroles, which does so without
conducting a public hearing, convening a meeting or guaranteeing
that all members see all the documentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is apparent none of the members read every word on every
line of every piece of paper in the clemency application,'' Sparks
said in one of his many criticisms of the process. ``Only Rodriguez
testified that he reads every bit of every file, and his
credibility is suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   If the board recommends against clemency, the request dies
shortly before the inmate does. If the board recommends clemency,
the decision is up to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-six clemency petitions have been submitted since George
W. Bush became governor in January 1995. The board has recommended
clemency only once, in the case of serial killer Henry Lee Lucas,
whose punishment was changed to life in prison by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It is, Sparks said many times in many ways, not much of a
clemency system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is elemental a flip of the coin would be more merciful than
these votes,'' he said in a footnote.
</P>
<P>
   The footnote was a reference to the 1998 ruling in which the
U.S. Supreme Court said, in a 5-4 decision, that clemency systems
must meet only ``minimal procedural safeguards'' that place them
somewhere between a coin toss and complete denial of access to the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' system meets the ``minimal procedural safeguards''
criteria by affording inmates the right to submit their requests
and a guarantee that they will be considered, Sparks ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This process may not meet normal due process standards, but it
does meet `minimal procedural safeguards,''' he said, adding that
Faulder and Barber failed to show that the board's decisions not to
recommend clemency were ``arbitrary, capricious, whimsical or based
on improper factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks then took the liberty of telling state officials they
could ``render frivolous any future cases'' attacking the process
by revising the system to add a hearing or, at least, require board
members to state reasons for decisions.

HARRIS RETURNS TO WHERE IT ALL BEGAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jim Harrick took the University of Rhode Island
basketball team to the Elite Eight in March. It's noteworthy _ and
easily overlooked _ because the Rams had never been that far in the
NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It's often that way with Harrick. He's not remembered for his
accomplishments, but for the scandal that cost him the UCLA
coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after Harrick's ouster as the Bruins coach, the
60-year-old is getting along with life just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll win basketball games wherever he is,'' said Santa
Barbara athletic director Gary Cunningham, who hired Harrick as his
assistant at UCLA in 1977. ``He's a good teacher, a good recruiter
and a good coach. I think Jim could live anywhere in the nation and
adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick doesn't build basketball programs, he elevates them to a
higher level. He did it with Pepperdine, did it again at UCLA. He's
doing it again at Rhode Island, the third stop in his 19-year
career. The Rams went 25-9 last season.
</P>
<P>
   To those who played for, or coached with Harrick, it's not a
surprise. Winning is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won at Pepperdine, he won at UCLA and he won at Rhode
Island,'' said Cameron Dollar, a point guard on UCLA's 1995
national championship team. ``He's like a mad scientist but he
doesn't share much of his information. That's why people (outside
of coaching) don't think he's a good coach. But he's an outstanding
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since he was fired by UCLA on Nov. 6, 1996,
Harrick returns to the area to coach a game. He even canceled an
appearance in another tournament to play in Pepperdine's inaugural
Sparklett's Invitational that begins today.
</P>
<P>
   It might be one of the few places in Southern California you
don't have to beg Harrick to come back to.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA was the job he always wanted. For 23 years he coached in
the Los Angeles area, climbing the ladder toward the job he
coveted. But Pepperdine is where it started, and there are no
bittersweet memories there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have many friends at Pepperdine, and it's a place I
really am fond of,'' Harrick said. ``It holds a special meaning for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In nine seasons with the Waves he won 167 games and went to four
NCAA Tournaments. But when UCLA offered him the job to revive its
program, he quickly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Before Harrick, UCLA went to the NCAA Tournament twice in seven
years. In Harrick's eight seasons in Westwood, the Bruins appeared
in the NCAAs eight times, won 191 games and a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Harrick's legacy isn't as the man who turned around a
faltering program, but rather as a man who saw an empire crumble at
his feet. Harrick is remembered for being fired for breaking an
NCAA rule, lying about it and then coercing an assistant to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the end is what people remember quite a bit,''
said Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar, an assistant under Harrick at
UCLA from 1992-96. ``But you have to remember the other stuff, too.
He's the only coach other than John Wooden to win a national
championship at UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick's supporters claim the dismissal had more to do with
personal differences with UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis than
violations. They also place some blame on Steve Lavin, who they
claim had designs on Harrick's job.
</P>
<P>
   Dalis did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I still don't understand the inner workings of
the administration, and why they did what they did,'' said
University of San Diego coach Brad Holland, an assistant at UCLA
under Harrick from 1988-92. ``Just knowing how he coveted the UCLA
job, I would say it deeply hurts him to this day that he's not the
coach there.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick may not have his dream job anymore, but he's moved on.
What lingers more than animosity from the firing is the feud
between Harrick and Lavin. They don't talk. Not since Harrick went
on ESPN in December of 1996 and said Lavin wouldn't be given the
UCLA job on a full-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the most unfortunate, difficult part, on a
personal level for me, just the fact that our friendship was a
casualty of those sets of circumstances,'' said Lavin, who spent
five years as Harrick's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember John Wooden, and the night I got the job he told me
he would be very surprised if by the end of the season Jim and I
were still talking. I didn't understand it at the time, but he,
obviously, was a little bit clairvoyant. He was aware that the
natural fallout was going to be the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until it's reconciled, it will always be painful because I
feel indebted and grateful to the man, and will always, because he
opened the door for me and gave me an opportunity of a lifetime,
and moved me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick is persuasive and poignant when discussing most things.
But when it came to talking about UCLA and what transpired, he was
nondescript. He chose not to nor point blame in any direction.
</P>
<P>
   Mention the relationship with Lavin and Harrick's voice starts
to crackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the last to call, two or three times, and he didn't
return them,'' Harrick said. ``I know it isn't right. But life's
made up of choices. Steve made a choice in his life, and that's the
choice he made.''
</P>
<P>
   After what happened at UCLA, most coaches would have difficulty
finding another job. Harrick was out of the college game for less
than a year before landing the Rhode Island position. He went from
the Pacific-10 to the Atlantic-10, and the difference is more than
just which ocean the school is near.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations aren't to win a national championship, the
expectations are only to win, or try very hard to do so. Harrick's
been trying very hard and what people know or didn't know about his
past doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a reason to ask him about any of that,'' Rhode
Island assistant coach Jerry DeGregorio said. ``He's one of the
five nicest people I've met in my life, and I'd put my mom and dad
in that group. He's a warm, generous, sincere person. I don't need
to read anything about Jim Harrick because I work with him 12 hours
a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is pleasant enough along the Rhode Island coast that he's
remodeling a house that he plans on using until his coaching days
are finished. Harrick's not a part of Los Angeles, the place that
dominated so much of his life, but he is a quick car ride to
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And, in comparison to the weight brought on by being UCLA's
coach, Harrick is experiencing weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great for him,'' said Jim Harrick Jr., an assistant
at Rhode Island. ``He's so much more relaxed and enjoying the job
at Rhode Island so much more than any other job. I've never seen
him more happy than he is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   After last season's success _ the Rams were a fluke turnover
away from a Final Four berth _ the Rhode Island legislator agreed
to build Rhode Island an 8,000 to 10,000-seat arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're following the paths of UConn and UMass in what they've
done with building new facilities,'' Harrick said. ``We needed that
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick's won 389 games in a career that's seen one losing
season, 11 NCAA Tournament appearances and a national title.
</P>
<P>
   He's remembered, at least in Los Angeles, for two of the most
notable losses of UCLA history. The first was to Princeton in the
first round of the 1994 NCAA Tournament. The other was the loss of
his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer why the perception is like that,'' Cunningham
said. ``But right now, they talk about the problems more than the
national championship.''

job, I would say it deeply hurts him to this day that he's not the
coach there.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick may not have his dream job anymore, but he's moved on.
What lingers more than animosity from the firing is the feud
between Harrick and Lavin. They don't talk. Not since Harrick went
on ESPN in December of 1996 and said Lavin wouldn't be given the
UCLA job on a full-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the most unfortunate, difficult part, on a
personal level for me, just the fact that our friendship was a
casualty of those sets of circumstances,'' said Lavin, who spent
five years as Harrick's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember John Wooden, and the night I got the job he told me
he would be very surprised if by the end of the season Jim and I
were still talking. I didn't understand it at the time, but he,
obviously, was a little bit clairvoyant. He was aware that the
natural fallout was going to be the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until it's reconciled, it will always be painful because I
feel indebted and grateful to the man, and will always, because he
opened the door for me and gave me an opportunity of a lifetime,
and moved me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick is persuasive and poignant when discussing most things.
But when it came to talking about UCLA and what transpired, he was
nondescript. He chose not to nor point blame in any direction.
</P>
<P>
   Mention the relationship with Lavin and Harrick's voice starts
to crackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the last to call, two or three times, and he didn't
return them,'' Harrick said. ``I know it isn't right. But life's
made up of choices. Steve made a choice in his life, and that's the
choice he made.''
</P>
<P>
   After what happened at UCLA, most coaches would have difficulty
finding another job. Harrick was out of the college game for less
than a year before landing the Rhode Island position. He went from
the Pacific-10 to the Atlantic-10, and the difference is more than
just which ocean the school is near.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations aren't to win a national championship, the
expectations are only to win, or try very hard to do so. Harrick's
been trying very hard and what people know or didn't know about his
past doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a reason to ask him about any of that,'' Rhode
Island assistant coach Jerry DeGregorio said. ``He's one of the
five nicest people I've met in my life, and I'd put my mom and dad
in that group. He's a warm, generous, sincere person. I don't need
to read anything about Jim Harrick because I work with him 12 hours
a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is pleasant enough along the Rhode Island coast that he's
remodeling a house that he plans on using until his coaching days
are finished. Harrick's not a part of Los Angeles, the place that
dominated so much of his life, but he is a quick car ride to
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And, in comparison to the weight brought on by being UCLA's
coach, Harrick is experiencing weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great for him,'' said Jim Harrick Jr., an assistant
at Rhode Island. ``He's so much more relaxed and enjoying the job
at Rhode Island so much more than any other job. I've never seen
him more happy than he is right now.''
</P>
<P>
   After last season's success _ the Rams were a fluke turnover
away from a Final Four berth _ the Rhode Island legislator agreed
to build Rhode Island an 8,000 to 10,000-seat arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're following the paths of UConn and UMass in what they've
done with building new facilities,'' Harrick said. ``We needed that
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrick's won 389 games in a career that's seen one losing
season, 11 NCAA Tournament appearances and a national title.
</P>
<P>
   He's remembered, at least in Los Angeles, for two of the most
notable losses of UCLA history. The first was to Princeton in the
first round of the 1994 NCAA Tournament. The other was the loss of
his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer why the perception is like that,'' Cunningham
said. ``But right now, they talk about the problems more than the
national championship.''

CARDS' ONLY CHANCE IS TO REMAIN HUNGRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Stadium is nothing special. A dome with a hole in its roof
and a giant Nike swoosh plastered on one wall. A place for pin-up
cheerleaders, love-struck fans and theme music that blares after
every first down.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing special except for the mystique. The invisible,
two-stepping dragon.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals are content, they're cooked, available on the
menu of appetizers. If they're happy, they're history, and the only
thing left is the degree of embarrassment. Which, in the past, has
been nothing short of well done.
</P>
<P>
   But if they're still hungry and properly humiliated, they have a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to be intimidated by a) the
playoffs; b) the star on the side of their helmets; or c) the sight
of Texas Stadium,'' Lomas Brown said. ``I think we're going to be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that every team is given a clean slate in the
postseason, but the differences in perspective can be staggering.
Failure in Minnesota is not reaching the Super Bowl; the standard
in Arizona is slightly above showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the buffet of excuses: The Cardinals are on the rise.
They finally finished in the black, finally made the playoffs. They
have nothing to lose, a young team that needs to jump in the pool
before crossing the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the reality: At some point, the Cardinals need to beat a
good team. And at some point, they need to beat the Cowboys in a
game that means something.
</P>
<P>
   You might be lost in the euphoria, but across the country, the
Cardinals are still considered gangly outsiders. A team that has
yet to beat anyone with a winning record, for whom four of nine
victories came against teams searching for a new coach. The worst
of 12 playoff entries.
</P>
<P>
   And, yee haw, you know they are relieved in Dallas. Thankful the
Cowboys are not playing Tampa Bay or the New York Giants. Welcoming
an opponent they have beaten 15 of the past 16 times, including
nine straight at home. Fully expecting to put another bird on the
grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they are relieved,'' Brown said. ``I hope they do feel
that way. Then you set someone up for a big letdown because we are
coming to play.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be up to Vince Tobin and Dave McGinnis to find a way to
slow the Cowboys running attack, to put a helmet on Troy Aikman, to
keep the game from becoming a ball-control farce. It will be up to
the offense to step up to the table, recognize the stakes and find
a way to match and raise.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, the Cardinals must look at the Cowboys
in the same way the Cowboys look at them. A team that stands in
their way. A team they deserve to beat, even on enemy turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has shown the ability to break through any type of
psychological barriers,'' McGinnis said. ``We've just about run the
gamut, and I think we've been steeled by the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anything is possible. In 1994, McGinnis was a coach
with the Bears, a team that went 9-7, losing twice to the Vikings
in the regular season. Somehow, they walked into the Metrodome and
put a playoff pasting on their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, in 1996, the Vikings talked very much like
the Cardinals of today. About maturity, toughness and revenge. They
entered Texas Stadium as a wild card and got bombed, 40-15.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not what you say you believe. It's believing what you
say and proving it.
</P>
<P>
   After losing to the Cowboys in November, a day when all thoughts
turned to the wild card, Andre Wadsworth talked the talk. He
predicted they would meet again in the postseason, and when it
happened, he offered a bit of advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They better come correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, that tasks belongs to the Cardinals. A team that surely
realizes it won seven games by three or fewer points playing a
last-place schedule.
</P>
<P>
   A team that doesn't have to apologize for where it is _ as long
as it isn't apologizing after another 60 minutes in Dallas. &QL;

CARDS HOPE TO ROLL A 3  
 ODDS DON'T FAVOR COWBOYS 
</HEADLINE>
 VS COWBOYS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theoretically, the better team should always win. Shouldn't
matter where it's played. Shouldn't matter how many times the teams
have met.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional game like football, though, talent isn't always
the determining factor. Over a four-month season, players are lost
to injuries and young teams grow up.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that's what the Cardinals are banking on when their
postseason begins Saturday where their regular season began, at
Texas Stadium against the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, at 9-7, enter the playoffs as neophytes who
didn't beat a winning team. Two of their setbacks came against the
Cowboys, including a blowout loss in the opener at Texas Stadium,
where the Cardinals have not won since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals aren't for a moment predicting a victory in their
third meeting with the Cowboys. But they like their chances. It is
difficult for a team to beat another three times in one season. It
has been done only seven times in the NFL since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that was said in the locker room among the
players,'' center Aaron Graham said Monday, the day after a
last-second, 52-yard field goal by Chris Jacke gave the Cardinals a
16-13 win over San Diego and sent them to a 17th game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no prediction, but anybody in the league will tell you
it's tough to beat a team three times in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin is glad his players have confidence in what is
unfamiliar territory for a young roster. But he's a proponent of
talent being the determining factor, and he points out that Dallas
(10-6) has ``probably seven or eight guys who are among the best,
or are the best, at their positions in the league. We don't have
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably works both ways,'' Tobin said of the third
meeting. ``Being divisional foes, we're familiar with each other.
Where Dallas might have an advantage is they've beaten us
consistently through the years.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, the Cowboys have won 16 of 17 games against
the Cardinals, including a 13-game streak that ended last season
with the Cardinals' 25-22 win in overtime at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is typical of the young players on the roster who have
come from college programs that played regularly in high-stakes
bowl games. Twenty-eight players were not yet in the league when
Tobin became coach in 1996, and 45 have been added during the Tobin
regime.
</P>
<P>
   There are few ties to a not-too-storied past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Nebraska,'' Graham said, ``the first time we got
to a national championship game, we knew what was on the line, what
was at stake, but we walked away with a loss on a last-second field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also came away thinking that if we ever got that
opportunity again, we were not going to lose. If I could say one
thing to my team this week, it would be to have that attitude. This
shouldn't be `I hope we win,' or `it would be great if we win.' We
have to go in with the attitude that we are going to win and keep
this going. If we do that, we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1970, of the 36 games matching foes for the third time in
a season, 11 involved regular season sweeps. Seven of those became
3-0 sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were dominated in the opener, 38-10, distracted
somewhat by first-round draft pick Andre Wadsworth's ending his
holdout the night before, and then by defensive tackle Eric Swann's
being ejected in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   They believe they should have won the second, a 35-28 loss at
home on Nov. 15 that ended with a no-call in the end zone. The
Cardinals contended that receiver Rob Moore was interfered with by
Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Cardinals won that game, they would be hosting this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new season and anything can happen,'' Tobin said.
``Dallas has been in the playoffs many years. We're trying to get
where they have been. A team that's been to the mountaintop doesn't
like to give it up to a team that hasn't been there.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs are new, but winning close, pivotal games is not.
The Cardinals' seven wins in games decided by three or fewer points
set an NFL record. Their last three were won by a field goal on the
final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure is when you are unprepared,'' said Aeneas Williams, a
five-time Pro Bowl cornerback who in the last game against Dallas
ended Michael Irvin's consecutive-game receiving streak at 117. ``I
think we have done a good job over and over in the face of
adversity. Whenever you go down to the wire, you learn something
every time. Now, instead of finding ways to lose games, we are
finding ways to win them. I think that is going to help us make a
quantum leap to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the Cardinals have to get better in the basic
elements that swing football games: running the ball and stopping
the run. They did neither well in their regular season finale, nor
in the last game against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're not quaking in their boots that they have to
play the Cardinals,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rule of Threes suggests the Cowboys better not take it
for granted. &QL;
