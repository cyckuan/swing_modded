	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Giving gifts to International Olympic
Committee members during the Olympic Games bidding process was good
manners, not corruption, the president of the organizing committee
for the Athens 2004 games said Wednesday.
	   The corruption crisis which has engulfed the IOC since claims
that some IOC members routinely accept bribes for their vote was a
small problem because no city selected had so far put on a bad
Olympics, said Stratis Stratigis, president of the Athens
Organizing Committee (ATHOC) for the 2004 Olympic Games.
	   ``I think it is a minor problem,'' Stratigis said. ``Cities get
the Olympics when they are capable of organizing the games.
	   ``So experience has shown that the cities which were selected
did organize proper games.''
	   IOC member Marc Hodler cast the Olympic world into turmoil on
Saturday with claims that the Olympics have been systematically
bought and sold and that some IOC members accepted money or favors
in return for their votes.
	   The claims followed admissions by Salt Lake City officials that
the bid committee for 2002 Winter Olympics gave scholarships to
relatives of IOC members and may have paid hundreds of thousands of
dollars in cash to agents professing to sell blocs of IOC votes.
	   Hodler has described the Salt Lake scholarship fund as a bribe.
	   Hodler also said that shadowy ``agents'' _ including at least
one IOC member _ promised blocs of votes for cash payments. One
such agent, Hodler said, may have received U.S. dlrs 100,000 in
cash and free treatment for hepatitis after moving to Salt Lake
while the city was seeking the bid.
	   In Australia, newspapers reported this week that cash payments
of between
	   5,000 to 10,000 Australian dollars were made to IOC members
during the failed Melbourne 1996 Olympic bid process.
	   The Australian newspaper quoted senior members of the Melbourne
bid committee admitting to the payments but denying they were given
in exchange for votes.
	   The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Sydney bid officials
channeled several million dollars of ``leftover'' money to the
Australian Olympic Committee to sway crucial wavering African votes
and win the 2000 Games.
	   The Herald reported the AOC set up a trust fund with the money
to administer an African Olympic Training Center at Canberra's
Australian Institute of Sport.
	   It was a political move credited with ensuring Sydney's bid
success.
	   Stratigis, in Sydney to observe the work of Sydney's Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Games, said he wasn't part of the bid
committee for the 2004 games and he was not aware of any corruption
during the bidding process.
	   He said the scandal was hurting the Olympic movement.
	   ``It has a damaging undertone . . . there have been a lot of
rumors going
	   around that the whole process of selecting can be influenced,''
Stratigis said.
	   ``But . . . so far, I don't think there have been wrong
selections.''
	   He said IOC members accepting gifts and memorabilia from bidding
cities was not corruption.
	   ``These are manners, not gifts,'' he said.
	   ``I think it is good manners if you and visit somebody to give
them a tie
	   or to give them a cufflink or to invite him for a proper lunch.
	   ``If somebody came with a 34-carat cufflink, I don't think this
is something one can accept.''
	   He said accepting a tour of Sydney harbor on a private yacht or
a trip to
	   an island near Athens was not a bribe. (rs/djp)

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
returned to Earth in triumph late Tuesday, ending NASA's first
space station-building mission.
	   It was a rare nighttime landing.
	   Endeavour swooped through the clear, chilly sky and landed on
the xenon-lit runway at 10:53 p.m.
	   ``Thanks a lot for an awesome job starting our space station
adventure,'' Mission Control told the six astronauts, calling out
each of their names, as soon as the shuttle rolled to a neat stop.
	   ``It's great to be home after such an exciting mission,''
replied commander Robert Cabana, who along with his crew connected
the first two pieces of the international space station.
	   Throughout the afternoon, thick rain clouds had hovered over the
landing strip. But the sky cleared by dusk, and Mission Control
gave Cabana the go-ahead for an on-time touchdown.
	   NASA's weather rules are especially stringent for nighttime
landings. This was only the 10th time in 17{ years of space shuttle
flight that astronauts returned in darkness.
	   Endeavour resembled a comet as it streaked over the Gulf of
Mexico and across Florida, its path tracked by infrared cameras.
	   Cabana and his crew were ready for a holiday break following
their exhausting yet satisfying journey, which spanned nearly 12
days and 4.6 million miles.
	   Before exiting the shuttle, they were warned it was a nippy 48
degrees outside. ``Must be getting close to Christmas,'' answered
Cabana.
	   Cabana had Christmas on his mind earlier in the day as well.
	   ``We can't wait to get back and see our families and have a
great Christmas,'' he said before rocketing out of orbit. ``It's
been a super mission. It's been unbelievable building a space
station.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Two of the astronauts _ Jerry Ross and James Newman _ made three
spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity together and attach antennas and
other equipment. The crew also spent a full day inside the station,
hooking up electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. The next construction mission is in May.
	   Until then, the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space station will circle
the Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and
Moscow.
	   ``Let's not project forward that everything's going to be
easy,'' said NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin, among the
approximately 150 people who gathered at the runway to welcome the
crew. ``This is tough stuff, and that's why we're going to space.''
	   As the shuttle team prepared for Endeavour's homecoming, two of
the three men who flew around the moon over Christmas 1968 gathered
at the Kennedy Space Center for a 30th anniversary celebration.
	   Apollo 8's Jim Lovell and Bill Anders paid tribute to the
astronauts soaring overhead and, a few hours later, watched them
land.
	   ``I'm so proud of what they've done,'' said Lovell, who also
flew to the moon on Apollo 13.

Armageddon at the Asian Games, Thai soccer players turn to
</HEADLINE>
religion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The favorite after-competition activity
of athletes at the Asian Games is watching the Hollywood disaster
epic ``Armageddon.''
	   It's so popular, and free, that organizers at the Athletes
Village have had to add a fifth showing each day.
	   But Armageddon star Bruce Willis is battling Hong Kong martial
arts actor Jackie Chan, who has also been drawing capacity crowds
to the 300-seat theater.
	   Next in popularity among athletes and officials are disco
dancing and karaoke crooning.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MORE MIRACLES: Thailand's ``miracle'' soccer team skipped
practice in favor of a religious ceremony to prepare for its Asian
Games semifinal against Kuwait.
	   The team also consulted Suriya Ariyawongsophon, a well-known
astrologer who had predicted the Thais would beat the powerful
South Koreans in the quarterfinals.
	   In what was hailed as a miracle victory, the Thais, with only
nine men on the field, stunned South Korea 2-1 in extra time
Monday. They faced Kuwait Wednesday for the right to advance to the
gold medal game.
	   Meanwhile, thousands of local fans flocked to ticket booths for
the Kuwait game and police were being reinforced to guard against
any unruly behavior.
	   A capacity crowd of 60,000 was guaranteed and as many as 30
million people, or every other Thai, were expected to watch the
game on television.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BIG WINNER: Thailand's prestigious Thammasat University will be
among the major winners at the Asian Games.
	   After the 41-nation event ends Dec. 20, some 4,500 units at the
Athletes Village will be converted into student and faculty housing
while the remaining 500 are to be used for athletes in training.
	   Besides the Athletes Village, several state of the art stadiums
were built on the university campus for the games.

South Korean scientists claim a step forward in human cloning
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean medical team said
Wednesday it had made an important advance in the cloning of human
cells to create replacement organs.
	   Using what is known as the ``Honolulu technique,'' the South
Korean team said it cultivated four embryonic cells from a single
cell implanted in a woman's ovum.
	   The technique has drawn worldwide attention since University of
Hawaii researchers announced in July that they used it to create
more than 50 carbon-copy mice.
	   The South Korean team was headed by Dr. Lee Bo-yeon, a professor
at Kyonghee University in Seoul.
	   Lee's team first removed the genetic nucleus of an egg donated
by a woman and then used a tiny needle to fill the empty egg with
the nucleus of one of her body cells.
	   It then cultivated the egg until it grew into a four-nucleus
cell, a step before developing into a human cell. Lee's team
stopped there because a resolution adopted by South Korean
scientists in 1993 banned taking the experiment farther.
	   The next step would have been implanting the egg into a woman's
womb and letting it grow into stem cells _ primordial cells from
which all of a human's bodily tissues and organs develop.
	   ``Our experiment marked the first time that the more reliable
cloning technology has been applied to human cells and might make
human cloning more feasible,'' Lee told The Associated Press.
	   Lee said, however, that the advance made by his team was a step
away from what U.S. scientists have achieved in developing stem
cells that can be implanted in a woman's womb for a human embryo.
	   University of Wisconsin scientists have reported success in
growing stem cells in a dish using clumps of cells that were grown
from fertilized eggs. Scientists from Johns Hopkins also grew stem
cells from egg cells taken from aborted fetuses.
	   Lee's team said its technique was more reliable than the one
used to create Dolly the sheep, which other laboratories so far
have failed to duplicate.
	   In initially announcing the results of the research on Tuesday,
Lee said a team of British scientists previously succeeded in a
similar experiment. But he said Wednesday he may have been
misinformed. Britain has laws banning research into human
reproductive cloning.
	   ``The cloning of human embryos should be encouraged for
scientific research to create replacement hearts and other organs.
It will eventually help human beings,'' Lee said.
	   Cultured stem cells, scientists say, could produce new heart
cells, or new insulin-producing cells for the treatment of
diabetes.
	   Following the announcement by the South Korean scientists, about
two dozen religious and civic activists held a rally in front of
Kyunghee Hospital, shouting for discontinuation of the ``inhuman
research.''
	   One protest sign read: ``Who am I? I don't want to be a cloned
human being.''
	   The announcement comes as South Korea's Parliament is pushing
legislation banning cloning of human cells except for research on
cancer or other diseases.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Games record holder Yuichiro Kamiyama
beat Japanese teammate Noriaki Mabuchi in two straight races
Wednesday, winning the men's sprint cycling gold medal of the Asian
Games.
	   The women's sprint final was an all-Chinese contest, with Wang
Yan, also a games record holder, winning in two straight races over
Jiang Cuihua.
	   Kamiyama's winning times were 11.346 seconds and 11.447, both
slower than his games mark of 10.567, set in preliminaries Monday.
	   For the bronze medal, South Korea's Hyun Ryung-chul beat China's
Liu Yadong in two straight races.
	   Wang's winning rides were 14.463 and 13.450, well behind her
games record of 11.725 set in 1994.
	   Taiwan's Fang Fen-fang lost the first race but beat teammate Lu
Yi-wen in the next two for the bronze medal

British minister's apology is too late for ``home children''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ They were called ``home children'' and about
100,000 of them, classified as orphans, were sent from England to
Canada between 1867 and 1939.
	   But a British cabinet minister's admission this week that the
policy was misguided comes several decades too late for people like
Herbert Fry of Stanbridge East, Quebec.
	   At the age of 14, Fry was sent from an orphanage in Somerset,
England, to Canada, a land whose streets, he was told, were ``paved
with sheets of gold.''
	   He arrived in 1924, and days later found himself on a pig farm
in Quebec's Eastern Townships.
	   He spent the next seven years laboring daily for 25 cents a
week, paid to him by the farm owners who provided him with a bed
and three meals a day.
	   Forty years later, Fry found out he wasn't an orphan _ in fact,
he was taken from his parents when they separated and placed in an
orphanage.
	   He also learned he had three sisters.
	   ``He was very bitter about that, about being taken from his
parents,'' Fry's wife Lorette said in a telephone interview from
her home in Stanbridge East.
	   ``He didn't come over by choice ... He doesn't know anything
about his mother and his father,'' she said, speaking on behalf of
her hard-of-hearing husband.
	   Britain sent a total of about 160,000 children, some as young as
five, to ``white Commonwealth countries,'' including Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, under migration schemes between the
1850s and the 1960s.
	   On Monday, British Health Secretary Frank Dobson released a
landmark statement, offering the government's sympathy ``and my
sincere regrets.''
	   Britain has pledged to create a fund to help home children
unable to visit their native country to meet with immediate family
members. It has also promised to create a database to help chart
the case histories of child migrants.
	   Mark Norton, who works in the British High Commission in Ottawa,
said the original home-children policy was intended to help poor
youngsters and orphans.
	   ``Many of the children were destined for Victorian workhouses,''
Norton said. ``The government believed it was giving them a new
opportunity to lead a better life.
	   ``But there are instances where this didn't happen at all.''
	   David Lorente, who runs Home Children Canada, a support network,
said the plan outlined by Dobson is primarily directed at
Australians.
	   The last home children came to Canada before 1939 but Britain
sent youngsters to Australia until 1967.
	   Lorente said most of the relatives in England of Canadian home
children are dead.
	   ``People in Canada have lived all their lives not knowing
anything about their families,'' Lorente said. ``People in
Australia have only lived half their lives.''
	   Lorente said two-thirds of the home children in Canada were
abused _ physically, sexually, or mentally _ by their mentors.
	   He said many home children weren't orphans.
	   ``There were too many kids on the streets in London, so they
packed them up and shipped them out. It was the cheapest way to
handle the political, economic and social problems.''

Just one of 300 athletes tested so far failed doping tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Only one Asian Games athlete has tested
positive for drugs among the 300 for whom tests have been
completed, a games medical official said Wednesday.
	   About 800 athletes are expected to be tested by the time
competition ends on Sunday. More than 6,000 athletes from 41
countries are competing in 36 sports.
	   At the last Asian Games four years ago in Hiroshima, Japan, 15
athletes out of 700 tested were found to have used banned
substances, said Dr. Rueangsak Siriphol, chairman of the games'
medical control subcommittee.
	   This time, several athletes were thrown off their national teams
before the games began as a result of pre-games testing. Those
announced publicly included four South Korean gymnasts, a South
Korean swimmer and a Japanese billiards player.
	   Rueangsak said Wednesday that some Thai athletes also were kept
off their national team after failing pre-game tests, but he was
unable to give the exact number or any other details.
	   The only athlete at the games to fail a doping test so far was
Jordanian weightlifter Ayed Khawaldeh, who tested positive for the
banned substance triamterene. Triamterene is a diuretic, used to
help lose weight, allowing a competitor to compete in lower weight
categories. Diuretics can also be used to mask the use of other
drugs.
	   Khawaldeh, 25, was disqualified on Dec. 9 after the results of
his test were sent to the Olympic Committee of Asia. He was not a
medal winner, and had been tested at random.
	   Rueangsak also said that all of the 1,800 female competitors who
took gender tests had passed. The genetic tests look for the
presence of the Y male chromosome.
	   ``All the tests show they are females according to their genes.
But their appearance. ... I am not sure,'' joked Rueangsak about
some of the more formidable-looking women athletes.
	   There are almost 2,000 women athletes taking part in the games,
and they are entitled to waive gender testing if they have
certification from previous Olympic-sanctioned events. However,
many have taken the tests voluntarily this time in an effort to
standardize documentation, said Rueangsak.

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Four Central American nations will
need dlrs 10 billion to repair damage to their economic
infrastructure from Hurricane Mitch, the Central American Economic
Integration bank has reported.
	   The bank, a regional lending agency supported by five Central
American nations plus Mexico, Taiwan and Argentina, said the money
was needed ``to repair and rehabilitate the economic apparatus.''
	   ``Central America won't get ahead without this amount of
money,'' bank President Jose Alejandro Arevalo said Tuesday.
	   The hurricane, which struck in early November, did the worst
damage in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.
	   Current foreign relief aid to those countries now total more
than dlrs 1.5 billion.

Chief inspector: Iraq did not fully cooperate with inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new material from Butler's report;
elaborates quote from U.S. diplomat. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler said in a report Tuesday that Iraq did not fully cooperate
with U.N. inspectors as it promised a month ago and imposed new
restrictions on their work.
	   ``Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in
either the fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited
weapons programs,'' Butler said in a report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Iraq pledged to resume full cooperation with the inspectors and
allow unfettered access to sites and documents on Nov. 14, under
threat of U.S. and British airstrikes. Butler accused Baghdad of
blocking access to two sites and hindering inspection of others.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to compel Baghdad to cooperate _ and a U.S. diplomat said
that option remains open.
	   ``We believe we have the authority we need under previous
Security Council resolutions to act and all options are on the
table,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``It's pretty serious and makes some strong conclusions,'' the
diplomat said of Butler's report. ``The president will review those
conclusions with his senior advisers.''
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution says a comprehensive review
of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions _ which Baghdad
desperately wants _ would only go ahead if Butler reported that
Iraq had resumed full cooperation with inspectors.
	   But Annan suggested in a letter to the council president
accompanying the report that council members had three options:
	   _They could decide that Iraq's performance does not justify a
comprehensive review at this time.
	   _They could decide that Iraq should be given additional time to
provide full cooperation.
	   _They could proceed with a comprehensive review ``on the premise
that it is sufficiently important to know precisely what has been
achieved in the area of disarmament over the entire period since
1991.''
	   Under the cease-fire resolution that ended the Gulf War in 1991,
sanctions against the sale of oil, the mainstay of Iraq's economy,
cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission, which Butler
heads, and the International Atomic Energy Agency certify that
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _ chemical, biological and
nuclear as well as long-range missiles _ have been destroyed.
	   The Iraqis believe a comprehensive review offers the quickest
route to lifting sanctions. But the United States insists that
there is no link, and that a review will only show what Iraq needs
to do to fully disarm.
	   While Butler's 10-page report was hard-hitting and fairly
negative, the IAEA's report concluded that Iraq had provided ``the
necessary level of cooperation'' to enable its nuclear inspectors
to complete their work ``efficiently and effectively.''
	   Mohamed El Baradei, the IAEA's director general, said in a
letter to Annan that Iraq pledged to cooperate with the IAEA to
resolve ``the few remaining questions and concerns related to
Iraq's clandestine nuclear program.''
	   In contrast, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction,
evasion and subterfuge which he said made it impossible for him to
assure the Security Council that Baghdad's weapons of mass
destruction have been eliminated.
	   Iraq's claim that it has fulfilled all of its disarmament
obligations and does not possess banned weapons or the ability to
make them ``cannot be accepted without further verification,'' he
said.
	   Butler said the U.N. Special Commission had ``clear evidence
that Iraq had taken advance actions at certain of the locations
planned for inspection in order to defeat the purposes of
inspection.''
	   During the past week, inspectors searching for material related
to banned weapons programs went to six locations and were allowed
to search the Taji military facility, a special security
organization cable office, and a private residence, Butler said.
	   But inspectors trying to enter the ruling Baath Party
headquarters _ where they had ``solid evidence of the presence of
proscribed materials'' _ couldn't gain access because Iraq
initially declared it to be a ``sensitive'' site subject to special
procedures and later introduced new requirements, including a
letter indicating what was being sought, Butler said.
	   At two other sites declared ``sensitive'' by Iraq, negotiations
ultimately cleared the way for inspections, he said. But one
building had been emptied of relevant materials, and the other
``had been prepared to avoid any disclosure of relevant materials
and the team assessed Iraq had expected their arrival,'' he said.
	   In light of this, Butler said he had decided not to conduct the
full range of inspections the team had planned _ and no inspection
of presidential sites took place.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   ``It remains the commission's strong view that, under the
present circumstances, relevant documentation must exist in Iraq
and that provision of such documentation is the best hope for
revealing the full picture'' of the country's weapons programs, he
said.
	   Butler said Iraq did not provide documents related to chemical
and biological weapons, refused access to archives of the Ministry
of Defense, the Military Industrialization Corporation and other
government departments, and refused to hand over documents found by
inspectors at Iraqi Air Force headquarters in July on chemical
munitions.
	   Baghdad did hand over documents relating to missiles although
Butler said ``a preliminary assessment indicates that they do not
contain the information sought by the commission.'' The Iraqis also
provided a report on their analysis of missile warhead fragments
for VX nerve agent.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
returned to Earth in triumph late Tuesday, ending NASA's first
space station-building mission.
	   It was a rare nighttime landing.
	   Endeavour swooped through the clear, chilly sky and landed on
the xenon-lit runway at 10:53 p.m.
	   ``Thanks a lot for an awesome job starting our space station
adventure,'' Mission Control told the six astronauts, calling out
each of their names, as soon as the shuttle rolled to a neat stop.
	   ``It's great to be home after such an exciting mission,''
replied commander Robert Cabana, who along with his crew connected
the first two pieces of the international space station.
	   Later, as he walked around the shuttle, Cabana almost seemed
overwhelmed by what he and his crew had achieved.
	   ``Wow! What can I say after a mission like that?'' he asked.
``We are just so happy to have gotten the international space
station off to such a super start.''
	   Throughout the afternoon, thick rain clouds had hovered over the
landing strip. But the sky cleared by dusk, and Mission Control
gave Cabana the go-ahead for an on-time touchdown.
	   NASA's weather rules are especially stringent for nighttime
landings. This was only the 10th time in 17{ years of space shuttle
flight that astronauts returned in darkness.
	   Endeavour resembled a comet as it streaked over the Gulf of
Mexico and across Florida, its path tracked by infrared cameras.
	   Cabana and his crew were ready for a holiday break following
their exhausting yet satisfying journey, which spanned nearly 12
days and 4.6 million miles.
	   Before exiting the shuttle, they were warned it was a nippy 48
degrees outside. ``Must be getting close to Christmas,'' answered
Cabana.
	   Cabana had Christmas on his mind earlier in the day as well.
	   ``We can't wait to get back and see our families and have a
great Christmas,'' he said before rocketing out of orbit. ``It's
been a super mission. It's been unbelievable building a space
station.''
	   The five Americans and one Russian set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Two of the astronauts _ Jerry Ross and James Newman _ made three
spacewalks to wire Zarya and Unity together and attach antennas and
other equipment. The crew also spent a full day inside the station,
hooking up electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. The next construction mission is in May.
	   Until then, the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space station will circle
the Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and
Moscow.
	   ``Let's not project forward that everything's going to be
easy,'' said NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin, among the
approximately 150 people who gathered at the runway to welcome the
crew. ``This is tough stuff, and that's why we're going to space.''
	   As the shuttle team prepared for Endeavour's homecoming, two of
the three men who flew around the moon over Christmas 1968 gathered
at the Kennedy Space Center for a 30th anniversary celebration.
	   Apollo 8's Jim Lovell and Bill Anders paid tribute to the
astronauts soaring overhead and, a few hours later, watched them
land.
	   ``I'm so proud of what they've done,'' said Lovell, who also
flew to the moon on Apollo 13.

WASHINGTON TODAY: Middle East trip overshadowed by impeachment
</HEADLINE>
process &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Over there, people smile, wave American flags
and cheer you.
	   That's one reason U.S. presidents get recharged _ and sometimes
seek solace _ in trips abroad. It's a chance to bask in being
presidential without having to deal with a contentious Congress.
	   But there are times when even foreign trips won't let them
escape the controversy back home. For President Clinton, an
otherwise historic trip to the Middle East this week is being
obscured in an impeachment sand storm.
	   Clinton came home late Tuesday from the three-day visit,
returning to a situation more perilous for him than it was before
he left. Even flying back, he was losing crucial ground among
Republican moderates who previously had been undecided.
	   And while polls still show a majority of Americans don't want
him impeached, some surveys suggest an increasing number would
rather see him resign than stand trial in the Senate.
	   So could he separate personal predicament from official duties
while on the trip?
	   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``You need to show up for work every
day. It's not a complicated thing.''
	   But it's not that simple a thing, either.
	   An example: The first two questions at a picture-taking session
in Gaza with Yasser Arafat dealt with whether Clinton had committed
perjury and his view of GOP calls for his resignation.
	   ``Bill Clinton has played the 'traveling presidency' with a
vengeance since Monica Lewinsky hit the news: Russia, Chile, China,
Africa, South Africa, Northern Ireland, Japan and now the Middle
East. Too bad he doesn't get frequent flyer miles,'' joked Stephen
Wayne, a Georgetown University political scientist and author of a
book on presidential leadership.
	   Even so, Wayne thinks Clinton is probably better off for taking
the trips _ including this week's _ if only for the ``pictures
shown back home .... It reinforces the notion that he's working on
the public's business.''
	   Even when peppered by questions on impeachment while standing
alongside a foreign leader, ``I think he looks presidential in the
way he patiently answers them,'' Wayne said.
	   Not all analysts agree.
	   ``I don't see that it did him much good to be abroad, regardless
of the substance of the trip,'' said Stephen Hess, a senior scholar
at the Brookings Institution who worked in the Eisenhower and Nixon
White Houses. ``It's like the children's game of rock and paper and
scissors. The paper of impeachment will cover the rock of anything
else.''
	   Was Clinton's mission hampered by the pending impeachment vote?
	   There's no doubt he received a hero's welcome in Gaza, but the
jury's still out on whether Clinton's overall visit put the peace
process back on track, as he claimed.
	   ``It's a bumpy track,'' said Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser, after Clinton failed to persuade Israel
to resume West Bank troop withdrawals called for under the Wye
River peace accord.
	   But that did not negate the fact that Clinton, the first
American president to visit Palestinian-ruled territory, witnessed
Palestinian leaders voting to annul a longtime stumbling block to
peace, their charter's call for the destruction of Israel.
	   Under the cloud of Watergate, President Nixon flew to Moscow in
early July 1974 to meet Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev. Nixon
hoped the summit would divert attention from Watergate. But it
didn't.
	   They signed a limited ban on underground nuclear tests and a few
other modest arms agreements. Brezhnev said the agreements ``could
have been broader,'' and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger blamed
pending impeachment efforts as hampering Nixon in negotiating.
	   A few weeks later, the House Judiciary Committee voted out three
articles of impeachment. On Aug. 9, Nixon resigned.
	   President Bush, whose love of foreign policy may have
contributed to his political downfall, used an overseas trip as a
post-election tonic.
	   After losing to Clinton in November 1992, Bush moped around a
bit _ then headed abroad. He paid a New Year's Day visit to U.S.
troops in Somalia, then went to Moscow for a farewell visit to
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and stopped in Paris for a chat
with President Francois Mitterrand.

Report: East Timor rebel wants vote after decade of autonomy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: One name correct for Suharto &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Jailed East Timor rebel leader Xanana
Gusmao backs an Indonesian autonomy proposal for his troubled
homeland on condition a referendum on full independence is held
after 10 years, the official Antara news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Separately, a visiting United Nations envoy is worried an
upsurge in violence could disrupt a new peace process for the
half-island territory.
	   U.N. diplomat Jamsheed Marker, who arrived in Jakarta on
Tuesday, called on the Indonesian military and East Timorese rebel
forces to show restraint in the former Portuguese colony invaded by
Indonesia in 1975.
	   Long-running U.N.-sponsored talks between Indonesia and Portugal
were revitalized earlier this year when Indonesia offered to grant
autonomy to East Timor.
	   The change in Indonesia's policy toward East Timor followed the
resignation last May of longtime autocratic President Suharto who
ordered the invasion 23 years ago and refused to compromise on its
status.
	   East Timor has been wracked by guerrilla war and human rights
abuses since it was annexed as Indonesia's 27th province in 1976.
	   Suharto's successor President B.J. Habibie put forward the
autonomy offer in exchange for international recognition of
Indonesian sovereignty. However, he has flatly rejected demands by
pro-independence activists for an immediate referendum.
	   In an apparent compromise, Gusmao suggested that a ballot be
conducted among East Timor's 800,000 people after 10 years of
autonomy, Antara reported.
	   Clashes between guerrillas and Indonesian troops have increased
in recent weeks. Protests by pro-independence activists have also
risen in size and frequency.
	   Despite the rising violence, Antara quoted Gusmao as saying he
hoped East Timor's troubles might be solved after Indonesia holds
elections next year as part of a push for political reform.
	   The sprawling Southeast Asian nation is now enduring its worst
economic and political turmoil in 30 years.
	   ``Indonesia has many problems that should be solved immediately,
not only the problem of East Timor,'' Gusmao said.
	   He described Habibie's six-month-old government as more
``moderate'' than Suharto's regime.
	   His comments were made in a joint interview in a Jakarta prison
with Antara and LUSA, the national news agency of Portugal.
	   The two agencies last Saturday signed an agreement to cooperate
as part of wider moves to heal a diplomatic rift betwen the two
nations.
	   Gusmao is serving a 20-year sentence for leading a bloody
guerrilla war against Indonesian troops.
	   Despite his imprisonment, he is regarded internationally as a
key player in moves to secure peace for East Timor.
	   Marker, who will visit East Timor this weekend and hold talks
with Habibie next week, is scheduled to meet Gusmao on Thursday.

Apartment house collapses in Rome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A five-story apartment house collapsed Wednesday,
and dozens of residents were feared buried in the rubble, news
reports said.
	   The building, in a modern, middle-class area of Rome, collapsed
at dawn, apparently for structural reasons, state-run RAI-TV said.
	   Five people were reportedly pulled out alive by the first rescue
workers to reach the scene.
	   The house, with a printing plant on the ground floor, was
reported built in the 1950s.

Basuki advances to Asian Games women's final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Third seed Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia
found her game in the first set tie-break and pounded out a 7-6
(7-3), 6-1 victory Wednesday over China's Li Fang, advancing to the
Asian Games tennis final.
	   For the women's gold medal, Basuki will play the winner of
Wednesday's later match between top seed Tamarine Tanasugarn and
China's Yi Jingqian.
	   Basuki, ranked No. 56 by the WTA, played evenly with No. 40 Li
through the first 12 games, but then took control, finishing off
the first set with a serve and volley.
	   Her heavy hitting from the baseline often left Li out of
position in the second set, but she mixed in shots like a lob
volley over Li's head.
	   In a men's quarterfinal, Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi beat South
Korea's Lee Hyung-taik 6-4, 7-5.
	   South Korea's Yoon Yong-il and India's Srinath Prahlad had won
semifinal places on Tuesday.
	   India's best hope, Leander Paes, who stands 91st in the ATP
rankings, had to drop out of the games with an injury. He was the
only Asian in the rankings' top 100.

U.N. agency advises against turning back on Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Western nations should avoid treating Russia as an
economic basket case and help it back on its feet, according to a
U.N. survey released today.
	   ``There's a general tendency to despair of Russia and walk away
from it at the moment, but that doesn't seem to us very sensible or
politically very wise,'' said Paul Rayment, head of economic
analysis at the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe.
	   Uncertainty in Russia posed the greatest potential risk to
improving economies in East Europe, the commission said in its
178-page Economic Survey of Europe.
	   East European exports to Russia are expected to drop by 20
percent to 25 percent for 1998 on last year, Rayment said.
	   Slow growth rates in Western Europe _ with estimates being cut
to 2\ percent from 3 percent _ will also hit eastern Europe hard
next year, he said.
	   Russia's economic collapse is ``by no means a unique event,''
the survey cautioned, pointing to smaller downturns in Ukraine and
Moldova.
	   Russia itself should present a ``carefully sequenced program''
to create the basic structures of a market economy and convince the
G-7 group of industrialized nations to provide help, the survey
added.
	   A $22.6 billion loan package put together by the International
Monetary Fund has been frozen since Russia defaulted on some of its
debts and devalued the ruble in mid-August.
	   The IMF has demanded that Russia draw up a sound budget as a
requirement for more loans.

Report: Toyota to slash domestic output
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's largest automaker will slash its domestic
production capacity in response to sluggish cars sales amid the
nation's worst recession in decades, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Toyota Motor Corp. will reduce its annual group production
capacity to 3.5 million four-wheel vehicles from the current 3.8
million over a three-year period, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said.
	   Ririko Takeuchi, a Toyota spokeswoman, said the company is now
mapping out a new three-year plan starting in fiscal 1999. But she
added that nothing has been decided.
	   The report in Japan's leading business daily said the reduction
will be the first in production capacity for Toyota, which
manufactured 3.5 million vehicles last year at its domestic plants.
	   The cuts will be made through the closure of some old production
lines or the integration of some of those producing similar models,
the Nihon Keizai said. However, no job cuts are planned, it said.
	   ``It's a long-anticipated move by the automaker, where overall
auto production is way over capacity in Japan,'' said Chikao
Masuzawa, an analyst at ING Baring Securities (Japan).
	   On Wednesday, Toyota Motor said its total domestic automobile
production fell 7.3 percent in November from the year-earlier month
to 267,020 vehicles, marking the ninth straight month of declines.
	   In its latest monthly report, Toyota said exports dropped 4.6
percent on year to 125,985 vehicles as a result of reductions in
shipments to Asia, Europe and other regions.
	   With the November figures, Takeuchi said Toyota's aggregate
domestic production totaled 2.932 million in the first 11 months of
this year, down 9.8 percent from the same period last year.

Political rivalry overshadows national independence day

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Thousands of Bangladeshis waving
red-and-green national flags converged Wednesday at a monument to
those who died fighting Pakistan in independence-day celebrations
overshadowed by political feuding.
	   The jubilant crowds joined President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed
and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in placing wreaths of flowers at
the monument at Savar outside Dhaka. Military gunners fired 21
times to salute the estimated 3 million people killed during the
nine-month war.
	   On Dec. 16, 1971, Pakistani soldiers surrendered to Indian
troops who backed Bangladesh in the war. Until the surrender,
Bangladesh was the eastern part of Pakistan _ the two halves
separated by 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) of Indian territory.
	   The national day celebrations meant different things to
different political parties.
	   ``We have established democracy and the task now is to reduce
poverty and (spread) education and health care to our people,''
Hasina said in an independence-day message.
	   Her political foe, former Prime Minister Zia Khaleda, head of
the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, accuses the
government of authoritarian rule and incompetence.
	   ``We will have to build up movement to end the misrule of this
government,'' Mrs. Zia said in her independence-day message.
	   Her party has called a number of general strikes in the past few
months, the latest three days ago to protest the governing party's
alleged fraud in a parliamentary by-election.
	   Zia's BNP has promised to hold more strikes and street protests
to force Hasina to resign and announce fresh polls ahead of those
scheduled in 2001.
	   ``Confrontation and promotion of narrow political interests have
weakened our political leadership which is now bereft of a
vision,'' Dhaka's Daily Star newspaper wrote in an editorial
Wednesday.
	   In the last 27 years, Bangladesh has witnessed two presidents
assassinated, three military coups and 19 other failed coup
attempts. It was under military or authoritarian rule for nearly 15
years.
	   The country's first free and fair elections in more than a
decade were held in 1991 when Mrs. Zia replaced military ruler Gen.
Hossain Muhammad Ershad.
	   Mrs. Zia was forced to resign in 1996 after two years of strikes
and street protests launched by then-opposition leader Hasina, who
won elections later that year.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Owed millions of dollars for unpaid
overseas telephone calls, the Cambodian government has ordered
local banks to halt money transfers of mobile telephone companies
to force them to pay their debts.
	   The order against five mobile phone companies operating in
Cambodia was issued by the government two weeks ago in efforts to
claim an estimated dlrs 10 million in unpaid overseas connection
fees, a Ministry of Post and Telecommunications official, Koy Kim
Sea, said Wednesday.
	   The Finance Ministry, struggling to increase revenues as it
prepares next year's budget, instructed the National Bank of
Cambodia to freeze the mobile phone providers' assets inside
Cambodia, which then passed the order on to commercial banks.
	   ``The government Cabinet realized they were short of money and
the telephone companies owed the ministry a lot of money,'' Koy Kim
Sea said.
	   The severity of the move has angered phone company managers, who
complain that the debts were caused by the many customers in
Cambodia who have not paid their bills over the years.
	   But the freeze has apparently been effective. All five companies
have either paid off the debts or have agreed to enter payment
plans of up to 18 months, an official at the ministry's accounting
department, Vuth Din, said Wednesday.
	   However, the ban on overseas transfers has so far only been
lifted for one company, Mobitel, according to National Bank
Director Tal Nay Im.
	   The four other companies were identified as Shiniwatra, Samart,
Camtel and Tricelcam.

Japan invites Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to visit Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on
Wednesday invited Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to visit Japan, a
Foreign Ministry official said.
	   Obuchi extended the invitation during a meeting with Chinese
Vice President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the annual Association
of Southeast Asian Nations summit.
	   Hu expressed thanks for the invitation and said he would convey
it to Zhu. No date was set for the visit.
	   Obuchi and Hu also agreed that Japan and China must cooperate to
help Asia overcome its recent economic slowdown. Hu reiterated that
China does not intend to devalue its currency and said it expects
economic growth of around 8 percent this year, the Japanese Foreign
Ministry official said.
	   The official said China praised Japan's efforts to help Asia
overcome its economic crisis. Hu added that China also plans to
unveil additional measures to help stabilize growth in the region,
the official said. He did not elaborate on what those measures
would be.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin traveled to Japan for six days
last month in a visit marked by tensions over Tokyo's decision not
to issue a full written apology for Japan's brutal invasion of
China during World War II.
	   Jiang's trip to Japan, the first by a Chinese head of state
since World War II, was viewed by many as a diplomatic failure.

Hun Sen says ASEAN `marriage' only waiting for ceremony
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 4th graf with Hun Sen also in front row for closing
ceremony; Badawi quote in grafs 6-7 &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said
Wednesday that his country's ``marriage'' to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations is complete except for the ceremony.
	   He said leaders of the nine-nation grouping sought no further
assurances on Cambodia's stability at a one-hour meeting Wednesday
morning during their annual two-day summit.
	   But while ASEAN leaders have said the country definitely will
become a member, some have insisted that it first must fully
establish the credibility of a newly formed coalition government.
	   Hun Sen had to sit in the front row as ASEAN leaders took the
stage for opening and closing ceremonies of the summit. He said
that was only because the leaders had made their decision too late
Monday to arrange an induction ceremony.
	   ``This is the ASEAN way, which is different from the United
Nations,'' he said, referring to the fact that Cambodia was given
its seat back at the world body last week.
	   Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi called the
resolution of the issue a compromise.
	   ``In a way, I was quite disappointed,'' he said. ``I had wanted
to see the Cambodian leader sitting there with all the other ASEAN
leaders.''
	   Hun Sen said he did not want to take attention away from the
meeting's focus. The question of Cambodia's admission had hijacked
the spotlight at pre-summit meetings.
	   ``We do not want this ceremonial process to cause any problems
to leaders of ASEAN who have to focus their attention on the
financial and economic issues,'' Hun Sen said.
	   ``Cambodia is still very happy because we became a full member
of ASEAN. For us, we count it as an admission. The marriage
ceremony has been organized. Now we have to wait for the
registration.''
	   Asked when the ceremony will take place, he said: ``I don't
know. I hope very soon.''
	   In a face-saving concession to summit host Vietnam, which had
spearheaded lobbying on its neighbor's behalf, the ceremony will
take place in Hanoi.
	   In speech after speech Tuesday, Hun Sen was assured Cambodia
would soon become the final member of the Southeast Asian
brotherhood, as envisioned when ASEAN was founded in 1967.
	   Vietnam went so far as to insist by day's end that Cambodia had
already been admitted and the ceremony was only a formality.
	   ``Although the admission ceremony has not yet occurred,
everybody should consider Cambodia as the 10th member of ASEAN,''
Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said.
	   Back home in Phnom Penh, political analysts weren't putting such
a good spin on Cambodia's entry.
	   ``A delay is a delay,'' said Kao Kim Hourn, executive director
of the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace, a local think
tank. ``Membership has been delayed with an ASEAN way of
face-saving, but in the end it shows that there was no consensus.''

Japanese stocks finish higher, dollar lower in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks finished higher Wednesday,
supported by an overnight gain on Wall Street and talk of tax
reductions in Japan. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 85.11 points,
or 0.61 percent, closing at 14,096.30 points. On Tuesday, the
average lost 100.43 points, or 0.71 percent.
	   The dollar bought 116.18 yen at mid-afternoon, down 1.40 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 116.35 yen overnight.
	   On the stock market, share prices started higher on buying of
high-technology issues as investors were encouraged by a rise of
127.70 points Tuesday in the Dow Jones industrial average, which
closed at 8,823.30.
	   Also helping the Tokyo market was talk of tax cuts among ruling
Democratic Party officials, traders said.
	   Kyodo News reported Tuesday that the tax panel of the ruling LDP
will soon propose around 9.3 trillion yen (dlrs 80.17 billion) in
tax cuts and deductions, including 4 trillion yen (dlrs 34.48
billion) in income tax cuts and 2.3 trillion yen (dlrs 19.82
billion) in corporate tax cuts.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.12 points, or 0.38 percent, to 1,093.39. The
TOPIX shed 11.04 points, or 1.00 percent, the previous day.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar initially gained some ground
from its levels in late New York trading overnight following
slower-than-expected growth in Japan's October current account
surplus, traders said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Japan's Finance Ministry said that the
nation's current account surplus rose 21.5 percent in October from
a year earlier to 1.335 trillion yen (dlrs 11.4 billion).
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast on average
a surplus of 1.491 trillion yen (dlrs 12.8 billion).
	   Signs of a slowdown in the growth of Japan's external surpluses
are supportive for the dollar, as they allay concerns about trade
friction.
	   Traders said, however, that market attention was mostly focused
on pending impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton,
keeping the dollar from rising further.
	   ``The impeachment of Mr. Clinton looks more possible, and that's
hurting U.S. markets and the dollar,'' said Takashi Nakauchi,
foreign exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.330 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.260 percent,
driving its price down to 103.96 yen from 104.57 yen.

Stoudamire plans to play in Europe if NBA season canceled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ Portland guard Damon Stoudamire plans to
play in Europe if the NBA season is canceled, his agent said
Tuesday.
	   Stoudamire, a free agent, had said he was not interested in
playing overseas, but apparently had a change of heart.
	   ``If the season is canceled, he's going to play in Europe,''
said Aaron Goodwin, Stoudamire's agent. ``Definitely.''
	   Teams in Italy and Greece have made offers to Stoudamire,
Goodwin said. He declined to name them.
	   Blazers officials declined comment, citing a league ban on
discussing players during the lockout.
	   No elite NBA players have left to play in Europe, but some have
had offers. Last month, Denver free agent LaPhonso Ellis reportedly
was offered a one-year deal with Kinder Bologna of the Italian
League estimated at dlrs 3 million after taxes.
	   Before the lockout, the Blazers had shown interest in re-signing
Stoudamire, and his agent said he would like to play for Portland.
	   Goodwin said he told Blazers president Bob Whitsitt that
Stoudamire was considering playing in Europe. He also sought advice
from the NBA's legal office to avoid jeopardizing Stoudamire's NBA
career. ``We were told how it could be done legally, with the
league's blessing,'' Goodwin said.
	   NBA commissioner David Stern has refused to say when the season
might be canceled if the lockout continues.

Japanese ambassador called in over import tariff plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government called
Japan's ambassador in and separately held urgent talks with the
United States over a Japanese plan to throttle rice imports with a
tariff of up to 1,200 percent, Trade Minister Tim Fischer said
Wednesday.
	   Fischer said Japan's move to impose the tariff just years after
it had been forced to open up its rice market was a huge concern
for Australia.
	   ``I spoke this morning with Charlene Barshefsky, U.S. Trade
Representative in respect of this, so great was my concern,'' he
said.
	   ``We both agreed that we wanted urgent consultations with the
Japanese government on the matter and we both questioned the
leadership of Japan in going down this pathway.''
	   Fischer said he called in Masaji Takahashi, Japan's Ambassador,
for talks with Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials.
	   Japan currently allows imports to make up just eight percent of
its rice market.
	   A departmental spokesman said senior officials told the
ambassador Australia was deeply concerned about the impact of the
new tariff.
	   ``Our particular concern is that any new export regime does not
impede existing access for imported rice or in anyway further
disadvantage imported rice,'' the spokesman said, on condition of
anonymity.
	   ``We're urging the Japanese to avoid excessively high tariff
levels.''
	   Fischer said Australia would continue to lobby the Japanese
government at all levels.

Williams, McNown lead AP All-America team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ First, he won the Heisman Trophy. Then, Ricky
Williams found himself with baseball's Texas Rangers.
	   On Tuesday, the Texas Longhorns tailback became a two-time
All-American, the only repeater on The Associated Press'
All-America team.
	   Williams, who ran for 2,124 yards and 27 touchdowns on his way
to breaking Tony Dorsett's career rushing record, was joined in the
backfield by UCLA quarterback Cade McNown and Boston College
running back Mike Cloud.
	   Williams, who has 6,279 career yards, led Texas to an 8-3 record
and Cotton Bowl matchup against Mississippi State.
	   McNown led the Bruins on a 20-game winning streak before their
national title hopes ended with a loss to Miami in the season
finale. The left-hander threw for 3,130 yards and 23 touchdowns and
set nearly every school single-season and career record.
	   Even in defeat, McNown was spectacular, throwing for a
school-record 513 yards, with five TD passes and a rushing TD in
the 49-45 loss to the Hurricanes. He finished third in the Heisman
balloting.
	   Cloud set a school and Big East Conference record with 1,726
yards, third best in the nation, and had 14 touchdowns.
	   Florida State had three players on the team, the most by any
school, with wide receiver Peter Warrick, kicker Sebastian
Janikowski and noseguard Corey Simon.
	   In a year loaded with record-setting quarterbacks, Kentucky's
Tim Couch made the second team and Kansas State's Michael Bishop
the third team.
	   The Atlantic Coast Conference was the top league, placing six
players on the team, which consisted of 16 seniors, eight juniors
and two sophomores.
	   Georgia's all-purpose star Champ Bailey made the team as a
defensive back, although he did much more for the Bulldogs. Bailey
had three interceptions and a fumble recovery, but also caught 47
passes for 744 yards and five TDs and averaged 21.8 yards per
kickoff return.
	   Torry Holt of North Carolina State joined Warrick as the other
wide receiver, and Rufus French of Mississippi was tight end.
	   Holt set ACC records with 88 catches for 1,604 yards. The senior
scored on a 68-yard punt return and a 63-yard reception in the
Wolfpack's 24-7 upset of Florida State on Sept. 12. He averaged

Japan still leads in Asian Games medal tally _ sort of
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ While China has emerged as the
continent's sports colossus, Japan still leads in the all-time gold
medal race of the Asian Games. Thanks to politics.
	   As of early Wednesday, the Japanese had picked up 673 golds in
12 games, while China had collected 559. But China's radical
Communist policies shut it out of the first six games, giving Japan
a big head start.
	   South Korea is third on the gold medal chart.
	   The most crushing domination of golds came at the 4th games in
1962, when Japan took 54 to nearest rival India's seven.
	   The most humiliating games for the Japanese were those in Seoul,
when they suffered their worst ever gold medal result compared to
China. At that 1986 event, China tallied 183 to Japan's 38.
	   Looking at the bottom end of the chart, Laos is the only country
to have won just one medal, a silver at the 1990 Beijing games.
	   And looking off the chart, Bhutan, Yemen, Palestine and the
Maldives have yet to win a single medal.
	   Singapore's N.C. Kok is listed as the first gold medalist. He
won the 1,500-meter freestyle event at the inaugural 1951 games in
New Delhi.

Riot erupts in Indonesian town after bus drivers go on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A three-day strike by public transport
drivers degenerated into a riot when mobs threw rocks and looted
shops in Samarinda on the island of Borneo on Wednesday, police and
witnesses said.
	   Thousands of passengers, angry about being stranded, joined the
melee.
	   Shops and offices in the city of 450,000 people were closed as
mobs burned piles of tires in the streets.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests.
	   Police said thousands of people choked the main avenue of
Samarinda, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   Hundreds of police and troops with sticks and shields confronted
mobs, said one officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Bus and van drivers went on strike on Monday in protest over the
high cost of spare parts for their vehicles.
	   Wednesday's violence was the latest in a series of sporadic
riots that have erupted across Indonesia.
	   The sprawling Southeast Asian nation is enduring its worst
economic crisis in 30 years. The official inflation rate is about
80 percent. Unemployment has skyrocketed as debt-burdened
businesses close down.
	   The government says just under half Indonesia's 202 million
people now live in poverty.
	   The violence has been matched by a rise in protests against the
government of President B.J. Habibie. He has promised to conduct
parliamentary elections next June and a president ballot after
that.
	   However, students say his reform agenda is too slow and too
conservative. They also want Habibie's predecessor Suharto to be
put on trial for corruption.
	   Suharto ended 32 years of autocratic rule when he quit last May
after a wave of student protests and riots claimed about 1,200
lives.

Singapore: One part of the global market is just too risky
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Singapore's premier, a key advocate of
free-market philosophy, urged world leaders on Wednesday to
consider how to lower the economic risks of huge, volatile swings
in short-term capital.
	   In an interview, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said if there is
anything that nations should learn from the 17-month-old Asian
financial crisis, it is that such swings can devastate economies.
	   ``It is a global problem. I think the potential risk of further
economies being destabilized in the future is quite real. So we've
got to study this new so-called financial architecture,'' Goh said
at the conclusion of a Southeast Asian summit.
	   During the two-day meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations, differences appeared to emerge among the nine leaders over
how they should cope with the crisis.
	   Some joined Goh in calling for further liberalization to win
back the massive foreign investment that had turned some ASEAN
developing nations into ``tigers'' before the crisis struck.
	   Others defended the practice of shielding their economies from
the risks of the global market, including Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, who has imposed capital controls in an effort to
shield his country from speculators.
	   In the end, the ASEAN leaders agreed Wednesday to liberalize
their economies by adopting several measures, including one that
will speed up implementation of a free-trade area and another that
will provide incentives for investors to return to Southeast Asia.
	   Goh denied that a rift had opened between himself and Mahathir,
especially in the two speeches they had given at the opening of the
summit about the Asian crisis and ASEAN's goals.
	   ``No, there is no real sharp difference,'' he said. ``We, too,
are concerned about the possibilities of short-term capital, given
its volatility to destabilize the economy. What he (Mahathir) put
in strong words, I put in mild words.
	   ``In other words, we are not in favor of control regulation, but
we recognize the need to study the impact of such short-term
capital flows. So, there lies the difference.''
	   Goh said he believes that the Group of Seven industrialized
nations have just begun to recognize the risks of the short-term
capital flow at the hands of operations such as hedge funds.
	   He said the G-7 is considering ways to manage the international
finance system better, and he urged it to include developing
nations such as ASEAN members in the discussion.
	   Goh called the ASEAN summit a success, even though the reforms
that it adopted did not cause any jump of approval in the region's
stock or currency markets.
	   ``The economic crisis is beyond ASEAN to solve,'' and the
financial markets know that, he said.
	   Nevertheless, Goh predicted that foreign investors will see the
summit as an indication that ``there are once again good prospects
to invest in ASEAN and Southeast Asia.''

Russia's budget on hold until next week, parliament says

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist-dominated parliament won't
begin discussing the draft 1999 budget until next week and won't
rush to approve it, even though the government wants it urgently,
lawmakers said Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government is hoping the
budget is passed before January so it can begin acting on its plan
to pull the country out of its worst economic crisis of the
post-Soviet era.
	   But the speaker of parliament's lower house, Gennady Seleznyov,
said debate on the 2,550-page budget draft probably wouldn't start
until Dec. 23 at the earliest, and would not finish quickly.
	   In recent years, the government and parliament have battled for
months before passing the annual budget. However, Primakov's
Cabinet has widespread support in the Communist-dominated lower
house, the State Duma, raising hopes that the budget may be
approved without lengthy debate.
	   Seleznyov said the Duma already supports much of the draft
budget, because for the first time in several years, Russia is
``living under the conditions of political consensus.''
	   Still, the Communist Party's No. 2 man, Valentin Kuptsov, said
Tuesday that parliament will take its time reviewing the budget,
despite the government's urging to hurry.
	   ``Neither the party nor the voters would appreciate it if we
skip studying the government's proposals in depth,'' Kuptsov was
quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Alexander Shokhin, head of the centrist Our Home is Russia
faction, has warned that the Communists were likely to demand
political concessions and even the right to censor Russia's
television in exchange for approving the budget.
	   In recent weeks, hard-liners have been adamantly demanding the
introduction of censorship on television, which they say is too
anti-Communist.
	   The draft budget envisages 30 percent inflation in 1999 and an
average ruble rate of 21.5 to the dollar. But independent
economists have warned that the ruble rate was unrealistic, and
inflation would be much higher.
	   On Tuesday, Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko conceded
the ruble may lose more value than the government had predicted.
	   The ruble already fell to 21.75 to the dollar in interbank
trading Tuesday, down from 21.35 during the previous session
Friday.
	   The new budget relies on foreign loans that may not materialize,
and on restructuring nearly half of Russia's mammoth foreign debt _
something that creditors have not yet agreed to do.
	   The Duma must vote on the budget three times, and it also plans
to debate 19 tax bills accompanying the document.
	   Foreign loans have been frozen since the government devalued the
ruble and defaulted on some of its debts in August. The passage of
the budget could help Russia attract new cash from international
lenders.

Apartment house collapses in Rome

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with at least seven people dead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A five-story apartment house collapsed Wednesday,
killing at least seven people and burying up to 31 others, news
reports said.
	   The building, in a modern, middle-class area of Rome, collapsed
at dawn, apparently for structural reasons, state-run RAI-TV said.
	   Five people were reportedly pulled out alive by the first rescue
workers to reach the scene.
	   Sixteen families, or 38 people, were believed to have lived in
the building. Police said chances of finding more survivors was
virtually nil.
	   Residents of nearby buildings joined dozens of police and
firefighters digging through the rubble with their hands, shovels
and heavy machinery. Specially-trained dogs were also on the scene
trying to sniff out survivors.
	   The house, with a printing plant on the ground floor, was
reported built in the 1950s.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later matches &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Top seed Tamarine Tanasugarn gave host
Thailand another gold medal chance Wednesday, beating China's Yi
Jingqian 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 and advancing to the Asian Games tennis
final.
	   In Thursday's gold medal match, Tamarine, ranked No. 37 by the
WTA, will face third seed Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia, who found her
game in the first set tie-break and pounded out a 7-6 (7-3), 6-1
victory over China's Li Fang.
	   Errors hurt Yi as Tamarine converted six of 10 break points in
the baseline battle.
	   Basuki, ranked No. 56, played evenly with No. 40 Li through the
first 12 games, but then took control, finishing off the first set
with a serve and volley.
	   Her heavy hitting from the baseline often left Li out of
position in the second set, but she mixed in shots like a lob
volley over Li's head.
	   In men's quarterfinals, Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi beat South
Korea's Lee Hyung-taik 6-4, 7-5, and India's Mahesh Bhupathi
defeated Uzbekistan's Oleg Ogorodov 6-3, 3-6, 7-5.
	   South Korea's Yoon Yong-il and India's Srinath Prahlad had won
semifinal places on Tuesday.
	   India's best hope, Leander Paes, who stands 91st in the ATP
rankings, had to drop out of the games with an injury. He was the
only Asian in the rankings' top 100.

Boat skipper may not be fit to stand trial: lawyer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ The skipper of a boat who allegedly
threatened American and Spanish tourists with a flare during a
cruise off Australia's northeast coast may be medically unfit to
face trial, his lawyer said Wednesday.
	   Troy Dallman, 29, faced Cairns Magistrates Court on three
charges of assault and one of going armed in public in a manner to
cause fear.
	   The charges arise from an eight-day dive trip from the
Queensland state resort town of Port Douglas to Thursday Island, on
the northern tip of Australia's Cape York, which passengers and
crew have described as ``the cruise from hell.''
	   Passengers and crew of the Reef Explorer say they were forced to
bind Dallman with duct tape and tie him to a bunk after he
threatened them during the trip in October.
	   Dallman's lawyer Trevor Lewis told the court a medical opinion
on his client which he had just obtained might lead to a request
that prosecution be halted.
	   Dallman was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward after the cruise.
	   The six American and two Spanish tourists on board the boat
allege Dallman became unstable after equipment failures during the
trip and that he believed the crew of the boat were plotting
against him.
	   The tourists have filed separate civil action against dive
company Reef Adventures alleging breach of contract, negligence and
breach of statutory duty.
	   The Queensland Transport Department is investigating the events
surrounding the cruise and the condition of the vessel.
	   No plea was entered in court Wednesday. Dallman was released on
bail and was ordered to reappear on Feb. 3.

<TEXT>
	   KOCAELI, Turkey (AP) _ A passenger train rear ended another
train waiting at a station Wednesday in the northwestern city of
Kocaeli, injuring 13 people, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   A railways official, Omer Yilmaz, said the cause of the accident
could be human error. He did not elaborate, but said an
investigation would be opened.
	   The accident derailed the last cars of both trains and hampered
transit along the line, the only track connecting Istanbul to the
capital city, Ankara.
	   Authorities transported some 500 passengers to Ankara by bus.
	   The 13 injured were treated in a hospital, but none was in
critical condition, the agency said.
	   Kocaeli is 110 kilometers (68 miles) west of Istanbul.

South Korean scientists claim a step forward in human cloning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATEs with detail; CLARIFIES that Lee cultivated a human
embryo in an early stage; no peer reviews reported
 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean medical team said
Wednesday it had made an important advance in the cloning of human
cells to create replacement organs.
	   Using what is known as the ``Honolulu technique,'' the South
Korean team said it cultivated a human embryo in its early stage
from a single cell implanted in a woman's ovum.
	   The technique has drawn worldwide attention since University of
Hawaii researchers announced in July that they used it to create
more than 50 carbon-copy mice.
	   The South Korean team was headed by Dr. Lee Bo-yeon, a professor
at the fertility clinic of Kyonghee University Hospital in Seoul.
	   ``Our experiment marked the first time that the more reliable
cloning technology has been applied to human cells and might make
human cloning more feasible,'' Lee told The Associated Press.
	   Lee's team first removed the genetic nucleus of an egg donated
by a woman and then used a tiny needle to fill the empty egg with
the nucleus of one of her body cells.
	   It then cultivated the egg until it grew and cleaved into four
embryonic cells, a step or two before developing into a human
fetus. Lee's team stopped there because a resolution adopted by
South Korean scientists in 1993 banned taking the experiment
farther.
	   The next step would have been implanting the egg into a woman's
womb and letting it grow into stem cells _ primordial cells from
which all of a human's bodily tissues and organs develop.
	   Lee said the 1993 resolution, while not legally binding, forced
his team to stop short of doing what U.S. scientists have already
achieved in developing stem cells.
	   University of Wisconsin scientists have reported success in
growing stem cells in a dish using clumps of cells grown from
fertilized eggs. Scientists from Johns Hopkins also grew stem cells
from egg cells taken from aborted fetuses.
	   Lee's team said its technique was more reliable than the one
used to create Dolly the sheep, which other laboratories so far
have failed to duplicate.
	   In initially announcing the results of the research on Tuesday,
Lee said a team of British scientists previously succeeded in a
similar experiment. But he said Wednesday he may have been
misinformed. Britain has laws banning research into human
reproductive cloning.
	   ``The cloning of human embryos should be encouraged for
scientific research to create replacement hearts and other organs.
It will eventually help human beings,'' Lee said.
	   He said his work needed more research before being reported to
international medical journals. So far, there have been no peer
reviews of his claims, Lee said.
	   Cultured stem cells, scientists say, could produce new heart
cells, or new insulin-producing cells for the treatment of
diabetes.
	   Following the announcement by the South Korean scientists, about
two dozen religious and civic activists held a rally in front of
Kyunghee Hospital, shouting for discontinuation of the ``inhuman
research.''
	   One protest sign read: ``Who am I? I don't want to be a cloned
human being.''
	   The announcement comes as South Korea's Parliament is pushing
legislation banning cloning of human cells except for research on
cancer or other diseases.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
emerged from the night sky and landed in triumph, ending NASA's
first flight to build the international space station.
	   ``Wow! What can I say after a mission like that?'' commander
Robert Cabana exclaimed after guiding the shuttle to a smooth
touchdown late Tuesday. ``We are just so happy to have gotten the
international space station off to such a super start.''
	   The six astronauts, who masterfully joined the first two pieces
of the space station in orbit, returned to handshakes, backslaps
and a stream of congratulations.
	   The well-wishers included two of the three Apollo 8 astronauts
who flew around the moon during Christmas 1968. Jim Lovell and Bill
Anders were attending a 30th anniversary bash at Kennedy Space
Center.
	   ``I'm so proud of what they've done,'' said Lovell, who also
circled the moon on Apollo 13.
	   Mission Control gave Cabana the go-ahead for an on-time
touchdown after hours of scrutinizing the weather. Thick rain
clouds hung over the space center throughout the afternoon but were
gone by dusk.
	   Endeavour resembled a comet as it streaked over the Gulf of
Mexico and across Florida, its path tracked by infrared cameras. It
swooped through a clear, chilly sky on final approach and landed on
the xenon-lit runway at 10:53 p.m., a minute early thanks to a
tailwind.
	   It was only the 10th time in 93 shuttle flights that a space
shuttle returned in darkness.
	   Mission Control complimented Cabana for his ``beautiful
landing,'' then thanked the entire crew _ calling out each of their
names _ ``for an awesome job starting our space station
adventure.''
	   During their exhausting journey, which spanned nearly 12 days
and 4.6 million miles, the astronauts set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Jerry Ross and James Newman made three spacewalks to wire Zarya
and Unity together and attach antennas and other equipment. The
crew also spent a full day inside the station, hooking up
electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. Nine Russian rocket launches also will be required;
the first took place on Nov. 20 when Zarya soared from Kazakstan.
Endeavour carried up Unity.
	   ``Two down, 43 to go,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin cheered
following Endeavour's touchdown. But he cautioned: ``Let's not
project forward that everything's going to be easy. This is tough
stuff.''
	   Shuttle program manager Tommy Holloway said even though
Endeavour's crew made everything look simple, ``I can assure you it
took a lot of hard work, a lot of preparation and a lot of
attention to detail.''
	   To ensure success, Holloway distributed a memo before the Dec. 4
launch reminding the shuttle team of ``three close calls'' over the
past year and urging everyone to do better. Among the incidents he
cited: the loss of the drag-chute door moments before Discovery
blasted off in October with John Glenn.
	   Because engineers still don't know why the door ripped off,
Endeavour landed without a drag chute. NASA did not want to risk
having the door fall off at liftoff and hit an engine again, and so
bolted it shut.
	   NASA hopes to have the door redesigned before the next shuttle
flight at the end of March. The telescope-delivery mission will be
led by Eileen Collins, the first female commander.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors appeared to be
leaving Baghdad on Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. weapons
inspector said Iraq had reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   Three busloads of weapons inspectors left the U.N. compound in
Baghdad Wednesday morning, followed by four white U.N. cars
carrying spare tires on top.
	   U.N. staff in Iraq sometimes travel from Baghdad to Amman,
Jordan, a 10-hour drive across the desert.
	   About half an hour earlier, three trucks loaded with luggage
left the U.N. headquarters. One of the drivers said he was headed
for Habbaniya air base, which the inspectors often use for entering
or leaving Iraq.
	   In Bahrain, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said that six to
eight weapons monitors were expected to leave Baghdad on Wednesday
as part of a usual rotation.
	   She refused to comment on whether additional inspectors were
being withdrawn.
	   ``I can not confirm or deny anything at this point,'' she said.
	   There were some 140 U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq and about
400 U.N. workers who regulate an oil-for-food deal with Iraq.
	   In his report, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction,
evasion and subterfuge that made it impossible for him to assure
that Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   There was no immediate Iraqi reaction to the report.

Thai troops on alert along Myanmar border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai army units along the border with
Myanmar have been on alert since last week in anticipation of
renewed fighting between ethnic rebels and Myanmar's military
government, Thailand's army commander in chief said on Wednesday.
	   ``We've stepped up safety measures along the border,'' Gen.
Surayud Chulanont, commander-in-chief of the Thai army told The
Associated Press.
	   ``We haven't increased the number of troops, but the troops are
on alert and we have rapid reaction forces ready,'' he said.
	   Hostilities in Myanmar have repeatedly spilled over on to Thai
soil, with both Myanmar soldiers and ethnic guerrillas allied with
them crossing the border to burn refugee camps during 1997.
	   More than 100,000 mostly Karen refugees are living in camps
inside Thailand, having fled what they charge is an ethnic
cleansing campaign conducted by Myanmar's military.
	   The Karen have been fighting for autonomy from the government in
Yangon since 1949. In recent years the Myanmar army has dislodged
them from most of their bases inside the country.
	   With the 50th anniversary of their rebellion coming up in
January, some rebel leaders expect the army will launch another
offensive aimed at wiping them out.
	   Surayud said the Thai military was preparing for that
possibility.
	   ``We know exactly what should be done in the sense that fighting
will escalate during the dry season and also from reports we've
received along the border,'' he said in explaining why troops were
on alert.
	   Surayud also said that he was seeking permission from the
Interior Ministry to move the refugees further inside Thai
territory to make it more difficult for invading forces to reach
them.
	   He said it was necessary to get the refugees moved within a
month.
	   ``Otherwise we'll be in the same position as last year,''
Surayud said.
	   The Thai army, under Surayud's predecessor Gen. Chetta
Thanajaro, was criticized by international human rights groups and
Western governments for failing to protect the refugees.
	   The Thai press blasted him for not responding with force to
repeated incursions on Thai soil.
	   Myanmar troops and guerrillas entered Thailand with seeming
impunity, torching refugee camps, shooting refugees, and
occasionally attacking Thai villagers.
	   Refugees, aid workers and even some Thai soldiers said the army
pushed refugees back across the border and into the path of a
Myanmar army offensive in Feb. 1997.
	   Surayud said the army was aware of the criticisms, and didn't
want a repeat of last year's events.
	   He said, however, the army could not unleash its might with the
first attack by Myanmar forces, as the rules of engagement demanded
warning shots first, and increased levels of response with each
repeated offense.
	   Gen. Chetta traveled frequently to Yangon to smooth over
problems with Myanmar's military government, filling a role
normally associated with the Foreign Ministry.
	   While Surayud said he will work with Myanmar's generals to solve
any problems between the two countries, he would let the Foreign
Ministry take the lead in relations between the neighbors.

Thai central bank files charges against four finance executives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank said Wednesday
it has filed criminal charges with police against four executives
of non-listed Thai Capital Finance and Securities Co. Ltd. for
reporting false financial statements to authorities.
	   The Bank of Thailand did not identify the four executives by
name, as is its normal practice, but said it has asked the police
to bar the four from traveling overseas for the time being.
	   The Bank of Thailand said in a statement that Thai Capital
Finance, which is still in operation, reported a series of false
financial statements to central bank authorities between June 30,
1997 and Oct. 3, 1997 in order to seek a capital injection from the
central bank's rescue fund for financial institutions.
	   The central bank said during that time, the company reported it
was running out of cash to repay depositors who were withdrawing
money from the company. The company made six requests for cash
injections from the central bank's Financial Institutions
Development Fund, or FIDF.
	   ``The FIDF was tricked into believing in it, and had extended
credits in response to all the six requests in total amount of
213.89 million baht (dlrs 5.95 million),'' the central bank said.
	   But actually, the company did not have any cash flow problems
since it then had 179 million to 228 million baht (dlrs 4.9 to 6.3
million) in deposits at commercial banks.
	   The central bank said the company needed then to maintain only
32 million to 39 million baht (dlrs 891,000 to 1.08 million) in
required liquidity reserves.

Japanese Kabaddi player owes it to India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In the late Mother Teresa's ``City of
Joy'' _ Calcutta _ a young Japanese left behind a good job offer
and mingled with policemen, railroad employees and street urchins
with one mission _ to absorb the subcontinent's game of kabaddi.
	   In the Asian Games in Bangkok this week, Takeshi Kozu found
himself facing the defending champion Indian national team, which
beat Japan 59-25 on its way to a perfect record and another gold
medal.
	   Japan came out with a victory and four losses, including a
final-day 24-7 defeat Wednesday to Pakistan, which took the silver
medal. Bangladesh won the bronze.
	   The 25-year-old Kozu, known in Japan as ``kabaddi-san,'' using
the Japanese honorific title, was introduced to the sport eight
years ago when he was studying Indian traditional philosophy at
Japan's Taisho University.
	   He became obsessed with the sport, which requires intense
concentration, flexibility and breath control, and was selected to
represent Japan at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan.
	   After Japan's 62-16 loss there to the gold medalist Indians, he
said of the opponents, ``Their speed, technique and moreover their
eagerness for life were different from ours.''
	   Returning from Hiroshima, Kozu received an offer for a well-paid
job with a Japanese company, but declined it and set out for
Calcutta, the eastern city that has produced many a top Indian
kabaddi player, including Indian captain Debasish Palit.
	   He enrolled at a language school to learn Bengali, the language
spoken in India's West Bengal state and the neighboring country of
Bangladesh, and scouted out a chance to play on a kabaddi team made
up of Calcutta policemen.
	   On his way back to his modest home in Calcutta after playing
with policemen, Kozu would watch street urchins playing the sport,
which needs no equipment, as players must be barefoot.
	   The sport draws its name from the rule requiring raiders to
continually say ``kabaddi'' while in enemy territory, trying to
score points by tagging opponents. The opponents can score by
pinning down the raiders until they run out of breath and can't
keep up the chant.
	   Kozu formerly practice the Japanese combat sport of karate.
	   But, he said in a recent interview, ``karate competition is
one-on-one. But in kabaddi, one player must challenge seven
opponents by himself and that excites me a lot.''

after at least 10 years; ADDS quote, graf 5; EDITS to raise other
Gusmao comments; One name correct for Suharto &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Jailed East Timor rebel leader Xanana
Gusmao says a referendum on full independence need not be held for
at least a decade if Indonesia grants autonomy to his troubled
homeland, the official Antara news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Separately, a visiting United Nations envoy expressed fears that
an upsurge in violence could disrupt a new peace process for the
half-island territory.
	   Indonesia has offered to grant autonomy to East Timor, but has
flatly rejected demands by pro-independence activists that a
referendum be held.
	   In an apparent compromise, Gusmao suggested it would be better
if at least 10 years of autonomy passed before East Timor's 800,000
people voted on whether to be part of or break away from Indonesia,
Antara reported.
	   ``What East Timor's population needs now is a formal decision
that does not corner them,'' he said of U.N.-sponsored negotiations
now being held between Indonesia and Portugal, East Timor's former
colonial master.
	   Meanwhile U.N. diplomat Jamsheed Marker, who arrived in Jakarta
on Tuesday, called on the Indonesian military and East Timorese
rebel forces to show restraint in the territory invaded by
Indonesia in 1975.
	   The long-running talks between Indonesia and Portugal were
revitalized earlier this year when Jakarta made its autonomy offer
in exchange for international recognition of its sovereignty over
East Timor.
	   The change in Indonesia's policy toward East Timor followed the
resignation last May of longtime autocratic President Suharto who
ordered the invasion 23 years ago and refused to compromise on its
status.
	   East Timor has been wracked by guerrilla war and human rights
abuses since it was annexed as Indonesia's 27th province in 1976.
	   Clashes between guerrillas and Indonesian troops have increased
in recent weeks. Protests by pro-independence activists have also
risen in size and frequency.
	   Despite the rising violence, Antara quoted Gusmao as saying he
hoped East Timor's troubles might be solved after Indonesia holds
elections next year as part of a push for political reform.
	   The sprawling Southeast Asian nation is now enduring its worst
economic and political turmoil in 30 years.
	   ``Indonesia has many problems that should be solved immediately,
not only the problem of East Timor,'' Gusmao said.
	   He described Habibie's six-month-old government as more
``moderate'' than Suharto's regime.
	   His comments were made in a joint interview in a Jakarta prison
with Antara and LUSA, the national news agency of Portugal.
	   The two agencies last Saturday signed an agreement to cooperate
as part of wider moves to heal a diplomatic rift between the two
nations.
	   Gusmao is serving a 20-year sentence for leading a bloody
guerrilla war against Indonesian troops.
	   Despite his imprisonment, he is regarded internationally as a
key player in moves to secure peace for East Timor.
	   Marker, who will visit East Timor this weekend and hold talks
with Habibie next week, is scheduled to meet Gusmao on Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Jailed East Timor rebel leader Xanana
Gusmao says a referendum on full independence need not be held for
at least a decade if Indonesia grants autonomy to his troubled
homeland, the official Antara news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Separately, a visiting United Nations envoy expressed fears that
an upsurge in violence could disrupt a new peace process for the
half-island territory.
	   Indonesia has offered to grant autonomy to East Timor, but has
flatly rejected demands by pro-independence activists that a
referendum be held.
	   In an apparent compromise, Gusmao suggested it would be better
if at least 10 years of autonomy passed before East Timor's 800,000
people voted on whether to be part of or break away from Indonesia,
Antara reported.
	   ``What East Timor's population needs now is a formal decision
that does not corner them,'' he said of U.N.-sponsored negotiations
now being held between Indonesia and Portugal, East Timor's former
colonial master.
	   Meanwhile U.N. diplomat Jamsheed Marker, who arrived in Jakarta
on Tuesday, called on the Indonesian military and East Timorese
rebel forces to show restraint in the territory invaded by
Indonesia in 1975.
	   The long-running talks between Indonesia and Portugal were
revitalized earlier this year when Jakarta made its autonomy offer
in exchange for international recognition of its sovereignty over
East Timor.
	   The change in Indonesia's policy toward East Timor followed the
resignation last May of longtime autocratic President Suharto who
ordered the invasion 23 years ago and refused to compromise on its
status.
	   East Timor has been wracked by guerrilla war and human rights
abuses since it was annexed as Indonesia's 27th province in 1976.
	   Clashes between guerrillas and Indonesian troops have increased
in recent weeks. Protests by pro-independence activists have also
risen in size and frequency.
	   Despite the rising violence, Antara quoted Gusmao as saying he
hoped East Timor's troubles might be solved after Indonesia holds
elections next year as part of a push for political reform.
	   The sprawling Southeast Asian nation is now enduring its worst
economic and political turmoil in 30 years.
	   ``Indonesia has many problems that should be solved immediately,
not only the problem of East Timor,'' Gusmao said.
	   He described Habibie's six-month-old government as more
``moderate'' than Suharto's regime.
	   His comments were made in a joint interview in a Jakarta prison
with Antara and LUSA, the national news agency of Portugal.
	   The two agencies last Saturday signed an agreement to cooperate
as part of wider moves to heal a diplomatic rift between the two
nations.
	   Gusmao is serving a 20-year sentence for leading a bloody
guerrilla war against Indonesian troops.
	   Despite his imprisonment, he is regarded internationally as a
key player in moves to secure peace for East Timor.

 &UR; U.N. inspectors appear to be evacuating Baghdad
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. official saying most inspectors have left,
U.N. humanitarian spokesman expected to release statement &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors appeared to be
evacuating Baghdad on Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. weapons
inspector said Iraq had reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   Three busloads of weapons inspectors left the U.N. compound in
Baghdad Wednesday morning, followed by four white U.N. cars
carrying spare tires on top.
	   U.N. staff in Iraq sometimes travel from Baghdad to Amman,
Jordan, a 10-hour drive across the desert.
	   About half an hour earlier, three trucks loaded with luggage
left the U.N. headquarters. One of the drivers said he was headed
for Habbaniya air base, which the inspectors often use for entering
or leaving Iraq.
	   ``It seems UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) offices are closed
and nearly all the inspectors have left,'' said a U.N. official in
Baghdad, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In Bahrain, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said that six to
eight weapons monitors were expected to leave Baghdad on Wednesday
as part of a usual rotation.
	   She refused to comment on whether additional inspectors were
being withdrawn.
	   ``I can not confirm or deny anything at this point,'' she said.
	   There were some 140 U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq and about
400 U.N. workers who regulate an oil-for-food deal with Iraq.
	   The U.N. official said that George Summerwell, the spokesman for
the humanitarian aid workers, was expected to issue a statement
shortly.
	   In his report, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction,
evasion and subterfuge that made it impossible for him to assure
that Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   There was no immediate Iraqi reaction to the report.

Controversial Russian tycoon calls for ban of Communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky on
Wednesday called for banning the Communist party, a day after a top
Communist lawmaker accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the
country.
	   Berezovsky said the government should use force to get rid of
the Communists if it needs to.
	   ``The later they use force the more blood will be shed,''
Berezovsky said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   At impeachment hearings Tuesday against President Boris Yeltsin,
Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin said Russia's post-Soviet
collapse would not have happened if Russia's government was not
made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.''
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, made similar
anti-Semitic remarks at a Moscow rally in October. Berezovsky
demanded the Communist Party be disbanded at that time as well.
	   ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock,
and not in the Duma,'' Interfax quoted Berezovsky as saying.
	   ``When I said that the first time, the president and the
government didn't see that the Communist Party has placed itself
outside the law of the civilized world,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin banned the Communist Party for one year in the early
1990s, but the party remains the country's leading opposition group
and has the largest faction in parliament's lower house, the State
Duma.
	   The Communists and Berezovsky have never been on good terms.
Many Communists believe Berezovsky, one of the country's richest
and most powerful businessmen, symbolizes the wild, unrestrained
capitalism that has emerged in post-Soviet Russia.
	   The Communists have also demanded that Berezovsky step down from
his post as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, a loose grouping of 12 ex-Soviet republics.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
emerged from the night sky and landed in triumph, ending NASA's
first flight to build the international space station.
	   ``Wow! What can I say after a mission like that?'' commander
Robert Cabana exclaimed after guiding the shuttle to a smooth
touchdown late Tuesday. ``We are just so happy to have gotten the
international space station off to such a super start.''
	   The six astronauts, who masterfully joined the first two pieces
of the space station in orbit, returned to handshakes, backslaps
and a stream of congratulations.
	   The well-wishers included two of the three Apollo 8 astronauts
who flew around the moon during Christmas 1968. Jim Lovell and Bill
Anders were attending a 30th anniversary bash at Kennedy Space
Center.
	   ``I'm so proud of what they've done,'' said Lovell, who also
circled the moon on Apollo 13.
	   Mission Control gave Cabana the go-ahead for an on-time
touchdown after hours of scrutinizing the weather. Thick rain
clouds hung over the space center throughout the afternoon but were
gone by dusk.
	   Endeavour resembled a comet as it streaked over the Gulf of
Mexico and across Florida, its path tracked by infrared cameras. It
swooped through a clear, chilly sky on final approach and landed on
the xenon-lit runway at 10:53 p.m., a minute early thanks to a
tailwind.
	   It was only the 10th time in 93 flights that a space shuttle
returned in darkness.
	   Mission Control complimented Cabana for his ``beautiful
landing,'' then thanked the entire crew _ calling out each of their
names _ ``for an awesome job starting our space station
adventure.''
	   During their exhausting journey, which spanned nearly 12 days
and 4.6 million miles, the astronauts set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Jerry Ross and James Newman made three spacewalks to wire Zarya
and Unity together and attach antennas and other equipment. The
crew also spent a full day inside the station, hooking up
electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. Nine Russian rocket launches also will be required;
the first took place on Nov. 20 when Zarya soared from Kazakstan.
Endeavour carried up Unity.
	   ``Two down, 43 to go,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin cheered
following Endeavour's touchdown. But he cautioned: ``Let's not
project forward that everything's going to be easy. This is tough
stuff.''
	   Shuttle program manager Tommy Holloway said even though
Endeavour's crew made everything look simple, ``I can assure you it
took a lot of hard work, a lot of preparation and a lot of
attention to detail.''
	   To ensure success, Holloway distributed a memo before the Dec. 4
launch reminding the shuttle team of ``three close calls'' over the
past year and urging everyone to do better. Among the incidents he
cited: the loss of the drag-chute door moments before Discovery
blasted off in October with John Glenn.
	   Because engineers still don't know why the door ripped off,
Endeavour landed without a drag chute. NASA did not want to risk
having the door fall off at liftoff and hit an engine again, and so
bolted it shut.
	   NASA hopes to have the door redesigned before the next shuttle
flight at the end of March. The telescope-delivery mission will be
led by Eileen Collins, the first female commander.

Daiwa predicts economy will shrink less next fiscal year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economy, while continuing its downturn,
will shrink less next year than this year, a research institute
predicted Wednesday.
	   Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the country _ will shrink 2.2 percent next
fiscal year, less than an estimated 2.5 percent contraction this
year, Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd. reported.
	   Personal consumption, however, will suffer a steeper drop next
year, falling 2 percent, compared to a predicted 0.4 percent in the
current term, the institute said.
	   Japan's fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends March 31.
	   Daiwa blamed tight lending policies at banks and fears about the
health of the financial system for the poor state of the economy,
which Japan's finance minister said earlier in the week was in
``shambles.''
	   With the nation suffering its worst recession since World War
II, the government has recently drawn up an economic stimulus
package worth a record 24 trillion yen (dlrs 206 billion).
	   But Daiwa predicted that the drop in personal consumption and a
rising jobless rate will weaken the effects of these measures.

O'Connor back in New Zealand side
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ Shayne O'Connor's international
cricket career turned full circle Wednesday when he replaced the
injured Simon Doull in the New Zealand team for the first test
against India starting Friday at Carisbrook.
	   Eight days ago, the Otago left-armer was cursing his misfortune
after the national selectors disregarded his form when naming four
other pace bowlers ahead of him for the test.
	   However, he was recalled to the side after Doull's right calf
seized up following New Zealand's two-day warmup match against
Otago at Carisbrook which ended Tuesday.
	   Indian coach Anshuman Gaekwad will name his squad of 12 on
Thursday with the only area of doubt being the final composition of
their bowling attack.
	   India is deciding whether to include another seamer in Debashish
Mohanty or a second spinner in Harbhajan Singh.
	   Singh is an exceptional talent and with the pitch containing
less grass than India expected, he may get the nod with Saurav
Ganguly, Ajay Jadeja and Sachin Tendulkar hustling through some
gentle seamers as a back-up.
	   Jadeja did not train Wednesday because of a slight body ache but
Gaekwad expected him and Navjot Sidhu to take their places at the
top of the order.
	   Sidhu has a foot infection but trained Wednesday and was keen to
play his 50th test. (djp)

died Wednesday in a fire that broke out in a northern Turkish
village, an agency reported.
	   Another seven were injured when the fire erupted in a house
where three families were living cramped in the village of
Hocahacip, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Their condition was not immediately available, nor was the cause
of the fire.
	   Hocahacip is some 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of Ankara,
the capital.
	   Several families are often forced to share houses in rural areas
due to poverty.

Lower house approves political equal rights amendment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French lawmakers early Wednesday adopted a proposed
Constitutional revision affirming the principle of equal access for
women to public or elected posts.
	   After unanimous approval by the National Assembly, the lower
house of parliament, the project to revise the French Constitution
will now go to the Senate for a vote.
	   The Constitutional revision does not specify how women will be
given greater access to elected office, but carries ``a large
symbolic value,'' Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou said.
	   While French women make up 51 percent of the population, the
number holding political office lags behind most European
countries.
	   Women in France hold only 11 percent of the 577 seats in the
National Assembly and 6 percent of Senate seats.
	   On the local level, less than 8 percent of city halls are run by
women.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who backs the measure, suggested
Tuesday that political parties reserve half of each ticket for
women in next year's European parliamentary elections.
	   Jospin is not the first to say the disparity needs to be
corrected. His predecessor, conservative Alain Juppe, also called
the lack of women in politics unacceptable. However, his efforts
failed to bring change.

Apartment house collapses in Rome killing at least seven

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A five-story apartment house collapsed Wednesday,
killing at least seven people and burying dozens of others.
	   The building, in a modern, middle-class area of Rome, collapsed
at dawn, apparently for structural reasons.
	   Sixteen families, or 38 people, were believed to have lived in
the apartment house. Five people were reportedly pulled out alive
by the first rescue workers to reach the scene.
	   ``Seeing this building in a pile of rubble means the chances of
finding more survivors is virtually nil,'' Rome's police chief,
Antonio Pagnozzi, said from the accident site.
	   Residents of nearby buildings joined dozens of police and
firefighters digging through the rubble with their hands, shovels
and heavy machinery. Specially-trained police dogs were trying to
sniff out survivors.
	   The rescue crew also used sensors to try to detect noises or
movement under the rubble.
	   Neighbors said they heard a huge explosion before the building
crumbled, suggesting a gas explosion.
	   Rome's chief firefighter, Luigi Abete, ruled out the
possibility.
	   ``I am certain the collapse was caused by a giving out of the
building's structure, '' said Abete. ``It couldn't have been a gas
explosion because it would have shattered glass everywhere.''
	   The house, with a printing plant on the ground floor, was
reported built in the 1950s.

Anwar's old school friends turn up at trial to show solidarity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS throughout with arguments in court.
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hoping to boost the spirits of an
old school chum, classmates of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim Wednesday attended his trial as the defense entered new
accusations of a political ploy to oust the now jailed politician.
	   Wearing the burgundy red with yellow, black and white striped
ties of their prestigious alma mater, Malay College, many of
Anwar's friends said they did not believe the sensational charges
against him.
	   Anwar, fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in September,
faces abuse of power charges and will be tried separately for
allegedly having engaged in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   He has denied all the accusations against him, saying they were
cooked up to eliminate the challenge he posed to Mahathir's
17-year-rule.
	   Defense lawyers on Wednesday tried to show that police were
aware of a political conspiracy and conducted investigations
accordingly.
	   ``Did you direct your investigations against any politician who
could be involved in a political conspiracy against Anwar?''
defense lawyer Gurbachan Singh asked a top police witness on
cross-examination.
	   ``Yes,'' replied the witness, Assistant Commissioner of Police
Musa Hassan, adding that he had questioned top police officers and
politicians including high-level cabinet ministers.
	   Musa, who led the investigations against Anwar, told the court
that police reopened an investigation earlier this year into the
sexual charges against the then deputy prime minister, one day
after he had publicly clashed with Mahathir at a ruling party
convention.
	   Strife between Mahathir and Anwar had been building for months
leading to this year's June 18-21 general assembly of their United
Malays National Organization. It went public when one of Anwar's
allies lashed out at Mahathir at the assembly, accusing him of
rampant corruption.
	   The prosecution is trying to prove that Anwar had sex with two
people and abused his political power to cover up the sexual
trysts.
	   The government's case is based on accusations by Ummi Hafilda
Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu Bakar,
a former driver for the politician's family.
	   Ummi wrote a letter in 1997 alleging sexual misconduct that was
submitted to Mahathir. Police investigations concluded the charges
were spurious and exonerated Anwar. Mahathir halted the
investigations in August of last year.
	   In court on Wednesday, Musa did not clarify why police reopened
the investigation this year on June 22, a day after the UMNO
meeting ended.
	   The letter's authors retracted their charges, but now say they
were coerced into doing so by police acting on behalf of Anwar.
	   Anwar's school chums inside the courtroom voiced disbelief at
the charges against their former classmate.
	   ``We know the boys who played truant, who sneaked out to the
cinema and did unsavory things. Today they are still like that,''
said Raja Puteri, who has known Anwar for 35 years.
	   ``But Anwar was very religious. He was strict and he did not
like dirty jokes,'' said Raja, smoking a pipe outside the
courthouse.
	   The Malay College old boys network is a virtual who's who of
modern Malaysia. The prestigious school has produced some of the
nation's top diplomats, businessmen and many chief ministers.
	   Even Malaysia's present king is a product of the school, which
is located in the northern town of Kuala Kangsar.
	   Earlier in court Wednesday, a defense lawyer accused Musa of
giving inconsistent testimony, angering prosecution lawyers.
	   Musa had said initially he did not know about a report to
Mahathir on the allegations of sexual misdeeds by Anwar.
Christopher Fernando, the defense lawyer, pointed out that he had
said the opposite on Tuesday.
	   Prosecutors also submitted the result of a DNA test that proved
that Anwar was not the biological father of his former secretary's
daughter.
	   On Tuesday, prosecutors produced a gray mattress that police
said had semen stains from Anwar's alleged illegal sexual acts.

Chief inspector: Iraq did not fully cooperate with inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. weapons inspectors leaving Iraq; EDITS to
conform &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations ordered the evacuation
of its inspectors from Baghdad on Wednesday, a day after chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler reported that Iraq had not met
promises made a month ago to fully cooperate with U.N. monitors and
had imposed new restrictions on their work.
	   On Wednesday morning, three busloads of weapons monitors left
the U.N. compound in Baghdad, followed by four white U.N. cars
carrying spare tires on top. Their destination was unknown.
	   About half an hour earlier, three trucks loaded with luggage
left the U.N. headquarters. One driver said he was headed for
Habbaniya air base, which U.N. personnel often use for entering or
leaving Iraq.
	   The last three visiting teams of weapons inspectors left Baghdad
on Monday, but up to 140 resident experts were to remain in the
country to monitor Iraq's known weapons.
	   ``The staff of UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) has been ordered
to leave Baghdad,'' said George Summerwell, a U.N. spokesman in
Baghdad.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler said that ``Iraq's conduct ensured that no progress was able
to be made in either the fields of disarmament or accounting for
its prohibited weapons programs.''
	   Iraq pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors and
allow unfettered access to sites and documents on Nov. 14, under
threat of U.S. and British airstrikes. Butler accused Baghdad of
blocking access to two sites and hindering inspection of others.
	   There were about 140 U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq and about
400 U.N. workers who regulate an oil-for-food deal with Iraq.
	   In his report, Butler said Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge made it impossible for him to assure that Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Under the cease-fire resolution that ended the Gulf War in 1991,
sanctions against the sale of oil, the mainstay of Iraq's economy,
cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission, which Butler
heads, and the International Atomic Energy Agency certify that
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _ chemical, biological and
nuclear as well as long-range missiles _ have been destroyed.
	   There was no immediate Iraqi reaction to the report.
	   A resolution adopted by the U.N. Security Council says a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions _
which Baghdad desperately wants _ would only go ahead if Butler
reported that Iraq had resumed full cooperation with inspectors.
	   But Annan suggested in a letter to the council president
accompanying the report that council members had three options:
	   _They could decide that Iraq's performance does not justify a
comprehensive review at this time.
	   _They could decide that Iraq should be given additional time to
provide full cooperation.
	   _They could proceed with a comprehensive review ``on the premise
that it is sufficiently important to know precisely what has been
achieved in the area of disarmament over the entire period since
1991.''
	   The Iraqis believe a comprehensive review offers the quickest
route to lifting sanctions. But the United States insists there is
no link, and a review will only show what Iraq needs to do to fully
disarm.
	   While Butler's 10-page report was hard-hitting and fairly
negative, the IAEA's report concluded that Iraq had provided ``the
necessary level of cooperation'' to enable its nuclear inspectors
to complete their work ``efficiently and effectively.''
	   Mohamed El Baradei, the IAEA's director general, said in a
letter to Annan that Iraq pledged to cooperate with the IAEA to
resolve ``the few remaining questions and concerns related to
Iraq's clandestine nuclear program.''
	   In contrast, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction,
evasion and subterfuge that he said made it impossible for him to
assure the Security Council that Baghdad's weapons of mass
destruction have been eliminated.
	   Iraq's claim that it has fulfilled all of its obligations to
disarm and does not possess banned weapons or the ability to make
them ``cannot be accepted without further verification,'' he said.
	   Butler said the U.N. Special Commission had ``clear evidence
that Iraq had taken advance actions at certain of the locations
planned for inspection in order to defeat the purposes of
inspection.''
	   During the past week, inspectors searching for material related
to banned weapons programs went to six locations and were allowed
to search the Taji military facility, a special security
organization cable office, and a private residence, Butler said.
	   But inspectors trying to enter the ruling Baath Party
headquarters _ where they had ``solid evidence of the presence of
proscribed materials'' _ couldn't gain access because Iraq
initially declared it to be a ``sensitive'' site subject to special
procedures and later introduced new requirements, including a
letter indicating what was being sought, Butler said.
	   At two other sites declared ``sensitive'' by Iraq, negotiations
ultimately cleared the way for inspections, he said. But one
building had been emptied of relevant materials, and the other
``had been prepared to avoid any disclosure of relevant materials
and the team assessed Iraq had expected their arrival,'' he said.
	   In light of this, Butler said he decided not to conduct the full
range of inspections the team had planned _ and no inspection of
presidential sites took place.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   ``It remains the commission's strong view that, under the
present circumstances, relevant documentation must exist in Iraq
and that provision of such documentation is the best hope for
revealing the full picture'' of the country's weapons programs, he
said.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Former President Sali Berisha has been
summoned to the state prosecutor's office to answer questions about
allegations that he organized riots three months ago which
threatened to topple the government, officials said Wednesday.
	   Berisha, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, was told to
report Friday at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT). It will mark the first time the
53-year-old Berisha has been interrogated as a possible defendant
in criminal action.
	   Under Albanian law, he could be served with an arrest warrant
during the Friday interrogation. The officials spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   In a statement, Berisha's Democratic Party said the government
action in summoning the former president was part of ``a wild
political vendetta'' against the opposition.
	   The party called on its followers to attend a protest rally
Thursday in Tirana's sprawling Skanderbeg Square.
	   The legal moves come in connection with two days of rioting
which swept the capital of this former Communist country in
September after the unsolved assassination of a leader of Berisha's
party, Azem Hajdari.
	   Berisha accused then-Prime Minister Fatos Nano of the ordering
the killing. A series of protests exploded into violence in which
at least three people were killed and dozens injured.
	   Rioters briefly seized the headquarters of state television and
other government installations.
	   Following the riots, Albania's parliament, controlled by Nano's
Socialist party, stripped Berisha of his parliamentary immunity,
paving the way for criminal charges. Nano later resigned as prime
minister.
	   International diplomats and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe have been trying to mediate between the
Democrats and the Socialists.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
announced Wednesday 600 billion yen (dlrs 5.1 billion) in new
low-interest loans to help troubled Asian countries rebuild their
devastated economies.
	   The loans, for projects such as roads, bridges, power stations
and airports, also will help Japan's sagging economy because the
contractors must be Japanese companies.
	   The money will go to ``countries of Asia who are doing their
utmost to reform their economic structures,'' Obuchi said.
	   It will be disbursed over three years and will be repayable over
40 years at an interest rate of 1 percent, a Foreign Ministry
official said.
	   The new loans were announced in speech delivered by Obuchi
during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations. Japanese officials clearly hoped the speech would display
Japanese leadership in efforts to overcome the region's economic
crisis.
	   Other than money, however, Obuchi announced few new initiatives.
	   Japan has provided far more than other countries in assistance
to affected Asian countries _ a total of dlrs 44 billion to date.
	   It also has created a dlrs 30 billion fund unveiled by Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in October for six Asian countries _
Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia and South Korea.
	   On Wednesday, Obuchi invited Vietnam to apply as well.
	   In the first loans under the plan, Japan's Foreign Ministry said
Obuchi told Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Tuesday
that his country will get up to 117 billion yen (dlrs 1 billion).
Thailand will have dlrs 1.85 billion available.
	   Obuchi said Japan also will contribute 500 million yen (dlrs 4.2
million) to establish a new fund under the auspices of the United
Nations to support international organizations dealing with
problems such as environmental degradation, narcotics and organized
crime.
	   He also said Japan would provide training to an additional
10,000 Asian workers who might otherwise face layoffs at home.
	   Instead of being praised for its largesse, however, Japan has
been frequently accused of dragging the region down economically by
failing to deal promptly with its own economic problems.
	   Obuchi acknowledged that Japan's recovery is vital for growth in
the region, but added that Asia's economic turnaround also is
important for Japan's recovery.
	   He said Japan has been doing its utmost to be a driving force
for Asia's recovery, despite its economic problems.
	   ``I am confident that the Japanese economy will surely recover
and once again vigorously lead the Asian economy,'' Obuchi said.
	   The prime minister stressed that dialogue and cooperation
between Japan and other Asian countries is vital to overcome the
economic crisis in the region. He proposed that Japan, China and
South Korea, as the three major countries in Northeast Asia,
increase their dialogue, with the goal of eventually forming a
``trilateral network.''
	   Obuchi is also scheduled to meet with leaders from Vietnam,
China, South Korea and Cambodia during his four-day trip.
	   He will travel to Ho Chi Minh City on Thursday, where he is to
visit a hospital built using Japanese aid, before returning to
Japan on Friday.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Dollar slides, Japanese stocks rise after a four-day fall

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slid against the yen Wednesday in
thin trading, while Japanese stock prices advanced moderately after
four days of decline.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 85.11 points,
or 0.61 percent, closing at 14,096.30 points. On Tuesday, the
average lost 100.43 points, or 0.71 percent.
	   In late afternoon trading, the dollar bought 115.62 yen, down
1.96 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York level of 116.35 yen overnight.
	   The dollar initially gained some ground from its levels in New
York overnight following slower-than-expected growth in Japan's
October current account surplus, traders said.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the Finance Ministry said that Japan's
current account surplus rose 21.5 percent in October from a year
earlier to 1.335 trillion yen (dlrs 11.4 billion). Economists
surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast on average a surplus
of 1.491 trillion yen (dlrs 12.8 billion).
	   Signs of a slowdown in the growth of Japan's surpluses are
supportive for the dollar, as they allay concerns about trade
friction.
	   Traders said, however, that market attention was mostly focused
on pending impeachment proceedings against President Bill Clinton,
keeping the dollar from rising further.
	   The dollar traded between 115.36 yen and 116.90 yen on
Wednesday.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, many players remained on the
sidelines amid continued worries about the domestic economy.
	   ``It's hard for investors to buy shares until they see a clear
sign of economic recovery in Japan,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general
manager of the stock division with Chuo Securities.
	   Worries about the health of Japanese banks continued to weigh on
the overall market after the government placed the ailing Nippon
Credit Bank under state control over the weekend, Ishikawa said.
	   The market shrugged off local media reports that the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party will soon propose cutting taxes, traders
said.
	   Kyodo News reported Tuesday that the tax panel of the ruling LDP
will propose around 9.3 trillion yen (dlrs 80.17 billion) in tax
cuts and deductions, including 4 trillion yen (dlrs 34.48 billion)
in income tax cuts.
	   An estimated 336 million shares changed hands on the first
section, down from Tuesday's 409 million shares. Advances
outnumbered declines 556 to 528, with 201 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 4.12 points, or 0.38 percent, to 1,093.39. The
TOPIX shed 11.04 points, or 1.00 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.330 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.260 percent,
driving its price down to 103.96 yen from 104.57 yen.

Maternity rules cause staffing problem at Indian wildlife reserve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Northern India's Dudhwa National Park is
facing a peculiar and severe staff shortage: four of its eight
working elephants are pregnant and owed maternity leave.
	   ``This will hit our operations,'' Dudhwa Director Rupak De told
The Associated Press on Wednesday.
	   Wildlife authorities in Uttar Pradesh, the state where Dudhwa is
located, had only this year decided to allow female park elephants
to become mothers and to relieve them from their duties carrying
tourists and park employees during pregnancy and for a period after
giving birth.
	   De set maternity leave at the last year of pregnancy _ an
elephant's gestation period is 22-25 months _ and for two years
after birth.
	   Only female elephants work at the parks, because males are hard
to train. The first Dudhwa elephant to be impregnated, by a wild
male, was sent to the Lucknow Zoo to begin her maternity leave a
few months ago. Park officials recently discovered three others
were pregnant.
	   The elephants work 12- to 14-hour days, starting off by giving
tourists rides. They also haul logs and transport staff around the
park to monitor wildlife, ward off poachers or fight fires.
	   De was on the lookout for healthy young female elephants to fill
in for those on maternity leave.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economy, while continuing its downturn,
will shrink less next year than this year, a research institute
predicted Wednesday.
	   Japan's gross domestic product _ the measure of all goods and
services produced in the country _ will shrink 2.2 percent next
fiscal year, less than an estimated 2.5 percent contraction this
year, Daiwa Institute of Research Ltd. reported.
	   Personal consumption, however, will suffer a steeper drop next
year, falling 2 percent, compared to a predicted 0.4 percent in the
current term, the institute said.
	   Japan's fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends March 31.
	   Daiwa blamed tight lending policies at banks and fears about the
health of the financial system for the poor state of the economy,
which Japan's finance minister said earlier in the week was in
``shambles.''
	   With the nation suffering its worst recession since World War
II, the government has recently drawn up an economic stimulus
package worth a record 24 trillion yen (dlrs 206 billion).
	   But Daiwa predicted that the drop in personal consumption and a
rising jobless rate will weaken the effects of these measures.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's central bank said Wednesday
it has filed criminal charges with police against four executives
of non-listed Thai Capital Finance and Securities Co. Ltd. for
reporting false financial statements to authorities.
	   The Bank of Thailand did not identify the four executives by
name, as is its normal practice, but said it has asked the police
to bar the four from traveling overseas for the time being.
	   The Bank of Thailand said in a statement that Thai Capital
Finance, which is still in operation, reported a series of false
financial statements to central bank authorities between June 30,
1997 and Oct. 3, 1997 in order to seek a capital injection from the
central bank's rescue fund for financial institutions.
	   The central bank said during that time, the company reported it
was running out of cash to repay depositors who were withdrawing
money from the company. The company made six requests for cash
injections from the central bank's Financial Institutions
Development Fund, or FIDF.
	   But actually, the company did not have any cash flow problems
since it then had 179 million to 228 million baht (dlrs 4.9 to 6.3
million) in deposits at commercial banks.
	   The central bank said the company needed then to maintain only
32 million to 39 million baht (dlrs 891,000 to 1.08 million) in
required liquidity reserves.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Telecom said Wednesday it will absorb
all local telephone charges for its business and personal customers
while they are using the company's Internet access service.
	   The SingNet savings will go into effect Jan. 1, and also include
a 30 percent cut in monthly subscriptions for corporate leased line
customers.
	   The company said that the reductions will save customers about
40 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 24.39 million) during the next
two years.
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. said
Wednesday it has won a dlrs 300 million contract to build an oil
drilling ship for an American company.
	   Hyundai will build the 23,000-ton, semi-submersible ship for
Reading &AMP; Bates Falcon Corp. of Houston, Texas, which will use it
to search for oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   Hyundai Heavy Industries, the world's largest shipbuilder, is a
subsidiary of the Hyundai group, South Korea's largest
conglomerate.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government called
Japan's ambassador in and separately held urgent talks with the
United States over a Japanese plan to throttle rice imports with a
tariff of up to 1,200 percent, Trade Minister Tim Fischer said
Wednesday.
	   Fischer said Japan's move to impose the tariff just years after
it had been forced to open up its rice market was a huge concern
for Australia.
	   ``I spoke this morning with Charlene Barshefsky, U.S. Trade
Representative in respect of this, so great was my concern,'' he
said.
	   ``We both agreed that we wanted urgent consultations with the
Japanese government on the matter and we both questioned the
leadership of Japan in going down this pathway.''
	   Fischer said he called in Masaji Takahashi, Japan's Ambassador,
for talks with Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials.
	   Japan currently allows imports to make up just eight percent of
its rice market.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's largest automaker will slash its domestic
production capacity in response to sluggish cars sales amid the
nation's worst recession in decades, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Toyota Motor Corp. will reduce its annual group production
capacity to 3.5 million four-wheel vehicles from the current 3.8
million over a three-year period, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said.
	   Ririko Takeuchi, a Toyota spokeswoman, said the company is now
mapping out a new three-year plan starting in fiscal 1999. But she
added that nothing has been decided.
	   The report in Japan's leading business daily said the reduction
will be the first in production capacity for Toyota, which
manufactured 3.5 million vehicles last year at its domestic plants.
	   The cuts will be made through the closure of some old production
lines or the integration of some of those producing similar models,
the Nihon Keizai said. However, no job cuts are planned, it said.
	   ``It's a long-anticipated move by the automaker, where overall
auto production is way over capacity in Japan,'' said Chikao
Masuzawa, an analyst at ING Baring Securities (Japan).
	   On Wednesday, Toyota Motor said its total domestic automobile
production fell 7.3 percent in November from the year-earlier month
to 267,020 vehicles, marking the ninth straight month of declines.
	   In its latest monthly report, Toyota said exports dropped 4.6
percent on year to 125,985 vehicles as a result of reductions in
shipments to Asia, Europe and other regions.
	   With the November figures, Takeuchi said Toyota's aggregate
domestic production totaled 2.932 million in the first 11 months of
this year, down 9.8 percent from the same period last year.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade rose again in
October, increasing 21.5 percent from a year ago, the government
announced Wednesday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.335 trillion yen (dlrs 11.4 billion) in October, the
Finance Ministry announced.
	   The rise marked the sixth consecutive monthly year-on-year
increase in the surplus, said the ministry, which earlier said it
was the 19th in a row.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure by its trading partners
to revive its sluggish economy to import more goods and cap the
ballooning surplus.
	   A Finance Ministry official, briefing reporters on condition of
anonymity, said there was no change in the upward trend, in which a
steep fall in imports is boosting both the current account and
trade surpluses.
	   In October, exports fell 6.5 percent from the same month last
year to 4.215 trillion yen (dlrs 36.34 billion). But imports
dropped further, falling 16.8 percent to 2.693 trillion yen (dlrs
23.22 billion).
	   As a result, Japan's overall trade surplus rose 19.9 percent to
1.522 trillion yen (dlrs 13.12 billion), while the trade and
services surplus jumped 27.5 percent to 816.9 billion yen (dlrs
7.04 billion) for the month.

SKorea hopes U.S. steel complaint can be settled amicably
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ South Korea hopes a complaint about
rapidly growing sales of South Korean steel in the United States
can be solved through discussions between companies, rather than
government negotiations, an official said Wednesday.
	   South Korean Trade Minister Han Duck-soo said a private-sector
delegation, which will include some government officials, will go
to the United States in early 1999 to discuss the issue with U.S.
counterparts.
	   South Korea's steel exports to the United States have grown
rapidly but are still small, Han said in an interview with Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   ``We didn't export much, but the percentage growth is huge so
the U.S. domestic industry may feel some discomfort with that,'' he
said.
	   ``Rather than haggling about whether exports have increased, we
hope the private sector finds modes of cooperation,'' Han said,
adding that perhaps the two sides could exchange products.
	   U.S. companies have complained that South Korean manufacturers
are dumping steel in the United States. They also are calling for
transparency and fairness in the privatization of South Korean
steel giant Posco and international bidding for bankrupt Hanbo
Steel Industry Co.
	   South Korean steel exports to the United States last year were
dlrs 6.8 billion, and 1998 January-October exports also stood at
dlrs 6.8 billion.
	   Han said under normal circumstances, South Korea makes steel for
domestic use, but because of its economic slowdown, local demand
has dropped. He noted that Japanese and Russian steel exports to
the United States are greater than those from South Korea.
	   In a separate interview, Minister of Finance and Economy Lee
Kyu-sung predicted that South Korea's economy will grow by 2
percent in 1999.
	   Lee said the growth will come mainly in the second half of the
year, with zero growth likely in the first half. This year the
economy is expected to contract by 5.5 percent.
	   Lee said he expects exports will grow modestly, to dlrs 136
billion from dlrs 132 billion this year. Imports will rise rapidly,
reducing the country's current account surplus, he said.
	   Lee added that the recent strengthening of the country's
currency, the won, will likely have less impact on exports than
world demand for South Korean goods.
	   ``As far as exports are concerned, world demand is more
important than the exchange rate,'' Lee said.
	   The United States is the biggest single buyer of South Korean
exports. Asian nations buy about 50 percent of South Korea's
exports.
	   Both ministers were in Hanoi for the annual summit of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Russian parliament considers tax bills
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament on Wednesday weighed several measures
aimed at streamlining the nation's unwieldy tax system in advance
of a debate on next year's budget.
	   The proposed bills seek to lower the value added tax, currently
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent. The
measures also call for revising the personal income tax tables to
take into account the ruble's recent fall.
	   The aim is to create tax incentives for ailing industries, and
encourage more tax evaders to pay what they owe. But critics warn
that tax cuts may only result in even lower government revenues.
	   The measures are expected to win approval in the
Communist-dominated parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other officials have voiced
hopes that the house will also quickly pass next year's budget. The
government says it needs the budget in place to deal with the worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   The budget passage could also help Russia attract loans from
international lenders, who froze disbursements after the crisis hit
in mid-August.
	   In recent years, protracted budget debates often resulted in
Russia living for months without an approved budget, adding to the
nation's economic turmoil.
	   Duma leaders say there will be no long debates this time because
there's widespread support of Primakov and his program.
	   Still, the house probably wouldn't start debating the budget
until Dec. 23 at the earliest, and it must vote on the budget three
times.
	   The draft budget envisages 30 percent inflation in 1999 and an
average ruble rate of 21.5 to the U.S. dollar _ the targets most
experts consider overly optimistic.
	   Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko conceded Tuesday that
the ruble may lose more value than the government had predicted.
The ruble is already trading at between 21 and 22 to the dollar,
and is expected to continue falling next year.
	   Also, inflation will be about 70 percent this year, and
economists say it could rise at an even faster clip next year.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors evacuated Baghdad on
Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. weapons inspector said Iraq
had reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   ``The staff of UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) has been ordered
to leave Baghdad,'' said George Somerwill, a U.N. spokesman in
Baghdad.
	   He said no decision had been made on withdrawing the 400 U.N.
humanitarian monitors from Iraq, but added that they were prepared
to leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   Three busloads of weapons monitors left the U.N. compound in
Baghdad Wednesday morning, followed by four white U.N. cars
carrying spare tires on top.
	   U.N. staff in Iraq sometimes travel from Baghdad to Amman,
Jordan, a 10-hour drive across the desert.
	   About half an hour earlier, three trucks loaded with luggage
left the U.N. headquarters. One of the drivers said he was headed
for Habbaniya air base, which the inspectors often use for entering
or leaving Iraq.
	   ``It seems UNSCOM offices are closed and nearly all the
inspectors have left,'' said a U.N. official in Baghdad, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There were some 140 U.N. weapons experts in Iraq.
	   In his report, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction,
evasion and subterfuge that made it impossible for him to assure
that Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   There was no immediate Iraqi reaction to the report.

Indian premier: Nuclear deterrent a matter of policy, not numbers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's prime minister refused Wednesday
to describe his country's nuclear capabilities, but said they
constituted the minimum necessary defense.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's speech to the upper house
of parliament Wednesday reiterated much of what he said a day
before in the lower house to update lawmakers on his negotiations
with the United States over India's nuclear arsenal.
	   He noted that lawmakers pressed him to elaborate on what he has
called India's ``minimum credible deterrent'' to threats believed
posed by neighboring China and Pakistan.
	   ``It is not a question of numbers, but of a policy approach,''
he said.
	   Vajpayee said India needs no more tests after exploding nuclear
devices under its western desert in May. The focus now is on
missiles to deliver nuclear warheads. Vajpayee said work on
extending the range of India's Agni missile was continuing.
	   The United States is pushing India to adopt limitations on
missile development, as well as sign onto the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty and ban production of fissile material. Six rounds of
U.S.-Indian talks have been held since May, and a seventh is
scheduled in late January.
	   The two countries launched negotiations after Washington slapped
economic sanctions on New Delhi for its series of nuclear weapons
tests in May.
	   Neighboring Pakistan, in response to arch-rival India, conducted
its own nuclear tests and it too is now under sanctions.
	   Washington lifted some sanctions this month after India and
Pakistan announced a moratorium on further testing and promised to
adhere to an international test ban treaty by September, as well as
to control the production and sale of nuclear materials.
	   Aside from the long-range Agni still under development, India
also has a force of 20-50 nuclear-capable medium-range Prithvi
missiles, according to the London defense journal Jane's
Intelligence Review.

UN appeals for dlrs 185 million to aid poor Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Amid trouble between the United
Nations and Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, the global body launched
its annual appeal Wednesday for emergency aid to the shattered
nation.
	   The United Nations asked for a hefty dlrs 185 million just four
months after it pulled its international staff out of Afghanistan
and buried a colleague killed by renegade Taliban soldiers.
	   This year's appeal is nearly 20 percent more than last year,
when the United Nations raised only dlrs 53 million of its dlrs 157
million appeal _ barely one third of its goal.
	   For the first time, the United Nations put in a human rights
clause into its annual appeal.
	   After two decades of war, ``Afghanistan is a country where
gross, systematic and arbitrary violations of human rights are
every day occurrences,'' the appeal document says.
	   The International Red Cross, which also launched its appeal
Wednesday, is seeking dlrs 36.3 million _ 20 percent less that its
previous request.
	   Thomas Gunther head of the Red Cross in Pakistan, cited ``the
volatility in the Afghan conflict.''
	   The Taliban have been assailed for its treatment of women and
ethnic minorities. The United Nations also accused the Taliban of a
bloody massacre of minority Shiite Muslims in northern Afghanistan
in August. The Taliban army blamed renegade soldiers for the
killings.
	   The Taliban also attacked their opponents, led by former
president Burhanuddin Rabbani, who in 1997 reportedly slaughtered
2,000 Taliban soldiers, forcing them to jump into wells and then
throwing grenades into the wells.
	   The Taliban also has attacked the United Nations for continuing
to allow Rabbani to keep the Afghan seat on the Security Council
given that his troops rule barely 10 percent of the country.
	   A ``humanitarian crisis'' is brewing in Afghanistan where
hospitals are without basic medicines and more than one-third of
the civilian population of Kabul is dependent on international aid,
Bronek Szynalski, acting U.N. coordinator for humanitarian aid to
Afghanistan, told a news conference in neighboring Pakistan.
	   ``If intervention is not proceeded with we will have a
humanitarian crisis,'' he warned.
	   U.N. officials, who launched the appeal in Pakistan, said it
hasn't been an easy time for the world body in Afghanistan, where
the United Nations has refused to allow its international staff to
return, citing security concerns.
	   The Taliban and the United Nations have also wrangled over the
Taliban's treatment of women and bickered over the treatment of
U.N. staff. In the 90 percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban,
women and girls are not allowed to go to school, women can't work,
have to wear the all-enveloping burqa and be accompanied by a close
male relatives outside their home.
	   In the beleaguered capital of Kabul, an estimated 30,000 widows
are believed to be the hardest hit by these edicts. They must rely
on their small children who roam the street scavenging for wood and
garbage to sell.
	   ``Afghanistan is one of the most difficult places for the
delivery of humanitarian assistance, yet the needs are as great as
ever before,'' Szynalski said. ``The situation remains extremely
precarious.''

Cook says air strikes could come without warning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As U.N. weapons inspectors evacuated Iraq on
Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said air strikes
could come quickly and without warning in the face of Saddam
Hussein's latest defiance of weapons inspections.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler accused the Iraqi
dictator in a report Tuesday of not meeting promises made last
month to fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors and imposing new
restrictions on their work.
	   ``This is a very serious report and we are taking it very
seriously,'' Cook said. ``It is important to recall that back last
month Saddam Hussein gave an undertaking that there would be
unconditional and unrestricted access for the inspectors, and it
was on that basis that the military action last time was halted.''
	   Butler said in his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that Baghdad had blocked access to two sites and hindered the
inspection of others, impeding the United Nation's continuing
effort to ensure that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction had been
destroyed.
	   ``The situation is very serious, indeed,'' Cook said. ``I would
underline that this is not some kind of technical matter. ... Here
we have a brutal dictator who has a proven track record of using
chemical weapons who is still continuing to acquire the capacity
for chemical and biological weapons, and that cannot be allowed to
continue.''

65 people hurt in shopping center explosion in southern

Philippines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 65 people were injured
when a grenade exploded inside a shopping mall filled with
Christmas shoppers in the southern Philippines, police said
Wednesday.
	   About 200 people crowded the five-story Shopper's Plaza in
Zamboanga for a one-day sale Tuesday when an explosion ripped
through a third-floor toy section, said Zamboanga City police chief
Karib Muammil.
	   The blast sent panicking shoppers fleeing from the building,
said Muammil. At least 15 people were hospitalized and about 50
others were treated for bruises and other slight injuries.
	   ``There was pandemonium,'' said Shiela Celorio, who said she saw
a grenade roll down an isle in the toy section. ``People panicked.
They were screaming and rushing downstairs. My God, I was so
afraid. I thought there will be more explosions.''
	   ``I tried to seek cover. It exploded just seconds later,'' she
said.
	   Leah Lapinig, another customer, said many people were hurt in
the stampede that followed the blast.
	   ``People were pushing each other. I was knocked down on the
floor, got up and ran towards the stairs,'' she said.
	   Muammil quoted witnesses as saying two men were involved in the
attack. he refused to give details.
	   Investigators believed the suspects were members of Muslim
extremist Abu Sayyaf group, which has been reported to have links
with Saudi Arabian dissident Osama Bin Laden blamed in the bombings
of the U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya in August.
	   It is the smaller but more violent of two Muslim rebel groups
still fighting the Manila government to establish an independent
Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
	   It has been linked to several recent kidnappings in Mindanao,
including those of an Italian missionary priest, the family of a
Taiwanese businessman and a group of Hong Kong and Malaysian
traders.

	   Three busloads of weapons monitors left the U.N. compound
Wednesday morning in Baghdad, followed by four white U.N. cars
carrying spare tires on top.
	   U.N. staff in Iraq sometimes travel from Baghdad to neighboring
Amman, Jordan, a 10-hour drive across the desert.
	   About half an hour earlier, three trucks loaded with luggage
left the U.N. headquarters. One driver said he was headed for
Habbaniya air base, which monitors often use for entering or
leaving Iraq.
	   ``It seems UNSCOM offices are closed and nearly all the
inspectors have left,'' said a U.N. official in Baghdad, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   There were some 140 U.N. weapons experts in Iraq.
	   In his report, Butler said Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge made it impossible for him to assure that Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms must be destroyed before the U.N. Security Council
can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   There was no immediate Iraqi reaction to the report.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ German journalist, screenwriter and
director Will Tremper has died. He was 70.
	   Tremper died Monday night at his Munich home, the Burda Verlag
publishing company said.
	   Tremper made a name for himself in the 1950s mainly as a people
reporter for Berlin's Der Tagesspiegel newspaper and Stern and
Bunte magazines.
	   He then turned to film, winning critical acclaim in 1961 for the
action-inspired ``Flight to Berlin.'' In 1963 he won the German
critics prize for his film ``Delay in Marienborn.''
	   After his last film in 1970, ``How did a nice girl like you get
into this business,'' he returned to journalism and also wrote
novels. In 1993 he published an autobiography, ``My Wild Years.''
	   He is survived by his wife, Celia. No information on funeral
arrangements was available.

Hong Kong stocks close lower in lackluster trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices closed slightly lower
Wednesday as investors waited for further developments in the
possible impeachment of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 13.45 points, or 0.13
percent, to 9,939.39.
	   Trading was light amid lack of overseas buying. Turnover was
2.76 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 353 million), less than
the 3.15 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 403 million) traded
in the previous session.
	   The market was ``dull and boring'' as investors remained
cautious ahead of the possible impeachment of President Clinton,
said Ricky Tam of Delta Asia Securities Ltd.
	   Banking giant HSBC Hodlings _ the market's largest company _ was
the day's biggest loser, shedding 3.00 Hong Kong dollars to close
at 186.00 Hong Kong dollars.
	   Other losers were conglomerate Swire Pacific ``A'', shedding
0.50 to close at 35.10; Hutchison Whampoa, down 0.25 at 52.50; and
Citic Pacific, down 0.20 at 17.00.
	   The day's gainers were Sun Hung Kai Properties, up 1.25 to close
at 55.75; Hong Kong Telecom, up 0.30 at 13.80; and China Telecom,
up 0.15 at 14.60.
	   Hong Kong's flag-carrier Cathay Pacific remained unchanged at
7.45.

Iran beats China in semifinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later semifinal &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Iran gained a berth in the Asian Games
soccer final with a 1-0 victory Wednesday over a Chinese side
weakened by the absence of its star striker and coach.
	   For the gold medal, Iran faces the winner of Wednesday's second
semifinal, between Thailand and Kuwait before a packed
Ratchamongkala Stadium.
	   The Chinese exhibited more control at midfield than in their
previous 2-1 defeat against Iran in a group decider last Friday.
	   The defeat leaves the Chinese still unavenged for the Iranian
victory that kept China out of the World Cup finals
	   The first half ended scoreless, with the Chinese containing
Bayern Munich striker Ali Daei, at one point bringing him down
twice deep in their territory in the space of 30 seconds.
	   Daei drew a yellow card in the 18th minute, eliciting boos to
the referee from Iranian fans who were constantly in action,
beating tambourines and dancing.
	   In the second half, Daei showed why he is considered such a
threat after scoring eight goals leading up to the semifinals. In
the fourth minute, he played a 15-meter free kick directly at the
feet of Sayed Ali Mosavi-Hasanzadeh, who shot at point blank range
on Chinese goalie Jiang Jin.
	   The ball bounced straight back at Mosavi and he launched it
again, this time beating Jiang.
	   It was his fifth goal of the tournament.
	   Chinese striker Yang Chen struggled to equalize, threatening
numerous times but never finding the mark.
	   Yang replaced Hao Haidong in the Chinese lineup. Hao was sitting
out the first of a two-game suspension for spitting in the face of
a referee in Monday's quarterfinal victory over Turkmenistan.
	   China's English coach, Bobby Houghton, watched from the stands,
among the capacity crowd of ardent Thai fans awaiting the
subsequent semifinal against Kuwait. He was suspended for one match
for using abusive language at referees and a soccer official.
	   The Thai crowd was still reveling in the national team's
thrilling quarterfinal victory on a golden goal in sudden death
extra time over South Korea. The Thai supporters had their faces
painted with Thai flags, and many wore headbands with the country's
colors.
	   Early in the morning, numerous lines snaked around buildings
housing ticket windows for the soccer game.

Government may make restaurants pay ``chair tax'' to supplement
</HEADLINE>
budget
 &UR; AP Photos Expected
 &UR; By ALISON MUTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ At the ``Red Snake,'' a smoky bar
where actors linger for hours over tripe soup and pork steak
crooned by Gypsy minstrels, the management is anxiously counting
its chairs.
	   It's not because any are missing but because soon the bar may
not be able to afford so many stools, thanks to a scheme by the
impoverished Romanian government to make restaurants, bars and cake
shops pay a ``chair tax.''
	   Under the draft law dreamed up by Finance Minister Decebal
Traian Remes to fill gaps in the budget, restaurants will pay
annually 250,000 lei (dlrs 25) per seat, on top of all their other
taxes.
	   In Romania, where some 35 percent of the economy is estimated to
be underground, some have praised the idea, which needs government
approval before it becomes effective.
	   Restaurants, particularly those still in state hands, are seen
as a gold mine for tax evasion and unaccountable earnings. Their
bookkeeping shows slim profits while the real earnings goes into
their pockets, daily Evenimentul Zilei said in a recent editorial.
	   ``In restaurants a significant economic activity... avoids
fiscal pressure,'' said the editorial. ``If the shoe maker, the
garbage collector and the tailor are stressed by taxes, why not the
agile bar owner?''
	   Waiters can earn in a few shifts the equivalent of what the
average Romanian makes in a month _ 1.2 million lei (dlrs 120).
Cooks fry smaller steaks than the menu recommends and sell the
surplus meat and owners have a host of expenses which can be
difficult to track.
	   But restaurateurs and employees argue that trade is falling in
recent years as purchasing power drops. Some of them wouldn't be in
trade if it weren't for business lunches and weddings.
	   ``We have rent, electricity, salaries, musician fees and other
expenses'' said Eugen Mitrofanov, the maitre d' at the Red Snake.
``This will make things really expensive.''
	   Of course, there are jokes that bars will hide their chairs in
the restroom or the cupboard when the inspectors come round,
although restaurateurs acknowledge that any checks will be done by
plainclothes officials with no prior warning.
	   In the popular ``Spring Time'' fast food joint which has about
150 seats, a floor manager is outraged by the new tax which she
thinks is a clumsy excuse for the government to fill holes in its
budget.
	   ``I can't see much government money going into public
projects,'' said Ioana Baitcu. ``Where in the world do you finds
such a tax?''

South Korean soccer chief to visit North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's top soccer official has
been invited to North Korea to discuss the possibility of holding
some of the 2002 World Cup games there, officials said Wednesday.
	   The invitation was extended by a communist party organization
instrumental in helping South Korea's Hyundai group set up
sightseeing tours of a scenic North Korean mountain.
	   The president of South Korea's Football Association is Chung
Mong-joon, a son of Chung Ju-yung, the founder of Hyundai, who
currently is visiting North Korea.
	   While North Korea has not officially responded to a South Korean
suggestion that it stage some of the 2002 World Cup matches, the
invitation is seen as an indication that it may be willing to do
so.
	   The younger Chung will visit the North for five days in
mid-January to discuss the possibility and seek a resumption of
goodwill soccer matches between the two Koreas, officials said.
	   South Korea is co-hosting the 2002 games with Japan. Each will
stage 32 matches.
	   Sepp Blatter, head of FIFA, soccer's world governing body, said
in Seoul early this month that his organization has no objection to
staging some of the 2002 matches in North Korea if both Koreas
agree to do so.
	   Chang Woong, the North Korean member of the International
Olympic Committee, said in Bangkok last week that inter-Korea
sports exchanges will not be possible unless political tension is
eased.
	   The last soccer matches between North and South Korea took place
in 1990 when their national teams traveled to each other's
capitals.
	   The next year, the two Koreas formed a single team for the world
youth soccer championship.
	   The two Koreas are still technically at war, since the 1950-53
Korean War ended in an armistice, not in a peace treaty. Their
border is the world's most heavily armed, with nearly two million
troops deployed on both sides.

Yeltsin stays at suburban residence Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin remained at a suburban
residence and was not expected to visit the Kremlin on Wednesday as
he continued to recover from his latest illness, his press service
said.
	   Yeltsin has been shuttling between two country residences and
the Kremlin for the past week as he recuperates from pneumonia.
Before that he was treated at a hospital for more than two weeks.
	   He planned to meet Thursday with Swiss President Flavio Cotti,
who is in Russia for a three-day visit. The leaders were expected
to discuss ways to combat economic crimes, among other things.
	   Yeltsin greeted foreign ambassadors, and met with the head of
the Federal Security Service on Tuesday before returning to his
Gorky-9 residence west of Moscow later in the day.
	   Yeltsin has looked stronger and more animated during public
appearances since his release from the hospital. Despite being
sidelined by a string of illnesses over the last several months,
the president brushes off calls from the opposition to step down
before his term ends in 2000.

Five youths who gang raped Thai schoolgirls get life in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Five Thai vocational school students
who abducted two school girls from a Bangkok bus last month and
gang raped them have been sentenced to life in prison, local papers
reported on Wednesday.
	   The rape of the girls, aged 14 and 17, and the indifference of
the passengers who did nothing during or after their abduction by
knifepoint from the bus, has shocked the country and received
prominent play in local papers.
	   Parents of the girls also said the first two police stations
they went to to report the rapes refused to let them file
complaints.
	   Judges at the provincial court in Nonthaburi, a northern suburb,
rejected a request for leniency from the five 18- and 19-year-old
vocational school students, who pleaded they were simply ``young
and stupid,'' according to the Bangkok Post.
	   The crime was ``blatant and inhuman,'' the judges said in
rendering their decision.
	   ``In order to set an example, the harshest penalty must be meted
out,'' they said, according to the Post.
	   One of the five, Prapansak Surisan, sent the court a letter
offering to marry both of the victims in exchange for leniency.
	   Surin Buaban, the aunt of Chatchai Saengsong, also convicted in
the crime, told The Nation newspaper the life sentences were unjust
and called the gang rapes ``a youthful prank.''
	   Chatchai's parents told the paper they would appeal his
sentence, but Prapansak's mother said the case was closed and her
son deserved to be punished.

Chief inspector: Iraq did not fully cooperate with inspectors

CORRECTS U.N. spokesman's name to Somerwill. &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations ordered the evacuation
of its inspectors from Baghdad on Wednesday, a day after chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler reported that Iraq had not met
promises made a month ago to fully cooperate with U.N. monitors.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   On Wednesday morning, three busloads of weapons monitors left
the U.N. compound in Baghdad, followed by four white U.N. cars
carrying spare tires on top. Their destination was unknown.
	   About half an hour earlier, three trucks loaded with luggage
left the U.N. headquarters. One driver said he was headed for
Habbaniya air base, which U.N. personnel often use for entering or
leaving Iraq.
	   The last three visiting teams of weapons inspectors left Baghdad
on Monday, but up to 140 resident experts were to remain in the
country to monitor Iraq's known weapons.
	   ``The staff of UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) has been ordered
to leave Baghdad,'' said George Somerwill, a U.N. spokesman in
Baghdad.
	   Somerwill said no decision had been made on withdrawing the 400
U.N. humanitarian monitors from Iraq, but added that they were
prepared to leave ``should it become necessary.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Iran gained a berth in the Asian Games
soccer final with a 1-0 victory Wednesday over a Chinese side
weakened by the absence of its star striker and coach.
	   For the gold medal, Iran faces the winner of Wednesday's second
semifinal, between Thailand and Kuwait before a packed
Ratchamongkala Stadium.
	   The Chinese exhibited more control at midfield than in their
previous 2-1 defeat against Iran in a group decider last Friday.
	   The defeat leaves the Chinese still unavenged for the Iranian
victory that kept China out of the World Cup finals
	   The first half ended scoreless, with the Chinese containing
Bayern Munich striker Ali Daei, at one point bringing him down
twice deep in their territory in the space of 30 seconds.
	   Daei drew a yellow card in the 18th minute, eliciting boos to
the referee from Iranian fans who were constantly in action,
beating tambourines and dancing.
	   In the second half, Daei showed why he is considered such a
threat after scoring eight goals leading up to the semifinals. In
the fourth minute, he played a 15-meter free kick directly at the
feet of Sayed Ali Mosavi-Hasanzadeh, who shot at point blank range
on Chinese goalie Jiang Jin.
	   The ball bounced straight back at Mosavi and he launched it
again, this time beating Jiang.
	   It was his fifth goal of the tournament.
	   Chinese striker Yang Chen struggled to equalize, threatening
numerous times but never finding the mark.
	   Yang replaced Hao Haidong in the Chinese lineup. Hao was sitting
out the first of a two-game suspension for spitting in the face of
a referee in Monday's quarterfinal victory over Turkmenistan.
	   China's English coach, Bobby Houghton, watched from the stands,
among the capacity crowd of ardent Thai fans awaiting the
subsequent semifinal against Kuwait. He was suspended for one match
for using abusive language at referees and a soccer official.
	   The Thai crowd was still reveling in the national team's
thrilling quarterfinal victory on a golden goal in sudden death
extra time over South Korea. The Thai supporters had their faces
painted with Thai flags, and many wore headbands with the country's
colors.
	   Early in the morning, numerous lines snaked around buildings
housing ticket windows for the soccer game.
	   For Iranian coach Mansour Pourhydari, just happy to reach the
final, ``it made no difference'' who his team's gold medal opponent
might be.
	   ``We were a little tired. We played five matches in 10 days,''
he said.
	   He praised the Chinese team, saying it has improved.
	   ``They played pretty good today. They got a lot more balls then
they used to and their teamwork is better. I think they will be
doing better in football.''

Saudi executed for child-rape

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A man who raped a young boy was
executed Wednesday, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Majed Mohammed al-Dayel, a Saudi citizen, was beheaded in the
capital, Riyadh, the agency said.
	   It said al-Dayel tricked the young boy into going up to the roof
of an apartment building, where he raped him.
	   ``After his heinous act, he then locked the door of the roof,
leaving the boy there for the whole night without any consideration
for any emotional or physical suffering he might go through,'' the
agency said.
	   The agency did not give the boy's age.
	   Al-Dayel had a previous record and was executed to ``put an end
to his evil ways,'' the agency said.
	   Al-Dayel's execution raised to 29 the number of beheadings in
the kingdom this year. Last year 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
the suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do
not have the right to appeal.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police fired tear gas and used batons
to beat protesting students who threw rocks at soldiers near
Jakarta's presidential palace on Wednesday.
	   Several hundred students tried to march on the palace but were
stopped about 400 meters (yards) away by security forces near the
Defense Ministry headquarters.
	   Witnesses said at least three students were seriously injured
and were taken to a nearby hospital by ambulances. Two were
unconscious.
	   Police arrested dozens of others and dragged and carried many of
them away to trucks. Witnesses said some had been beaten and were
bleeding.
	   Some students smashed street lamps and street signs and
overturned large ornamental potted plants on the roadside.
	   The protesters, most of them from a privately-run university,
had demanded that Indonesia's powerful military get out of
politics.
	   They also wanted ex-President Suharto to be put on trial for
corruption.
	   A wave of protests and riots forced Suharto to quit in May after
32 years of autocratic rule. Graft allegations against him are now
being investigated by state lawyers. But he has not been charged.
Suharto has denied any wrongdoing.
	   One witness said police fired tear-gas canisters when students
refused to disperse.
	   Wednesday's violence was the latest in a series of clashes
between students and security forces in recent weeks as political
turmoil in the world's fourth most populous nations continues to
boil.
	   On Nov. 13, security forces opened fired and shot nine students
to death when thousands of protesters tried to march on the
Parliament.
	   Earlier on Wednesday soldiers and police in anti-riot gear
blocked another group of 150 students from marching to the palace.
	   Security personnel placed razor wire on a street behind the
palace.
	   Four armored cars were also moved into position and six military
trucks unloaded guards equipped with shields and batons.
	   A banner unfurled by the students said: ``Put Suharto on trial.
Form a new government.''
	   The students also repeatedly chanted ``reform or revolution.''
	   Also Wednesday, hundreds of students staged protests at the
Attorney General office which is now dealing with the Suharto's
case.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors evacuated Baghdad on
Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. weapons inspector said Iraq
had reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   ``The staff of UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) has been ordered
to leave Baghdad,'' said George Somerwill, a U.N. spokesman in
Baghdad.
	   He said no decision had been made on withdrawing the 400 U.N.
humanitarian monitors from Iraq, but added that they were prepared
to leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz called the report by
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler a ``bad report'' and said it
was ``intended to trigger an American and British military strike
on Iraq.'' His remarks were carried by the official Iraqi News
Agency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes could come
quickly and without warning.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''

Olympics opponents call for full disclosure

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Trying to clear its image after
allegations of bribery, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's ethics
panel plans to scour eight years of documents to find out how
nearly dlrs 13 million was spent.
	   The chairman of the panel, retired Utah Supreme Court Chief
Justice Gordon R. Hall, says investigators will have to rely on
SLOC for information and that the panel has no power to penalize.
	   ``We are not a fact-finding body. We don't do investigations,''
Hall said. ``As far as doing things like removing (SLOC trustees),
we don't have any such authority.''
	   SLOC spokeswoman Shelley Thomas said the five members of the
panel were to be contacted Wednesday, and the organizing committee
is scheduled to meet Friday to initiate the investigation.
	   Thomas could not promise the panel's findings will be made
public, but government leaders and a head of an anti-Olympic group
are warning that anything less won't do.
	   ``The Utah Games effort has been grievously damaged and the
public confidence greatly eroded by the developing bribery
scandal,'' said Stephen Pace, chairman of Utahns for Responsible
Public Spending, an anti-Olympics group.
	   Full disclosure of the bid committee's finance is the only way
to restore that confidence, Pace said in a letter on Tuesday.
	   Salt Lake's bid was funded with private money, and Olympic
officials have refused to open its financial books.
	   But recent revelations that the bid committee, under the
direction of former president Thomas Welch, spent nearly dlrs
400,000 on 13 scholarships _ including six for relatives of
International Olympic Committee members _ and the resulting outcry
from government leaders could force SLOC's hand.
	   Adding to SLOC's problems are revelations that Welch solicited
dlrs 28,000 in free medical services, including plastic surgery,
from Intermountain Health Care, which was recently named the 2002
Winter Games' primary medical provider.
	   Gov. Mike Leavitt called for the ethics investigation on Monday
and has been joined by leaders of Utah's Legislature.
	   House Minority Leader David Jones said Tuesday he will introduce
a bill when the Legislature convenes in January requiring SLOC to
itemize past and future expenditures.
	   ``Utah taxpayers have a great investment in the 2002 Games and
they deserve to know that public revenue is being properly spent,''
he said. Nearly dlrs 60 million in taxpayer money went to build
venues for the Games.
	   Several former Salt Lake Bid Committee board members said they
didn't know about the payments to relatives of the IOC members,
although they knew they were being vigorously courted.
	   ``I always facetiously say I'd rather be an IOC delegate than
king,'' said Fred Ball, a member of the bid committee since its
inception. ``We took very good care of them.''
	   ``I don't think anybody would have expected us to have them in
Motel 6 and take them to Hardees at night,'' said Ball, but he
added that he believed all the wooing was done within existing
rules, which limit the value of gifts to IOC members to dlrs 150.
	   ``As far as I knew, we were playing the game, but playing the
game within the rules,'' said Henry Marsh, a member of the SLOC's
board of trustees and a four-time Olympic steeplechaser.
	   The IOC has begun its own investigation of the Salt Lake bribery
allegations.
	   Salt Lake City Council member Joanne Milner questioned why Mayor
Deedee Corradini didn't know about the bid committee's actions.
	   ``She's supposed to be asking these tough questions as our
representative,'' said Milner, who is looking into what the city
can do to require full SLOC disclosure.
	   ``I know SLOC will conduct an investigation. But good grief, how
impartial can that be? What a conflict of interest,'' she said.

Chernobyl reactor shut down for repairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The only operational reactor at the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant was shut for lengthy repairs that
have been delayed because of energy shortages, officials said
Wednesday.
	   Reactor No. 3 was stopped late Tuesday and is expected to stay
idle until Feb. 16, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom
said.
	   The repairs will include replacing some of the reactor's safety
equipment and checking its other components to make sure the
reactor can operate safely until April 1999, when it is to undergo
additional repairs, a spokesman at Chernobyl said.
	   Ukraine's nuclear authorities originally ordered the reactor
shut for repairs by Dec. 1, but the Energy Ministry asked for a
two-week delay, until another nuclear reactor was restarted,
because it could not compensate for the energy loss otherwise.
	   Two nuclear reactors were restarted this week, allowing energy
officials to finally stop the Chernobyl reactor, where frequent
malfunctions this year have again raised concerns over its safety.
	   The reactor underwent major repairs between July 1997 and May
1998, but has been stopped many times since.
	   Reactor No. 3 has been Chernobyl's only working reactor since
1996, and plans call for the plant to be shut down entirely by
2000.
	   Another of Chernobyl's four Soviet-designed reactors was closed
in 1996, the third has been inactive since a 1991 fire, and the
fourth was destroyed in a 1986 explosion and fire, the world's
worst nuclear accident.
	   Ukraine has five nuclear power plants that account for more than
40 percent of the country's electricity production.

Schroeder travels to eastern Germany to learn region's problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Meeting to start 1500 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder headed with
most of his Cabinet to the former communist east Wednesday to show
solidarity with the economically troubled region.
	   Since taking office in October, Schroeder has been eager to
dispel critics' charges that he had taken little interest in
eastern Germany's problems _ high unemployment tops the list _
since unification in 1990.
	   Now he is launching a series of regular talks with eastern
governors by meeting Saxony's Kurt Biedenkopf, whose area leads the
four other eastern states in closing the economic gap with richer
western Germany.
	   To add weight to the effort, most Cabinet members are
accompanying Schroeder for the afternoon meeting in the state
capital Dresden.
	   The chancellor promised in his inaugural address last month to
hold special Cabinet sessions in the east every two months. He has
also appointed a minister for eastern German affairs, and has
promised to continue massive doses of government aid.
	   Schroeder's bid to reach out to eastern Germans, who make up
about a fifth of the population, is part of a historic eastward
shift of the nation's center of gravity brought on by unification.
	   Next fall, with the government's move from Bonn in the west,
Schroeder will be governing a united Germany from Berlin for the
first time since the Nazi defeat in World War II.
	   Eastern Germans helped lift Schroeder and his Social Democrats
into power by turning against Helmut Kohl in September elections,
their gratitude for the chancellor who unified Germany worn out.
	   But a poll published last week by the Leipziger Volkszeitung
newspaper showed barely half of all easterners think the 7-week-old
center-left government is doing a good job.
	   Topics for Wednesday's talks include Saxony's economic situation
and ways to put young people to work, the future of government aid
to the east and the continuing cleanup of polluted industrial sites
left over from communist times.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's prime minister refused Wednesday
to describe his country's nuclear capabilities, but said they
constituted the minimum necessary defense.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's speech to the upper house
of parliament Wednesday reiterated much of what he said a day
before in the lower house to update lawmakers on his negotiations
with the United States over India's nuclear arsenal.
	   He noted that lawmakers pressed him to elaborate on what he has
called India's ``minimum credible deterrent'' to threats believed
posed by neighboring China and Pakistan.
	   ``It is not a question of numbers, but of a policy approach,''
he said.
	   Vajpayee said India needs no more tests after exploding nuclear
devices under its western desert in May. The focus now is on
missiles to deliver nuclear warheads. Vajpayee said work on
extending the range of India's Agni missile was continuing.
	   The United States is pushing India to adopt limitations on
missile development, as well as sign onto the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty and ban production of fissile material. Six rounds of
U.S.-Indian talks have been held since May, and a seventh is
scheduled in late January.
	   The two countries launched negotiations after Washington slapped
economic sanctions on New Delhi for its series of nuclear weapons
tests in May.
	   Neighboring Pakistan, in response to arch-rival India, conducted
its own nuclear tests and it too is now under sanctions.
	   Foreign minister Jaswant Singh, Vajpayee's envoy in the U.S.
talks, was quoted by local news agencies as adding in an address to
parliament Wednesday that nuclear powers such as the ``sanctions
crazy'' United States demonstrated ``astonishing and unacceptable
arrogance'' in preaching to India the opposite of what they
practiced.
	   Washington lifted some, 9th graf pvs.

All eyes on Thais in soccer semifinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later games, medals &QL;

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Gold medal winners took a back seat at
the Asian Games Wednesday. For Thai spectators, the only game in
town was at the soccer stadium, where their national team sought to
extend the ``miracle'' that took it to the semifinals.
	   Ratchamongkala Stadium was already packed by the time Iran
finished off a 1-0 victory over China, advancing to the gold medal
game against the winner between Thailand and Kuwait.
	   Thais waited in long early morning lines for tickets to see
their team, which had upset the heavily favored South Koreans in
the quarterfinals with a goal in sudden death extra time.
	   The Thai team, meanwhile, had skipped some practice in favor of
a religious ceremony to prepare for the semifinal.
	   With 13 gold medals already, the Thais are having their best
Asian Games ever, and one more Thai reached a gold medal showdown
Wednesday. Tamarine Tanasugarn, the women's top seed, beat China's
Yi Jingqian 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 in the semifinals. She next faces third
seed Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia, who ousted China's Li Fang 7-6
(7-3), 6-1.
	   China won its 93rd gold medal of the games when Wang Yan, the
games record holder, beat teammate Jiang Cuihua in the women's
cycling sprint. Her winning times of 14.463 and 13.450, however,
were well behind her games record of 11.725 set in 1994.
	   In the men's sprint, Yuichiro Kamiyama beat Japanese teammate
Noriaki Mabuchi, but didn't beat the games record of 10.567 he had
set in preliminaries here.
	   A gold by Ryoki Abe in karate's kata competition, in which
entrants are judged on style alone, gave Japan a total of 43, still
behind archrival South Korea's 47.
	   Japan and South Korea were playing later Wednesday for the gold
in baseball.
	   Taiwan, famous for its Little League world baseball titles, beat
China 10-6 for the bronze medal.
	   In the South Asian sport of kabaddi, Pakistan beat Japan 24-7
and won the silver medal. Defending champion India already had
climbed the gold with a perfect 6-0 record and did not play
Wednesday.
	   In Iran's semifinal soccer victory, Bayern Munich striker Ali
Daei, who has scored eight goals himself in this tournament, sent a
free kick that Sayed Ali Mosavi-Hasanzadeh fired at point-blank
range at Chinese goalie Jiang Jin. The ball bounced straight back
at Mosavi, and this time he kicked it past Jiang for the game's
only goal, in the second half's fourth minute.
	   For Iranian coach Mansour Pourhydari, just happy to reach the
final, ``it made no difference'' who his team's gold medal opponent
might be.
	   ``We were a little tired. We played five matches in 10 days,''
he said.

Group to sue Japan for compensation for former sex slaves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A group of attorneys plans to sue the
Japanese government to demand compensation and an official apology
for Taiwanese women enslaved by Japanese troops during World War
II, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
	   ``We will fight to gain the justice that Japan owed those women
50 years ago,'' said Wang Ching-feng, head of a group of Taiwanese
and Japanese attorneys planning the lawsuits.
	   Historians say 200,000 Asians were forced to serve as ``comfort
women'' in Japanese military brothels during World War II.
	   Former sex slaves from the Philippines, South Korea and
elsewhere have also demanded compensation and an apology from
Japan's government.
	   In response, Japan has arranged for a private institution, the
Asian Woman's Fund, to pay U.S. dlrs 18,500 to each of the some 300
former sex slaves in the region.
	   Thirty Taiwanese women rejected that payment plan two years ago,
accusing Japan of dodging responsibility by arranging for the
private group to make the payments.
	   Twelve other former Taiwanese sex slaves have died since Taiwan
began a campaign to demand compensation in 1992.
	   Six Japanese attorneys arrived in Taiwan early this week to help
gather information for use in the lawsuits expected to be filed
early next year.
	   The attorneys told a news conference Wednesday they were willing
to sue their own government to help unveil the truth about history.

Casualty toll rises in South African tornado
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UMTATA, South Africa (AP) _ Police guarded against looters on
the devastated streets of this eastern town Wednesday after a
tornado ripped through, killing 17 people. President Nelson Mandela
narrowly escaped injury.
	   The death toll from the Tuesday afternoon tornado rose to 17
from the previous count of 13 after more bodies were found,
including that of a 20-year-old woman who had been struck by
lightning. About 162 people were injured. The disaster was
compounded because the storm badly damaged Umtata's hospital.
	   Mandela, 80, whose home is about 20 kilometers (12 miles)
outside Umtata, was shopping at a pharmacy when the storm hit.
	   The storm shattered the windows of the pharmacy, blew down the
door and collapsed part of the roof. Mandela's bodyguards acted
quickly to protect the president, said his spokeswoman, Priscilla
Naidoo.
	   ``When they saw glass shattering they laid the president down
and shielded his body from flying debris,'' Naidoo said. ``They
were on the ground for about 60 seconds.''
	   Mandela and his bodyguards all emerged unhurt and left in his
armored limousine, Naidoo said.
	   The pharmacy was located in the hard-hit town center, where all
the trees on the main street were uprooted and several buildings
destroyed, according to police Director Chris Louw.
	   Mandela planned to visit some of the wrecked sites on Wednesday,
Naidoo said.
	   Officials were assessing the damage, which would take weeks,
perhaps months, to clean up, said police Inspector John Fobian.
	   ``Security officials are still guarding the town's central
business district to prevent people from looting,'' he said.
	   A tornado also touched down Tuesday about 250 kilometers (155
miles) west
	   of Umtata in Hogsback, killing a 10-year-old girl and injuring
three other children.

Iran beats China in semifinal

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stadium overcrowded, 2nd graf &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Iran gained a berth in the Asian Games
soccer final with a 1-0 victory Wednesday over a Chinese side
weakened by the absence of its star striker and coach.
	   For the gold medal, Iran faces the winner of Wednesday's second
semifinal, between Thailand and Kuwait before a crowd that
overflowed the 60,000-seat Ratchamongkala Stadium, blocking
corridors and emergency exits. Riot police stood by.
	   The Chinese exhibited more control at midfield than in their
previous 2-1 defeat against Iran in a group decider last Friday.
	   The defeat leaves the Chinese still unavenged for the Iranian
victory that kept China out of the World Cup finals
	   The first half ended scoreless, with the Chinese containing
Bayern Munich striker Ali Daei, at one point bringing him down
twice deep in their territory in the space of 30 seconds.
	   Daei drew a yellow card in the 18th minute, eliciting boos to
the referee from Iranian fans who were constantly in action,
beating tambourines and dancing.
	   In the second half, Daei showed why he is considered such a
threat after scoring eight goals leading up to the semifinals. In
the fourth minute, he played a 15-meter free kick directly at the
feet of Sayed Ali Mosavi-Hasanzadeh, who shot at point blank range
on Chinese goalie Jiang Jin.
	   The ball bounced straight back at Mosavi and he launched it
again, this time beating Jiang.
	   It was his fifth goal of the tournament.
	   Chinese striker Yang Chen struggled to equalize, threatening
numerous times but never finding the mark.
	   Yang replaced Hao Haidong in the Chinese lineup. Hao was sitting
out the first of a two-game suspension for spitting in the face of
a referee in Monday's quarterfinal victory over Turkmenistan.
	   China's English coach, Bobby Houghton, watched from the stands,
among the capacity crowd of ardent Thai fans awaiting the
subsequent semifinal against Kuwait. He was suspended for one match
for using abusive language at referees and a soccer official.
	   The Thai crowd was still reveling in the national team's
thrilling quarterfinal victory on a golden goal in sudden death
extra time over South Korea. The Thai supporters had their faces
painted with Thai flags, and many wore headbands with the country's
colors.
	   Early in the morning, numerous lines snaked around buildings
housing ticket windows for the soccer game.
	   For Iranian coach Mansour Pourhydari, just happy to reach the
final, ``it made no difference'' who his team's gold medal opponent
might be.
	   ``We were a little tired. We played five matches in 10 days,''
he said.
	   He praised the Chinese team, saying it has improved.
	   ``They played pretty good today. They got a lot more balls then
they used to and their teamwork is better. I think they will be
doing better in football.''

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singaporean Muslims will start eating duck now
that the republic's first halal license for the birds has been
granted to a local poultry company, television reported Wednesday.
	   Heng Kwee Keng Poultry Co. conducted a survey of Muslims and
found they would be willing to eat ducks if they are slaughtered
according to Islamic practice.
	   The company hired Muslim workers to slaughter the ducks, and
hopes to see a 20 percent increase in sales over the next three
years. Muslims comprise 14.9 percent of the population aged 10
years or older.

China executes seven for armed robbery

 &UR; Eds: Incorporates material from BC-China-Death Sentence

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Authorities in southern Guangdong province have
executed seven gang members who were convicted for dozens of armed
robberies and possession of and trafficking in guns and ammunition,
according to a report seen Wednesday in Beijing.
	   The members of what was known as the ``two gun, one axe'' gang
were executed Tuesday after Guangdong's highest court rejected
their appeals, the local newspaper Yangcheng Evening News reported.
	   It said the group's members were found guilty of killing three
people and committing about 50 armed robberies or burglaries as
well as trafficking in weapons.
	   A court in Beijing, meanwhile, has sentenced to death a man
convicted of selling heroin, the official newspaper China Daily
reported Wednesday.
	   Ma Yong, an unemployed man from Gansu province _ a drug
trafficking corridor in northwestern China _ was caught selling 299
grams (10 1/2 ounces) of heroin in a Beijing park last May, the
report said.
	   The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate Court, which sentenced Ma on
Monday, also sentenced an accomplice, Yan Yiling, to life
imprisonment, it said. The court also ordered the confiscation of
all of Ma and Yan's property.
	   The report said the two could appeal to a higher court within 10
days after the verdict.
	   The severe sentences were cited as evidence of the government's
determination to curb the fast-growing trade in illegal drugs.

Quebec feeling cheated from 2002 Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Members of the delegation for Quebec City's 2002
Winter Olympics bid feel betrayed in light of the scandal
surrounding the successful bid by Salt Lake City.
	   ``You have to be disappointed when you realize that not all the
players were playing by the same rules,'' Quebec City 2002 bid
chief Rene Paquet said. ``It's really unfortunate.''
	   Quebec City lost out to its American rival for the 2002 Games.
The vote wasn't close, but it since has been revealed that Salt
Lake City used nefarious means of winning the favor of some
International Olympic Committee members.
	   A dlrs 500,000 ``humanitarian aid'' program was set up by the
Salt Lake City bid committee, part of which paid for the education
of six relatives of IOC members.
	   One has been identified as Sonia Essomba, daughter of Rene
Essomba, an IOC member from Cameroon who died Aug. 31.
	   Swiss IOC executive committee member Marc Hodler called the fund
nothing more than a bribe, and Salt Lake City organizers have since
apologized for the ``embarrassment'' caused by the scandal.
	   What is particularly frustrating to Paquet and his colleagues is
that the Quebec City group long held suspicions that some rival
bids were using underhanded methods to sway IOC voters.
	   ``We had doubts that all the candidate cities were playing
absolutely by the rules,'' said Paquet, a Quebec City lawyer and
businessman. ``But having doubts is one thing and being able to
produce some specific facts is another.''
	   Paquet said his group heard rumors that some of the rival bid
groups resorted to devious means of winning votes, rumors that have
been confirmed at the IOC meetings in Lausanne, Switzerland, last
weekend.
	   He said the IOC has to get a better handle on how much each city
spends in bidding for Games and where the money goes. As for Salt
Lake City's humanitarian aid package, Paquet said his group could
not have set up such a fund even if it wanted to because every
dollar spent by Quebec City 2002 had to be accounted for.
	   ``No bid city had more of an open budget than we did,'' he said.
``Because much of our budget came in the form of government and
corporate grants, everybody knew where the money came from and
where it went.''
	   As with the case with Toronto 1996 bid chief Paul Henderson,
Paquet was approached by an ``agent'' offering to help sway certain
IOC members to vote Quebec City's way _ for a price _ during the
bidding process for the Games.
	   ``My answer was quick and precise,'' Paquet said. ``We did not
play that game.''

Insurance workers protest privatization plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Some 200,000 employees of state-owned
insurance companies held a one-day nationwide strike Wednesday to
protest government plans to both privatize the business and open it
up to foreigners.
	   ``Such an anti-national decision ought to be opposed with all
our strength,'' R.P. Manchanda, president of the national insurance
employees union, told Press Trust of India news service. Manchanda
joined scores of fellow employees in a demonstration outside the
Life Insurance Corp.'s New Delhi headquarters.
	   United News of India said similar rallies were held across the
country at Life Insurance Corp. and General Insurance Corp.
offices.
	   Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha, of the Bharatiya Janata Party
that leads the governing coalition, introduced the insurance bill
Tuesday in parliament, where it was immediately sent to a committee
for fine-tuning and is unlikely to come up for vote in this
session, which ends next week.
	   BJP moderates overrode objections from the party's right wing to
propose allowing private insurance companies to be established with
up to 40 percent foreign investment. India's main opposition
Congress party says it broadly supports the bill, but has questions
about such issues as the level of foreign investment allowed and
the scope of powers of a proposed regulatory authority.
	   Leftists who staged nationwide protest last week against the
BJP's economic policies argue working people will be hurt because
foreigners will destroy indigenous businesses. Those on the far
right have joined the left in opposing the insurance bill, saying
India should allow no foreign meddling in its economy.
	   Reformers say the Indian economy will be strengthened by foreign
money, ideas and entrepreneurs.
	   India's insurance companies were taken over by the government in
1973 after then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi accused them of being
inefficient.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police fired tear gas and used batons
to beat protesting students who threw rocks at soldiers near
Jakarta's presidential palace on Wednesday.
	   Hundreds of students in three groups tried separately to march
on the ornate white-columned mansion, but were blocked by security
personnel.
	   At least three students were hospitalized and dozens were
arrested. Some were bleeding as they were dragged into military
trucks and taken away, witnesses said.
	   The protest took place even though President B.J. Habibie was in
Hanoi attending a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
	   Police fired tear gas and hit the members of one group after
they threw rocks near the Defense Ministry headquarters about 400
meters (yards) from the palace.
	   Some students smashed street lamps and street signs and
overturned large ornamental potted plants on the roadside.
	   One witness said police fired tear-gas canisters when the
students refused to disperse.
	   The protesters, from several universities, had demanded that
Indonesia's powerful military get out of politics.
	   They also wanted ex-President Suharto to be put on trial for
corruption.
	   A wave of student protests and riots forced Suharto to quit in
May after 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   Graft allegations against him are now being investigated by
state lawyers. But he has not been charged. Suharto has denied any
wrongdoing.
	   Wednesday's violence was the latest in a series of clashes
between students and security forces in recent weeks as political
turmoil in the world's fourth most populous nation continues to
boil.
	   On Nov. 13 security forces opened fired and shot nine students
to death when thousands of protesters tried to march on the
Parliament.
	   Earlier on Wednesday soldiers and police in anti-riot gear
blocked another group of 150 students from marching to the palace.
	   Security personnel placed razor wire on a street behind the
building.
	   Four armored vehicles were moved into position and six military
trucks unloaded guards equipped with shields and batons.
	   A banner unfurled by the students said: ``Put Suharto on trial.
Form a new government.''
	   The students also repeatedly chanted ``reform or revolution.''
	   Later several hundred students congregated near the heavily
guarded National Monument in a park adjacent to the palace. But
they were corralled by security forces.
	   In another part of Jakarta, about 500 students shook the
wrought-iron gates of Indonesia's attorney general's office
demanding that Suharto be taken to court immediately.
	   Some students threw garbage at police guarding the building. But
officers did not respond.
	   The office is in charge of investigating Suharto.
	   Last week state prosecutors questioned the 77-year-old ex-leader
about his wealth.
	   State lawyers quizzed Suharto soon after his resignation six
months ago, but said they failed to find any evidence against him.
	   Habibie, Suharto's successor, ordered a new investigation be
launched amid accusations that the initial probe had been too soft.

Myanmar military government says more opposition members resign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Fifty three more members of Myanmar's
main opposition party, the National League for Democracy have
resigned voluntarily, the state-run New Light of Myanmar reported
on Wednesday.
	   ``They no longer wished to participate in political activities
of NLD,'' the paper said.
	   In addition, the party's office in Tachilek, a northern city
straddling the border with Thailand, has been closed and the local
chapter of the party disbanded, the paper said.
	   NLD leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi has
said the resignations have been coerced by the military and her
party's leadership does not recognize them as valid.
	   Since the middle of the year, the military government has
arrested nearly a thousand NLD members, only releasing those who
resign from the party or sign agreements to cease all political
activity.
	   For months the military insisted that the arrested NLD members
were staying at government guest houses by their own choice and
engaging in friendly discussions with their hosts.
	   But at a press conference earlier this month, Col. Hla Min, the
government spokesman, called the NLD members hostages and said they
wouldn't be released until Suu Kyi rescinded her call to convene
the country's parliament.
	   Most of the arrests took place just before Suu Kyi attempted to
hold a meeting of parliament in September.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990
election, but the military has refused to let the assembly meet or
honor its pledge to hand over power to the victors.

Sri Lanka's new military chief says Tamil rebels smaller, still

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's new military chief said
Wednesday that the Tamil Tigers were a less effective fighting
force after a series of offensives by government troops, but the
rebels were still very dangerous.
	   ``They have a number of experienced hard-core fighters who are
kept for big attacks, but that number is reduced compared to what
they had earlier,'' Lieutenant General Srilal Weerasooriya told
reporters after taking over as army chief Wednesday.
	   Weerasooriya, 54, said the military would keep up the pressure
on the rebels, but in the end, only a political solution would
ensure an end to the ethnic conflict.
	   ``We have been given a task to defeat the LTTE, defeat them as a
force that is not strong enough for them to continue,'' he said.
	   He did not give details of estimates of the guerrillas'
strength.
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a homeland in the northeast,
saying the country's minority ethnic Tamils are discriminated
against by the majority Sinhalese who control the government and
military. More than 56,000 people have been killed in the war.
	   Weerasooriya earlier headed the bloodiest offensive in the
16-year civil war, a failed 19-month attempt to capture a vital
highway in the northern war zone which cost more than 7,000 lives.
	   The government called off the offensive two weeks ago after
wresting control of only 40 kilometers (24 miles) of the
70-kilometer (45-mile) highway.
	   Government troops have since launched another offensive in the
direction of Mullaittivu, the largest town under rebel control, but
it is unclear whether the guerrilla bastion is their target.
	   Weerasooriya said the quality of rebel fighters had fallen in
recent times.
	   ``There are more who are surrendering, less who take the cyanide
capsule, and we see younger people among the Tigers now,'' he said.
	   Each rebel carries a cyanide capsule around his or her neck.
They are under orders to take the capsules to commit suicide rather
than be captured.

Ukraine's parliament votes down privatization of telecom monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament rejected a government
bill allowing privatization of the country's telecommunications
monopoly, news reports said Wednesday.
	   Deputies voted 161-71 late Tuesday to label the bill as
violating the constitution and are expected to debate another bill
on privatization of Ukrtelecom next week, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The government wants to sell up to 30 percent of Ukrtelecom and
use the earnings to pay off its mounting debt in overdue wages, but
intends to keep a controlling stake in the company for at least
five years.
	   Under current law, telecommunications companies in the former
Soviet republic are on a list of businesses barred from
privatization, and can go into private hands only with parliament's
permission.
	   Ukrtelecom officials said Ukraine could raise as much as dlrs
2.4 billion from selling a 25 percent stake in the company, which
includes 35 subsidiaries and 738 branches throughout Ukraine and
employs 130,000 people.
	   The company recorded more than dlrs 6 million in profits in
1997, and intends to invest 500 million hryvna (dlrs 146 million at
the current rate) in Ukraine's telecommunications sector this year,
the independent Ukrainian News agency said.
	   Ukrtelecom and Ukraine's oil and gas pipeline network are widely
considered its only properties that could bring back large foreign
investors who massively withdrew from the country this year, wary
of its unstable financial situation.
	   Ukraine's government owes more than dlrs 1 billion to state
employees and pensioners, and has been short of cash for years
because of poor tax collection and lack of reforms to boost
economic growth.

Russian parliament passes bill on printing rubles

 &UR; EDs: LEADS with 7 grafs on parliament passing bill to print
rubles. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament approved a bill Wednesday that allows
the government to print 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.2 billion) _ an
amount that will help pay the state's bills, but which may also
provoke more inflation.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
workers and pensioners, among others. But with inflation already
running at around 70 percent this year, the fresh infusion of cash
could push prices even higher.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, unanimously passed the
measure Wednesday on the final reading. President Boris Yeltsin's
government is authorized to print the new money until the end of
the year.
	   The bill now goes to parliament's upper house, which is expected
to approve it swiftly, and then to Yeltsin, who is expected to sign
it without delay.
	   The Russian government has already begun printing rubles in
recent months to cover its huge budget deficit. As expected, the
value of the currency has been declining and inflation has been
rising.
	   In an attempt to shore up the currency, the bill passed
Wednesday also requires Russian exporters to repatriate 75 percent
of their hard-currency earnings, up from the current 50 percent.
This will keep more foreign currency inside Russia.
	   Russia is struggling with its worst economic crisis since the
Soviet Union collapsed, and the government has been assembling a
series of measures to guide the country out of its depression.
	   Parliament also was weighing several measures aimed at
streamlining the nation's unwieldy tax system in advance of a
debate on next year's budget.
	   The proposed bills seek to lower the value added tax, currently
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent. The
measures also call for revising the personal income tax tables to
take into account the ruble's recent fall.
	   The aim is to create tax incentives for ailing industries, and
encourage more tax evaders to pay what they owe. But critics warn
that tax cuts may only result in even lower government revenues.
	   The measures are expected to win approval in the
Communist-dominated parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other officials have voiced
hopes that the house will also quickly pass next year's budget. The
government says it needs the budget in place to effectively deal
with the crisis.
	   In recent years, protracted budget debates often resulted in
Russia living for months without an approved budget, adding to the
nation's economic turmoil.

Muslim youths force hospital closure in Ghana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana, (AP) _ Authorities have closed a major regional
hospital after angry Muslim youths threatened the lives of staff
members, a news agency report said.
	   The Kintampo Government Hospital in Ghana's Brong-Ahafo region
was closed down Tuesday following repeated threats and an attack on
the hospital by the youths Thursday, the Ghana News Agency
reported.
	   According to hospital officials, the trouble started after a
doctor performed post-mortem examinations on the bodies of two
Muslims who had died in an accident.
	   Relatives had become angry after they had asked that the bodies
be released immediately for burial, but were asked to wait until

objects to having post-mortem exams performed.

Poll says National Front could lose half of voters over schism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's far-right National Front could lose up to
half its voting bloc over the feud between the party's two leaders,
according to a poll published Wednesday.
	   The Sofres poll, conducted for the Nouvel Observateur magazine,
said 36 percent of National Front voters remain loyal to party
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, while 33 percent back Bruno Megret, Le
Pen's rebellious former lieutenant.
	   If Le Pen and Megret present separate lists for next spring's
European elections, 41 percent of National Front supporters would
vote for another party and 12 percent would abstain, the survey
said.
	   Three hundred National Front supporters were questioned in the
survey.
	   Le Pen, 70, the longtime leader of the extreme-right party, is
fighting to retain control of his ranks.
	   On Tuesday, Megret's backers announced they will hold an urgent
party congress Jan. 24 to determine the party's future. Le Pen
bitterly opposes the meeting.

HARARE, Zimbabwe: South Africa.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Banana said he had fled Zimbabwe to escape political persecution
and meet with ``real friends,'' including President Nelson Mandela
of South Africa.
	   ``I left the country because I was in possession of dangerous
information, so I had to share it with my real friends,'' the
63-year-old Banana said without elaborating.
	   The Harare High Court set Dec. 23 for sentencing on 11 gay sex
charges.
	   On Sunday, Mandela and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
discussed Banana's.
	   Mandela said then the two leaders reached a ``common position''
on Banana, believed to be an agreement to persuade him to return
home, possibly as part of deal for a light sentence or even a
pardon from Mugabe.
	   Banana, a Methodist minister and theology professor, served as
ceremonial president after independence in 1980 until 1987.
	   State prosecutors say Banana fled first to neighboring Botswana,
where he met with church and political officials, and then to South
Africa, entering both countries illegally after surrendering his
passport during his trial earlier this year.
	   Mandela triggered controversy when he saw Banana at his Pretoria
residence at Banana's request this month.
	   Attorney Erik Morris, acting for Banana last Friday, told the
court the politician had left the country ``not to defeat the
course of justice or evade punishment.''
	   ``He had a political agenda and wished to meet with heads of
state, for he had matters to impart,'' Morris said.
	   Next week's hearing will also consider Banana's status after he
jumped bail and crossed international borders illegally, forfeiting
his bail of 30,000 Zimbabwe dollars and the title deed to his
Harare home.
	   Chief state prosecutor Augustine Chikumira, who agreed to
Banana's house arrest, said that under Zimbabwe law, there was no
maximum penalty for Banana's convictions. Chikumira said Banana
faced a fine or prison term.
	   Earlier, state prosecutors had said Banana faced up 22 years in
jail for the 11 convictions.
	   Reports by the state media Wednesday said Banana had surrendered
at the border with South Africa Tuesday and was whisked to Harare
in a limousine accompanied by Zimbabwean detectives.
	   Mugabe, at a church assembly last week, praised Banana for his
political role combating racism in the church before independence
in 1980. The state media has also urged Zimbabweans to forgive
Banana, seen as a sign of a likely pardon.
	   Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe.
	   Banana was prosecuted after revelations of his predatory
homosexuality were made in the trial of a police inspector who
killed a colleague for taunting him over a three year sexual
relationship Banana forced on him while president.

Controversial Russian tycoon calls for ban of Communists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with liberal lawmakers assailing Communists,
Communists lashing out at the media in new grafs 7-10. ADDS
byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky on
Wednesday called for banning the Communist party, a day after a top
Communist lawmaker accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the
country.
	   Berezovsky said the government should use force to get rid of
the Communists if it needs to.
	   ``The later they use force the more blood that will be shed,''
Berezovsky said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   At impeachment hearings Tuesday against President Boris Yeltsin,
Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin said Russia's post-Soviet
collapse would not have happened if Russia's government was not
made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.''
	   Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of Jews in
prominent positions, but they have always been outnumbered by
ethnic Russians.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, made similar
anti-Semitic remarks at a Moscow rally in October. Berezovsky
demanded the Communist Party be disbanded at that time as well.
	   ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock,
and not in the Duma,'' Interfax quoted Berezovsky as saying.
	   Members of the liberal Yabloko faction on Wednesday called for a
resolution denouncing Ilyukhin's statement, but parliament did not
immediately act on the proposal.
	   Unrepentant after his statements, Ilyukhin responded to the
motion by accusing liberals of fueling anti-Semitism in Russia.
	   ``What kind of democracy is it when a Russian man can't speak
the truth,'' he said Wednesday.
	   Other Communists demanded that Russian television networks be
banned from covering the Duma's activities because they said
coverage of Ilyukhin's Tuesday remarks was biased against him.
	   The business daily Kommersant speculated on Wednesday that
Ilyukhin made the statements to provoke the Kremlin into trying to
ban the Communist Party.
	   ``That would strengthen the party's image as the main opposition
force,'' the newspaper said.
	   Yeltsin banned the Communist Party for one year in the early
1990s, but it quickly rebounded as the country's leading opposition
group and now has the largest faction in parliament's lower house,
the State Duma.
	   The Communists and Berezovsky have never been on good terms.
Many Communists believe Berezovsky, one of the country's richest
and most powerful businessmen, symbolizes the wild, unrestrained
capitalism that has emerged in post-Soviet Russia.
	   The Communists have also demanded that Berezovsky step down from
his post as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, a loose grouping of 12 ex-Soviet republics.

Ponting says he was approached by bookmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Test batsman Ricky Ponting said
Wednesday he wants to the first player to appear at an Australian
Cricket Board inquiry into the bookmaker scandal to ensure no slur
can be cast over his much-publicized gambling habit.
	   ACB chief executive Malcolm Speed earlier revealed that Ponting
had told him last week about an approach from an Australian
bookmaker to supply information about the national team in return
for money.
	   Ponting rejected the offer, made in Sydney about a year ago, and
wants to
	   put his case as soon as possible to the inquiry into player
conduct which was set up in response to the betting controversy
involving fellow Australian players Shane Warne and Mark Waugh.
	   Speed gave details of the inquiry _ to be chaired by Brisbane
lawyer Rob O'Regan _ at a media conference.
	   ``What Ricky said to me, which I accept unreservedly, is that
approximately a year ago in Sydney he was approached at a dog race
meeting,'' Speed said.
	   ``He was approached by a bookmaker, (who) asked him to provide
information about the makeup of the Australian team and, in
essence, who was going to be 12th man, the condition of the pitch
and similar information.
	   ``In return for that, he (Ponting) would be paid money.
	   ``Ricky assures me he rejected the approach out of hand, he
walked away from the person who made the offer and he immediately
reported that approach to his manager. I've confirmed that with his
manager.''
	   Speed declined to say how much money Ponting said he had been
offered, while Ponting apparently did not name the bookmaker.
	   It is understood Ponting approached Australian team management
last week in Adelaide, immediately after a meeting where the
players were told the story about Waugh and Warne was about to go
public.
	   Speed then spoke to Ponting and it was decided to keep the
matter quiet until after the third Ashes test, which Australia won.
	   Ponting, whose test berth is under threat because of poor form,
released a book a few weeks ago titled ``Punter'' and is renowned
for his betting.
	   The board fined Waugh and Warne in 1995 after it was learned
they had received money from an Indian bookmaker for pitch and
weather information during the 1994 tour of Sri Lanka.
	   As a result of the scandal, the ACB announced late last week it
would hold the inquiry.
	   Meanwhile, Speed is hopeful Waugh and Warne will not have to go
to Pakistan in response to a summons from that country's judicial
commission into match-fixing and bribery.
	   Waugh and Warne alleged that former Pakistan captain Salim Malik
offered money for them to play badly during the 1994 tour of that
country.
	   The Pakistanis claim the news of the bookmaker affair in Sri
Lanka weakens the Australians' credibility.
	   Waugh and captain Mark Taylor appeared at the inquiry while on
tour in Pakistan in October and Taylor said this week there was
nothing to add.
	   The ACB has suggested a video link between the two countries, or
for members of the Pakistan inquiry to visit Australia, and is
awaiting a response from the Pakistan Cricket Board. (djp)

UN appeals for dlrs 185 million to aid poor Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS last graf with U.N. appeal split into two categories &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Amid trouble between the United
Nations and Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, the global body launched
its annual appeal Wednesday for emergency aid to the shattered
nation.
	   The United Nations asked for a hefty dlrs 185 million just four
months after it pulled its international staff out of Afghanistan
and buried a colleague killed by renegade Taliban soldiers.
	   This year's appeal is nearly 20 percent more than last year,
when the United Nations raised only dlrs 53 million of its dlrs 157
million appeal _ barely one third of its goal.
	   For the first time, the United Nations put in a human rights
clause into its annual appeal.
	   After two decades of war, ``Afghanistan is a country where
gross, systematic and arbitrary violations of human rights are
every day occurrences,'' the appeal document says.
	   The International Red Cross, which also launched its appeal
Wednesday, is seeking dlrs 36.3 million _ 20 percent less that its
previous request.
	   Thomas Gunther head of the Red Cross in Pakistan, cited ``the
volatility in the Afghan conflict.''
	   The Taliban have been assailed for its treatment of women and
ethnic minorities. The United Nations also accused the Taliban of a
bloody massacre of minority Shiite Muslims in northern Afghanistan
in August. The Taliban army blamed renegade soldiers for the
killings.
	   The Taliban also attacked their opponents, led by former
president Burhanuddin Rabbani, who in 1997 reportedly slaughtered
2,000 Taliban soldiers, forcing them to jump into wells and then
throwing grenades into the wells.
	   The Taliban also has attacked the United Nations for continuing
to allow Rabbani to keep the Afghan seat on the Security Council
given that his troops rule barely 10 percent of the country.
	   A ``humanitarian crisis'' is brewing in Afghanistan where
hospitals are without basic medicines and more than one-third of
the civilian population of Kabul is dependent on international aid,
Bronek Szynalski, acting U.N. coordinator for humanitarian aid to
Afghanistan, told a news conference in neighboring Pakistan.
	   ``If intervention is not proceeded with we will have a
humanitarian crisis,'' he warned.
	   U.N. officials, who launched the appeal in Pakistan, said it
hasn't been an easy time for the world body in Afghanistan, where
the United Nations has refused to allow its international staff to
return, citing security concerns.
	   The Taliban and the United Nations have also wrangled over the
Taliban's treatment of women and bickered over the treatment of
U.N. staff. In the 90 percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban,
women and girls are not allowed to go to school, women can't work,
have to wear the all-enveloping burqa and be accompanied by a close
male relatives outside their home.
	   In the beleaguered capital of Kabul, an estimated 30,000 widows
are believed to be the hardest hit by these edicts. They must rely
on their small children who roam the street scavenging for wood and
garbage to sell.
	   ``Afghanistan is one of the most difficult places for the
delivery of humanitarian assistance, yet the needs are as great as
ever before,'' Szynalski said. ``The situation remains extremely
precarious.''
	   Szynalski said the U.N. appeal has been split into two
categories: dlrs 115 million for ``high priority'' programs like
emergency food aid, epidemic control and construction of shelters
and the remaining dlrs 70 million for programs like rebuilding the
war-devastated infrastructure.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Taiwan defeated cross-strait rival
China 10-6 Wednesday for the Asian Games bronze medal in baseball,

	   China scored four in the botttom of the seventh, and the last
two innings were scoreless.
	   Hsu Ming-chieh, who came on in relief of starter Chuan Chin-Her
in the fourth inning, picked up the victory. He gave up five hits
and three earned runs in 5 2/3 innings.
	   The loser was Zhang Wanjun, China's first of two relievers, who
yielded five hits and three earned runs.
	   In the semifinals, South Korea beat China 9-2 and Japan edged

U.N. weapons monitors evacuate Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi reaction to withdrawal, INCORPORATES
material from UN-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors evacuated Baghdad on
Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. weapons inspector said Iraq
had reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   ``The staff of UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) has been ordered
to leave Baghdad,'' said George Somerwill, a U.N. spokesman in
Baghdad.
	   He said no decision had been made on withdrawing the 400 U.N.
humanitarian monitors from Iraq, but added that they were prepared
to leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   The last three visiting teams of weapons inspectors left Baghdad
on Monday, but up to 140 resident experts were to remain in the
country to monitor known sites.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed the report by
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler as ``full of lies'' and said
it was ``intended to trigger an American and British military
strike on Iraq.''
	   He said the withdrawal of the inspectors ``means again that the
Special Commission is a tool in America's hand to implement its
policy of aggression.'' His remarks were carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes could come
quickly and without warning.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''
	   Iraq had pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors and
allow unfettered access to sites and documents on Nov. 14, under
threat of U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge that made it impossible for him to assure that Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security
Council can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler said Iraq's claim that it does not possess banned weapons
or the ability to make them ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   He said inspectors were not able to gain access to the
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid
evidence of the presence of proscribed materials.''
	   At two other sites, negotiations ultimately cleared the way for
inspections, he said. But one building had been emptied of relevant
materials, and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any
disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   ``It remains the commission's strong view that, under the
present circumstances, relevant documentation must exist in Iraq
and that provision of such documentation is the best hope for
revealing the full picture'' of Iraqi weapons programs, he said.

Ruling party panel proposes tax relief package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel
proposed a record 9.3 trillion yen (dlrs 80 billion) tax cut
package Tuesday for the fiscal year beginning April 1, officials
said.
	   The plan will be submitted to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who
will use it to compile his tax reform proposal aimed at helping
lift the Japanese economy out of its worst recession in decades.
	   The panel's tax blueprint includes 4 trillion yen (dlrs 34
billion) in permanent income tax cuts, said Hideyuki Aizawa, a
senior official on the committee.
	   The overall burden on Japanese taxpayers will be unchanged from
this year, because the government implemented a one-time tax cut of
4 trillion yen (dlrs 34 billion) for fiscal 1998. The panel said it
had made no final decision on how to distribute the tax relief
across income brackets.
	   The plan is still subject to changes resulting from Prime
Minister Obuchi's talks with Liberal Party leader Ichiro Ozawa on
forming a coalition. The Liberals have been urging a reduction in
Japan's consumption tax to stimulate consumer spending, and the LDP
tax panel said it would continue to debate reform of the sales tax.
	   Wednesday's proposal also includes permanent corporate tax cuts
worth 2.3 trillion yen (dlrs 20 billion) from next fiscal year, and
capital investment tax breaks worth 400 billion yen (dlrs 3.4
billion).
	   Under the plan, households with children would also benefit from
300 billion (dlrs 2.59 billion) yen in child tax credits _ a
measure designed partly to help halt the dramatic fall in Japan's
birthrate.
	   The child-tax credits were included to assist low- to
middle-income households with two children, who would actually see
their tax burden increase under the panel's proposals.
	   The panel also proposed housing-related tax breaks worth 1.2
trillion yen (dlrs 10.3 billion).
	   The government hopes to submit the tax reform proposals at the
next Parliamentary session that begins in January.

Russian parliament passes bill on printing rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament approved a bill today that
allows the government to print $1.2 billion _ an amount that will
help pay the state's bills, but may also provoke more inflation.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
workers and pensioners, among others. But with inflation already
running at around 70 percent this year, the fresh infusion of cash
could push prices even higher.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, unanimously passed the
measure today on the final reading. President Boris Yeltsin's
government is authorized to print the new money until the end of
the year.
	   The bill now goes to parliament's upper house, which is expected
to approve it swiftly, and then to Yeltsin, who is expected to sign
it without delay.
	   The Russian government has already begun printing rubles in
recent months to cover its huge budget deficit. As expected, the
value of the currency has been declining and inflation has been
rising.
	   In an attempt to shore up the currency, the bill passed today
also requires Russian exporters to repatriate 75 percent of their
hard-currency earnings, up from the current 50 percent. This will
keep more foreign currency inside Russia.
	   Russia is struggling with its worst economic crisis since the
Soviet Union collapsed, and the government has been assembling a
series of measures to guide the country out of its depression.
	   Parliament also was weighing several measures aimed at
streamlining the nation's unwieldy tax system in advance of a
debate on next year's budget.
	   The proposed bills seek to lower the value added tax, currently
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent. The
measures also call for revising the personal income tax tables to
take into account the ruble's recent fall.
	   The aim is to create tax incentives for ailing industries, and
encourage more tax evaders to pay what they owe. But critics warn
that tax cuts may only result in even lower government revenues.
	   The measures are expected to win approval in the
Communist-dominated parliament's lower house, the State Duma.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other officials have voiced
hopes that the house will also quickly pass next year's budget. The
government says it needs the budget in place to effectively deal
with the crisis.
	   In recent years, protracted budget debates often resulted in
Russia living for months without an approved budget, adding to the
nation's economic turmoil.

Former captain to sit out limited-overs matches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Former captain Mike Atherton was
Wednesday dropped from the 16-man England cricket squad for the
triangular limited-overs series against Australia and Sri Lanka.
	   Atherton and fast-medium pace bowler Angus Fraser were the
high-profile casualties axed from the England tour squad which this
week surrendered a sixth consecutive Ashes contest.
	   The pair will join Matthew Fleming, Peter Martin, Warren Hegg,
Ian Austin and Dougie Brown on a plane home after the fifth test in
Sydney from Jan. 2-6, but will remain as standby players for the
one-day tournament.
	   On Dec. 26, England will fly in Ben Hollioake, Mark Ealham, Neil
Fairbrother, Nick Knight, Mark Alleyne, Ashley Giles and Vince
Wells, currently playing club cricket in New Zealand.
	   England manager Graham Gooch denied Atherton's omission was due
to his ongoing back problems and said it would not rule him out of
World Cup calculations.
	   ``Athers has played a lot of cricket already and we thought it
best if he doesn't undertake this part of the tour,'' Gooch said.
	   ``In no way does him cloud the issue of his possible selection
for the World Cup squad. It has nothing to do with his back,
because as far as I know that's in shape although we have to
realize the history of it.''
	   Chairman of selectors David Graveney said those chosen were
likely to form the nucleus of England's squad for both the Sharjah
tournament in April and the World Cup in May and June.
	   Australian-born Adam Hollioake, who is on holidays with his
parents in Perth, joins younger brother Ben on the tour and will
lead the side in some of the five lead-up matches prior to the
start of the one-day series on Jan. 7.
	   The England limited-overs team: Alec Stewart, Mark Alleyne, John
Crawley, Robert Croft, Mark Ealham, Neil Fairbrother, Ashley Giles,
Darren Gough, Dean Headley, Graeme Hick, Adam Hollioake, Ben
Hollioake, Nasser Hussain, Nick Knight, Alan Mullally, Vince Wells.

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) _ Space shuttle Endeavour and its crew
emerged from the night sky and landed in triumph, ending NASA's
first flight to build the international space station.
	   ``Wow! What can I say after a mission like that?'' commander
Robert Cabana exclaimed after guiding the shuttle to a smooth
touchdown late Tuesday. ``We are just so happy to have gotten the
international space station off to such a super start.''
	   The six astronauts, who masterfully joined the first two pieces
of the space station in orbit, returned to handshakes, backslaps
and a stream of congratulations.
	   The well-wishers included two of the three Apollo 8 astronauts
who flew around the moon during Christmas 1968. Jim Lovell and Bill
Anders were attending a 30th anniversary bash at Kennedy Space
Center.
	   ``I'm so proud of what they've done,'' said Lovell, who also
circled the moon on Apollo 13.
	   Mission Control gave Cabana the go-ahead for an on-time
touchdown after hours of scrutinizing the weather. Thick rain
clouds hung over the space center throughout the afternoon but were
gone by dusk.
	   Endeavour resembled a comet as it streaked over the Gulf of
Mexico and across Florida, its path tracked by infrared cameras. It
swooped through a clear, chilly sky on final approach and landed on
the xenon-lit runway at 10:53 p.m., a minute early thanks to a
tailwind.
	   It was only the 10th time in 93 flights that a space shuttle
returned in darkness.
	   Mission Control complimented Cabana for his ``beautiful
landing,'' then thanked the entire crew _ calling out each of their
names _ ``for an awesome job starting our space station
adventure.''
	   During their exhausting journey, which spanned nearly 12 days
and 4.6 million miles, the astronauts set the cornerstone for the
international space station by joining the Russian-built Zarya
control module and the American-made Unity connecting chamber.
	   Jerry Ross and James Newman made three spacewalks to wire Zarya
and Unity together and attach antennas and other equipment. The
crew also spent a full day inside the station, hooking up
electronics.
	   ``I've got to admit, we were all pretty tense at various phases
of the mission,'' Cabana said. And so they were ``really
relieved,'' once all their objectives were accomplished, he said.
	   It was the first of 36 space shuttle flights that NASA estimates
will be needed over the next five years to build the 16-nation
space station. Nine Russian rocket launches also will be required;
the first took place on Nov. 20 when Zarya soared from Kazakstan.
Endeavour carried up Unity.
	   ``Two down, 43 to go,'' NASA chief Daniel Goldin cheered
following Endeavour's touchdown. But he cautioned: ``Let's not
project forward that everything's going to be easy. This is tough
stuff.''
	   Shuttle program manager Tommy Holloway said even though
Endeavour's crew made everything look simple, ``I can assure you it
took a lot of hard work, a lot of preparation and a lot of
attention to detail.''
	   To ensure success, Holloway distributed a memo before the Dec. 4
launch reminding the shuttle team of ``three close calls'' over the
past year and urging everyone to do better. Among the incidents he
cited: the loss of the drag-chute door moments before Discovery
blasted off in October with John Glenn.
	   Because engineers still don't know why the door ripped off,
Endeavour landed without a drag chute. NASA did not want to risk
having the door fall off at liftoff and hit an engine again, and so
bolted it shut.
	   NASA hopes to have the door redesigned before the next shuttle
flight at the end of March. The telescope-delivery mission will be
led by Eileen Collins, the first female commander.

Fugitive ex-president Banana gets house arrest after returning to

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Fugitive former President Canaan Banana
was placed under house arrest Wednesday after ending an
international manhunt by surrendering to police.
	   Banana, convicted in absentia on Nov. 26 on sodomy and
homosexual assault charges, was ordered to remain under police
guard at his mansion in the luxury Harare suburb of Mount Pleasant
until sentencing next week.
	   The former president was convicted on 11 gay sex charges after
he had fled the country, first to neighboring Botswana and then to
South Africa.
	   Banana said he fled Zimbabwe to escape political persecution and
meet with ``real friends,'' including President Nelson Mandela of
South Africa.
	   ``I left the country because I was in possession of dangerous
information, so I had to share it with my real friends,'' the
63-year-old Banana said without elaborating.
	   The Harare High Court set Dec. 23 for sentencing and to consider
Banana's status after he jumped bail, forfeiting his bond of 30,000
Zimbabwe dollars and the title deed to his Harare home. He also
allegedly crossed international borders illegally.
	   There were indications Banana would be treated with leniency.
	   On Sunday, Mandela and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
discussed Banana's case.
	   Mandela said then the two leaders reached a ``common position''
on Banana, believed to be an agreement to persuade him to return
home, possibly as part of deal for a light sentence or even a
pardon from Mugabe.
	   Banana, a Methodist minister and theology professor, served as
ceremonial president after independence in 1980 until 1987.
	   State prosecutors say Banana fled first to neighboring Botswana,
where he met with church and political officials, and then to South
Africa, entering both countries illegally after surrendering his
passport during his trial earlier this year.
	   Mandela triggered controversy when he saw Banana at his Pretoria
residence at Banana's request this month.
	   Attorney Erik Morris, acting for Banana last Friday, told the
court the politician had left the country ``not to defeat the
course of justice or evade punishment.''
	   ``He had a political agenda and wished to meet with heads of
state, for he had matters to impart,'' Morris said.
	   Chief state prosecutor Augustine Chikumira, who agreed to
Banana's house arrest, said that under Zimbabwe law, there was no
maximum penalty for Banana's convictions. Chikumira said Banana
faced a fine or prison term.
	   Earlier, state prosecutors had said Banana faced up 22 years in
jail for the 11 convictions.
	   Reports by the state media Wednesday said Banana had surrendered
at the border with South Africa Tuesday and was whisked to Harare
in a limousine accompanied by Zimbabwean detectives.
	   Mugabe, at a church assembly last week, praised Banana for his
political role combating racism in the church before independence
in 1980. The state media has also urged Zimbabweans to forgive
Banana, seen as a sign of a likely pardon.
	   Homosexual acts are illegal in Zimbabwe.
	   Banana was prosecuted after revelations of his predatory
homosexuality were made in the trial of a police inspector who
killed a colleague for taunting him over a three year sexual
relationship Banana forced on him while president.

U.N. weapons monitors evacuate Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraqi reaction to withdrawal, INCORPORATES
material from UN-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors evacuated Baghdad on
Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. weapons inspector said Iraq
reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   ``The staff of UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) has been ordered
to leave Baghdad,'' said George Somerwill, a U.N. spokesman in
Baghdad.
	   He said no decision had been made on withdrawing the 400 U.N.
humanitarian monitors from Iraq, but added that they were prepared
to leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   The last three visiting teams of weapons inspectors left Baghdad
on Monday, but up to 140 resident experts were to remain in the
country to monitor known sites.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed the report by
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler as ``full of lies'' and said
it was ``intended to trigger an American and British military
strike on Iraq.''
	   He said the withdrawal of the inspectors ``means again that the
Special Commission is a tool in America's hand to implement its
policy of aggression,'' according to remarks carried by the
official Iraqi News Agency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes could come
quickly and without warning.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''
	   Iraq pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors and
allow unfettered access to sites and documents on Nov. 14, under
threat of U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler said Iraqi obstruction, evasion and subterfuge made it
impossible for him to assure that Baghdad's weapons of mass
destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security
Council can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler said Iraq's claim that it does not possess banned weapons
or the ability to make them ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   He said inspectors were unable to gain access to the
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid
evidence of the presence of proscribed materials.''
	   At two other sites, negotiations ultimately cleared the way for
inspections, he said. But one building had been emptied of relevant
materials, and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any
disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   ``It remains the commission's strong view that, under the
present circumstances, relevant documentation must exist in Iraq
and that provision of such documentation is the best hope for
revealing the full picture'' of Iraqi weapons programs, he said.

Controversial Russian tycoon calls for ban of Communists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky called
today for a ban on the Communist party, a day after a top Communist
lawmaker accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the country.
	   Berezovsky said the government should use force to get rid of
the Communists if it needs to.
	   ``The later they use force the more blood that will be shed,''
Berezovsky said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   At impeachment hearings Tuesday against President Boris Yeltsin,
Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin said Russia's post-Soviet
collapse would not have happened if Russia's government was not
made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.''
	   Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of Jews in
prominent positions, but they have always been outnumbered by
ethnic Russians.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, made similar
anti-Semitic remarks at a Moscow rally in October. Berezovsky
demanded the Communist Party be disbanded at that time as well.
	   ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock,
and not in the Duma,'' Interfax quoted Berezovsky as saying.
	   Members of the liberal Yabloko faction today called for a
resolution denouncing Ilyukhin's statement, but parliament did not
immediately act on the proposal.
	   Unrepentant after his statements, Ilyukhin responded to the
motion by accusing liberals of fueling anti-Semitism in Russia.
	   ``What kind of democracy is it when a Russian man can't speak
the truth,'' he said today.
	   Other Communists demanded that Russian television networks be
banned from covering the Duma's activities because they said
coverage of Ilyukhin's Tuesday remarks was biased against him.
	   The business daily Kommersant speculated today that Ilyukhin
made the statements to provoke the Kremlin into trying to ban the
Communist Party.
	   ``That would strengthen the party's image as the main opposition
force,'' the newspaper said.
	   Yeltsin banned the Communist Party for one year in the early
1990s, but it quickly rebounded as the country's leading opposition
group and now has the largest faction in parliament's lower house,
the State Duma.
	   The Communists and Berezovsky have never been on good terms.
Many Communists believe Berezovsky, one of the country's richest
and most powerful businessmen, symbolizes the wild, unrestrained
capitalism that has emerged in post-Soviet Russia.
	   The Communists have also demanded that Berezovsky step down from
his post as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, a loose grouping of 12 ex-Soviet republics.

which saw 2,500 job cuts this year, may face the same amount of
layoffs in 1999, BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder said.
	   ``In 1999 there could again be 2,500 fewer positions at Rover,''
he said at a journalists club meeting late Tuesday. At the
beginning of 1998, Rover had a work force of 40,000, he noted.
	   He also warned that Rover's fleet management business poses a
depreciation risk for the BMW group, citing a more than 15 percent
drop in used car prices in Britain over the past six months.
	   BMW's Rover provides automobiles to rental companies that it
agrees to buy back after a certain period at a previously agreed
price. It then sells them as used cars.
	   His statements mark the first time that BMW was outspoken about
possible rental contract losses, which analysts say might require a
provision of between 200 million and 250 million marks (dlrs 120
million and dlrs 150 million) this year.

British unemployment rate remains steady
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Unemployment in Britain stayed at 4.6 percent for
the fourth consecutive month in November, although the number of
people claiming welfare rose slightly.
	   The government reported Wednesday that the number claiming
welfare increased by 5,900 to about 1.33 million, while the
government-preferred International Labor Organization total _ which
includes people not eligible for benefits _ rose by 16,000 between
August and September.
	   Despite the increases in those seeking benefits, the government
said the labor market generally continued to improve, with
employment rising and job vacancies reaching record numbers.
	   The number of people working reached a record 27.2 million in
August through October, up 80,000 from May-June and an increase of
259,000 compared to a year ago. The growth was attributed mainly to
an increase in the number of women taking full-time jobs.
	   ``The figures refute the worst fears of those predicting a large
jump in unemployment,'' said Employment Minister Andrew Smith.
``The number of those in work has risen to 27.2 million, the
highest level ever recorded, and a small increase in unemployment
reflects the slow down in the economy predicted by both the Bank of
England and government economists.''

Town warily marks 10th anniversary of Lockerbie disaster
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOCKERBIE, Scotland (AP) _ Ten years after the wreckage of Pan
Am Flight 103 hurtled down on the town, the big news in Lockerbie
is the new Christmas lights over the main street.
	   ``The media has got a hold of this, that the lights are being
switched on again in Lockerbie after 10 years. Well, we never had
any,'' said resident Marjory McQueen, laughing loudly.
	   The town plans a single event to mark the crash's 10th
anniversary on Dec. 21: a memorial service at 7:03 p.m. local time
(1903 GMT) _ the moment the plane hit the ground. The commemoration
will coincide with services in Arlington, Virginia, Syracuse, New
York, and London's Westminster Cathedral.
	   Normal life resumed long ago in Lockerbie, which lost its
obscurity and its holidays the night a bomb sent the Boeing 747
crashing down on the town. People on the ground recalled a weird,
rumbling noise, a streak of flame in the sky, then a mighty
explosion and debris raining on their homes.
	   ``The pictures were moving on the walls, the ornaments were
bouncing up and down. I just hadn't a clue what was happening,''
said Maxwell Kerr, whose block was hit by a forward section of the
fuselage and 62 bodies that fell from the plane.
	   Lockerbie lost 11 of its own people along with the 259 people
aboard Flight 103, which had just reached cruising altitude of
31,000 feet (9,450 meters), 42 minutes after taking off from
London's Heathrow airport for New York.
	   The 366,228-pound (166,119-kilo) aircraft was felled by a small
amount of high explosives smuggled on in a portable radio hidden
inside a suitcase. The suitcase made its way as checked baggage
from Malta to Frankfurt, Germany, and then to London.
	   ``Can you imagine seeing bodies lying on roofs of buildings or
all over a golf course? The scale of what we were facing was
immense,'' Prof. Anthony Busuttil, head of forensic medicine at
Edinburgh University, said in a recent interview with The Scotsman
newspaper.
	   He led a team of eight pathologists and eight dentists who
worked long days identifying the dead _ just one aspect of a
massive job of cleaning up a disaster and investigating a mass
killing.
	   Like the disaster, the 10th anniversary has landed on Lockerbie
from somewhere else: from the necessity for survivors to
commemorate their loss, and from the widely resented interest of
the media.
	   Recent moves to arrange a trial in the Netherlands for the two
Libyans accused of the bombing keep the town's name in the news.
	   Lockerbie today looks very much like it did 10 years ago, just
before the disaster, except for the new Safeway supermarket on the
main street and those new Christmas lights.
	   Casual visitors wouldn't know that the neat garden on Sherwood
Crescent marks the place where the crashing wings of the jumbo jet
blasted a crater and killed three families: Tom and Kathleen
Flannigan, and their 10-year-old daughter Joanne; John and Rosaleen
Somerville and their children, 10-year-old Ann and 13-year-old
Paul; and Maurice and Dora Henry.
	   Across the tracks at Rosebank Crescent, only a small memorial
serves as a reminder that 62 bodies of Pan Am passengers fell with
a part of the fuselage between two rows of houses, miraculously
killing no one on the ground.
	   The town library has a small display of disaster memorabilia,
including the Arkansas state flag and a letter from then-Gov. Bill
Clinton, thanking the town for its kindness to Bill and Caroline
Sneed, whose son Sandy Phillips was one of 35 Syracuse University
students killed.
	   Trepidations about the 10th anniversary began a year ago, when
two television companies began working on documentaries, said Tom
Russell, chairman of the commemoration committee.
	   A town meeting was held in February to discuss anniversary
plans, and about five dozen people shared in the discussion.
	   ``They wanted absolutely nothing, the BIG ZERO, really nothing
at all. They wanted just to be left in peace,'' said Mrs. McQueen,
a member of the regional council who volunteered to be the town's
media contact.
	   ``But we knew that the Lockerbie 10th anniversary didn't just
belong to Lockerbie, it belonged to lots of other people as well
... and we knew there was absolutely no way we would be allowed to
let the 10th anniversary pass unmarked,'' she said.
	   Gideon Pringle, who chaired the Friendship Group that assisted
relatives of crash victims, said townspeople feared Clinton _ and
the attendant press corps _ might show up.
	   Pringle had been in Arlington National Cemetery in 1995 when
Clinton dedicated a memorial cairn of 270 stones. ``I've seen Mr.
Clinton's entourage, his convoy _ it's something else. Something
that you would never see here, anyway,'' he said.
	   ``The word was certainly put out that we wanted to keep it
low-key,'' Pringle said. No dignitaries were invited, and the most
famous name at the service will probably be Scottish Secretary
Donald Dewar.
	   The memorial service is intended to stress that Lockerbie has
moved on. None of the clergy who will lead the service were here 10
years ago. Primary school students, all too young to remember the
catastrophe, will form the choir.
	   Russell says his abiding memory of the crash's aftermath ``was
the incredible cooperativeness.''
	   ``The community wanted to do something.''
	   Volunteers worked for months to sort and launder clothing
recovered from the plane, and return it to relatives. The
Friendship Group was available to deal with the wishes of visiting
relatives, including guiding them to the place where their loved
one's body fell.
	   ``I haven't experienced anyone who hasn't felt the better for
coming here,'' Pringle said.
	   ``I think it's the fact that when they see the area where their
loved ones fell, it gives them some comfort _ it's green, lush,''
he said. ``When they come here, they are welcomed with open arms,
and they know that things are in safe hands.''

Much-criticized Kenya police force to fete 100th anniversary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The head of Kenya's much-maligned police
Wednesday invited citizens to attend the commemoration of the 100th
anniversary of the founding of the force by British colonial
authorities.
	   The invitation by Commissioner Duncan Wachira to ``Kenyans from
all walks of life'' to attend day-long celebrations Friday in
Nairobi's Uhuru Park comes less than a week after a police officer
shot dead a mini-van driver and seriously wounded his conductor for
no apparent reason.
	   The officer was arrested, but other drivers and conductors went
on a rampage in Nairobi Monday to protest the killing.
	   Two senior police officials last week apologized for police
excesses and asked the public to forgive the many atrocities
committed by police, ranging from harassment and demanding bribes
to torture and extra-judicial killings.
	   Asst. Police Commissioner Stephen Kimenchu admitted during a
human rights workshop that police had committed many atrocities,
usually at the bidding of politicians. But he said things were
changing.
	   And police chaplain Reserve Supt. Mike Harries called for
forgiveness but urged Kenyans to remember that the police work
against great odds and are underfunded and underpaid.
	   It is not uncommon for those seeking police assistance to have
to go to police stations to fetch police because all vehicles are
broken down or they have run out of gas.
	   Victims of armed robbery and assault often wait hours for police
to show up, and many off-duty police officers have been implicated
in robberies, either through renting their service weapons to gangs
or direct participation.
	   As in most other African nations, police in Kenya routinely beat
back crowds with bullwhips and clubs and routinely beat confessions
out of petty thieves.
	   In an editorial page essay Wednesday in the East African
Standard, columnist Maina Muiruri pondered the likelihood that
Kenyans will easily forgive their police.
	   ``The library files on the police should not be recommended for
detailed perusal if one hopes to forgive the Kenya police for their
past sins,'' he wrote, pointing out case after case of police
excess.
	   Muiruri said the only real guarantee that the Kenya police are
changing would ``a sign that there would be no more political
interference in the police.''
	   ``The Kenyan force is far too gone in the rot that nothing short
of thorough restructuring might produce any result,'' he wrote.
``So far, the two apologies are just drop-in-the-ocean piecemeal
measures that can at best achieve nothing above one-day PR.''
	   On Wednesday, King'ori Mwangi, the new police spokesman,
declined to provide information on police salaries, saying he was
busy with preparations for the centenary celebration.
	   It is widely understood that police salaries have not kept pace
with the rise in the cost of living. Small bribes, popularly known
as ``kito kidogo'' or something small in Kiswahili _ as well as
large-scale payoffs to senior officers _ are commonplace.

Emir says he will appoint more people to advisory council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Bahrain's emir revealed plans Wednesday
plans to appoint more citizens to his advisory council, a step
toward broadening the base of the decision-making process.
	   The move comes after four years of sporadic political violence
in the tiny island state, which has no parliament.
	   ``There are now plans to expand the composition of the
(Consultative) Council and increase its scope so that it could play
a bigger role in national decision making,'' the emir, Sheik Isa
bin Salman Al Khalifa, said in an interview published in
government-controlled newspapers on Wednesday _ Bahrain's national
day.
	   ``This expansion would involve representatives of various social
and productive groups who would help achieve the civilized progress
which Bahrain was aiming for,'' Sheik Isa said.
	   The emir did not say how many more people would appointed to the
council, nor did he reveal how its role would be enhanced.
	   The Consultative Council has 40 members, who make
recommendations on policy and laws, but have no legislative power.
	   The newspapers reported that the emir had also pardoned a number
of prisoners, but gave no details. Officials could not be reached
for comment.
	   The government has been hard-pressed to control the political
unrest that broke out in December 1994 when pro-democracy activists
clashed with security forces in the streets.
	   More than 40 people have been killed in the violence, which has
included bombings and arson attacks.
	   Hundreds of people have been imprisoned, with many activists
receiving sentences ranging from a year to life imprisonment.
	   The government has accused the opposition of using the call for
political freedom as a cover-up for a conspiracy, instigated by
Iran, to set up a Shiite Islamic state in Bahrain.
	   Iran, which is overwhelmingly Shiite, had denied the charge.
	   A slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens are Shiites, but
the ruling family and government are dominated by members of the
mainstream Sunni Islamic sect.

Epic South Korean win prevents Asian Games sweep for China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a stunning upset, South Korea's Kim
Taek-soo beat China's Liu Guoliang for Asian Games gold in men's
singles table tennis Wednesday, dashing Chinese hopes of their
first gold medal sweep in 20 years.
	   Kim, the world No. 11, jumped into the air and then into the
arms of his coach after his 21-16, 21-14, 22-20 victory over Liu,
the world No. 2.
	   ``I am the champion,'' the elated, sweat-drenched 28-year-old
said.
	   Following a victory earlier in the day in the women's doubles,
China had gone into the match with six of the seven golds. A win by
Liu, the Olympic singles and doubles champion, would have given
China its first sweep of all the medals since 1978, when the games
were also held in Bangkok.
	   But Kim was all focus and drive, pumping his fist into the air
after winning points and pacing around his end of the table like a
caged animal.
	   ``It was very important to fight because the Chinese are very
strong,'' said Kim, who won an Olympic bronze in 1992. ``I believed
in myself.''
	   But the Chinese were able to take consolation in their women,
who swept all their gold medals, putting a victorious stamp on a
transition to a new generation of players following the withdrawal
of team veterans.
	   Wang Nan, a 20-year-old from northeast Liaoning province, was
the star of the Chinese women, taking four golds. Her last came in
doubles, which she and Li Ju won Wednesday against a Hong Kong
pair.
	   Hong Kong's Chan Tan-lui and Song Ah-sim had beaten a strong
South Korean team in the semis but were completely outclassed by
the Chinese in the final, going down 21-7, 21-8.
	   China came to Bangkok with a team of mostly young players,
missing stars including Wang Tao and Deng Yaping, a three-time
world singles champion who also won doubles and singles at the 1992
and 1996 Olympics.
	   Wang said the team's victories in Bangkok showed that China was
succeeding in making the transition to a new generation.
	   ``I don't dare say that I'll take Deng Yaping's place because
she was the best player in the world,'' Wang said. ``But I'll
gradually get closer to her.''
	   Wang's other golds came in the singles, mixed doubles and team.
Wang, now No. 3, said she believed her victories could give her
enough points to move to the top spot in the world rankings.
	   Despite missing out on a sweep, Chinese coach Lu Yuansheng said
the six golds would boost his team's confidence.
	   ``Through this competition young players have trained, they've
become more mature,'' he said. ``We want the generations to follow
one after the other.''

Samsung in talks with IMG for management contract of golfer Se Ri
</HEADLINE>
Pak

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Bowing to criticism at home and
abroad, South Korea's Samsung group said Wednesday it was giving up
management of golfer Se Ri Pak but would continue as a corporate
sponsor.
	   Samsung said it was talking to International Management Group of
the United States and three other companies about terms of a
management contract for the 21-year-old star.
	   ``We just began talks with IMG and we are in contact with three
other companies,'' Kim Il-keun, a Samsung spokesman, said. He
declined to reveal names of the other companies.
	   Samsung signed a 10-year contract with Pak in 1996 under which
she received about dlrs 1 million a year and unspecified
performance bonuses and Samsung became her manager and sole
sponsor.
	   But Kim said Samsung would give up its management role next year
and allow Pak to negotiate deals with golf equipment makers and
other companies that do not compete directly with Samsung.
	   ``It is impossible to calculate exactly, but we believe the
advertising impact _ Pak's playing golf in clothes with Samsung
logos on _ is worth'' the loss of sole sponsorship rights, Kim
said. ``That's what we will get.''
	   The new management company will take commissions from golf
equipment makers and others for using Pak in advertisements in
return for handling her schedules, press releases and contracts.
	   The decision came after Samsung was criticized for its handling
of Pak, especially during her weeklong visit to South Korea in late
October and early November.
	   During the visit, Pak had to attend a golf tournament, numerous
promotional events for Samsung, a parade in her hometown and a
medal ceremony with the president. She ended up being hospitalized
for exhaustion.
	   Last week, golf coach David Leadbetter ended his relationship
with Pak, saying it was difficult working with a player who was
controlled by so many interests _ Samsung, her father and agents
hired by Samsung and the family.
	   Kim refused to comment on the criticism, saying Samsung will
release its official position when a deal is finalized with a
management firm.
	   Pak won the LPGA Championship in May and then became the
youngest winner of the U.S. Women's Open a month later.
	   She won twice more, setting an LPGA scoring record in one
tournament, and finished the year second to Annika Sorenstam in
money and the player of the year points. In voting by the Golf
Writers Association of America, Pak was selected LPGA player of the
year.
	   Based in Cleveland, Ohio, IMG manages many famous athletes
including golfers Mark O'Meara, Tiger Woods and Annika Sorenstam.
Its former clients include Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, Nick Faldo
and Nick Price.

U.S. envoys acknowlege yawning gap between Serbs and Albanians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Serb reaction to Pec killings
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Senior U.S. envoys are acknowledging
a huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethinc Albanians on the
future of the province in the wake of violence that marred an
informal peace deal and left 42 people dead.
	   After a late-night meeting Tuesday with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, both senior envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Christopher Hill, the U.S. diplomat most involved in daily efforts
to broker a peace, appeared pessimistic.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic. Hill said, ``enormous
differences remain between the two sides.''
	   The Yugoslav army said it killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shots were heard from the sealed-off
border area. Residents said the Yugoslav army sent armored vehicles
and at least one helicopter into the region.
	   International monitors said they saw 31 bodies, all wearing
camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters (yards) of
the border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns and grenades.
	   In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including five
teenagers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in
Kosovo's western town of Pec when unidentified assailants opened
fire Monday in a bar. Serb media blamed the killings on the ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec in protest of the
killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable,'' and ``appaling beyond words.''
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   A top government body for the province said the killings of
Serbs were ``the most monstruous crime in the series of assaults by
Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   ``The problem in Kosovo is not about human rights, this is most
cruel terrorism and Nazism supported secretly and publicly by some
representatives of the ethnic Albanian community,'' the statement
from the Temporary Executivy Council for Kosovo said.
	   The statement also demanded an end to ``Western, one-sided
condemnation of Serbs and the Serbian people in Kosovo'' and for
``international recognition of what is obvious...that Albanian
terrorists and their political leaders are the obstacle for
reaching a peaceful solution in Kosovo.''
	   A reaction by ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party said the
murders ``show the intention of Albanian terrorist gangs to achieve
independent Kosovo at any rate, using most brutal methods like the
murder of innocent children.''
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily.
	   The rebels say they won't accept anything short of independence.
Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.

Defiant town provides haven for war crimes suspects

<TEXT>
	   FOCA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ It has been called a ``closed,
dark place'' run by Serb hard-liners, a haven for war crimes
suspects, scene of some of the worst horrors of the Bosnian war.
	   As a result, Foca, about 25 miles southeast of Sarajevo, has
been virtually cut off from the international aid earmarked to
rebuild the country after the 1992-1995 war.
	   Before the war, Foca was a picturesque, multiethnic town,
nestled between towering, green hills along a narrow valley at the
junction of the Drina and Cehotina rivers.
	   About half the population of 40,000 was Muslim, the rest Serb
and a few Croats. The Serbs, however, drove out the Muslims and
Croats early in the war. To reinforce the town's new, all-Serb
image, the town was renamed Srbinje, although few other Bosnians
use the name.
	   The once lively streets are now virtually empty. The
400-year-old mosque that had been a symbol of Foca was destroyed.
The site is now a park.
	   An estimated 80 percent of the 22,800 residents are unemployed.
Shop windows stand almost empty. Although the town lies on a major
road between eastern Bosnia and the Adriatic coast, few cars pass
by.
	   The traditional means of transportation _ the horse-drawn wagon
_ appears to be replacing cars.
	   Anyone in the town who has $60 is considered rich, according to
a 57-year-old woman who declined to give her name, saying it would
be dangerous to do so. She said city officials had gotten rich from
wartime plunder, but no one cared about ordinary townspeople.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton agreement which ended the war, Bosnia's
three communities _ Serbs, Muslims and Croats _ are required to
allow minority refugees to return to their prewar homes and to
surrender those accused of war crimes and end ethnic
discrimination.
	   Communities that refuse to follow these rules will get no
international aid. According to human rights groups, Foca falls
short of even those minimum standards.
	   ``We think that this is a great injustice towards the Serbs,''
said Radojica Tesovic, the local governor and a member of the
Bosnian Serb hard-line party.
	   In a report entitled ``A Closed, Dark Place,'' the U.S.-based
Human Rights Watch said Foca was the scene of wartime atrocities
``beyond anyone's worst nightmare.''
	   For example, the human rights monitoring group alleged that in
1992, Bosnian Serbs rounded up Muslims and Croats and jailed them
in detention centers where they were ``tortured, raped and ether
expelled, killed or 'disappeared.'''
	   Non-Serb women were taken from their homes to the downtown
sports complex near the city hall where, said the group, they were
``systematically raped or otherwise sexually assaulted as part of
the Serb (ethnic cleansing) campaign.''
	   Today, Foca is a still a safe haven for Bosnian Serbs indicted
by the International War Crimes Tribunal, Human Rights Watch says.
	   ``Only eight of them,'' Tesovic stressed.
	   French troops patrol the town but have so far made no attempt to
arrest any of the eight suspects here. Instead, the suspects move
around freely in the streets or sip coffee in the bars.
	   In an apparent effort to appease international demands, one of
Foca's war crimes suspects, Milorad Krnojelac, surrendered to
French troops in June. Krnojelac, former warden of the town jail,
was, among other, indicted for rape _ the first time the offense
has been officially defined as a war crime.
	   The next day, protesters trashed the local offices of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation and the United Nations
International Police Task Force.
	   Nevertheless, town authorities sent a request to international
agencies, arguing that with the surrender of Krnojelac, Foca had
met conditions for foreign aid.
	   So far, they have received no response.
	   Tesovic acknowledged that Foca has not been receptive to
requests by former non-Serb residents to return home. ``We are
receiving requests by prewar citizens,'' he said. ``But until now,
we have not approved any of them.''
	   In its report, Human Rights Watch accused international agencies
of ``turning a blind eye'' to violations of the Dayton agreement in
Foca in the interest of keeping the peace.
	   ``I really don't understand what the international community
wants from us,'' Tesovic said. ``We are cooperative. Do they expect
us to take those people by the hand and hand them over to them?''

Most Asian stocks close lower pending results of Clinton's

impeachment proceedings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Wednesday as
investors stood by the wayside to await the results of impeachement
proceedings against U.S. President Bill Clinton.
	   In Tokyo, share prices rose, but continued worries over the
domestic economy also held back further advances. The U.S. dollar
slid against the yen in lackluster trading.
	   After four days of declines, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average gained 85.11 points, or 0.61 percent, to close at
14,096.30 points.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 115.62 yen, down 1.96 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 116.35 yen overnight.
	   The dollar initially gained some ground from its levels in late
New York trading overnight following smaller-than-expected growth
in Japan's October current account surplus.
	   Earlier Wednesday, the Finance Ministry said Japan's current
account surplus rose 21.5 percent in October from a year earlier to
1.335 trillion yen (dlrs 11.4 billion).
	   Signs of a slowdown in the growth of Japan's external surpluses
are supportive of the dollar, as they allay concerns about trade
friction.
	   Continued worries over the health of Japanese banks also weighed
down the market.
	   ``It's hard for investors to buy shares until they see a clear
sign of economic recovery in Japan,'' said Sachio Ishikawa of Chuo
Securities in Tokyo.
	   In Hong Kong, President Clinton's impeachment proceedings and
lack of overseas buying dampened market sentiment.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 13.45 points, or 0.13
percent, to 9,939.39.
	   The market was ``dull and boring'' amid lack of more definite
market-moving news, said Ricky Tam of Delta Asia Securities Ltd.
	   ELSEWHERE:
	   BANGKOK: Shares fell as the index continued to trail sideways
ahead of the yuletide holidays. The SET index lost 4.65 points, or
1.3 percent, to end at 344.53.
	   JAKARTA: Shares rose 2.9 percent, bouyed by gains in some
blue-chip shares. The JSX index was up 11.929 points to close at
412.694 points.
	   MANILA: Shares rose sharply as Wall Street's 1.5 percent
overnight gain triggered buying of selected blue chips. The PSE
Index gained 72.51 points, or 4 percent, to close at 1,869.24.
	   TAIPEI: Shares fell after Acer Inc. and United Microelectronics
Corp. dampened market sentiment by lowering their 1998 profit
forecasts. The Weighted Price Index was down 167.30 points, or 2.41
percent, to close at 6,769.52.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares fell as investors cashed in on gains in
retail sector stocks. The Composite Index fell 0.80 points, or 0.14
percent, to close at 542.99 points.
	   SEOUL: Shares fell as strong liquidity and falling local
interest rates prompted investors to cash in on gains. The KOSPI
was down 33.89 points, or 5.8 percent, to close at 545.97.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares fell as an early 1.6 percent surge caused by
Wall Street's overnight gain fizzled out. The Straits Times Index
was down 9.19 points, or 0.67 percent, to close at 1,359.10.
	   SYDNEY: Shares rose led by gains in energy and gold stocks. The
All Ordinaries Index was up 9.4 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at
2,697.30.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares rose led by gains in the tourism and retail
sector stocks. The NZSE-40 capital index was up 12.89, or 0.70
percent, to close at 1,953.22.

Cambodia will send back waste dumped by Taiwan company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Outraged by the dumping of 3,000
tons of waste near a coastal town, Cambodia's environment minister
said Wednesday it will be shipped back to Taiwan and the local
company responsible for importing it will be heavily fined.
	   He added that the material might be toxic.
	   The waste _ a jumble of rubble and dirt _ was found last week on
the outskirts of Sihanoukville, 185 km (115 miles) southwest of
Phnom Penh. According to a customs invoice it was shipped from
Taiwan last month by a local company.
	   The shipment is described as construction waste on the invoice,
but environment officials fear the material is incinerated toxic
waste and may contain heavy metals or chemicals hazardous to human
health.
	   The Cambodian company who imported the material was not named,
but has apparently taken on work banned by the government.
	   Cambodia's government has been approached several times by
companies interested in disposing industrial waste, including one
proposal for the construction of a sophisticated waste incineration
plant in the country.
	   Mok Mareth, who took a jab at rich industrialized nations in his
televised statement, has repeatedly said the government will turn
down any waste-related business proposals.
	   ``Industrialized nations have difficulties finding space within
their countries to discard toxic waste, that's why they dump it in
poor countries. Cambodia is well aware about that and cannot let
this happen on a whim,'' he said.
	   Mok Mareth announced on national television that Deputy Prime
Minister Sar Kheng has ordered the creation of a government
commission to investigate the dumping.
	   The minister said those found responsible for the dumping face
fines of millions of dollars for environmental destruction and will
be forced to pay compensation to anyone living in the area whose
health is affected by the mess.
	   Whether the material is found to be toxic or not, Mok Mareth
said the waste will be shipped back to Taiwan.
	   ``As a lesson for waste exporters it must be cleaned up and
transported back, regardless of whether it is toxic or nontoxic,''
he said.
	   A chemical expert from Singapore's environmental protection
agency examined the site Tuesday and samples of the waste were
flown to Hong Kong on Wednesday for analysis, Mok Mareth told The
Associated Press.

Ten percent of Dutch workers burned out by daily grind
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ More than half a million Dutch
workers suffer from job burnout blamed on low wages, high pressure
and an unpleasant working environment, a new study has found.
	   The study, released Wednesday by the Central Statistics Office,
found that 10 percent of the 6.5 million Dutch workers exhibited
the burnout symptoms of unusual tiredness and exhaustion.
	   The number of hours logged at work weighed much more heavily
than age as a factor for burnout, the institute said. Those in high
pressure jobs were four times as likely to feel the adverse effects
of stress.
	   Teachers showed the highest rate of employee burnout, followed
by workers in the health care and communications fields.
	   The study also found that burnout occurred more frequently among
women and full-time workers.
	   It was released as debate rages in the Netherlands over the
advent of the so-called ``24-hour economy,'' the U.S.-style
lengthening of opening hours for shops, banks and other services.
Until recently, many Dutch businesses were able to resist pressure
to stay open evenings and weekends.

Envoys acknowledge yawning gap between Serbs and Albanians in
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Senior U.S. envoys are acknowledging
a huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province in the wake of violence that left 42 people
dead and marred an informal peace deal.
	   After a late-night meeting Tuesday with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, both senior envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Christopher Hill, the U.S. diplomat most involved in daily efforts
to broker a peace, appeared pessimistic.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic. Hill said, ``enormous
differences remain between the two sides.''
	   The Yugoslav army said it killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gunbattle near the border with
Albania on Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shooting were heard from the
sealed-off border area. Area residents said the Yugoslav army sent
armored vehicles and at least one helicopter into the remote region
and continued barring anyone from entering.
	   International monitors said they saw 31 bodies, all wearing
camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred yards of the
border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns and grenades.
	   In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including five
teen-agers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in
Kosovo's western town of Pec when unidentified assailants opened
fire with submachine guns Monday in a bar. Serb media blamed the
killings on the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's
secession.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec on Tuesday in protest of
the killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces, which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic sent a message of
condolences to the families of killed Serbs, saying, ``we will not
hesitate to prevent anyone from jeopardizing peace and security of
our citizens.''
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable,'' and ``appalling beyond words.''
	   ``There is no excuse for this kind of action,'' he said.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily. The rebels
say they won't accept anything short of independence. Serbia,
meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial autonomy
for Kosovo.

Apartment house collapses in Rome killing at least eight
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with death toll up to eight; ADDS details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A five-story apartment house collapsed Wednesday,
killing at least eight people and burying dozens of others.
	   As many as 38 people were believed to have lived in the
apartment house. Five were reportedly pulled out alive by the first
rescue workers to reach the scene.
	   ``Seeing this building in a pile of rubble means the chances of
finding more survivors is virtually nil,'' Rome's police chief,
Antonio Pagnozzi, said at the scene.
	   The building is located in a modern, middle-class area of Rome,
about six kilometers (3 1/2 miles) from central Piazza Venezia. It
collapsed at dawn, apparently because of structural weaknesses.
	   Neighbors said they heard a huge explosion before the building
crumbled, suggesting a gas explosion. But Rome's chief firefighter,
Luigi Abate, ruled out the possibility.
	   ``I am certain the collapse was caused by the building's
structure giving way,'' said Abate. ``It couldn't have been a gas
explosion because it would have shattered glass everywhere.''
	   The building was reduced to a 1.5-meter (yard) high pile of
cement blocks and broken furniture, with not a single wall left
standing. Personal belongings, including a child's bicycle, were
strewn among the rubble.
	   Residents of nearby buildings were digging through the rubble
alongside dozens of police and firefighters, using their hands,
shovels and other machinery. Specially-trained police dogs were
trying to sniff out survivors.
	   The rescue crew also used sensors to try to detect noises or
movement under the rubble.
	   The house, with a printing plant on the ground floor, was
reported built in the 1950s. Investigators were trying to determine
if the building had undergone any unauthorized restructuring which
could have caused the collapse. Another possibility is that the
ground underneath the building may have caved in. Residents had
reportedly complained about the ground being unstable.
	   Pope John Paul II, during his general audience at the Vatican,
expressed ``profound pain,'' for the victims and their families.
	   Mayor Francesco Rutelli proclaimed Thursday a day of mourning.

Sex, lies, and video tapes in Anwar trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with prosecutors disclosing
they have video evidence; Changes overline

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prosecutors in the trial of
politician Anwar Ibrahim announced plans on Wednesday to introduce
video tapes as evidence to prove corruption and illegal sex
charges.
	   ``I'll be bringing in rebuttal evidence, that includes video
tapes,'' said Abdul Gani Patail, who leads the prosecution against
Anwar.
	   No details were given, but a defense lawyer said there are no
lurid scenes.
	   Anwar, fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in September,
faces abuse of power charges and will be tried separately for
allegedly having engaged in illegal sex acts, including sodomy.
	   He has denied all the accusations against him, saying they were
cooked up to eliminate the challenge he posed to Mahathir's
17-year-rule.
	   Hoping to boost the spirits of an old school friend, classmates
of the former deputy prime minister sat in the court Wednesday
wearing the burgundy red with yellow, black and white striped ties
of their prestigious alma mater, Malay College.
	   Many of Anwar's friends said they did not believe the
sensational charges against him.
	   As they looked on, defense lawyers tried to show that police
were aware of a conspiracy against Anwar and conducted
investigations accordingly.
	   ``Did you direct your investigations against any politician who
could be involved in a political conspiracy against Anwar?''
defense lawyer Gurbachan Singh asked a top police witness on
cross-examination.
	   ``Yes,'' replied the witness, Assistant Commissioner of Police
Musa Hassan, adding that he had questioned top police officers and
politicians including high-level cabinet ministers.
	   Musa, who led the investigations against Anwar, told the court
that police reopened an investigation earlier this year into the
sexual charges against the then deputy prime minister, one day
after he had publicly clashed with Mahathir at a ruling party
convention.
	   The prosecution is trying to prove that Anwar had an
extramarital affair, committed numerous acts of sodomy and then
abused his official position to cover up the sexual trysts.
	   The government's case was prompted by accusations by Ummi
Hafilda Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu
Bakar, a former driver for the politician's family.
	   Ummi wrote a letter in 1997 alleging sexual misconduct that was
submitted to Mahathir. Police investigations concluded the charges
were spurious and exonerated Anwar. Mahathir halted the
investigations last August.
	   In court on Wednesday, Musa did not clarify why police reopened
the investigation this year on June 22, a day after the UMNO
meeting ended.
	   The letter's authors retracted their charges, but now say they
were coerced into doing so by police acting on behalf of Anwar.
	   Anwar's school chums inside the courtroom voiced disbelief at
the charges against their former classmate.
	   ``We know the boys who played truant, who sneaked out to the
cinema and did unsavory things. Today they are still like that,''
said Raja Petra, who has known Anwar for 35 years.
	   ``But Anwar was very religious. He was strict and he did not
like dirty jokes,'' said Raja, smoking a pipe outside the
courthouse.
	   The Malay College old boys network is a virtual who's who of
modern Malaysia. The prestigious school has produced some of the
nation's top diplomats, businessmen and many chief ministers.

Government to launch campaign to save 650 animals, plants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ More than 650 types of Vietnam's animals
and plants are under danger of extinction, so the government is
launching an annual campaign for preservation of nature, the
Environment Department said Wednesday.
	   The department said about 300 animals, birds and reptiles, along
with 350 rare plants, face the threat of extinction.
	   The government is launching a weeklong exhibition in Hanoi of
120 photos on enviromental preservation and a nationwide campaign
to raise people's awareness of enviromental protection, it said.
	   Both will be launched Dec. 26 _ designated as Biological
Diversity Day by the international convention on biological
diversity.
	   The Environment Department said the government is planning to
increase the number of nature preserves from 87 to 101 in the near
future.
	   Vietnam's wildlife and rare plants have declined sharply in
recent decades as the result of increased hunting. Much of its
forests were destroyed during Vietnam War and by slash-and-burn
cultivation practices by ethnic minorities.
	   The country's green cover has dropped to some 28 percent from 43
percent half a century ago.
	   Many wild animals have been hunted for food or for export to
China for use in traditional medicine.

With lawyers harassed, Chinese dissidents go to trial alone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With attorneys locked up, harassed or plain
scared, two prominent dissidents will defend themselves against
charges of subversion Thursday in China's highest-profile dissident
trials in two years.
	   Qin Yongmin's and Wang Youcai's families were running out of
options Wednesday to help the pair, leading organizers of a budding
opposition political party. Qin's family pleaded for a postponement
at Wuhan's Intermediate People's Court, but court officials denied
the request.
	   ``Holding the trial in this way makes it impossible for the
judiciary to be independent or the trial just,'' said brother Qin
Xiaoguang.
	   Qin and Wang will be tried separately, in cities 500 kilometers
(300 miles) apart and in proceedings attended only by family and a
few observers selected by the courts.
	   Qin, 44, and Wang, 31, are accused of inciting the subversion of
state power, apparently for helping to organize the China Democracy
Party. They face from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted
under the harshest aspects of the law.
	   By moving against Qin, Wang and the China Democracy Party, the
ruling Communist Party appears to be signaling its determination to
crush challenges to its monopoly on power. Authorities have
detained or questioned more than 30 people associated with the
party in a 17-day-old crackdown.
	   Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, and Wang, a student
leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are among
the most active and influential members of China's dissident
community. A third prominent member of the dissident community, Xu
Wenli, was also arrested in the crackdown, but not yet charged.
	   To prevent displays of solidarity outside Wang's trial, police
have detained at least ten dissidents in the eastern city of
Hangzhou, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported. The Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said many
more are missing and believed to be in custody.
	   Wang's wife, Hu Jiangxia, said Wednesday she had given up trying
to find him a lawyer. She said police prevented the one lawyer who
agreed to represent Wang from traveling to Hangzhou.
	   ``He'll have to defend himself,'' Hu said.
	   Four law firms refused to take Qin's case, his brother said. The
Information Center said one lawyer who initially agreed to
represent Qin on Monday went missing for four hours and then called
Qin's family to withdraw.
	   Dispirited by the harsh treatment, Qin's family argued over
whether to attend the trial. Qin Xiaoguang said he and his father
have decided to stay away to protest the unfairness, but another
brother will go.
	   Three dissidents from northeastern China sent an open letter to
China's legislature and the Supreme People's Court appealing for
fair trials, the Information Center said. It added that authorities
violated China's own laws by not ensuring Wang and Qin have
adequate representation.
	   The letter was the latest in a string of petitions demonstrating
the appeal of both Wang and Qin and the idea of the China Democracy
Party.
	   Since Wang publicly announced in June that he and others in
Hangzhou were setting up the party, dissidents in at least 14
provinces and cities have set up party branches. Authorities have
refused their applications to register the party as required by
law.
	   Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has put on
trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. He
was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-year
sentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile.

U.S. envoys acknowlege yawning gap between Serbs and Albanians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new grafs 11-14 to UPDATE with more reaction from
Serbs, others to Pec killings &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Senior U.S. envoys are acknowledging
a huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province following violence that marred an informal
peace deal and left 42 people dead.
	   After a late-night meeting Tuesday with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, both senior envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Christopher Hill, the U.S. diplomat most involved in daily efforts
to broker a peace, appeared pessimistic.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic. Hill said, ``enormous
differences remain between the two sides.''
	   The Yugoslav army said it killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania on Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shots were heard from the sealed-off
border area. Residents said the Yugoslav army sent armored vehicles
and at least one helicopter into the region.
	   International monitors said they saw 31 bodies, all wearing
camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters (yards) of
the border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns and grenades.
	   In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including five
teen-agers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in
Kosovo's western town of Pec where unidentified assailants opened
fire in a bar. Serb media blamed the killings on the ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec in protest of the
killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable,'' and ``appaling beyond words.''
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   A top government body for the province said the killings of
Serbs were ``the most monstruous crime in the series of assaults by
Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   ``The problem in Kosovo is not about human rights, this is most
cruel terrorism and Nazism supported secretly and publicly by some
representatives of the ethnic Albanian community,'' the statement
from the Temporary Executivy Council for Kosovo said.
	   The statement also demanded an end to ``Western, one-sided
condemnation of Serbs and the Serbian people in Kosovo'' and for
``international recognition of what is obvious...that Albanian
terrorists and their political leaders are the obstacle for
reaching a peaceful solution in Kosovo.''
	   Ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party said the murders ``show
the intention of Albanian terrorist gangs to achieve independent
Kosovo at any rate, using most brutal methods like the murder of
innocent children.''
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily.
	   The rebels say they won't accept anything short of independence.
Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.

Portuguese, Spanish fishermen rescued from boat in Atlantic waters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA CORUNA Spain (AP) _ Eighteen Portuguese and Spanish fishermen
were rescued from their vessel after it sprang a leak early
Wednesday in waters some 200 miles off the coast of Ireland, a
marine department spokesman said here Wednesday.
	   The British-flagged `Sea Dog' sent out distress signals after it
began experiencing problems shortly after midnight. Another
British-flagged vessel, `Capricho,' which was in the area at the
time sent lifeboats to rescue the crew of 11 Portuguese and seven
Spaniards, the spokesman said.
	   No one was reported injured. It was not immediately known to
which country the rescued crew was to be brought.
	   There were no details as to why the boat sprung a leak, said the
spokesman, who asked not to be identified.
	   Both the Sea Dog and Capricho are based in the northwestern
Spanish port of La Coruna.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Senior U.S. envoys are acknowledging
a huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province following violence that marred an informal
peace deal and left 42 people dead.
	   After a late-night meeting Tuesday with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, both senior envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Christopher Hill, the U.S. diplomat most involved in daily efforts
to broker a peace, appeared pessimistic.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic. Hill said, ``enormous
differences remain between the two sides.''
	   The Yugoslav army said it killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania on Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   On Tuesday, detonations and shots were heard from the sealed-off
border area. Residents said the Yugoslav army sent armored vehicles
and at least one helicopter into the region.
	   International monitors said they saw 31 bodies, all wearing
camouflage uniforms, lying within a few hundred meters (yards) of
the border. They said they appeared to be rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army fighters ambushed as they tried to bring in guns and grenades.
	   In separate violence, at least six Serbs, including five
teen-agers, were killed and three were wounded late Monday in
Kosovo's western town of Pec where unidentified assailants opened
fire in a bar. Serb media blamed the killings on the ethnic
Albanian rebels.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec in protest of the
killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable,'' and ``appaling beyond words.''
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   A top government body for the province said the killings of
Serbs were ``the most monstruous crime in the series of assaults by
Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   ``The problem in Kosovo is not about human rights, this is most
cruel terrorism and Nazism supported secretly and publicly by some
representatives of the ethnic Albanian community,'' the statement
from the Temporary Executivy Council for Kosovo said.
	   The statement also demanded an end to ``Western, one-sided
condemnation of Serbs and the Serbian people in Kosovo'' and for
``international recognition of what is obvious...that Albanian
terrorists and their political leaders are the obstacle for
reaching a peaceful solution in Kosovo.''
	   Ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party said the murders ``show
the intention of Albanian terrorist gangs to achieve independent
Kosovo at any rate, using most brutal methods like the murder of
innocent children.''
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily.
	   The rebels say they won't accept anything short of independence.
Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.

Likud caucus chairman says early elections are on the horizon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The chairman of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's ruling coalition said Wednesday that early elections
are on the horizon because the government can no longer muster a
majority in parliament.
	   Netanyahu is considering calling new elections himself, said his
senior adviser, David Bar Illan. Netanyahu is weighing this against
the prospects of shoring up his present coalition, ``whatever he
feels is better for the country,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   Netanyahu's government is threatened by an alliance of
disgruntled former Cabinet ministers, dovish opposition legislators
upset by his refusal to withdraw troops in the West Bank and by
coalition hawks who fear he'll do just that.
	   The coalition suffered a blow when Finance Minister Yaakov
Neeman announced Tuesday evening he would resign and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he would make an important
political announcement this week. The Yediot Ahronot said
Mordechai, a supporter of the Wye agreement, would declare support
for spring elections, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   Since his narrow election victory in May 1996, Netanyahu has
been engaged in a balancing act between keeping the talks with the
Palestinians alive while not making concessions that would prompt
hard-liners in his coalition to try and bring him down.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's three-day visit this week, during
which he tried to revive the Wye accord, forced the issue.
Netanyahu told the president he would not withdraw troops on
Friday, citing repeated Palestinian violations of the accord.
	   In response, the dovish opposition Labor Party said it would no
longer back the government in crucial votes, as it had done in
recent weeks, to ensure that the Wye accord is carried out.
	   Meir Shetreet, the chairman of the ruling coalition, said he was
having difficulties mustering a majority in parliament.
	   Asked about the prospects for spring elections, more than a year
ahead of schedule, Shetreet told Associated Press Television News:
``It seems to me that we are very, very close that point. I don't
see how this government can go on in this situation.''
	   A crucial test will come on Monday. On that day, parliament will
vote either on a motion of no confidence in the government or a
bill to hold early elections and Labor believes it has enough
supporters to win either.
	   Netanyahu himself had instigated the no-confidence motion on
Dec. 7 as part of an elaborate parliamentary maneuver to delay the
vote of the early elections bill by two weeks.
	   Netanyahu could get the no confidence motion withdrawn at the
last minute, leaving only the early elections bill on the table.
	   Communications Minister Limor Livnat urged Netanyahu to join
forces with Labor and set up a broad-based government.
	   The recommendation was surprising because Livnat is one of the
staunchest opponents of the Wye agreement. In a Likud-Labor
government, there would be a much strong push to implement Wye.
	   Livnat said she's had a change of heart. After the visit of
Clinton to Gaza, she said, ``we have to admit that a Palestinian
state will be declared and recognized by the nations of the
world.''

Lagos Workers call off strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Striking workers of the state-owned water
company began returning to work Wednesday, one day after the
military government signed an order to increase minimum wages.
	   The strike, which lasted over a week, had shut off water to the
populous commercial capital, forcing people to scramble for
supplies. Long lines of people carrying jugs of water became a
common sight in the crowded city.
	   Soon after taking power in June, military leader Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar promised to increase the minimum monthly wage
for federal civil servants from dlrs 9 to dlrs 61 _ a more than 600
percent increase _ effective September 1.
	   The increases were also to apply to state civil servants, but
were to be negotiated on a state-by-state basis. The Tuesday order
makes the dlrs 61 minimum wage applicable to all Lagos state
workers as well.
	   Lagos workers initiated the strike because the increase had
still not been applied to them.
	   The water situation would take at least two days to ease,
officials said.

	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ An Austrian tourist died but her
boyfriend survived an eight-day ordeal in scorching temperatures
after their camper became stuck in sand dunes near a remote lake in
the Australian Outback, police said Wednesday.
	   The body of 28-year-old medical student Caroline Grossmueller,
who scribbled notes begging for help as she lay dying from heat
exhaustion, was found in the desert Tuesday.
	   Next to the body were a container of liquid and a backpack with
some food.
	   Police are investigating the details of the tragedy, which
occurred after a camper-van hired by the woman and her boyfriend
Karl Goeschka became bogged down near Lake Eyre on Dec. 7 and they
tried to walk to safety.
	   Lake Eyre is a huge saltwater lake in the center of South
Australia state. It lies about 435 miles (700 kilometers) north of
Adelaide, the state capital, in one of the country's most remote
and arid regions. The lake rarely contains water.
	   Grossmueller died less than 20 miles (30 kilometers) from the
township of William Creek after ignoring Goeschka's pleas to
abandon an attempt to walk across a 43-mile (70-kilometer) stretch
of the desert in temperatures above 122 F (50 C).
	   Goeschka, a 32-year-old research assistant at the Vienna
University of Technology, turned back and survived.
	   Police said that when the camper-van became stuck the pair,
who'd been together for 11 years, decided to set out on foot for
William Creek.
	   After two days, Goeschka began to feel ill and opted to return
to the van, which was stocked with food and water, but
Grossmueller, physically the stronger of the two, went on.
	   Two German tourists found her body some 24 miles (40 kilometers)
from the vehicle.
	   Police also found two notes written by Grossmueller begging for
help. Australian television reported she scrawled the word ``help''
in the dirt beside her.
	   Goeschka was found in the van and taken to William Creek.
	   William Creek Hotel owner Mal Anderson said he was in good shape
Wednesday, but was extremely distressed at Grossmueller's death.
	   Locals and police said the death could have been averted.
	   ``It is a very remote track, I try to warn people off it,''
Anderson said.
	   He said the van could have been driven out of the sand quite
easily if the couple had known to deflate the tires slightly.
	   Former desert tour operator Adam Plate, who sign posted the
track to Halligan Bay, said the rented van should have been fitted
with UHF radio and a guide book for Outback traveling.
	   He said there was also plenty of water in dams and flowing bores
near the track where Grossmueller died.
	   Senior Constable Tony Feltus said the couple should have waited
by the vehicle until the temperature dropped.

Claimants recommit to peaceful resolution of claims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian nations and China
recommitted themselves Wednesday to avoiding a clash over the
disputed Spratly Islands, but made no progress in resolving
overlapping claims in the area, a Philippines official said.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon told reporters that China and
the Philippines, who recently traded verbal barbs over one part of
the vast archipelago, will hold further talks ``when conditions are
right.''
	   Siazon said all sides recommitted themselves to following
earlier pacts _ calling for a peaceful resolution to the various
claims _ at a meeting between Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao and
leaders of the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   China is one of three ``dialogue partners'' meeting with the
Philippines and other ASEAN members following the group's annual
summit.
	   ``I hope that the message got through that the ASEAN countries
really wish to have improved relations with China,'' Siazon said.
``I think everyone in this conference is sincere in wanting to find
a peaceful solution to the South China Sea issue.''
	   He said Philippine officials were watching China's ``body
language'' in handling the issue, and looked forward to more talks
at a date to be set.
	   The Spratlys, which sit astride busy sea lanes in the South
China Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and
in part by Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
	   Each country except Brunei has soldiers stationed there, and all
except China and Taiwan are ASEAN members.
	   Last month, Manila lodged a protest with Beijing after Chinese
workers began enlarging buildings erected on Mischief Reef, part of
the Spratly chain. Both countries claim the reef.
	   China says the concrete structures are shelters for fishermen,
but Manila says they could be used militarily because of their
extensive docking areas and satellite communications equipment.
	   Siazon had warned Tuesday that the disputed islands have become
``an accident waiting to happen,'' and ASEAN foreign ministers were
said to be sharply critical of China's role in the Spratlys during
a private meeting Saturday.
	   Siazon said the issue was raised ``very diplomatically,'' in the
meeting with Hu.
	   Hu did not refer directly to the Spratlys in a statement issued
at the meeting.
	   In its final declaration on the Hanoi summit, ASEAN called on
all disputants to ``exercise restrain and to refrain from taking
actions that are inimical to the peace, security and stability of
Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region.''
	   ASEAN also includes Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore and
Thailand.

Philippines grounds S-211 trainer jets, attack choppers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines grounded its fleet of
Italian-made S-211 trainer jets and U.S.-made MG-520 attack
helicopters on Wednesday following two separate crash landings
during flight training this week.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado has ordered an investigation
to determine the cause of the accidents, which left four pilots
injured.
	   ``We want to investigate the incidents to know whether it was
pilot error or an oversight in maintenance,'' said Mercado.
	   The first accident occurred late Monday when an S-211 plane
crash landed into a grassy area in Mabalacat town in Pampanga
province near Manila. The plane's two pilots suffered slight
injuries and were hospitalized.
	   In the second accident, an MG-520 attack helicopter crash landed
early Tuesday inside the Sangley Point air force base in nearby
Cavite province also hurting its two pilots.
	   Air force spokesman Col. Jose Mendoza said the grounding order
will affect 10 S-211 jets being used by the air force to train
pilots.
	   Mendoza said the air force's fighting capability will not be
affected since the primary air defense of the country relies on the
older but more dependable F-5s.
	   But he expressed concern about the grounding of all of the 25
MG-520 helicopters, which are used mainly as air support for ground
forces.

Likud caucus chairman says early elections are on the horizon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The chairman of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's ruling coalition said Wednesday that early elections
are on the horizon because the government can no longer muster a
majority in parliament.
	   Netanyahu is considering calling new elections, said his senior
adviser, David Bar Illan. Netanyahu is weighing this against the
prospects of shoring up his present coalition. ``Whatever he feels
is better for the country,'' the senior adviser said.
	   Netanyahu's government is threatened by an alliance of
disgruntled former Cabinet ministers, dovish opposition legislators
upset by his refusal to withdraw troops in the West Bank and by
coalition hawks who fear he'll do just that.
	   The coalition suffered a blow when Finance Minister Yaakov
Neeman announced Tuesday evening that he would resign and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he would make an important
political announcement this week. The Yediot Ahronot said
Mordechai, a supporter of the Wye agreement, would declare support
for spring elections, more than a year ahead of schedule.
	   Since his narrow election victory in May 1996, Netanyahu has
been engaged in a balancing act between keeping the talks with the
Palestinians alive while not making concessions that would prompt
hard-liners in his coalition to try and bring him down.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's three-day visit this week, during
which he tried to revive the Wye accord, forced the issue.
Netanyahu told Clinton he would not withdraw troops on Friday,
citing repeated Palestinian violations of the accord.
	   In response, the dovish opposition Labor Party said it would no
longer back the government in crucial votes, as it had done in
recent weeks, to ensure that the Wye accord is carried out.
	   Meir Shetreet, the chairman of the ruling coalition, said he was
having difficulties mustering a majority in parliament.
	   Asked about the prospects for spring elections, more than a year
ahead of schedule, Shetreet told Associated Press Television News:
``It seems to me that we are very, very close that point. I don't
see how this government can go on in this situation.''
	   A crucial test will come Monday, when parliament will vote
either on a motion of no confidence in the government or a bill to
hold early elections. Labor believes it has enough supporters to
win either.
	   Netanyahu instigated the no-confidence motion on Dec. 7 as part
of an elaborate parliamentary maneuver to delay the vote of the
early elections bill by two weeks.
	   Netanyahu could get the no-confidence motion withdrawn at the
last minute, leaving only the early elections bill on the table.
	   Communications Minister Limor Livnat urged Netanyahu to join
forces with Labor and set up a broad-based government.
	   The recommendation was surprising because Livnat is one of the
staunchest opponents of the Wye agreement. In a Likud-Labor
government, there would be a much stronger push to implement Wye.
	   Livnat said she's had a change of heart. After Clinton's visit
to Gaza, she said, ``we have to admit that a Palestinian state will
be declared and recognized by the nations of the world.''

Rebel Chechen warlord denies killing foreigners, defies government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   URUS-MARTAN, Russia (AP) _ A leader of a militant Islamic group
in breakaway Chechnya on Wednesday dismissed accusations that his
group killed four kidnapped Westerners, whose severed heads were
found last week.
	   ``We didn't cut the foreigners' heads,'' said Uvai Akhmadov,
second-in-command to Arbi Barayev, a warlord whose fighters are
based in Urus-Martan, Chechnya's second-largest city located 20
kilometers (12 miles) southwest of the capital, Grozny.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's government has accused
Barayev of masterminding the kidnapping and killing the three
Britons and a New Zealander who were in Chechnya to install a
cellular phone system.
	   The four men were seized Oct. 3 and their heads were found at a
roadside last week. Chechen officials say they were killed as the
government was mounting a rescue attempt.
	   Akhmadov blamed the president's ``accomplices'' for the killing,
but didn't offer any evidence to back his claim.
	   Chechnya introduced an one-month state of emergency this week in
a bid to combat warlords who have carried out a wave of kidnappings
in the breakaway southern region since the end of its 1994-96 war
with Russia.
	   Barayev has often been named as one of the central figures in
the kidnappings, and his men in Urus-Martan were bracing for combat
Wednesday.
	   His fighters, most in their teens or early 20s, have dug
trenches around the town and were patrolling the streets, guns in
hand.
	   ``We are ready for war. A true Muslim will go to heaven if he
dies for his faith,'' Akhmadov said in an interview.
	   He accused Maskhadov of acting on behalf of the West and Russia
to ruin Chechnya.
	   ``The West together with Russia and their servant Maskhadov want
to destroy Chechnya to prevent the Islamic revival,'' he said. ``We
want to free Chechnya of those who reneged on their faith, and then
liberate the rest of the world.''
	   Maskhadov, a top rebel military commander during Chechnya's war
with Russia, won presidential elections in a landslide in early
1997 after Russian troops left. But he has been unable to impose
his authority, and many of his former allies have turned against
him.
	   Vice President Vakha Arsanov on Tuesday accused Maskhadov of
failing to establish strict Islamic rules.
	   Maskhadov didn't react to Arsanov's statement and instead
invited Chechen citizens to gather at a central square in Grozny on
Thursday to support his planned crackdown against the rebel
warlords.
	   With Chechnya's economy in shambles after the war, kidnapping
has become a lucrative business, with hundreds of people abducted
for ransom.
	   Russia media reports say some of the ransoms have run into the
millions of dollars, though the figures have not been confirmed by
the parties involved.
	   Chechnya says it is fully independent, but its claim has not
been recognized by any country. Moscow maintains that Chechnya
remains part of Russia, but has no control over developments there.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police fired tear gas and used batons
to beat protesting students who threw rocks at soldiers near
Jakarta's presidential palace on Wednesday.
	   Hundreds of students in three groups tried separately to march
on the ornate white-columned mansion, but were blocked by security
personnel.
	   At least three students were hospitalized and dozens were
arrested.
	   Some were bleeding as they were dragged into military trucks and
taken away, witnesses said.
	   Police said they were being detained at Jakarta's police
headquarters.
	   Wednesday's crackdown come after the military warned students
not to demonstrate near the palace.
	   The protest took place despite the fact that President B.J.
Habibie was in Hanoi attending a meeting of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
	   Police fired tear gas and hit the members of one group of about
500 after they threw rocks near the Defense Ministry headquarters
about 400 meters (yards) from the palace.
	   Some students smashed street lamps and street signs and
overturned large ornamental potted plants on the roadside.
	   ``I saw the police fire tear canisters when the students refused
to disperse,'' said one witness.
	   The protesters, from several universities, had demanded that
Indonesia's powerful military get out of politics.
	   They also wanted ex-President Suharto to be put on trial for
corruption.
	   A wave of student protests and riots forced Suharto to quit in
May after 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   Graft allegations against him are now being investigated by
state lawyers. But he has not been charged. Suharto has denied any
wrongdoing.
	   Wednesday's violence was the latest in a series of clashes
between students and security forces in recent weeks as political
turmoil in the world's fourth most populous nations continues to
boil.
	   On Nov. 13 security forces opened fired and shot nine students
to death when thousands of protesters tried to march on the
Parliament.
	   Earlier on Wednesday soldiers and police in anti-riot gear
blocked another group of 150 students from marching to the palace.
	   Security personnel placed razor wire on a street about 150
meters (yards) behind the building.
	   Four armored vehicles were moved into position and six military
trucks unloaded guards equipped with shields and batons.
	   A banner unfurled by the students said: ``Put Suharto on trial.
Form a new government.''
	   The students also repeatedly chanted ``reform or revolution.''
	   Later several hundred students congregated near the heavily
guarded National Monument in a park adjacent to the palace. But
they were corralled by security forces.
	   In another part of Jakarta, about 700 students shook the
wrought-iron gates of Indonesia's attorney general's office
demanding that Suharto be taken to court immediately.
	   Some students threw garbage at police guarding the building. But
officers did not respond.
	   The office is in charge of investigating Suharto.
	   Last week state prosecutors questioned the 77-year-old ex-leader
about his wealth.
	   State lawyers quizzed Suharto soon after his resignation six
months ago, but said they failed to find any evidence against him.
	   Habibie, Suharto's successor, ordered a new investigation be
launched amid accusations that the initial probe had been too soft.
	   Separately, a three-day strike by public transport drivers
degenerated into a riot when mobs threw rocks and looted shops in
Samarinda on the island of Borneo on Wednesday, police and
witnesses said.
	   Thousands of passengers, angry about being stranded, joined the
melee.
	   Shops and offices were closed as mobs burned piles of tires in
the streets.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests in the
city about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) northeast of Jakarta.

Netanyahu hangs tough, but may not have impressed hard-liners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with grafs 3,4,18,19, fresh Palestinian reaction;
TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace
process forward has frustrated President Bill Clinton and angered
the Palestinians _ and might not be enough to save his government
from collapse next week.
	   Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's
three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day
earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on
Friday, as stipulated by the Wye River peace accord.
	   Palestinian officials said they were equally as free to freeze
the accords.
	   ``I don't think the Palestinians should be expected to implement
from one side,'' Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour told The
Associated Press on Wednesday.
	   Clinton had hoped that his visit would move Netanyahu to back
down from his freeze on the process _ especially after the
Palestine National Council met an Israeli demand and formally
renounced clauses in its charter that call for Israel's
destruction.
	   Netanyahu approved of the renunciation, but said he would not
move forward until the Palestinians meet six other demands. The
next withdrawal from territory was due Friday, according to Wye.
	   A prisoner release _ a highly emotional issue for Palestinians _
is also due Friday, but Netanyahu showed no sign of going ahead
with that either.
	   The prime minister is trying to shore up support from
hard-liners in his coalition who have threatened to vote against
the government in a no-confidence motion on Monday.
	   Michael Kleiner said in a statement he was unmoved, and
infuriated by Netanyahu's role in the PNC vote.
	   ``The fact that the prime minister is accepting this farce, is
only strengthening (Kleiner's) view that he has to act to bring
down the government,'' Kleiner's office said.
	   Hard-liners faulted Netanyahu for his part in initiating the PNC
meeting because it provided Clinton with an opportunity to visit
the Palestinian-held territories _ and hint at U.S. approval for
Palestinian aspirations to statehood.
	   Eli Goldschmidt, caucus chairman of the opposition Labor Party,
on Tuesday smelled victory.
	   ``Now we have the 61 and it looks sure,'' said Goldschmidt who
is counting on at least nine legislators, including present and
former coalition members, to vote with Labor. There are 120
legislators in the Knesset.
	   Goldschmidt's boss, Ehud Barak, was already planning for an
election, and had flown in top U.S. political consultants to help
him, including James Carville.
	   Clinton appeared frustrated with the Israeli prime minister's
apparent obsession with domestic worries. The president chatted
with Netanyahu for a few minutes on the tarmac Tuesday evening
before boarding Air Force One for its return flight to the United
States.
	   Netanyahu's office described the chat as ``serious,'' but would
not elaborate.
	   ``We'll just keep at it,'' Clinton had said earlier, and
announced that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will return to
the Mideast in several weeks.
	   Palestinians said it was increasingly difficult to work with a
weakened government.
	   ``All the talk by Israeli officials about security is not the
security of the Israeli people, but the security of keeping their
seats in the government,'' Gaza security chief Mohammmed Dahlan
told The AP on Wednesday.
	   Compounding Netanyahu's woes, his finance minister, Yaacov
Neeman, has reportedly quit, according to an Israel TV report.
	   Neeman _ popular in the business community _ was reportedly
insulted that Netanyahu offered the ministry to the head of a small
party in order to shore up support in the Knesset.
	   Neeman was on vacation and not reachable for comment.
	   In what may have been a snowball effect, Netanyahu's defense
minister Yitzhak Mordechai _ known to support going ahead with Wye
_ said he would have his own announcement to make Friday. He did
not elaborate.
	   If Mordechai and others in Netanyahu's coalition who support the
peace process bolted, that would leave Netanyahu shorn of his left
and right wings by Monday's vote.
	   Netanyahu appeared to be unshaken.
	   ``We will go to the people if necessary,'' he told The
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``I don't fear elections.''

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Large pieces of ice loosened by warm
temperatures fell from a rooftop in Kiev, killing one woman and
injuring another, officials said Wednesday.
	   The unidentified women, aged 61 and 24, were standing at the
entrance to an office building when the falling icicles hit them,
the Emergency Situations Ministry said.
	   The older woman was killed and the younger woman was
hospitalized in critical condition.
	   An 11-year-old girl also was hit by a falling icicle Tuesday and
hospitalized with head injuries, the ministry said.
	   Temperatures have fluctuated widely in Kiev over the past
several days. The cold weather has created large icicles which have
then been loosened from overhangs and drains by warmer weather.
	   Kiev authorities have moved to prevent more casualties, sending
workers to inspect rooftops and safely knock down icicles that
threaten crowded streets.

Inter meets Manchester United; Bayern Munich faces Kaiserslautern

in Champions Cup quarterfinal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ronaldo goes to Old Trafford and the two German
teams, Bayern Munich and Kaiserslautern, meet each other in the
quarterfinals of the European Champions Cup.
	   Manchester United and Inter Milan, both runners-up in their
domestic leagues last season, were paired in Wednesday's draw. The
first leg is at Old Trafford March 3, and the second at San Siro
two weeks later.
	   The all-German matchup means that Bayern must get past the club
that edged it for the Bundesliga title last season. Right now, the
two teams are second and third behind Bayer Leverkusen.
	   The other quarterfinal pairings have defending titlist and
seven-time champion Real Madrid against Dynamo Kiev, a
quarterfinalist last season, and Juventus, attempting to make the
final for the fourth time in a row, against Greek titlist
Olympiakos.
	   Real Madrid initially drew Inter Milan. But UEFA secretary
Gerhard Aigner had already explained that teams who had qualified
from the same group in the previous round could not be drawn
together. Inter topped its group and Real was second, one of the
two best runners-up.
	   That put Inter back into the pot and, this time, Dynamo Kiev
came out, while Inter was drawn against Manchester United in the
most eye-catching matchup of the round.
	   In the considerably weaker Cup Winners Cup, defending champion
Chelsea faces Valerenga of Norway, thus avoiding Italy's Lazio and
Spanish league leader Mallorca.
	   Lazio meets Greek club Panionis and Mallorca visits Varteks of
Croatia in the first leg, which is March 4.
	   The other quarterfinal is Lokomotiv Moscow against Israeli club
Maccabi Haifa.
	   Only three nations have any interest in the UEFA Cup
quarterfinals with three Italian, three French and two Spanish
clubs going for the title.
	   Yet all three Italian or French teams or both Spanish clubs
could make it to the last four because they managed to avoid each
other. UEFA said it made no effort to keep clubs from the same
countries apart.
	   Olympique Marseille hosts Celta Vigo, which is second in the
Spanish standings, Bologna welcomes Lyon, Bordeaux receives Parma
and AS Roma goes to Atletico Madrid. The matches are March 2 and
16.

Legal tug-of-war between tribunal, Belgrade heads for showdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
is planning a courtroom showdown with Belgrade authorities in a
legal tug-of-war over three Serb officers indicted for allegedly
ordering a 1991 massacre.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said Wednesday she would
send four staff members to a Belgrade military court case Thursday
at which the officers are due to testify as witnesses.
	   ``We will request from the court that they be detained and
transferred to The Hague,'' Arbour said, adding that she was ready
to put the officers on trial as soon as possible.
	   The three Serbs, Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Milan
Mrksic, are accused in a 1995 tribunal indictment of ordering the
1991 massacre of 261 Croats taken out of a hospital in Vukovar in
eastern Croatia.
	   The military court president has requested the tribunal's files
on the three men, which form the basis for their U.N. indictment.
The court is investigating the massacre, but has no suspects.
	   Arbour said there was no question of turning over the tribunal's
evidence, which includes testimony of the sole survivor of the
massacre.
	   At her request, tribunal judges last week ordered Yugoslav
authorities to halt their investigation and send any evidence they
have against the officers to The Hague along with the officers.
	   Under international law, the tribunal has the power to take over
cases from domestic courts. National governments are obliged to
cooperate with such requests within 60 days.
	   Yugoslav authorities argue that their constitution bars them
from sending the men to The Hague for U.N. trial.
	   According to their indictment, the three officers oversaw troops
who herded 260 unarmed, non-Serb men out of a hospital where they
had been sheltering, drove them to a farm and summarily executed
them before plowing their bodies into a mass grave.
	   Asked by reporters if she expected a dramatic showdown on
Thursday, Arbour replied: ``My expectation is that the law will be
obeyed. I hope I will be accurate one day and I hope that day is
tomorrow.''
	   Arbour will not attend the hearing herself; she has a meeting
scheduled in The Hague with Yugoslav Justice Minister Zoran
Knezevic to discuss Belgrade's continued defiance of the tribunal.
	   As well as refusing to extradite the three officers, Yugoslav
authorities also have barred Arbour's staff from investigating
allegations of atrocities committed in the Serb province of Kosovo.
	   The tribunal, set up in 1993 to prosecute war crimes committed
all over the former Yugoslavia since 1991, can do nothing more than
report Belgrade's continued refusal to cooperate to the Security
Council.

Azerbaijan signs oil deal with U.S., Saudi companies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Azerbaijan has signed an agreement with
American and Saudi oil companies to explore potentially rich oil
fields in the Caspian Sea nation, officials said Wednesday.
	   The U.S. company Frontiera Resources and Delta HESS, of Saudi
Arabia, signed a contract Tuesday with the Azerbaijani state oil
company SOCAR on the development of the Kyursangi and Karabakhly
oil fields, which are believed to contain about 100 million tons of
oil.
	   SOCAR will control 50 percent of the project, with the American
and Saudi companies holding 30 and 20 percent stakes respectively.
	   The partners hope to start production in three years, officials
said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Philippines won its first gold
medal of the 13th Asian Games Wednesday, beating Taiwan 13-2 in the
final of 9-ball pool doubles.

Filipinos marched ahead, taking the remaining six frames.
	   In the clash for the bronze, host Thailand's Anan Terananon and
W. Suriyasriwan defeated Taiwan's pair of Chao Fong-pang and Yang
Ching-Shun 9-5.

Dennis Mitchell exonerated of doping violation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with IAAF comment, CLARIFIES that decision
clears way for Mitchell to compete outside the United States &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ For Dennis Mitchell, it was a double reason to
celebrate.
	   The Olympic sprinter learned Tuesday that a three-member USA
Track and Field Doping Hearing Board ruled that he did not commit a
doping violation.
	   ``I'm free!'' said Mitchell, also celebrating his daughter's
third birthday. ``I heard the good news on her birthday and we
celebrated her birthday and my exoneration on the same day.
	   ``It's been a long, uphill battle. Once I got to the peak of
everything, I was happy it was all over. I'm exhausted, but I'm
happy.''
	   Mitchell, 32, was given a two-year suspension by the
International Track and Field Federation after testing positive for
testosterone in an out-of-competition test April 1 at his home in
Gainesville, Florida.
	   The unanimous decision, announced after a two-day hearing,
clears the way for Mitchell to compete in the United States and, at
least for now, abroad.
	   ``He was only suspended by us awaiting a hearing,'' IAAF
spokesman Giorgio Reineri said today. ``Now that the USA hearing
has ruled there wasn't a doping offense, he is clear and can
compete anywhere.''
	   While he is eligible to compete in the World Indoor
Championships in Japan in March, the ruling does not mean the case
is closed. Reineri said the U.S. body must send all documentation
on the case to the IAAF.
	   The IAAF's doping commission will study the material and make a
recommendation to the next IAAF Council meeting, scheduled for
April 8-9 in Seville, Spain. If the IAAF is not satisfied with the
U.S. ruling, it can refer the case to the federation's arbitration
panel.
	   A member of the gold medal-winning U.S. 400-meter relay team and
bronze medalist in the 100 in the 1992 Olympics, Mitchell has been
the chairman of the Athletes Advisory Committee of USA Track and
Field since December 1996.
	   ``There were days I wanted to cry, but my little girl (Imani)
and little boy (Malachi, 2) were sitting in front of me, so I
couldn't cry,'' Mitchell said. ``My girlfriend, Keishia Story, and
my mother, Lenora, have been there for me. I feel relieved to get
to this point. It's been a long time coming.
	   ``Just before the hearing, I broke down and I didn't think I
could make it. But my girlfriend and my mother and Suja (Thomas,
his lawyer) lifted me up. They've been unbelievably great through
this whole thing.''
	   Because the case still must go before the IAAF, USA Track and
Field head Craig Masback would say only that he was happy for
Mitchell.
	   ``Athletes are innocent until proven guilty. Here is an athlete
who was exonerated,'' Masback said.
	   Mitchell called the suspension ``the darkest hour of my life.''
	   ``My dedication to this sport and to society would not and could
not allow me to do such a thing,'' Mitchell said. ``This is both
morally and ethically unacceptable to me. I would have never in my
wildest dreams thought this would happen to me.''
	   As the president of the USATF's Athletes Advisory Committee, the
athletes' voice in the national governing body, Mitchell has been
an outspoken advocate of keeping drugs out of the sport.
	   ``Overnight that has been taken away from me,'' Mitchell had
said. ``The things that have happened to me in the last few months
will forever affect all parts of my life. This can never be taken
away.''
	   ``Even going to practice is different now,'' Mitchell said
Tuesday. ``The stress is off, I'm working toward next season and
I'm working with it now with a big ray of hope.
	   ``I thought the Goodwill Games (in July) would be my last meet.
Now I can continue to do what I plan to do, that is, compete until
2001.
	   ``I can't explain how happy I am.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors evacuated Baghdad on
Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. arms inspector said Iraq had
reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   ``The staff of UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) has been ordered
to leave Baghdad,'' said George Somerwill, a U.N. spokesman in
Baghdad.
	   He said no decision had been made on withdrawing the 400 U.N.
humanitarian monitors from Iraq, but added that they were prepared
to leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   The last three visiting teams of weapons inspectors left Baghdad
on Monday, but up to 140 resident experts were to remain in the
country to monitor known sites.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed the report by
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler as ``full of lies'' and said
it was ``intended to trigger an American and British military
strike on Iraq.''
	   He said the withdrawal of the inspectors ``means again that the
Special Commission is a tool in America's hand to implement its
policy of aggression.'' His remarks were carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes could come
quickly and without warning.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''
	   The U.S. has 22 warships and 201 aircraft in the region,
including 72 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
	   Eight of the warships carry cruise missiles.
	   Britain has 22 strike aircraft in the region.
	   Iraq had pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors and
allow unfettered access to sites and documents on Nov. 14, under
threat of U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge that made it impossible for him to assure that Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security
Council can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler said Iraq's claim that it does not possess banned weapons
or the ability to make them ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   He said inspectors were not able to gain access to the
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid
evidence of the presence of proscribed materials.''
	   At two other sites, negotiations ultimately cleared the way for
inspections, he said. But one building had been emptied of relevant
materials, and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any
disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   ``It remains the commission's strong view that, under the
present circumstances, relevant documentation must exist in Iraq
and that provision of such documentation is the best hope for
revealing the full picture'' of Iraqi weapons programs, he said.

Epic South Korean win prevents Asian Games sweep for China

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a stunning upset, South Korea's Kim
Taek-soo beat China's Liu Guoliang for Asian Games gold in men's
singles table tennis Wednesday, dashing Chinese hopes of their
first gold medal sweep in 20 years.
	   Kim, the world No. 11, jumped into the air and then into the
arms of his coach after his 21-16, 21-14, 22-20 victory over Liu,
the world No. 2.
	   ``I am the champion,'' the elated, sweat-drenched 28-year-old
said.
	   Following a victory earlier in the day in the women's doubles,
China had gone into the match with six of the seven golds. A win by
Liu, the Olympic singles and doubles champion, would have given
China its first sweep of all the medals since 1978, when the games
were also held in Bangkok.
	   But Kim was all focus and drive, pumping his fist into the air
after winning points and pacing around his end of the table like a
caged animal.
	   ``It was very important to fight because the Chinese are very
strong,'' said Kim, who won an Olympic bronze in 1992. ``I believed
in myself.''
	   To reach the final, Kim already had beaten China's Kong Linghui,
who won doubles gold with Liu, in the semifinals earlier in the
day. Kong and South Korea's Oh Sang-eun shared bronze.
	   But the Chinese were able to take consolation in their women,
who swept all their gold medals, putting a victorious stamp on a
transition to a new generation of players following the withdrawal
of team veterans.
	   Wang Nan, a 20-year-old from northeast Liaoning province, was
the star of the Chinese women, taking four golds. Her last came in
doubles, which she and Li Ju won Wednesday against a Hong Kong
pair.
	   Hong Kong's Chan Tan-lui and Song Ah-sim had beaten a strong
South Korean team in the semis but were completely outclassed by
the Chinese in the final, going down 21-7, 21-8.
	   The South Korean pair, Ryu Ji-hae and Lee Eun-sil, shared bronze
with Taiwan's Xu Jing and Chen Chiu-tan.
	   China came to Bangkok with a team of mostly young players,
missing stars including Wang Tao and Deng Yaping, a three-time
world singles champion who also won doubles and singles at the 1992
and 1996 Olympics.
	   Wang said the team's victories in Bangkok showed that China was
succeeding in making the transition to a new generation.
	   ``I don't dare say that I'll take Deng Yaping's place because
she was the best player in the world,'' Wang said. ``But I'll
gradually get closer to her.''
	   Wang's other golds came in the singles, mixed doubles and team.
Wang, now No. 3, said she believed her victories could give her
enough points to move to the top spot in the world rankings.
	   Despite missing out on a sweep, Chinese coach Lu Yuansheng said
the six golds would boost his team's confidence.
	   ``Through this competition young players have trained, they've
become more mature,'' he said. ``We want the generations to follow
one after the other.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ With House Judiciary Committee Republicans
reporting that President Bill Clinton disgraced his office and
should be ousted, the White House desperately looked to Republican
moderates Wednesday for a way to stem a pro-impeachment stampede.
The prospects for Clinton avoiding impeachment in a House of
Representatives vote later this week only worsened Tuesday, leaving
White House aides to weigh a last-ditch confession of wrongdoing or
a censure plan that can win Republican backing. Clinton advisers
hoped to work with Rep. Christopher Shays, a Connecticut
Republican, who expected to meet with the president Wednesday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The chairman of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's ruling coalition said Wednesday that early elections
are on the horizon because the government can no longer muster a
majority in parliament. Netanyahu is considering calling new
elections, said his senior adviser, David Bar Illan. Netanyahu is
weighing this against the prospects of shoring up his present
coalition. ``Whatever he feels is better for the country,'' the
senior adviser said. Netanyahu's government is threatened by an
alliance of disgruntled former Cabinet ministers, dovish opposition
legislators upset by his refusal to withdraw troops in the West
Bank and by coalition hawks who fear he'll do just that.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Senior U.S. envoys are acknowledging
a huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians on the
future of the province following violence that marred an informal
peace deal and left 42 people dead. After a late-night meeting
Tuesday with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, both senior
envoy Richard Holbrooke and Christopher Hill, the U.S. diplomat
most involved in daily efforts to broker a peace, appeared
pessimistic. ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the
future of Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters,
without detailing his talks with Milosevic. Hill said, ``enormous
differences remain between the two sides.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police fired tear gas and used batons
to beat protesting students who threw rocks at soldiers near
Jakarta's presidential palace on Wednesday. Hundreds of students in
three groups tried separately to march on the ornate white-columned
mansion, but were blocked by security personnel. At least three
students were hospitalized and dozens were arrested. Some were
bleeding as they were dragged into military trucks and taken away,
witnesses said. Police said they were being detained at Jakarta's
police headquarters. Wednesday's crackdown come after the military
warned students not to demonstrate near the palace.

Senator to discuss Mideast peace with Syrian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter was en route to Syria
on Wednesday to update Syrian President Hafez Assad on Mideast
peace efforts following U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to
Israel and the Palestinian areas.
	   Specter, who accompanied Clinton in Israel, said the president
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu both told him they
wanted to try to resume stalled Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
	   Speaking to reporters on the eve of his departure, Specter
stressed that because Netanyahu was embroiled in an internal
political struggle to save his ruling coalition, it might be a
difficult for him to pursue a Syrian peace track vigorously.
	   ``I think that while the timing is not good right now for Israel
because of the political situation that it would be useful to try
to move the peace process ahead,'' said Specter, a Republican from
Pennsylvania.
	   Talks between Israel and Syria broke down nearly three years ago
but the issue of where they left off is still a point of contention
between the sides.
	   The Syrians claim Israel's previous government offered to return
all of the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau Israel captured from
Syria during the 1967 Mideast War, in exchange for peace. But the
proposal was never made officially.
	   Netanyahu's government opposes giving up all of the Golan,
fearing Syria would gain strategic control over Israel's north and
over vital water sources.
	   According to Israeli press reports, Assad has been making
overtures recently to encourage Israel to resume negotiations.
	   Specter has traveled to the Mideast several times in an effort
to broker peace in the region.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mixed Wednesday as
investors stood by the wayside to await the results of impeachment
proceedings against U.S. President Bill Clinton. In Tokyo, share
prices rose, but continued worries over the domestic economy also
held back further advances. The U.S. dollar slid against the yen in
lackluster trading. After four days of declines, the benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 85.11 points, or 0.61
percent, to close at 14,096.30 points. In late afternoon, the
dollar bought 115.62 yen, down 1.96 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo
and also below its late New York level of 116.35 yen overnight. The
dollar initially gained some ground from its levels in late New
York trading overnight following smaller-than-expected growth in
Japan's October current account surplus. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
announced Wednesday 600 billion yen (dlrs 5.1 billion) in new
low-interest loans to help troubled Asian countries rebuild their
devastated economies. The loans, for projects such as roads,
bridges, power stations and airports, also will help Japan's
sagging economy because the contractors must be Japanese companies.
The money will go to ``countries of Asia who are doing their utmost
to reform their economic structures,'' Obuchi said. It will be
disbursed over three years and will be repayable over 40 years at
an interest rate of 1 percent, a Foreign Ministry official said.
(ASEAN-JAPAN)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's tax panel
proposed a record 9.3 trillion yen (dlrs 80 billion) tax cut
package Tuesday for the fiscal year beginning April 1, officials
said. The plan will be submitted to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
who will use it to compile his tax reform proposal aimed at helping
lift the Japanese economy out of its worst recession in decades.
The panel's tax blueprint includes 4 trillion yen (dlrs 34 billion)
in permanent income tax cuts, said Hideyuki Aizawa, a senior
official on the committee. The overall burden on Japanese taxpayers
will be unchanged from this year, because the government
implemented a one-time tax cut of 4 trillion yen (dlrs 34 billion)
for fiscal 1998. (JAPAN-TAX CUTS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament approved a bill Wednesday that allows
the government to print 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.2 billion) _ an
amount that will help pay the state's bills, but which may also
provoke more inflation. Russia's cash-strapped government needs the
money to pay off workers and pensioners, among others. But with
inflation already running at around 70 percent this year, the fresh
infusion of cash could push prices even higher. Parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, unanimously passed the measure Wednesday on
the final reading. President Boris Yeltsin's government is
authorized to print the new money until the end of the year. The
bill now goes to parliament's upper house, which is expected to
approve it swiftly, and then to Yeltsin, who is expected to sign it
without delay. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament rejected a government
bill allowing privatization of the country's telecommunications
monopoly, news reports said Wednesday. Deputies voted 161-71 late
Tuesday to label the bill as violating the constitution and are
expected to debate another bill on privatization of Ukrtelecom next
week, the Interfax news agency reported. The government wants to
sell up to 30 percent of Ukrtelecom and use the earnings to pay off
its mounting debt in overdue wages, but intends to keep a
controlling stake in the company for at least five years. Under
current law, telecommunications companies in the former Soviet
republic are on a list of businesses barred from privatization, and
can go into private hands only with parliament's permission.

Milosevic blasts U.S. for allegedly supporting Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
``terrorists.''
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Milosevic statement. Trims.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - After meeting U.S. envoys seeking to
reinvigorate the Kosovo peace process, Yugoslavia's president
Wednesday blasted the United States for allegedly supporting ethnic
Albanian ``terrorists'' and vowed to crush them.
	   In a statement, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said
American representatives in the U.N. Security Council ``are losing
credibility'' by allegedly blocking resolutions denouncing ethnic
Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Yugoslav security forces ``are determined to protect their
citizens and property and will suppress terrorism regardless of the
support it has.'' Milosevic said.
	   He said those ``terrorist bandits ... with a criminal face'' who
on Tuesday gunned down six young Serbs in a bar in the western town
of Pec ``will be found, wherever they are.''
	   After the late-night talks with Milosevic on Tuesday, U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke acknowledged a huge divide between Serbs and
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians on the future of the province in the wake
of violence that marred an informal peace deal and left 42 people
dead.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic.
	   The Yugoslav army said it killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   In Pec, six Serbs, including five teenagers, were killed and
three were wounded late Monday when unidentified assailants opened
fire Monday in a bar.
	   Serbian officials and media were quick to blame the killings on
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's secession, and started
a massive anti-Albanian campaign. Milosevic's statement reflected
that campaign.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec Wednesday in protest of
the killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable,'' and ``appalling beyond words.''
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   A top government body for the province said the killings of
Serbs were ``the most monstrous crime in the series of assaults by
Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   ``The problem in Kosovo is not about human rights, this is most
cruel terrorism and Nazism supported secretly and publicly by some
representatives of the ethnic Albanian community,'' the statement
from the Temporary Executive Council for Kosovo said.
	   The statement also demanded an end to ``Western, one-sided
condemnation of Serbs and the Serbian people in Kosovo'' and for
``international recognition of what is obvious ... that Albanian
terrorists and their political leaders are the obstacle for
reaching a peaceful solution in Kosovo.''
	   A reaction by ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party said the
murders ``show the intention of Albanian terrorist gangs to achieve
independent Kosovo at any rate, using most brutal methods like the
murder of innocent children.''
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily.
	   The rebels say they won't accept anything short of independence.
Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.

budget
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with restaurants in one county replacing stools with
benches

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ At the ``Red Snake,'' a smoky bar
where actors linger for hours over tripe soup and pork steak
crooned by Gypsy minstrels, the management is anxiously counting
its chairs.
	   It's not because any are missing but because soon the bar may
not be able to afford so many stools, thanks to a scheme by the
impoverished Romanian government to make restaurants, bars and cake
shops pay a ``chair tax.''
	   Under the draft law dreamed up by Finance Minister Decebal
Traian Remes to fill gaps in the budget, restaurants will pay
annually 250,000 lei (dlrs 25) per seat, on top of all their other
taxes.
	   In Romania, where some 35 percent of the economy is estimated to
be underground, some have praised the idea, which needs government
approval before it becomes effective.
	   Restaurants, particularly those still in state hands, are seen
as a gold mine for tax evasion and unaccountable earnings. Their
bookkeeping shows slim profits while the real earnings goes into
their pockets, daily Evenimentul Zilei said in a recent editorial.
	   ``In restaurants a significant economic activity... avoids
fiscal pressure,'' said the editorial. ``If the shoe maker, the
garbage collector and the tailor are stressed by taxes, why not the
agile bar owner?''
	   Waiters can earn in a few shifts the equivalent of what the
average Romanian makes in a month _ 1.2 million lei (dlrs 120).
Cooks fry smaller steaks than the menu recommends and sell the
surplus meat and owners have a host of expenses which can be
difficult to track.
	   But restaurateurs and employees argue that trade is falling in
recent years as purchasing power drops. Some of them wouldn't be in
trade if it weren't for business lunches and weddings.
	   ``We have rent, electricity, salaries, musician fees and other
expenses'' said Eugen Mitrofanov, the maitre d' at the Red Snake.
``This will make things really expensive.''
	   In the county of Gorj in southern Romania, restaurant and bar
owners are replacing their stools with benches in an effort to save
money if the tax goes through, daily Cotidianul reported.
	   Of course, there are jokes that bars will hide their chairs in
the restroom or the cupboard when the inspectors come round,
although restaurateurs acknowledge that any checks will be done by
plainclothes officials with no prior warning.
	   In the popular ``Spring Time'' fast food joint which has about
150 seats, a floor manager is outraged by the new tax which she
thinks is a clumsy excuse for the government to fill holes in its
budget.
	   ``I can't see much government money going into public
projects,'' said Ioana Baitcu. ``Where in the world do you finds
such a tax?''

Authorities exhuming body of banker who died under bridge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COMO, Italy (AP) _ The two sons of a Vatican-connected financier
gathered at his grave Wednesday for the exhumation of his body to
determine whether his 1982 death was murder or suicide.
	   Prosecutors hope a new examination of the body will shed light
on the death of Roberto Calvi, whose corpse was found hanging from
Blackfriars Bridge in London following Italy's biggest postwar
banking scandal.
	   Calvi was known as ``God's banker'' for his close ties to the
Vatican.
	   The exhumation was awaiting the arrival of a judge from Rome.
The body will be then taken to the morgue in nearby Milan for
tests.
	   Banco Ambrosiano, in which the Vatican bank held a significant
stake, collapsed in 1982 when it could not collect dlrs 1.4 billion
in loans made to shell companies in Latin America.
	   Calvi, the bank's chairman, was found dead days later.
	   Roman businessman Flavio Carboni has been charged with
conspiracy to commit homicide in connection with the case.
	   Prosecutors asked for the exhumation after Carboni's lawyers
presented a report based on a preliminary examination of the body
that indicated Calvi hanged himself.
	   ``What do I think of the exhumation? It was Carboni's right to
seek it in his defense. For us, it's traumatic,'' said Carlo Calvi.
	   Carlo Calvi was joined by his brother, Leone, at the cemetery in
Drezzo, a town on the shores of Lake Como.

Police brigadier placed under investigation in teen shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ The policeman who shot and killed a teen
during a weekend arrest has been placed under formal investigation
for manslaughter _ one step short of being charged for the crime,
French media reported Wednesday.
	   The police brigadier, Henri Bois, was released from custody
Tuesday night, while angry youths battled police and torched cars
for a third straight night in a troubled area of Toulouse, in
southeastern France.
	   About 100 cars have been torched in the last few days.
	   Meanwhile, interim Interior Minister Jean-Jack Queyranne warned
rioting youths the government will assure that order is restored in
the troubled neighborhoods.
	   ``We will have a return to order because we must have calm in
housing projects,'' Queyranne said, speaking after a Cabinet
meeting Wednesday.
	   An autopsy found that 17-year-old Habib, whose last name hasn't
been released, was killed by a bullet that entered the left side of
his neck and punctured a lung, causing him to bleed to death.
	   The other police officer arrested after the slaying was freed
Tuesday afternoon, the prosecutor said.
	   Police contend the shooting, which occurred during a scuffle
while police were trying to make the arrest, was accidental. Police
say Habib was trying to steal a BMW.
	   The Toulouse riots are just the latest flareup reflecting the
bitter tension between French police and disaffected youths from
immigrant families.

Family battle to regain land roils east German suburb

<TEXT>
	   TELTOW, Germany (AP) _ Seehof, in the Berlin suburb of Teltow,
is a quiet neighborhood of well-tended homes, bordered by parks, a
nature preserve and a waterway.
	   Yet the calm belies a storm that has surrounded Seehof since
German reunification in 1990.
	   The 500 or so houses were built on the Seehof farm, once owned
by one of Berlin's wealthiest families, the Saberskys. They fled
Nazi Germany in the 1930s because they were Jewish, ending up in
the United States and elsewhere.
	   For decades, the family could not seek restitution because the
land was in communist East Germany. Now with the Wall gone and
Teltow looking like prime real estate, the heirs want to regain
title to the 84 hectares (208 acres), worth dlrs 170 million or
more.
	   The prospect frightens many of the 1,500 people who have lived
in Seehof for decades. With so much at stake, the battle has become
increasingly bitter, with accusations of anti-Semitism, greed and
dishonest politics.
	   Although several decisions have gone against them, the family is
pushing ahead. Their latest appeal was heard Wednesday by the
Federal Administrative Court in Berlin.
	   ``I don't shy away from a fight,'' said one American descendant,
Peter Sonnenthal, a former lawyer for the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission who helped bring down Wall Street titans
Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky.
	   In an interview before the hearing, Sonnethal, 44, concedes he
stands to make a lot of money but insists he does not intend to
force anyone from his home.
	   ``We're fighting a decision that says my family wasn't
persecuted,'' he said. ``But the truth is this property was owned
by my family and stolen by the Nazis and that's what must be
addressed.''
	   The family has won small victories, getting three parcels back
in 1995, including the grand, three-story villa where Sonnenthal's
grandfather, Albert Sabersky, once lived.
	   The villa quickly sold for dlrs 4.8 million. Sonnenthal and his
sister received half as sole heirs to Albert Sabersky; the rest was
divided among 16 other heirs.
	   Still, the state office charged with deciding restitution claims
denied the bulk of their claim. Deputy director Josefine Ewers says
the Saberskys ``without a question'' were persecuted by the Nazis _
but not when it came to selling their farm.
	   Both sides have spent years searching through old archives,
digging out maps, aerial photos and records. The case hinges on
whether the land was used as a farm or intended for development,
whether the Saberskys sold under pressure and what happened to the
money.
	   The Saberskys, mainly bankers and grain traders, bought Seehof
in 1878. They maintained it as a farm but drew up plans to develop
a strip along the water where other wealthy Berliners had started
building country homes.
	   But when the Nazis came to power in 1933 and started banning
Jews from professions _ including farming _ the family hired a Nazi
real-estate broker to begin selling all of Seehof.
	   ``They knew what was coming,'' Sonnenthal said. ``They sold it
off as fast as they could.''
	   The family claims the Saberskys sold the farm under pressure for
about half the market value, and that the broker charged them an
exorbitant commission _ reaching 50 percent after the 1938
anti-Jewish pogrom known as Kristallnacht.
	   They also say the Nazis confiscated the proceeds, and the family
never saw the money.
	   Ewers, of the restitution office, says records show the family
was not really farming the land but instead was preparing it for
development with intent to sell. If the family was not farming, she
argues, it would not have been under pressure from the Nazis'
banning the profession for Jews.
	   She says the broker's commission was reasonable considering all
they asked him to do. She also disputes Sonnethal's claim that the
family never saw any money from its financial agent, noting it used
the same man in the 1950s.
	   Sonnenthal says Ewers and the court acted under political
pressure, ignoring his evidence to protect homeowners _ and voters.
She denies it.
	   Charges that the family is only after money reflect shades of
anti-Semitism, he says, as do the swastikas that appeared in the
neighborhood during the seven-year court battle.
	   He has offered to drop claims to any home if the occupant pays
10,000 to 15,000 marks (dlrs 6,000 to dlrs 9,000) _ about 10
percent of the market value.
	   ``As a Jew returning to Germany, I will not make a victim out of
anyone who suffered under communism,'' he says. ``We set the price
intentionally low.''
	   About 120 people have accepted the offer or are in the process
of doing so. The majority are holding out _ taking their chances
with the courts.
	   Sonnenthal, now in private practice in Denver, was in the
courtroom Wednesday. If it rules against him, he's already planning
to take the case to the Constitutional Court, Germany's highest.
	   ``It's been seven years and 20 trips'' to Germany, he said. But
for the sake of his grandparents, ``I carry on.''

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ At the ``Red Snake,'' a smoky bar
where actors linger for hours over tripe soup and pork steak while
being serenaded by Gypsy minstrels, the management is anxiously
counting its chairs.
	   It's not because any are missing but because soon the bar may
not be able to afford many: Under a draft law dreamed up by Finance
Minister Decebal Traian Remes to fill gaps in the budget,
restaurants, bars and cake shops would have to pay an annual tax of
$25 per chair.
	   In Romania, where 35 percent of the economy is estimated to be
underground, some have praised the idea, which needs government
approval before it becomes effective.
	   But in one county in southern Romania, restaurateurs and bar
owners already have found a way to get around the tax: They're
replacing their chairs with benches.

Civil aviation strike threatens to disrupt Christmas travel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A planned strike by airport workers
threatens to seriously disrupt pre-Christmas travel for thousands
of people.
	   Employees have scheduled daily work stoppages between 6 a.m. and
10 a.m. and again between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Dec. 21-23, the
union for civil aviation workers said.
	   The strikes could cause dozens of flight cancellations and
delays as passengers gear up to travel for Christmas and the New
Year.
	   The workers, who include airport maintenance and ground crews,
are demanding the immediate hiring of staff to cover increased
demands in smaller, regional airports around the country.
	   Civil aviation telecommunications employees have also declared
separate work stoppages for Friday and Saturday with the same
demands.
	   The previous strike staged by the 2,700-strong civil aviation
union over four days in September was declared illegal by an Athens
court.
	   The work stoppages come on the heels of a series of strikes and
protests, including a 24-hour nationwide general strike last
Tuesday which paralyzed the country.
	   Disgruntled workers are protesting the government's fiscal
austerity program designed to ensure Greece qualifies for joining
the European Union's single currency by 2001.

Controversial Russian tycoon calls for ban of Communists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with interior minister quotes in grafs 8-9. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky on
Wednesday called for banning the Communist party, a day after a top
Communist lawmaker accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the
country.
	   Berezovsky, who is Jewish, said the government should use force
to get rid of the party if it needs to.
	   ``The later they use force the more blood that will be shed,''
Berezovsky said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   At impeachment hearings Tuesday against President Boris Yeltsin,
Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin said Russia's post-Soviet
collapse would not have happened if Russia's government was not
made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.''
	   Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of Jews in
prominent positions, but they have always been outnumbered by
ethnic Russians.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, made similar
anti-Semitic remarks at a Moscow rally in October. Berezovsky
demanded the Communist Party be disbanded at that time as well.
	   ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock,
and not in the Duma,'' Interfax quoted Berezovsky as saying.
	   Other top Russian officials also criticized Ilyukhin.
	   The Duma ``must rigorously curb such statements or else it will
utterly discredit itself,'' said Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin, according to Interfax.
	   Members of the liberal Yabloko faction on Wednesday called for a
resolution denouncing Ilyukhin's statement, but parliament did not
immediately act on the proposal.
	   Unrepentant after his statements, Ilyukhin responded to the
motion by accusing liberals of fueling anti-Semitism in Russia.
	   ``What kind of democracy is it when a Russian man can't speak
the truth,'' he said Wednesday.
	   Other Communists demanded that Russian television networks be
banned from covering the Duma's activities because they said
coverage of Ilyukhin's Tuesday remarks was biased against him.
	   The business daily Kommersant speculated on Wednesday that
Ilyukhin made the statements to provoke the Kremlin into trying to
ban the Communist Party.
	   ``That would strengthen the party's image as the main opposition
force,'' the newspaper said.
	   Yeltsin banned the Communist Party for one year in the early
1990s, but it quickly rebounded as the country's leading opposition
group and now has the largest faction in parliament's lower house,
the State Duma.
	   The Communists and Berezovsky have never been on good terms.
Many Communists believe Berezovsky, one of the country's richest
and most powerful businessmen, symbolizes the wild, unrestrained
capitalism that has emerged in post-Soviet Russia.
	   The Communists have also demanded that Berezovsky step down from
his post as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, a loose grouping of 12 ex-Soviet republics.

Briton sentenced to 6 years in jail, fined dlrs 2.3 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A Briton who embezzled more
than dlrs 2 million from the government has been sentenced to six
years in jail, the Public Prosecutor's Office said Wednesday.
	   George Webster Atkinson, 46, a landscape architect from
Manchester who helped to build the Emirates Golf Club, was also
fined 8.5 million dirhams (dlrs 2.3 million), an official in the
prosecutor's office said.
	   A court found Atkinson guilty Tuesday of defrauding the Dubai
government of 8.2 million dirhams (dlrs 2.2 million) by presenting
inflated invoices for work undertaken between 1983 and 1993, the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The court also convicted him of conspiring with two other
expatriates to skim off as much government money as possible. The
other two persons are no longer in the country.
	   Atkinson has until December 30 to appeal, said the official.
	   If he serves his sentence, it will probably end in late 2001 as
the Emirates penal system counts every year sentenced as nine
months in prison. Further, Atkinson has been in jail since March
and that period will be regarded as part of his sentence, said the
official.
	   But Atkinson will spend an additional day in jail for every 100
dirhams (dlrs 27) of the fine he does not pay, said the official.
	   Atkinson had worked on several of Dubai's landmark projects,
such as the Dubai Creek Golf and Yacht Club and the national golf
club, the Gulf News reported.
	   The oil-rich Emirates relies heavily on expatriates who form the
majority of its work force. Citizens constitute only one quarter of
the population of 2.4 million people.

Iranian group urges pressure on Tehran over slayings

	   PARIS (AP) _ An Iranian opposition group on Wednesday criticized
Europe's growing ties with Tehran, which it accused of using death
squads to kill eight intellectuals in recent weeks.
	   Facing deepening political and economic troubles, the government
``has opted for violence and used terror to try to regain control
of the situation,'' Saleh Radjavi of the National Council of the
Iranian Resistance, told a news conference.
	   ``We deplore the European Union's meeting next week with the
regime to promote economic relations,'' he said, referring to a
gathering planned in Vienna.
	   He also criticized France's invitation for Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami to visit in February.
	   After his election last year, ``a lot of people wanted to think
Khatami was the (Mikhail) Gorbachev of Tehran,'' Radjavi said,
referring to the Iranian president's reputation as a moderate
reformer.
	   ``But he doesn't act like Gorbachev,'' the former Soviet
president.
	   The Iranian government has arrested hundreds of student
protesters in recent weeks, and its Intelligence Ministry has
organized a ``shock committee to eliminate a certain number of
intellectuals,'' said Radjavi.
	   The killings began with the stabbing deaths of dissident
Daryoush Frohar and his wife Parvaneh Eskandarit, who were found
dead in their home Nov. 23. Mrs. Eskandarit's body was mutilated,
Radjavi said.
	   Frohar was president of the banned Iranian National Party and a
former labor minister under Ayatollah Khomeini, spiritual leader of
the 1979 Iranian revolution.
	   Since those slayings, five writers have been found strangled to
death on Tehran streets and a sixth, Mohammad Jaafar-Kianlow, has
been missing since Dec. 12 and believed dead, Radjavi said.
	   Most of the victims were called before a Tehran prosecutor who
``threatened them with death,'' he said.
	   The writers were among those calling on the government to
legalize the banned Iranian Writers Association, which had drawn up
a charter and was planning a general assembly, Radjavi said.
	   Radjavi called on the international community to press for a
fact-finding mission to Iran ``to do everything possible to shed
light on these killings and to find the murderers.
	   The Iranian resistance leader said the Tehran government was
facing increasing instability due to a power struggle between
factions, strikes by unpaid workers, and by the plunge in world oil
prices.
	   Heavily dependent on its oil production, the government was
running a 40 percent budget deficit that stood to worsen with the
price fall, he said.

Iran beats China in semifinal; Kuwait tops Thailand 3-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kuwait victory &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Iran and Kuwait set up a Middle East
final in Asian Games soccer with victories Wednesday.
	   Iran won 1-0 against a Chinese side weakened by the absence of
its star striker and coach. Kuwait scored less than 30 seconds into
the game and went on to beat Thailand 3-0 in its semifinal.
	   The Kuwait victory stunned a crowd that overflowed the
60,000-seat Ratchamongkala Stadium, blocking corridors and
emergency exits. Riot police stood by.
	   English soccer great Sir Bobby Charleton was part of the crowd
to cheer on his good friend Peter Withe, the Thai coach, while
Kuwait's top official _ Olympic Council of Asia president Sheihk
Ahmad al-Sabah _ cheered on his team.
	   Thailand reached the semifinals with a golden goal from its last
kick of its quarterfinal against favored South Korea, but its hopes
of a gold medal soured even before it touched the ball in the
semifinal against Kuwait.
	   Kuwait left back Nohyr al-Shammari took the ball down the flank
and floated it across to the far post, where Husain al-Khodhari
headed past Thai goalie Chaiyong Khumpiam to make it 1-0 in 28
seconds.
	   Kuwait could have sealed the game by the break but Farj Laheeb
twice had close range shots stopped by Chaiyong.
	   Chaiyong robbed Laheeb of another chance shortly after the break
when he came a long way out of the goal area to smother a through
ball.
	   Then Laheeb scored his ninth goal of the tournament in the 54th
minute, finally beating Chaiyong with a powerful header following a
cross by midfield star Bader al-Halabeej.
	   Kuwait coach Milan Macala replaced al-Halabeej soon after and
the player looked disgusted at the decision to send out teammate
Ali Adel.
	   Thailand tried to find a way back into the match but was reduced
to 10 men at 73 minutes.
	   On the third goal, Shzadah Khaled scored from close range after
Chaiyoung could only swipe away a header with a one-hand save that
left Khaled with an easy shot at the open goal.
	   Some fans threw water bottles toward the field while many more
deserted the stadium, unable to bear the final minutes.
	   In the opening semifinal, the Chinese exhibited more control at
midfield than in their previous 2-1 defeat against Iran in a group
decider last Friday.
	   The defeat leaves the Chinese still unavenged for the Iranian
victory that kept China out of the World Cup finals
	   The first half ended scoreless, with the Chinese containing
Bayern Munich striker Ali Daei, at one point bringing him down
twice deep in their territory in the space of 30 seconds.
	   Daei drew a yellow card in the 18th minute, eliciting boos to
the referee from Iranian fans who were constantly in action,
beating tambourines and dancing.
	   In the second half, Daei showed why he is considered such a
threat after scoring eight goals leading up to the semifinals. In
the fourth minute, he played a 15-meter free kick directly at the
feet of Sayed Ali Mosavi-Hasanzadeh, who shot at point blank range
on Chinese goalie Jiang Jin.
	   The ball bounced straight back at Mosavi and he launched it
again, this time beating Jiang.
	   It was his fifth goal of the tournament.
	   Chinese striker Yang Chen struggled to equalize, threatening
numerous times but never finding the mark.
	   Yang replaced Hao Haidong in the Chinese lineup. Hao was sitting
out the first of a two-game suspension for spitting in the face of
a referee in Monday's quarterfinal victory over Turkmenistan.
	   China's English coach, Bobby Houghton, watched from the stands,
among the capacity crowd of ardent Thai fans awaiting the
subsequent semifinal against Kuwait. He was suspended for one match
for using abusive language at referees and a soccer official.
	   The Thai crowd was still reveling in the national team's
thrilling quarterfinal victory on a golden goal in sudden death
extra time over South Korea. The Thai supporters had their faces
painted with Thai flags, and many wore headbands with the country's
colors.
	   Early in the morning, numerous lines snaked around buildings
housing ticket windows for the soccer game.
	   For Iranian coach Mansour Pourhydari, just happy to reach the
final, ``it made no difference'' who his team's gold medal opponent
might be.
	   ``We were a little tired. We played five matches in 10 days,''
he said.
	   He praised the Chinese team, saying it has improved.
	   ``They played pretty good today. They got a lot more balls then
they used to and their teamwork is better. I think they will be
doing better in football.''	  $

Controversial Russian tycoon calls for ban of Communists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with interior minister quotes in grafs 8-9. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky on
Wednesday called for banning the Communist party, a day after a top
Communist lawmaker accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the
country.
	   Berezovsky, who is Jewish, said the government should use force
to get rid of the party if it needs to.
	   ``The later they use force the more blood that will be shed,''
Berezovsky said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   At impeachment hearings Tuesday against President Boris Yeltsin,
Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin said Russia's post-Soviet
collapse would not have happened if Russia's government was not
made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.''
	   Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of Jews in
prominent positions, but they have always been outnumbered by
ethnic Russians.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, made similar
anti-Semitic remarks at a Moscow rally in October. Berezovsky
demanded the Communist Party be disbanded at that time as well.
	   ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock,
and not in the Duma,'' Interfax quoted Berezovsky as saying.
	   Other top Russian officials also criticized Ilyukhin.
	   The Duma ``must rigorously curb such statements or else it will
utterly discredit itself,'' said Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin, according to Interfax.
	   Members of the liberal Yabloko faction on Wednesday called for a
resolution denouncing Ilyukhin's statement, but parliament did not
immediately act on the proposal.
	   Unrepentant after his statements, Ilyukhin responded to the
motion by accusing liberals of fueling anti-Semitism in Russia.
	   ``What kind of democracy is it when a Russian man can't speak
the truth,'' he said Wednesday.
	   Other Communists demanded that Russian television networks be
banned from covering the Duma's activities because they said
coverage of Ilyukhin's Tuesday remarks was biased against him.
	   The business daily Kommersant speculated on Wednesday that
Ilyukhin made the statements to provoke the Kremlin into trying to
ban the Communist Party.
	   ``That would strengthen the party's image as the main opposition
force,'' the newspaper said.
	   Yeltsin banned the Communist Party for one year in the early
1990s, but it quickly rebounded as the country's leading opposition
group and now has the largest faction in parliament's lower house,
the State Duma.
	   The Communists and Berezovsky have never been on good terms.
Many Communists believe Berezovsky, one of the country's richest
and most powerful businessmen, symbolizes the wild, unrestrained
capitalism that has emerged in post-Soviet Russia.
	   The Communists have also demanded that Berezovsky step down from
his post as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, a loose grouping of 12 ex-Soviet republics.

Court rules that Kurdish leader free to leave country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court ruled Wednesday that the Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan is free to leave the country.
	   The ruling followed a decision by Germany to withdraw the
international arrest warrant it had issued for Ocalan, who was
wanted on terrorism charges, news reports said.
	   Ocalan had been staying in a Rome villa, but was kept under
police surveillance and was barred from leaving the city.
	   The leader of the Kurdistan Workers party, or PKK, was detained
in Rome on Nov. 12 when he arrived on a flight from Moscow.
	   He is wanted in his home country of Turkey for trial on
terrorism charges. But Italy refuses to return him to Turkey, where
he faces a possible death sentence.

Asian air fares up, especially business class, says study
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Air fares around the Asia-Pacific region are up
4.8 percent over last year and business class passengers are being
hit the hardest, according to a study released Wednesday by
American Express.
	   ``Because volumes of travelers from the Asia-Pacific region have
dropped substantially and because of price wars in the leisure fare
markets, airlines are trying to raise more revenue from premium
class travelers, who tend to be less sensitive to price increases
than leisure travelers,'' said Eric Meierhands, director of
purchasing management for American Express.
	   There have also been modest increases on economy tickets during
the past quarter, as airlines, which buy oil and service debt in
U.S. dollars, try to recoup losses caused by currency devaluations.
	   Over the past three years, the study showed, business class
airfares in the region have increased 14 percent, first class has
gone up 11.5 percent, while economy class tickets have gone up 10
percent.
	   Thailand has reported the most significant increases, with fares
in all classes up more than 21 percent over the past year, the
study said.
	   Although Indonesian fares have remained flat from the last
quarter, they represent a significant increase in the cost of
travel because of the dramatic drop in the value of the rupiah, the
study said.
	   Airlines in Malaysia are absorbing almost all of the impact of
the currency depreciation, raising fares by 5 percent in the last
year, less than the inflation rate of 6.2 percent, the study said.
	   Singapore's first and business class fares have increased about
1 percent over the past year.

	   LONDON (AP) _ As U.N. weapons inspectors evacuated Iraq on
Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes
could come quickly and without warning in the face of Saddam
Hussein's latest defiance.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday. ``I'm not now going to give him any warning of
what we might do.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed the Iraq crisis with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in a 15-minute phone call just after 9 p.m.
(2100 GMT) Tuesday, said a spokesman for Blair, speaking with
customary anonymity.
	   Blair also met with his cabinet's defense committee earlier
Tuesday to discuss Iraq, the spokesman said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors evacuated Baghdad on
Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. arms inspector said Iraq had
reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain. ``There
is nobody left behind.''
	   Cross said weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency were expected to arrive
in Bahrain later Wednesday.
	   In Baghdad, a U.N. spokesman said no decision had been made on
withdrawing the 400 U.N. humanitarian monitors from Iraq.
	   George Somerwill added, however, that they were prepared to
leave ``should it become necessary.''

Eritrea acquires 10 Russian MiG-29s
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JULIA STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Russian MiG-29 jet fighter planes were
seen flying over Asmara this week, confirming speculation that the
Eritrean Air force had acquired as many as 10 of the aircraft as
its border dispute with Ethiopia continues to fester.
	   More than a dozen officials from the Russian Ministry of
Aviation Production have been in the Eritrean capital, and Russian
pilots and technicians have also been seen.
	   There has been no official comment on the additions to the
Eritrean air force, which greatly increase its power and range.
	   Until now, the air force consisted of six Italian Aermacchi
MB-339CD training jets converted to attack aircraft, eight Finnish
Rodigo trainers and a couple of Mi-17 helicopters.
	   Earlier this month, Russia struck a deal to sell neighboring
Ethiopia fighter jets, combat helicopters, and other military
hardware.
	   Defense sources say four Su-27 fighters and several Mi-24 and
Mi-8 helicopters are expected to be delivered by the end of the
month.
	   According to the analysts, Ethiopia already owns 70 Soviet-era
MiG-23s, and an Israeli firm recently agreed to sell Addis Ababa 10
upgraded MiG-21 Lancer fighters.
	   Eritrea is embroiled in a seven-month standoff in its border
dispute with its larger southern neighbor. There has been relative
calm since heavy battles in May and June, but both sides have been
importing millions of dollars worth of weaponry and reinforcing
their troops positions.
	   Jane's Defense Weekly says the current price of a MiG-29 ranges
from dlrs 20-25 million new, including a training, start-up
package. Used models go for dlrs 15-20 million.
	   Eritrea's spending on defense last year totaled dlrs 87 million.
The country's total expenditures for the current year were forecast
at about dlrs 340 million.
	   It is estimated that 200,000 soldiers now face each other along
the common, 1,000 kilometer (625-mile) border.
	   In June, Eritrea and Ethiopia carried out air strikes against
each other. Ethiopian MiG-28s strafed Asmara's air base and
civilian airports killing more than 30 civilians.
	   Eritrea used its Aermacchis to attack Mekele, the capital of
Ethiopia's Tigray province, hitting an elementary school in which
51 were killed. The Ethiopians later bombed Adigrat, a main
military garrison.
	   Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of invading its territory at Badime on
May 12, while Eritrea claims the land through a series of Italian
colonial treaties. Peace efforts have stalled over Eritrea's
refusal to withdraw from the contested Badime area and allow the
Ethiopian administration to return.
	   The conflict prevention and resolution body of the Organization
of African Unity is to discuss the Ethio-Eritrean conflict when it
meets Thursday and Friday in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

Milosevic blasts U.S. for allegedly supporting Kosovo

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After meeting with U.S. envoys
seeking to reinvigorate the Kosovo peace process, Yugoslavia's
president Wednesday blasted the United States for allegedly
supporting ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' and vowed to crush the
rebels.
	   In a statement, Slobodan Milosevic said American representatives
in the U.N. Security Council ``are losing credibility'' by
allegedly blocking resolutions denouncing ethnic Albanian
``terrorists.''
	   Yugoslav security forces ``are determined to protect their
citizens and property and will suppress terrorism regardless of the
support it has.'' Milosevic said.
	   After the late-night talks with Milosevic on Tuesday, U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke acknowledged a huge divide between Serbs and
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians on the future of the province in the wake
of violence that marred an informal peace deal and left 42 people
dead.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters. He gave no
details on his talks with Milosevic.
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. Ethnic
Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's population.
	   The deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the
agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after Milosevic
launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February, leaving
hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily.
	   The rebels say they won't accept anything short of independence.
Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   The Yugoslav army said it killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania on Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   In Pec, six Serbs, including five teenagers, were killed and
three were wounded late Monday when unidentified assailants opened
fire in a bar.
	   Serbian officials and media were quick to blame the killings on
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's secession, and started
a massive anti-Albanian campaign.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec on Wednesday in protest
of the killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against
``the terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which
had to partially withdraw from the province after the
U.S.-sponsored agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency
reported.
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable,'' and ``appalling beyond words.''
	   A top government body for the province said the killings of
Serbs were ``the most monstrous crime in the series of assaults by
Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   ``The problem in Kosovo is not about human rights, this is most
cruel terrorism and Nazism supported secretly and publicly by some
representatives of the ethnic Albanian community,'' the statement
from the Temporary Executive Council for Kosovo said.
	   The statement also demanded an end to ``Western, one-sided
condemnation of Serbs and the Serbian people in Kosovo'' and for
``international recognition of what is obvious ... that Albanian
terrorists and their political leaders are the obstacle for
reaching a peaceful solution in Kosovo.''
	   A reaction by ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party said the
murders ``show the intention of Albanian terrorist gangs to achieve
independent Kosovo at any rate, using most brutal methods like the
murder of innocent children.''
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.

Hodler says he went public to avoid cover-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The senior IOC official whose
allegations of bribery and blackmail rocked the Olympic movement
said he went public because he initially feared a cover-up of the
Salt Lake City scandal.
	   ``The feeling crept up on me that certain people are afraid of
this case and wanted to sweep everything under the carpet,'' Marc
Hodler was quoted as saying in Wednesday's Zurich daily Neue
Zuercher Zeitung.
	   ``Because of various misunderstandings, I was under the
impression that some of my colleagues might try not to uncover
mistakes made by some members of the IOC and lay all the blame on
the Salt Lake City organizing committee,'' he said in a separate
interview with Zurich's Tages-Anzeiger daily.
	   ``I'm not acting for Salt Lake City but for justice,'' he said.
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old senior member of the IOC executive board,
has said Salt Lake City had been ``blackmailed'' by agents
promising to secure votes during its successful bid for the 2002
Winter Games.
	   The Salt Lake bid committee offered nearly dlrs 400,000 in
scholarship funds to 13 people, including six relatives of IOC
members.
	   A high-level IOC panel is investigating the Salt Lake case.
	   On Saturday, Hodler alleged that four ``agents'' _ including one
member of the IOC _ had been involved in vote-buying schemes over
the past 10 years.
	   He cited supposed irregularities in the elections of at least
four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia,
and Salt Lake.
	   ``In don't enjoy being a member of a club that has a bad
reputation,'' Hodler told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung.
	   ``I'm a lawyer and, as such, I can't do anything without
proof,'' he added in defense of his revelations. ``In contrast to
what you might believe, I'm probably the best friend of IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch.''
	   Hodler said he wanted to ``exert pressure'' on the IOC to change
its election procedure for Olympic cities, putting the decision in
the hands of a small group rather than the entire IOC membership.

Rebel forces increase pressure on besieged Angolan city

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces Wednesday attacked government
army positions on the outskirts of Kuito, resuming their offensive
against the strategic central highland city after a day of relative
calm, according to news reports.
	   The UNITA rebels moved on Cunji, seven kilometers (four miles)
outside Kuito, shortly before daybreak, the private radio station
Radio Eclesia reported from the city which lies about 500 kms (300
miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda.
	   Cunji is located on high ground overlooking Kuito. Its capture
would give the rebels a vantage point for artillery fire on the
center of the city whose one-time population of 100,000 has been
swollen by thousands of displaced people fleeing fighting in the
surrounding area.
	   Battles have focused on Bie province, whose capital is Kuito,
since fighting between the two sides restarted Dec. 4, ending a
four-year peace pact in the former Portuguese colony.
	   Kuito reportedly was mostly calm Tuesday.
	   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon said he expected the group's
leadership inside Angola to issue a statement on the peace accord
in the coming days.
	   The spokesman, Rui Oliveira, said the military situation in Bie
province was ``muddled.''
	   An International Red Cross spokesman in Luanda said the airport
at Huambo, the country's second-largest city, 110 kilometers (70
miles) west of Kuito, was closed to civilian flights.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the U.N.-brokered
1994 peace agreement, which was supposed to end a two-decade civil
war that broke out after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

Milosevic blasts U.S. for allegedly supporting Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
``terrorists.''
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS date of Pec shooting to Monday &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - After meeting U.S. envoys seeking to
reinvigorate the Kosovo peace process, Yugoslavia's president
Wednesday blasted the United States for allegedly supporting ethnic
Albanian ``terrorists'' and vowed to crush them.
	   In a statement, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic said
American representatives in the U.N. Security Council ``are losing
credibility'' by blocking U.N. statements denouncing ethnic
Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Yugoslav security forces ``are determined to protect their
citizens and property and will suppress terrorism regardless of the
support it has.'' Milosevic said.
	   He said those ``terrorist bandits ... with a criminal face'' who
gunned down six young Serbs late Monday in a bar in the western
town of Pec ``will be found, wherever they are.''
	   After the late-night talks with Milosevic on Tuesday, U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke acknowledged a huge divide between Serbs and
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians on the future of the province in the wake
of violence that marred an informal peace deal and left 42 people
dead.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic.
	   The Yugoslav army said it killed 36 ethnic Albanian rebels and
wounded a dozen in a five-hour gun battle near the border with
Albania Monday. The guerrillas use Albania as a sanctuary and
conduit for arms.
	   In Pec, six Serbs, including five teenagers, were killed and
three were wounded when unidentified assailants opened fire in a
bar.
	   Serbian officials and media were quick to blame the killings on
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for Kosovo's secession, and started
a massive anti-Albanian campaign. Milosevic's statement reflected
that campaign.
	   All Serb schools remained closed in Pec Wednesday in protest of
the killings. Kosovo Serbs demanded resolute action against ``the
terrorists'' and urged a return of Serb security forces which had
to partially withdraw from the province after the U.S.-sponsored
agreement was reached, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
	   In Belgrade, Holbrooke condemned the Pec killings, calling them
``outrageous and unacceptable,'' and ``appalling beyond words.''
	   Holbrooke brokered the Oct. 12 agreement to end the fighting in
Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. The
deal averted threatened NATO airstrikes and bought time for
diplomats to try to work out an agreement on the future of the
province, where majority ethnic Albanians are seeking independence.
	   A top government body for the province said the killings of
Serbs were ``the most monstrous crime in the series of assaults by
Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   ``The problem in Kosovo is not about human rights, this is most
cruel terrorism and Nazism supported secretly and publicly by some
representatives of the ethnic Albanian community,'' the statement
from the Temporary Executive Council for Kosovo said.
	   The statement also demanded an end to ``Western, one-sided
condemnation of Serbs and the Serbian people in Kosovo'' and for
``international recognition of what is obvious ... that Albanian
terrorists and their political leaders are the obstacle for
reaching a peaceful solution in Kosovo.''
	   The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party said the murders
``show the intention of Albanian terrorist gangs to achieve
independent Kosovo at any rate, using most brutal methods like the
murder of innocent children.''
	   Holbrooke said in Pristina that NATO's ``activation order (for
airstrikes) remains in place'' and progress toward a peaceful
settlement ``must be made because we are concerned that the
fighting may flare up.''
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts appear stalled, however, raising
fears the province could explode again into bloody fighting.
	   Dozens of people on both sides have been killed since the Oct.
12 agreement, which sought to end the violence sparked after
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatist rebels in February,
leaving hundreds dead and an estimated 300,000 homeless.
	   Ethnic Albanian politicians insist on a plan that would enable
them to break free of Serbian rule but seem prepared to accept
autonomy instead of independence _ at least temporarily.
	   The rebels say they won't accept anything short of independence.
Serbia, meanwhile, refuses to consider anything more than partial
autonomy for Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.

 &UR; Eritrea acquires 10 Russian MiG-29s
 &UR; By JULIA STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Russian MiG-29 jet fighter planes were
seen flying over Asmara this week, confirming speculation that the
Eritrean Air force had acquired as many as 10 of the aircraft as
its border dispute with Ethiopia continues to fester.
	   More than a dozen officials from the Russian Ministry of
Aviation Production have been in the Eritrean capital, and Russian
pilots and technicians have also been seen.
	   There has been no official comment on the additions to the
Eritrean air force, which greatly increase its power and range.
	   Until now, the air force consisted of six Italian Aermacchi
MB-339CD training jets converted to attack aircraft, eight Finnish
Rodigo trainers and a couple of Mi-17 helicopters.
	   Earlier this month, Russia struck a deal to sell neighboring
Ethiopia fighter jets, combat helicopters, and other military
hardware.
	   Defense sources say four Su-27 fighters and several Mi-24 and
Mi-8 helicopters are expected to be delivered by the end of the
month.
	   According to the analysts, Ethiopia already owns 70 Soviet-era
MiG-23s, and an Israeli firm recently agreed to sell Addis Ababa 10
upgraded MiG-21 Lancer fighters.
	   Eritrea is embroiled in a seven-month standoff in its border
dispute with its larger southern neighbor. There has been relative
calm since heavy battles in May and June, but both sides have been
importing millions of dollars worth of weaponry and reinforcing
their troops positions.
	   Jane's Defense Weekly says the current price of a MiG-29 ranges
from dlrs 20-25 million new, including a training, start-up
package. Used models go for dlrs 15-20 million.
	   Eritrea's spending on defense last year totaled dlrs 87 million.
The country's total expenditures for the current year were forecast
at about dlrs 340 million.
	   It is estimated that 200,000 soldiers now face each other along
the common, 1,000 kilometer (625-mile) border.
	   In June, Eritrea and Ethiopia carried out air strikes against
each other. Ethiopian MiG-28s strafed Asmara's air base and
civilian airports killing more than 30 civilians.
	   Eritrea used its Aermacchis to attack Mekele, the capital of
Ethiopia's Tigray province, hitting an elementary school in which
51 were killed. The Ethiopians later bombed Adigrat, a main
military garrison.
	   Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of invading its territory at Badime on
May 12, while Eritrea claims the land through a series of Italian
colonial treaties. Peace efforts have stalled over Eritrea's
refusal to withdraw from the contested Badime area and allow the
Ethiopian administration to return.
	   The conflict prevention and resolution body of the Organization
of African Unity is to discuss the Ethio-Eritrean conflict when it
meets Thursday and Friday in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

Netanyahu hangs tough, but may not have impressed hard-liners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh Palestinian reaction in grafs 3,4,15,16;
TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace
process forward has frustrated U.S. President Bill Clinton and
angered the Palestinians _ and might not be enough to save his
government from collapse next week.
	   Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's
three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day
earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on
Friday, as stipulated by the Wye River peace accord.
	   Palestinian officials said they were equally as free to freeze
the accords.
	   ``I don't think the Palestinians should be expected to implement
from one side,'' Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour told The
Associated Press on Wednesday.
	   Clinton had hoped that his visit would move Netanyahu to back
down from his freeze on the process _ especially after the
Palestine National Council met an Israeli demand and formally
renounced clauses in its charter that call for Israel's
destruction.
	   Netanyahu approved of the renunciation, but said he would not
move forward until the Palestinians met six other demands. The next
withdrawal from territory is due Friday, according to Wye.
	   A prisoner release _ a highly emotional issue for Palestinians _
is also due Friday, but Netanyahu showed no sign of going ahead
with that either.
	   The prime minister is trying to shore up support from
hard-liners in his coalition who have threatened to vote against
the government in a no-confidence motion on Monday.
	   Knesset member Michael Kleiner said in a statement he was
unmoved, and infuriated by Netanyahu's role in the PNC vote.
	   ``The fact that the prime minister is accepting this farce, is
only strengthening (Kleiner's) view that he has to act to bring
down the government,'' Kleiner's office said.
	   Hard-liners faulted Netanyahu for his part in initiating the PNC
meeting because it provided Clinton with an opportunity to visit
the Palestinian-held territories _ and hint at U.S. approval for
Palestinian aspirations to statehood.
	   Eli Goldschmidt, caucus chairman of the opposition Labor Party,
on Tuesday smelled victory.
	   ``Now we have the 61 and it looks sure,'' said Goldschmidt who
is counting on at least nine legislators, including present and
former coalition members, to vote with Labor. There are 120
legislators in the Knesset.
	   Goldschmidt's boss, Ehud Barak, was already planning for an
election, and had flown in top U.S. political consultants to help
him, including James Carville.
	   Palestinians said it was increasingly difficult to work with a
weakened government.
	   ``All the talk by Israeli officials about security is not the
security of the Israeli people, but the security of keeping their
seats in the government,'' Gaza security chief Mohammmed Dahlan
told The AP on Wednesday.
	   Compounding Netanyahu's woes, his finance minister, Yaacov
Neeman, has reportedly quit, according to an Israel TV report.
	   Neeman _ popular in the business community _ was reportedly
insulted that Netanyahu offered the ministry to the head of a small
party in order to shore up support in the Knesset.
	   Neeman was on vacation and not reachable for comment.
	   In what may have been a snowball effect, Netanyahu's defense
minister Yitzhak Mordechai _ known to support going ahead with Wye
_ said he would have his own announcement to make Friday. He did
not elaborate.
	   If Mordechai and others in Netanyahu's coalition who support the
peace process bolted, that would leave Netanyahu shorn of his left
and right wings by Monday's vote.
	   Netanyahu appeared to be unshaken.
	   ``We will go to the people if necessary,'' he told The
Associated Press on Tuesday. ``I don't fear elections.''

Tight schedule makes Kim wait

 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has run a tight schedule for the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. But a slight delay
as things wound down Wednesday night led to a small diplomatic
snafu.
	   South Korean President Kim Dae-jung was scheduled to make his
red-carpet entry to meet privately with the nine ASEAN leaders at 6
p.m.
	   His motorcade was just down the block from the International
Conference Center when word came that Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie's motorcade hadn't left yet, and Habibie was nowhere to be
found.
	   Habibie's convoy was forced to cruise around the block twice so
Kim could get in. Afterward, a contrite Habibie appeared and
trotted down the steps quickly, apologizing to the security men who
had been frantically talking into their two-way radios.
	   Through it all, other uniformed guards crammed into the guard
booth, mesmerized by television coverage of the Thailand-Kuwait
soccer match at the Asian Games.

Inter meets Manchester United; Bayern Munich faces Kaiserslautern
</HEADLINE>
in Champions Cup quarterfinal
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ronaldo goes to Old Trafford and the two German
teams, Bayern Munich and Kaiserslautern, meet each other in the
quarterfinals of the European Champions Cup.
	   Manchester United and Inter Milan, both runners-up in their
domestic leagues last season, were paired in Wednesday's draw. The
first leg is at Old Trafford March 3, and the second at San Siro
two weeks later.
	   The all-German matchup means that Bayern must get past the club
that edged it for the Bundesliga title last season. Right now, the
two teams are second and third behind Bayer Leverkusen.
	   The other quarterfinal pairings have defending titlist and
seven-time champion Real Madrid against Dynamo Kiev, a
quarterfinalist last season, and Juventus, attempting to make the
final for the fourth time in a row, against Greek titlist
Olympiakos.
	   Real Madrid initially drew Inter Milan. But UEFA secretary
Gerhard Aigner had already explained that teams who had qualified
from the same group in the previous round could not be drawn
together. Inter topped its group and Real was second, one of the
two best runners-up.
	   That put Inter back into the pot and, this time, Dynamo Kiev
came out, while Inter was drawn against Manchester United in the
most eye-catching matchup of the round.
	   ``I'm very happy. Manchester United is a great club,'' said
Inter vice president Gianmaria Visconte. ``It will be a fantastic
match. We always have admired Manchester United.''
	   Manchester United chief executive Martin Edwards said that
facing an Italian team was hard enough yet he relished the
opportunity of facing Ronaldo.
	   ``It's a tough draw and it's a great draw in one sense because
of Inter Milan's reputation,'' he said.
	   ``If you are going to win the European Cup you have to be
prepared to play the best teams at some stage. Italian teams have
proved in recent years that they are among the strongest in Europe,
while Inter Milan are a really good side who have arguably the
world's best player in Ronaldo.''
	   The matchup will also bring United's David Beckham and Inter's
Argentinian midfielder Diego Simeone together for the first time
since their World Cup flareup that saw the England played sent off.
	   After Simeone had floored Beckham, the English player kicked out
at the Argentinian player while on the ground and was expelled. In
one of the most dramatic games of the World Cup 10-man England lost
the game on penalties after a 2-2 tie.
	   Kaiserslautern manager Gerhard Hercog said he had hoped to avoid
three-time titlist Bayern.
	   ``We are not disappointed but we did expect another European
competitor,'' he said, adding that it meant his club was up against
``the strongest team in the group.''
	   Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz said he was thankful that his
team didn't draw Inter again.
	   ``We're very happy that Inter was thrown back into the pot
because they're such a difficult team,'' he said. ``But now we have
to stay focused on playing Dynamo Kiev if we want to win.
	   ``If we start being too relieved about not playing Inter and
thinking it's an easy draw, it would be easy to ruin our chances
and all work this far would be wasted.''
	   Dynamo Kiev president Grigory Surkis, whose team was knocked out
by Juventus at the same stage last season, said he prefered to face
the defending champion later in the competition.
	   ``If you have as your aim to come to the final, the best thing
is to play against the title holder in the final round,'' he said.
``But we will try our best.''
	   Juventus vice president Roberto Bettega said his team, which
squeezed into the last eight with its first win after five tied
games, said his team wouldn't be fooled into thinking it had an
easy draw in Greek club Olympiakos.
	   ``We you start thinking who you want to draw, then you're
dreaming,'' the former Juventus striker said. ``Then there's
reality. The draw gave us Olympiakos and these are the games we
must win and we formulate a strategy for this draw. It will be
difficult because Olympiakos was first in their group and Greek
football is improving.''
	   In the considerably weaker Cup Winners Cup, defending champion
Chelsea faces Valerenga of Norway, thus avoiding Italy's Lazio and
Spanish league leader Mallorca.
	   Lazio meets Greek club Panionis and Mallorca visits Varteks of
Croatia in the first leg, which is March 4.
	   The other quarterfinal is Lokomotiv Moscow against Israeli club
Maccabi Haifa.
	   Only three nations have any interest in the UEFA Cup
quarterfinals with three Italian, three French and two Spanish
clubs going for the title.
	   Yet all three Italian or French teams or both Spanish clubs
could make it to the last four because they managed to avoid each
other. UEFA said it made no effort to keep clubs from the same
countries apart.
	   Olympique Marseille hosts Celta Vigo, which is second in the
Spanish standings, Bologna welcomes Lyon, Bordeaux receives Parma
and AS Roma goes to Atletico Madrid. The matches are March 2 and
16.
	   Marseille sports director Marcel Dib was wary of Celta, which
has never won a major honor and only got into the UEFA Cup by
finishing seventh in the Spanish league. Celta ousted two English
teams, Premier League leader Aston Villa and then Liverpool, to
gain the last eight.
	   ``They're a team of very high level. They have had very good
results, they are a team in form,'' Dib said. ``We have never met a
Spanish team in Europe.''

Arafat: Palestinians have a ``natural right'' to declare a state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinians have a ``natural right'' to
declare a state next May, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
here Tuesday.
	   Speaking to reporters in Cairo after briefing Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on U.S. Presidential Bill Clinton's visit to the
region, Arafat referred to the first Israel-Palestinian accord,
signed in 1993, as the base line of the peace process.
	   ``It is known that the Oslo agreement, which we signed at the
White House under the supervision of President Clinton, had five
years as a transitional period. This period ends on May 4, 1999
and, after that, it is our natural right to declare our independent
state,'' Arafat said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that any
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state would kill the peace
process.
	   A summit between Arafat, Clinton and Netanyahu on the
Israeli-Gaza Strip border on Tuesday failed to produce an Israeli
commitment to withdraw on schedule from more West Bank land.
	   Palestinians have accused Israel of wrecking Clinton's bid to
salvage the Wye River interim peace accord that the president
helped to negotiate in October.
	   In separate remarks to reporters, Mubarak said the Wye accord
would be fulfilled eventually.
	   ``I am confident that this agreement will be implemented,
whether one of the sides is satisfied or not. This is inevitable if
we want peace and stability in the region.''

Donor countries approve blueprint to advance Bosnian

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ World powers frustrated with the slow pace
of reconciliation in Bosnia approved a blueprint Wednesday designed
to advance the process and warned the country's fractious leaders
that foreign aid is not open-ended.
	   The Bosnia Peace Implementation Council endorsed the plan after
a two-day meeting called to review progress in implementing the
Dayton peace accords, which ended Bosnia's 1992-1995 war among
Moslems, Croats and Serbs.
	   The council, which comprises more than 40 countries and
international organizations, set out a package of measures for
reforming the Bosnian economy, strengthening government
institutions and encouraging the return of refugees and displaced
persons.
	   It stated that some success in these areas has already been
made, saying ``a lasting peace within Bosnia and Herzegovina is
starting to take root.''
	   But it warned that Bosnia is still in no condition to survive
without outside help.
	   ``Without the scaffolding of international support, it would
collapse,'' the council said in a 30-page declaration.
	   On the aid issue, the council reminded Bosnian leaders that
their struggling Balkan nation is among the world's ``most assisted
countries'' and that this multi-billion dollar aid will soon start
to dwindle.
	   ``Bosnia and Herzegovina must use the time that remains to
prepare for life without total reliance on foreign aid, and to face
up to the challenge of transforming the economy to generate jobs
and a better standard of living.''
	   Specifically, leaders were urged to speed up sales of state
assets to promote a market-oriented economy, set up a properly
functioning capital market and banking system and fight corruption
and tax evasion.

Arafat: Palestinians have a ``natural right'' to declare a state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES Mubarak spoke with Arafat graf 7; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinians have a ``natural right'' to
declare a state next May, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
here Tuesday.
	   Speaking to reporters in Cairo after briefing Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on U.S. Presidential Bill Clinton's visit to the
region, Arafat referred to the first Israel-Palestinian accord,
signed in 1993, as the base line of the peace process.
	   ``It is known that the Oslo agreement, which we signed at the
White House under the supervision of President Clinton, had five
years as a transitional period. This period ends on May 4, 1999
and, after that, it is our natural right to declare our independent
state,'' Arafat said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that any
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state would kill the peace
process.
	   A summit between Arafat, Clinton and Netanyahu on the
Israeli-Gaza Strip border on Tuesday failed to produce an Israeli
commitment to withdraw on schedule from more West Bank land.
	   Palestinians have accused Israel of wrecking Clinton's bid to
salvage the Wye River interim peace accord that the president
helped to negotiate in October.
	   Addressing the same news conference as Arafat, Mubarak said the
Wye accord would be fulfilled eventually.
	   ``I am confident that this agreement will be implemented,
whether one of the sides is satisfied or not. This is inevitable if
we want peace and stability in the region.''

A Christmas wish: Reunite crown prince and ex-girlfriend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The holidays are a time of
reconciliation, so a Dutch group hopes its Christmas card depicting
the Dutch crown prince with his ex-girlfriend in a wedding dress
will reunite them.
	   The Willem Alexander and Emily Foundation has sent out several
thousand Christmas cards featuring an illustration of the smiling
couple dressed for a royal wedding.
	   Trouble is, Prince Willem Alexander _ eldest son of Queen
Beatrix and next in line for the Dutch throne _ broke up with
commoner Emily Bremers this past fall.
	   ``We suspect that they still have great feeling for each
other,'' foundation chairman Johan Vlemmix told the daily De
Telegraaf. ``Who knows, maybe it will work out during Christmas.''
	   The card depicts Bremers in a white bridal gown and Willem
Alexander sporting his royal sash and medals, standing by a golden
carriage. It reads, ``Merry Christmas and a Happy and Healthy
1999.''
	   ``If they see this picture, they're bound to get back
together,'' Vlemmix told the Trouw newspaper.
	   The couple broke off their relationship amid widespread
speculation that the prince soon would announce his engagement to
Ms. Bremers, the daughter of an orthodontist.
	   Among the recipients of the holiday cards were Cabinet members
and the royal family, including the queen, who is said to oppose
any marriage between her son and a commoner.
	   The Royal House had no comment about the cards, a spokesman for
the family said Wednesday.
	   If the last-ditch effort for a happy reunion of Emily and Willem
Alexander doesn't succeed, Vlemmix said he'll disband his
four-year-old society.

Court says German zoo can accept controversial baby elephants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ The Cologne Administrative court on
Wednesday cleared the way for Dresden's zoo to import four baby
elephants, ruling that reasons given by the environment ministry
against their import were insufficient.
	   The decision came a day after Dresden zoo director Hubert
Luecker filed the complaint against cancellation of an import
permit by Environment Minister Juergen Trittin.
	   The four African elephants, along with three intended for the
zoo in Basel, Switzerland, were to be flown to Frankfurt later
Wednesday, although an appeal against the court's decision may
still be filed.
	   The elephants, which were to be sent this month to the Dresden
and Erfurt zoos in eastern Germany, were part of a group of 30
young elephants captured in August from herds in Botswana and taken
to a South African farm.
	   A South African judge ruled early this month that the animals
had been abused and deprived of water at the farm. He granted
temporary custody to the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.
	   But according to the German Embassy in South Africa, the
accusations against the animal farm were largely groundless.
	   Trittin last week said that Germany would protest the abuse of
the animals by not accepting them in its zoos, even after the South
African judge approved their export.
	   Norbert Otto, a federal lawmaker from Erfurt, demanded in
parliament Tuesday that Trittin take steps to prevent the animals
from being put to sleep in South Africa.
	   In addition, the cultural minister of Saxony, of which Dresden
is the capital, asked the state's 740,000 school children to write
letters of protest urging Trittin to allow the elephants into
Germany.

U.N. weapons monitors evacuate Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details on U.S. British forces in the region, all
U.N. weapons inspectors withdrawn from Baghdad &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos BAG 101-108 &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors left Baghdad on
Wednesday, a day after their boss said Iraq had reneged on its
promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Iraq's compliance.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed the report by
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler as ``full of lies'' and said
it was ``intended to trigger an American and British military
strike on Iraq.''
	   He said the withdrawal of the inspectors ``means again that the
Special Commission is a tool in America's hand to implement its
policy of aggression.'' His remarks were carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes could come
quickly and without warning.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''
	   The United States has 22 warships and 201 aircraft in the
region, including 72 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
Eight of the warships carry cruise missiles. Britain has 22 strike
aircraft in the region.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain Wednesday that
the weapons inspectors had been pulled out of the country.
	   ``There is nobody left behind,'' she said.
	   Cross said weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission
and the International Atomic Energy Agency were expected to arrive
in Bahrain later Wednesday.
	   In Baghdad, a U.N. spokesman said no decision had been made on
withdrawing the 400 U.N. employees monitoring humanitarian programs
in Iraq.
	   George Somerwill added, however, that they were prepared to
leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   The last three visiting teams of weapons inspectors left Baghdad
on Monday, but up to 140 resident experts had remained in the
country to monitor known sites.
	   Under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, Iraq had pledged
Nov. 14 to resume full cooperation with inspectors and allow
unfettered access to sites and documents.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge that made it impossible for him to assure that Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security
Council can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler said Iraq's claim that it does not possess banned weapons
or the ability to make them ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   He said inspectors were not able to gain access to the
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid
evidence of the presence of proscribed materials.''
	   At two other sites, negotiations ultimately cleared the way for
inspections, he said. But one building had been emptied of relevant
materials, and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any
disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   ``It remains the commission's strong view that, under the
present circumstances, relevant documentation must exist in Iraq
and that provision of such documentation is the best hope for
revealing the full picture'' of Iraqi weapons programs, he said.

Friday, as stipulated by the Wye River peace accord.

U.N. prosecutor asks Russia for diplomatic backing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-War Crimes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's
chief prosecutor has asked Russia for more diplomatic backing in
international efforts to bring Serb war crimes suspects to justice.
	   Louise Arbour of Canada made the request Tuesday during talks
with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov at a peace conference on
Bosnia in Madrid.
	   ``I requested the meeting in part because of the increased
frequency and strength of their public comments ... with respect to
our use of sealed indictments,'' Arbour told reporters in The Hague
on Wednesday.
	   Russia has questioned the legality of the U.N. court's use of
so-called ``secret indictments,'' claiming they deprive suspects of
the right to turn themselves in and prevent governments from
arresting suspects.
	   Arbour dismissed the argument as having ``no air of reality in
the present context.''
	   The tribunal argues that sealed indictments are necessary,
particularly in the Serb-controlled section of Bosnia, because far
from arresting indicted suspects, authorities often shield them.
	   Arbour said she also asked Russia to exert diplomatic pressure
on Serb authorities in Bosnia and Yugoslavia to arrest indicted
suspects. But she came away empty-handed.
	   ``I did not come back with a commitment to that extent,'' she
said Wednesday.
	   Russia recently blocked the U.N. Security Council from taking
action against Yugoslavia for hindering the tribunal's work.
	   Diplomats said that Moscow, which has close religious and
cultural ties to Yugoslavia, even blocked a press statement from
the council president condemning Yugoslavia's defiance.

Angry protesters demand justice in front of U.S. Embassy

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Hundreds of survivors of the
Srebrenica massacre protested Wednesday over the harsh sentences
imposed on three Srebrenica Muslims by a Bosnian Serb court.
	   At first, a smaller group of mainly women stood quietly across
the street of the embassy, but after a bigger group carrying
banners joined them, the roughly 200 protesters became aggressive,
breaking a security line and approaching the U.S. Embassy entrance.
	   ``We will not leave this place,'' one of the women yelled. After
embassy personnel met with protesters and promised to pass a letter
written by them to U.S. President Bill Clinton, the women moved
away from the embassy gates to the other side of the street.
	   During the Bosnian war, the eastern Muslim enclave of Srebrenica
was declared a United Nations safe zone, but in 1995, it was
brutally overrun by Bosnian Serb forces, while the U.N. stood by
and watched.
	   The United Nations were not able to prevent a massacre that
followed, in which thousands of Muslim men were systematically
executed.
	   Wednesday's protest was prompted by a Bosnian Serb court
decision, which sentenced three Muslim survivors of the 1995 ordeal
to a total of 51 years in prison for murder. The men began a hunger
strike after they were sentenced Saturday.
	   Last year, the court sentenced each man to 20 years
imprisonment. But international officials overseeing the 1995
Dayton peace agreement demanded a retrial, calling the first
proceedings a sham.
	   The defendants had signed confessions that they had committed
the crimes, but said they were forced to do so.
	   International officials in Bosnia condemned the court's decision
at the retrial on Saturday, and said the sentences were handed down
despite lack of evidence. They also said they were unable to do
anything else for the three men.
	   The three men were part of a group of seven who escaped a
massacre. They said they survived for months in the wild, and
surrendered when they spotted U.S. soldiers patrolling the former
front line in May 1996.
	   The troops noted some of the men were wearing military uniforms,
carrying weapons and had recent haircuts, and handed them over to
Bosnian Serb police. They were held for a year before the first
trial opened.

Embassy and auxiliary missions to close Dec. 18, 24
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy in Nairobi and its
auxiliary missions will close for two days this month because of
security threats following the Aug. 7 twin bombings at the missions
in Kenya and Tanzania, the embassy said Wednesday.
	   In a statement, the embassy said it will close all elements of
its mission in Nairobi on Dec. 18 and Dec. 24 ``because of security
concerns'' cited in a State Department warning last month.
	   Embassy spokesman Chris Scharf declined to explain why those two
dates _ one the Friday before the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan
is expected to begin and the other Christmas Eve _ were chosen or
whether any specific threats have come to light.
	   The August bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam killed 224
people including 12 Americans in the Kenyan capital and wounded
more than 5,400.
	   A U.S. federal district court has indicted Saudi millionaire
Osama bin Laden, an Islamic extremist in exile in Afghanistan, for
masterminding the attacks and five others for carrying them out.
	   The United States retaliated Aug. 20 with air strikes on camps
in Afghanistan suspected of housing bin Laden's base of operations
and on a pharmeceutical factory in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum,
which Washington said was making chemicals for weapons.
	   The embassy statement also cited a Nov. 12 State Department
warning of possible retaliatory acts against Americans abroad
following the bombings, air strikes and arrests, and also tensions
in Iraq over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``The potential for retaliatory acts against Americans and
American interests overseas continues to exist,'' said the State
Department warning, quoted in Wednesday's statement.
	   On Sunday, U.S. embassies in four Gulf states warned U.S.
citizens to be on alert for terrorist attacks on Americans within
the next 30 days.
	   U.S. embassies in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and
Bahrain issued a statement Sunday saying there was a strong
possibility of an attack being planned against U.S. targets in the
Gulf over the next month.

Former Nova Scotia leader battles charge of a 1956 rape
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The sexual-assault trial unfolding
here is doubly dramatic. The charges date back to 1956, when two
alleged victims were 14. And the man they accuse is a household
name in Nova Scotia _ he governed it for eight years.
	   At 70, Gerald Regan remains one of the province's best-known
politicians. He was its premier from 1970-78, and later served in
the federal Cabinet.
	   But as the chief prosecutor said in opening arguments last
month, the trial is not about Regan's public life _ it is about
allegations of ``a very dark side of his private life.''
	   After sitting through five weeks of prosecution testimony _
including emotional accounts from the alleged victims _ Regan took
the stand in his own defense Tuesday.
	   He denied each charge against him _ that he raped a 14-year-old
girl in 1956, attempted to rape another 14-year-old a few months
later, and in 1969, while opposition leader in the Nova Scotia
legislature, tried to rape one of his office workers.
	   ``I certainly did not,'' Regan declared each time defense lawyer
Edward Greenspan asked if he had committed one of the assaults.
	   The charges were not filed until 1995; each accuser said she
lacked the confidence to press charges in the immediate aftermath
of the alleged attacks.
	   Canada has no statute of limitations for serious crimes such as
rape. In the past three years, a Roman Catholic bishop and a member
of Parliament have faced charges of sexually assaulting young
Indian women in the 1960s.
	   In the Regan case, the charges led to three years of legal
wrangling before the trial began Nov. 2. The case could go to the
jury by Thursday.
	   The first accuser, a 56-year-old woman now living in Quebec,
testified that Regan, then a 28-year-old lawyer and sportscaster,
raped her while driving her home in the summer of 1956.
	   The second accuser said Regan tried to rape her that winter
while driving her home from a skating rink. She said she fought him
off, threatening to tear up some wedding pictures in his car if he
persisted.
	   The third woman, 18 at the time of the alleged 1969 incident,
said Regan invited her into his office, exposed himself and forced
her to the floor.
	   With such a long lapse since the alleged crimes, and a lack of
corroborating evidence, cross-examination has focused on the
accuracy of witnesses' memories.
	   The second accuser, for example, admitted she had elaborated on
her account since her first police interview in 1993. But she
bristled when Greenspan suggested she and the first accuser jointly
fabricated their allegations.
	   ``I may have some of these facts wrong,'' the woman said. ``The
only thing I can say today is that in fact what happened to me when
I was 14 did happen. Mr. Regan picked me up and sexually abused me.
He changed my life and he ended my childhood, and I'm not going to
go away until there's something done about it.''
	   Greenspan noted the first accuser had been unable to locate for
police the roadside gravel pit where she allegedly was attacked.
	   ``You could drive up and down Highway 1 until the cows come
home, lady,'' Greenspan said. ``There was no pit and there was no
rape.''
	   But prosecutors later produced aerial photographs from the 1950s
showing there were several gravel pits in the area at the time.
	   The testimony has provided a close-up look at small-town life in
1950s Nova Scotia; the first two accusers lived at the time in
Windsor, population 3,000.
	   Skating parties were popular among Windsor teen-agers, One
witness said various townspeople, including Regan, would drive her
home from such parties.
	   ``There was nothing to be afraid of,'' she said.
	   Regan's wife, Carole, whom he wed in November 1956, testified on
Monday, recounting their honeymoon and other trips that took him
away from Windsor for much of the period in question.
	   She disputed testimony that she had been friends with the mother
of one accuser, even denying she once gave the mother a favorite
chowder recipe.
	   Regan has been accompanied to court regularly by at least one of
his six grown children, and he has been outgoing toward
acquaintances and the media.
	   ``No matter what's going on inside him, in the courtroom he's
very gregarious,'' said Stephen Kimber, a Halifax professor writing
a biography of Regan. ``He's a politician, and he plays that
role.''
	   Before Regan began testifying, Greenspan recalled the opening
prosecution salvo about his client.
	   ``This is not a Hollywood movie or a TV drama,'' Greenspan said.
``This case is not about dark sides... This is about justice.''

Eritrea acquires 10 Russian MiG-29s

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Russian MiG-29 jet fighter planes were
seen flying over Asmara this week, confirming speculation that the
Eritrean Air force had acquired as many as 10 of the aircraft as
its border dispute with Ethiopia continues to fester.
	   More than a dozen officials from the Russian Ministry of
Aviation Production have been in the Eritrean capital, along with
Russian pilots and technicians.
	   There has been no official comment on the additions to Eritrea's
air force, which greatly increase its power and range.
	   Eritrea is embroiled in a seven-month standoff in its border
dispute with its larger southern neighbor. There has been relative
calm since heavy battles in May and June, but both sides have been
importing millions of dollars worth of weaponry and reinforcing
their troops positions.
	   Earlier this month, Russia struck a deal to sell neighboring
Ethiopia fighter jets, combat helicopters, and other military
hardware.
	   The conflict prevention and resolution body of the Organization
of African Unity is to discuss the conflict when it meets Thursday
and Friday in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

Kenyan president pays his respects at Khomeini's tomb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi laid a
wreath Wednesday at the tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's
revolutionary leader, the official news agency reported.
	   Moi held talks with Iran's President Mohammad Khatami shortly
after his arrival in Tehran on Tuesday for a three-day visit.
	   In their talks, Khatami referred to the August bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi which killed 213 people, including a dozen
Americans, the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
	   Khatami said he longed for the day when there was no terrorism
in the world, IRNA reported.
	   The Kenyan ambassador to Tehran, Al-Haj Mohammed Soba, has said
that Kenya is studying the possibility of using Iran as a transit
route for the export of its goods to the former Soviet republics.

Anwar's adopted brother accuses police of brutality
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Anwar Trial
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police stripped and took naked
pictures of the adopted brother of Anwar Ibrahim to extract a
confession that Malaysia's former No. 2 leader had sodomized him, a
court heard Wednesday.
	   Sukma Dermawan, Anwar's adopted brother, said police broke down
his resolve by conducting a painful examination of his genitalia,
Anwar's lawyer, Christopher Fernando, told the court hearing
charges against Anwar on Wednesday.
	   The former deputy prime minister is currently facing trial on 10
charges of corruption and illegal sex acts.
	   ``The police took all types of body hair from Sukma, and
conducted an anal test on him, which hurt him very much,'' said
Fernando, reading excerpts of an undated letter Sukma had written
from jail shortly after he pleaded guilty in September to allowing
himself to be sodomized by Anwar.
	   Fernando submitted the letter as an exhibit to support the
defense team's contention that police were enmeshed in a high-level
conspiracy to topple Anwar.
	   Sukma, 38, is serving a six-month sentence, along with Anwar's
speech writer, Munawar Ahmad Anees, who also pleaded guilty to
having sex with Anwar.
	   Both men are now appealing their convictions after saying police
had coerced the confessions.
	   On Wednesday, Fernando's repeated attempts to question a police
witness about whether he was involved in humiliating Sukma drew
furious protests from prosecutors.
	   ``Your Lordship has bent backwards for the defense, allowing
them to ask all these questions,'' leading prosecutor Abdul Gani
Patail told presiding judge Augustine Paul. ``There has to be a
limit to all this.''
	   Judge Paul then barred the defense team from posing any further
questions to the prosecution's witness, senior police officer Musa
Hassan.
	   Minutes before the hearing adjourned on Wednesday, Abdul Gani
threatened to undermine the defense's assertions that police forced
Sukma to fabricate evidence against Anwar.
	   ``In view of what the defense is doing, I'll like to inform the
court that I'll be bringing in rebuttal evidence that includes
video tapes,'' Abdul Gani said.

Court rules that Kurdish leader free to leave country
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with various scenarios possible for Ocalan; ADDS
background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court Wednesday lifted restrictions on
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, leaving him free to leave the
country.
	   The ruling followed a decision by Germany to withdraw the
international arrest warrant it had issued for Ocalan, who was
wanted on terrorism charges, news reports said.
	   Ocalan had been staying in a Rome villa, but was kept under
police surveillance and was barred from leaving the city.
	   The leader of the Kurdistan Workers party, or PKK, was detained
in Rome on Nov. 12 when he arrived on a flight from Moscow.
	   He is wanted in his home country of Turkey for trial on
terrorism charges. But Italy refuses to return him to Turkey, where
he faces a possible death sentence, sparking tensions between the
two countries and prompting an unofficial boycott of Italian
products by Turks.
	   It is not clear what will happen next.
	   Ocalan has asked Italy for political asylum, but the country's
center-left government, led by former Communist Massimo D'Alema, is
split over what to do.
	   Italy has indicated it might try Ocalan or expel him to a third
country. Those mentioned include Pakistan, Libya and North Korea.
Italy on Wednesday denied reports that it planned to send Ocalan to
Albania.
	   Italy has also appealed to the European Union to help it set up
an international tribunal to try the Kurdish rebel.
	   The United States has repeatedly said that Ocalan needs to be
brought to justice for his terrorism crimes.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's rebel
group began fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in 1984.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Park
Chan-ho pitched a four-hitter and his teammates rapped out 14 hits
as South Korea trounced Japan 13-1 Wednesday for the baseball gold
medal of the Asian Games.
	   Park needed to pitch only seven innings under baseball's mercy
rule, which shortens games to that limit if one team is leading by
10 runs. He struck out four and walked two.
	   Earlier, Taiwan defeated cross-strait rival China 10-6 for the
bronze medal, breaking the game open with a seven-run seventh
inning.
	   Japan's only run was a first-inning homer by Kokichi Akune.
	   By the end of that inning, the Korean ``dream team,'' laden with
professionals, led 2-0 on a double and an error.
	   The Koreans added four more in the second on an RBI single, a
bases-loaded walk, a ground-out and a wild pitch.
	   After designated hitter Park Jae-hong doubled home two runs in
the third, Japan turned to its second reliever of the game, sidearm
pitcher Hitoshi Miyata. The first batter he faced, Kim Dong-joo,
doubled home Park, who went 3-for-4 and batted in three runs,
making it 9-1.
	   The Koreans added four runs in the fifth, capped by Cho
In-sung's two-run single.
	   Masahiro Kimura, who gave up four hits, three walks and five
earned runs in 1 1/3 innings, took the loss. He was one of four
Japanese pitchers for the six innings in which the South Koreans
batted.
	   When the game was halted after the top of the seventh, ecstatic
Korean players tossed several of their teammates into the air,
starting with Park Chan-ho. Then they ran a victory lap around the
field carrying two large Korean flags.
	   The team was backed by a large and loud contingent of fans,
including an organized group called the Korea Han-kyoreh cheer
team, whose activities are meant to back reunification of South
Korea with isolationist North Korea.
	   Against a weaker Chinese side in Tuesday's semifinals, South
Korea's Kim Byung-hyun pitched six innings of hitless relief,
striking out 12, in a 9-2 victory.
	   China took a 2-0 fourth-inning lead in Wednesday's bronze medal
game, but Taiwan, famed for its Little League world titles, shot to
a 10-2 lead with three runs in the sixth and the big seventh.
	   In the seventh, Chen Chih-yuan singled in one run, another
scored on a double steal, Pan Chung-wei doubled home two, Lin
Kun-han hit a two-run homer, and Yang Sun-huan doubled in the last
one after China had brought in its second reliever, Lu Jiangang.
	   China scored four in the botttom of the seventh, and the last
two innings were scoreless.
	   Hsu Ming-chieh, who came on in relief of starter Chuan Chin-Her
in the fourth inning, picked up the victory. He gave up five hits
and three earned runs in 5 2/3 innings.
	   The loser was Zhang Wanjun, China's first of two relievers, who
yielded five hits and three earned runs.

Belarusian president in Moscow to push for closer union
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko flew to
Moscow on Wednesday to push one of his favorite projects, a closer
union with Russia.
	   Lukashenko shrugged off Belarus' huge debts for Russian gas
supplies, saying he intended to discuss only political issues
during the Moscow talks.
	   ``We should think not only about the economy and debts, which
are the issues everyone wants us to focus on, in detriment to other
matters,'' Lukashenko said upon arriving in the Russian capital.
``The talks in Moscow will be exclusively of a political
character.''
	   Lukashenko plans to meet Thursday with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, who remained at a country residence Wednesday,
recuperating from his latest illness.
	   The authoritarian Belarusian leader, openly nostalgic for the
Soviet Union, has urged closer political integration and dual
citizenship since Russia and Belarus signed a union treaty in 1996.
The move strengthened ties, but stopped well short of merging the
two nations.
	   Lukashenko refused to divulge details about his planned talks
with Yeltsin, but said ``we may go even further'' than the union
treaty envisages.
	   Russia has been less enthusiastic than Lukashenko about the idea
of a union. Russia, with nearly 150 million people, is plagued by
economic and social problems, while Belarus, with about 10 million
people, is even poorer.
	   Belarus has been suffering from food shortages, and has
introduced food rationing in some regions.
	   Still, Russia views Belarus as an important ally. Both countries
are adamantly opposed to NATO's expansion into East European.

Report: East Timor rebel wants vote after decade of autonomy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with hostage fears, grafs 3,5; One name correct for
Suharto

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Jailed East Timor rebel leader Xanana
Gusmao says a referendum on full independence need not be held for
at least a decade if Indonesia grants autonomy to his troubled
homeland, the official Antara news agency reported Wednesday.
	   Separately, a visiting United Nations envoy expressed fears that
an upsurge in violence could disrupt a new peace process for the
half-island territory.
	   Earlier in a two-page, handwritten letter sent to Portuguese
state radio RDP, Gusmao said he had reasons to believe that radical
elements of the East Timor's resistance might be planning to take
U.N. diplomat Jamsheed Marker hostage, to press their case for
independence.
	   Gusmao said this would be an act of terrorism that could only
damage East Timor's fight for self-determination, RDP said
Wednesday.
	   Marker arrived in Indonesia on Tuesday and is to visit East
Timor this weekend. He was not immediately available for comment.
	   Indonesia has offered to grant autonomy to East Timor, but has
flatly rejected demands by pro-independence activists that a
referendum be held.
	   In an apparent compromise, Gusmao suggested it would be better
if at least 10 years of autonomy passed before East Timor's 800,000
people voted on whether to be part of or break away from Indonesia,
Antara reported.
	   ``What East Timor's population needs now is a formal decision
that does not corner them,'' he said of U.N.-sponsored negotiations
now being held between Indonesia and Portugal, East Timor's former
colonial master.
	   Meanwhile Marker called on the Indonesian military and East
Timorese rebel forces to show restraint in the territory invaded by
Indonesia in 1975.
	   The long-running talks between Indonesia and Portugal were
revitalized earlier this year when Jakarta made its autonomy offer
in exchange for international recognition of its sovereignty over
East Timor.
	   The change in Indonesia's policy toward East Timor followed the
resignation last May of longtime autocratic President Suharto who
ordered the invasion 23 years ago and refused to compromise on its
status.
	   East Timor has been wracked by guerrilla war and human rights
abuses since it was annexed as Indonesia's 27th province in 1976.
	   Clashes between guerrillas and Indonesian troops have increased
in recent weeks. Protests by pro-independence activists have also
risen in size and frequency.
	   Despite the rising violence, Antara quoted Gusmao as saying he
hoped East Timor's troubles might be solved after Indonesia holds
elections next year as part of a push for political reform.
	   The sprawling Southeast Asian nation is now enduring its worst
economic and political turmoil in 30 years.
	   ``Indonesia has many problems that should be solved immediately,
not only the problem of East Timor,'' Gusmao said.
	   He described Habibie's six-month-old government as more
``moderate'' than Suharto's regime.
	   His comments were made in a joint interview in a Jakarta prison
with Antara and LUSA, the national news agency of Portugal.
	   The two agencies last Saturday signed an agreement to cooperate
as part of wider moves to heal a diplomatic rift between the two
nations.
	   Gusmao is serving a 20-year sentence for leading a bloody
guerrilla war against Indonesian troops.
	   Despite his imprisonment, he is regarded internationally as a
key player in moves to secure peace for East Timor.
	   Marker who will hold talks with Habibie next week, is scheduled
to meet Gusmao on Thursday.

Former jockey jailed for race fixing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A former apprentice jockey was jailed after
admitting he accepted bribes in exchange for fixing two horse
races, anti-corruption officials said Wednesday.
	   Magistrate Tong Man gave Keith Kwok, 24, a six-month jail term
for accepting bribes of 180,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
23,000) to fix the races in 1996, the Independent Commission
Against Corruption said in a statement.
	   In a race in March, 1996, Chin Kin-ming, who was an apprentice
jockey at the time, paid Kwok about 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 12,800) to ensure Kwok's horse, Fit for Royalty, would not
finish in the first three places, the statement said. He finished
in fourth place.
	   Chin later became one of the territory's top jockeys.
	   Kwok's lawyers said he came from a poor family and had to
support his parents, brother, sister, and grandmother in mainland
China with his 300,000 Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 38,400) salary.
	   He was sidelined twice during his career due to injuries,
government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Kwok is to repay the bribe money to the Hong Kong Jockey Club,
which operates Hong Kong horse racing, the statement said.
	   On Tuesday, anti-corruption officials arrested 11 others,
including former and current jockeys, in connection with the race
rigging. Among them is Sherie Kong, one of the first two women
jockeys to win a license in Hong Kong.
	   Choi Chun-wai, 27, and Chan Ka-chun, 22, also were charged
Wednesday with conspiring with Chin to rig the race. Their cases
were adjourned until Dec. 23.
	   Earlier this year, a Hong Kong court sentenced a businessman to
3 1/2 years in jail after he was found guilty of offering bribes to
jockeys to fix horse races.

Kosovo's Rugova receives Sakharov peace prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) - Ibrahim Rugova, leader of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, was awarded the European Parliament's Sakharov
peace prize on Wednesday for his efforts to find a peaceful outcome
to the province's drive for independence.
	   Rugova, who was selected for the prize in October, received the
award during a ceremony in Strasbourg, where the Parliament is
holding its monthly session.
	   ``This prize represents, for me and for the people of Kosovo, an
important recognition of our pacifist struggle and of our
sacrifices,'' the 54-year old Rugova told the European parliament.
	   Kosovo's population is almost 90 percent ethnic Albanian, many
of whom want independence or at least union with next-door Albania.
	   Rugova was elected as head of the biggest Albanian party, the
pro-independence League of Democratic Kosovo, in 1989, when
Belgrade revoked Kosovo's nearly two decades of autonomy.
	   Rugova was overwhelmingly elected president of Kosovo in 1992
and again last March. But Serbian authorities have always refused
to recognize the new state.
	   Instead of ruling, Rugova poured his efforts into organizing an
unusual parallel state with separate schools, medical and civic
institutions.
	   ``During the past decade, we have managed to build a true
civilian society in Kosovo,'' Rugova told European deputies.
	   He warned that the situation in Kosovo remains serious, despite
a shaky ceasefire negotiated last October under which Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw much of his troops
from the province.
	   ``Let me underline that independence, with guarantees for the
Serb population, is the best solution for Kosovo ... Only
independence will enable to ensure peace and stability in this part
of Europe,'' he said.
	   Rugova suggested that Kosovo could become an international
protectorate for a transitional period leading to independence.
	   The European Union supports autonomy for the province, but not
independence.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Benjamin Netanyahu's refusal to move the peace
process forward has frustrated U.S. President Bill Clinton and
angered the Palestinians _ and might not be enough to save his
government from collapse next week.
	   Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's
three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day
earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops in the West Bank on
Friday, as stipulated by the Wye River peace accord.
	   ``This is a clear violation of the agreement,'' said Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, returning to Gaza from Cairo, where he had
briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Clinton visit. ``I
dont think that the American administration and President Clinton
will agree to this.''

Riot erupts in Indonesian town after bus drivers go on strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 26 arrested, graf 3

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A three-day strike by public transport
drivers degenerated into a riot when mobs threw rocks and looted
shops in Samarinda on the island of Borneo on Wednesday, police and
witnesses said.
	   Thousands of passengers, angry about being stranded, joined the
melee.
	   Local Police commander Tomy Sagiman said 26 people were
detained. There were no reports of injuries.
	   Shops and offices in the city of 450,000 people were closed as
mobs burned piles of tires in the streets.
	   Police said thousands of people choked the main avenue of
Samarinda, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles) northeast of Jakarta.
	   Hundreds of police and troops with sticks and shields confronted
mobs, said one officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Bus and van drivers went on strike on Monday in protest over the
high cost of spare parts for their vehicles.
	   Wednesday's violence was the latest in a series of sporadic
riots that have erupted across Indonesia.
	   The sprawling Southeast Asian nation is enduring its worst
economic crisis in 30 years. The official inflation rate is about
80 percent. Unemployment has skyrocketed as debt-burdened
businesses close down.
	   The government says just under half Indonesia's 202 million
people now live in poverty.
	   The violence has been matched by a rise in protests against the
government of President B.J. Habibie. He has promised to conduct
parliamentary elections next June and a president ballot after
that.
	   However, students say his reform agenda is too slow and too
conservative. They also want Habibie's predecessor ex-President
Suharto to be put on trial for corruption.
	   Suharto ended 32 years of autocratic rule when he quit last May
after a wave of student protests and riots claimed about 1,200
lives.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors evacuated Baghdad on
Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. arms inspector said Iraq had
reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed the Iraq crisis with
U.S. President Bill Clinton in a 15-minute phone call late Tuesday,
a spokesman for Blair in London said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency arrived in Bahrain Wednesday
afternoon.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain. ``There
is nobody left behind.''
	   In Baghdad, a U.N. spokesman said no decision had been made on
withdrawing the 400 U.N. humanitarian monitors from Iraq.
	   George Somerwill added, however, that they were prepared to
leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast Wednesday
and began playing patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos
training with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Swiss President Flavio Cotti met Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Wednesday and signed a joint statement
on technological and financial cooperation.
	   ``The main signal which I want to send is that we are interested
in an inflow of capital into Russia,'' Primakov said after the pair
signed the agreement. ``We will unconditionally establish favorable
conditions for that to take place.''
	   Primakov stressed the importance of Russia's relations with
Switzerland and joked over the Swiss policy of electing presidents
for only one year.
	   ``Excuse me if I sound like I am interfering into your domestic
Swiss affairs, but I'm really disappointed that you have presidents
for only one year at a time,'' he said.
	   Cotti, who arrived in the Russian capital from St. Petersburg in
the morning, will wrap up his three-day visit on Thursday, when he
is scheduled to meet with President Boris Yeltsin, Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov and other Russian leaders.
	   In St. Petersburg, Cotti told regional officials that Swiss
private industry remains interested in Russian markets despite
Russia's financial woes.
	   Cotti, accompanied to Moscow by a number of Swiss business
leaders, reiterated his call for closer economic cooperation in an
interview published on Wednesday in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
	   ``We, the Swiss people, continue to believe in the huge economic
potential of Russia,'' he said.
	   `We hope that Russia will continue economic reforms and create
proper conditions for investors to make profits,'' he said. ``I
don't see any reason to doubt the long-term prospects of economic
cooperation with Russia.''

Legislators walk out of chamber to protest `roll back of democracy'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Pro-democracy politicians walked out of a
legislative meeting Wednesday to protest a government proposal to
appoint some district council members rather than holding open
elections.
	   Under the proposal, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa would appoint
one in five positions on the district boards, a move liberal
legislators criticize as a rollback of democracy. Voters would
elect the other members.
	   ``At the end of this century, when the whole world is going
forward (towards democracy), Mr. Tung is leading Hong Kong in the
opposite direction,'' Martin Lee, chairman of the opposition
Democratic Party, the territory's most popular, told Radio Hong
Kong.
	   ``We cannot possibly tolerate this.''
	   Michael Suen, the territory's secretary for constitutional
affairs, told legislators the proposal would help the government
``attract some individuals who are enthusiastic and interested in
district affairs'' but do not want to campaign for office.
	   Lee said he would try to block passage of the government
proposal when it comes before the legislature early next year.
	   The 18 district boards in the territory advise the government on
local affairs and have limited budgets and administrative powers.
	   Earlier this year, Tung also announced he would abolish two
municipal councils, which also were democratically elected before
China regained sovereignty over the former British colony in July,
1997.
	   After the handover, the government added appointed officials _
many of them losers in the previous elections _ to the councils to
give a majority to conservatives friendly to Beijing.
	   Beijing also replaced the legislature elected under British
rule, which was dominated by pro-democracy politicians, with one
controlled by pro-business and pro-Beijing conservatives. A new
legislature was elected in May.
	   Under the constitution, only a portion of the seats will be
filled through democratic elections before the year 2007.
	   The Democrats won a majority of the votes in the May elections,
but remain a minority voice in the legislature.
	   Tung, a former shipping tycoon, was handpicked by Beijing to
lead the post-handover Hong Kong.
	   Despite the handover, the Beijing communist government has
generally left civil liberties in Hong Kong unchanged.

German Disl wins women's 15K
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSRBLIE, Slovakia (AP) _ Uschi Disl of Germany captured her
second consecutive biathlon World Cup victory when she overcame a
shooting error and won a 15-kilometer competition Wednesday.
	   ``I never thought I'd get away with only one shooting mistake,''
said the 28-year-old, who won the relay gold medal with Germany at
the Nagano Olympics in February.
	   Disl, a five-time world champion, posted a time of 44 minutes,
34.2 seconds, including a one-minute penalty for one missed target,
from the prone position on the first stop at the shooting range.
	   Albina Achatova of Russia went perfect in shooting and took
second place in 45:56.5.
	   Magdalena Forsberg of Sweden retained her World Cup lead after
four events when she finished third, in 46:14.0. Forsberg, the
defending World Cup champion, lost the victory by missing two
targets on the final shooting stop, from the standing position.
	   Disl, who won her 16th career World Cup event, now has 98
points, while Forsberg leads with 110.
	   Biathlon combines cross-country skiing with target shooting. In
the 15K event, the racers make four stops at the range, shooting
twice from the prone and twice from the standing position.

Former jockey jailed for race fixing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug and coding

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A former apprentice jockey was jailed after
admitting he accepted bribes in exchange for fixing two horse
races, anti-corruption officials said Wednesday.
	   Magistrate Tong Man gave Keith Kwok, 24, a six-month jail term
for accepting bribes of 180,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
23,000) to fix the races in 1996, the Independent Commission
Against Corruption said in a statement.
	   In a race in March, 1996, Chin Kin-ming, who was an apprentice
jockey at the time, paid Kwok about 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 12,800) to ensure Kwok's horse, Fit for Royalty, would not
finish in the first three places, the statement said. He finished
in fourth place.
	   Chin later became one of the territory's top jockeys.
	   Kwok's lawyers said he came from a poor family and had to
support his parents, brother, sister, and grandmother in mainland
China with his 300,000 Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 38,400) salary.
	   He was sidelined twice during his career due to injuries,
government-run Radio Hong Kong reported.
	   Kwok is to repay the bribe money to the Hong Kong Jockey Club,
which operates Hong Kong horse racing, the statement said.
	   On Tuesday, anti-corruption officials arrested 11 others,
including former and current jockeys, in connection with the race
rigging. Among them is Sherie Kong, one of the first two women
jockeys to win a license in Hong Kong.
	   Choi Chun-wai, 27, and Chan Ka-chun, 22, also were charged
Wednesday with conspiring with Chin to rig the race. Their cases
were adjourned until Dec. 23.
	   Earlier this year, a Hong Kong court sentenced a businessman to
3 1/2 years in jail after he was found guilty of offering bribes to
jockeys to fix horse races.

Legal tug-of-war between tribunal, Belgrade heads for showdown

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
is planning a courtroom showdown with Belgrade authorities in a
legal tug-of-war over three Serb officers indicted for allegedly
ordering a 1991 massacre.
	   Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour said Wednesday she would
send four staff members to attend a Belgrade military court case
Thursday at which the officers are due to testify as witnesses.
	   ``We will request from the court that they be detained and
transferred to The Hague,'' Arbour said, adding that she was ready
to put the officers on trial as soon as possible.
	   The three Serbs, Veselin Sljivancanin, Miroslav Radic and Milan
Mrksic, are accused in a 1995 tribunal indictment of ordering the
1991 massacre of 261 Croats taken out of a hospital in Vukovar in
eastern Croatia.
	   The military court president has requested the tribunal's files
on the three men, which form the basis for their U.N. indictment.
The court is investigating the massacre, but has no suspects.
	   Arbour said there was no question of turning over the tribunal's
evidence, which includes testimony of the sole survivor of the
massacre.
	   At her request, tribunal judges last week ordered Yugoslav
authorities to halt their investigation and send any evidence they
have against the officers to The Hague along with the officers.
	   Under international law, the tribunal has the power to take over
cases from domestic courts. National governments are obliged to
cooperate with such requests within 60 days.
	   Yugoslav authorities argue that their constitution bars them
from sending the men to The Hague for U.N. trial.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police fired tear gas and used batons
to beat protesting students who threw rocks at soldiers near
Jakarta's presidential palace on Wednesday when a rioting mob also
looted Chinese-owned shops in a provincial town.
	   About 1,300 students protested in central Jakarta.
	   Three groups tried separately to march on the ornate
white-columned mansion, but were blocked by security personnel.
	   At least three students were hospitalized and dozens more
sustained minor injuries.
	   Riot squads fought with about 500 protesters who entered the
grounds of the Defense Ministry about 400 meters (yards) from the
palace.
	   Both sides threw rocks and bricks at one another.
	   Some students smashed street lamps and street signs and
overturned large ornamental potted plants on the roadside.
	   About two dozen protesters were dragged into military trucks and
taken away. Some were bleeding, witnesses said.
	   Police said they were being detained at Jakarta's police
headquarters.
	   The violence was the latest in a series of clashes between
students and security forces in recent weeks as political turmoil
in the world's fourth most populous nation continues to boil.
	   On Nov. 13 security forces shot nine students to death when
thousands of protesters tried to march on the Parliament.
	   Wednesday's crackdown came after the military warned students
not to demonstrate near the palace.
	   The protests took place even though President B.J. Habibie was
in Hanoi attending a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
	   The students demanded that the powerful military get out of
politics and that ex-President Suharto be tried for corruption.
	   A wave of student protests and riots forced Suharto to quit in
May after 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   Graft allegations against him are now being investigated by
state lawyers. But he has not been charged. Suharto has denied any
wrongdoing.
	   Separately on Wednesday, a strike by public transport drivers
degenerated into a riot when mobs threw rocks and looted
Chinese-owned shops in Samarinda on the island of Borneo.
	   Thousands of passengers, angry about being stranded, joined the
melee, witnesses said. Some protesters burned tires in the street.
	   Police said 26 people were detained. There were no immediate
reports of injuries in the city about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
northeast of Jakarta.
	   Ethnic Chinese shopkeepers are often targeted by mobs when
violence flares in Indonesia as it grapples with its worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   Earlier in Jakarta, soldiers and police in anti-riot gear
blocked another group of 150 students from marching to the palace
by placing razor wire on a street about 150 meters (yards) from the
building.
	   Four armored vehicles were moved into position and six military
trucks unloaded guards equipped with shields and batons.
	   A banner unfurled by the students said: ``Put Suharto on trial.
Form a new government.''
	   The students also repeatedly chanted ``reform or revolution.''
	   Later several hundred students congregated near the heavily
guarded National Monument in a park adjacent to the palace. But
they were corralled by security forces.
	   In another part of Jakarta, about 700 students shook the
wrought-iron gates of Indonesia's attorney general's office
demanding that Suharto be taken to court immediately.
	   Some students threw garbage at police guarding the building. But
officers did not respond.
	   The office is in charge of investigating Suharto.
	   State lawyers quizzed Suharto soon after his resignation six
months ago, but said they failed to find any evidence against him.
	   However, Habibie, Suharto's successor, ordered a new
investigation after accusations that the initial probe had been too
soft.
	   Last week state prosecutors questioned the 77-year-old ex-leader
about his wealth.

Turkish freigths sinks off Israeli coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A Turkish cargo ship sank off Israel on
Wednesday and was abandoned by its crew.
	   The 1,000 ton freighter Dogruyolar had just left the Israeli
port of Haifa with a cargo of cement and was headed south along the
coast when its engine room began to fill up with water, said Haifa
port spokesman Yossi Rosenthal.
	   After the ship sent out a distress signal, the nine crew members
were rescued by Israeli coast guard and naval vessels, said Hakan
Abaci, an official at the Turkish Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   The cause of the massive leak was not immediately known.

budget &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ At the ``Red Snake,'' a smoky bar
where actors linger for hours over tripe soup and pork steak while
being serenaded by Gypsy minstrels, the management is anxiously
counting its chairs.
	   It's not because any are missing but because soon the bar may
not be able to afford many: Under a draft law dreamed up by Finance
Minister Decebal Traian Remes to fill gaps in the budget,
restaurants, bars and cake shops would have to pay an annual tax of
dlrs 25 per chair.
	   In Romania, where 35 percent of the economy is estimated to be
underground, some have praised the idea, which needs government
approval before it becomes effective.
	   But in one county in southern Romania, restaurateurs and bar
owners already have found a way to get around the tax: They're
replacing their chairs with benches.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors evacuated Baghdad on
Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. arms inspector said Iraq had
reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed the Iraq crisis with
U.S. President Bill Clinton in a 15-minute phone call late Tuesday,
a spokesman for Blair in London said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency arrived in Bahrain Wednesday
afternoon.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain. ``There
is nobody left behind.''
	   In Baghdad, a U.N. spokesman said no decision had been made on
withdrawing the 400 U.N. humanitarian monitors from Iraq.
	   George Somerwill added, however, that they were prepared to
leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast Wednesday
and began playing patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos
training with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed the report by
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler as ``full of lies'' and said
it was ``intended to trigger an American and British military
strike on Iraq.''
	   He said the withdrawal of the inspectors ``means again that the
Special Commission is a tool in America's hand to implement its
policy of aggression.'' His remarks were carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said air strikes could come
quickly and without warning.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused Butler of
overstepping his authority by ordering the evacuation of
inspectors. He called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting,
ITAR-Tass news agency reported in Moscow.
	   Ivanov was in Madrid on Wednesday for a peace conference on
Bosnia. Russia has consistently opposed military action against
Iraq.
	   The U.S. has 22 warships and 201 aircraft in the region,
including 72 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
	   Eight of the warships carry cruise missiles.
	   Britain has 22 strike aircraft in the region.
	   Iraq had pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors and
allow unfettered access to sites and documents on Nov. 14, under
threat of U.S. and British air strikes.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge that made it impossible for him to assure that Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security
Council can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler said Iraq's claim that it does not possess banned weapons
or the ability to make them ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   He said inspectors were not able to gain access to the
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid
evidence of the presence of proscribed materials.''
	   At two other sites, negotiations ultimately cleared the way for
inspections, he said. But one building had been emptied of relevant
materials, and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any
disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   ``It remains the commission's strong view that, under the
present circumstances, relevant documentation must exist in Iraq
and that provision of such documentation is the best hope for
revealing the full picture'' of Iraqi weapons programs, he said.

Singapore PM says Indonesia risks chaos before polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in an
interview to be published Thursday that there is a big risk
Indonesia will break apart before next June's elections.
	   ``There may be a need for somebody to take charge to ensure that
there will be law and order,'' Goh said in an interview for the
latest issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review. ``Otherwise, the
whole country may break up, and if that happens, elections may not
take place.''
	   ``I think there is a big risk over there if the economy does not
recover; poverty, unemployment, lawlessness,'' Goh said.
	   ``And off course, I would expect violence in the run-up to the
elections. But you must have elections to throw up a government
which Indonesians would accept,'' he said. Indonesia is scheduled
to hold presidential elections in June.
	   Turning to Malaysia, Goh said the neighboring country is
politically stable and is in a much stronger position now than it
has been. ``Capital controls have helped Malaysia in the short
term,'' he said.
	   ``Malaysia has strong political institutions. I think change can
take place in Malaysia without big problems,'' Goh said. ``Of
course, at the moment, the uncertainty is who will come up after''
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir fired his chosen successor, Anwar Ibrahim, in
September.
	   Goh said he himself expects to remain in power beyond the
Singaporean elections in 2002, but will recruit more younger,
talented politicians to the Cabinet.
	   ``Then after the next election, I will be in a position to
decide, once there's a team ready,'' Goh said. ``I will then
reshape my role so that the team will have more responsibilities,
will have bigger public exposure to do things. And I would begin
to, shall we say, take a more backseat role.''

Rebel forces increase pressure on besieged Angolan city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces Wednesday attacked Angolan
army positions on the outskirts of Kuito, resuming their offensive
against the strategic central highland city after a day of relative
calm, according to news reports.
	   The UNITA rebels moved on Cunji, seven kilometers (four miles)
outside Kuito, shortly before daybreak, the private radio station
Radio Eclesia reported from the city, which lies about 500
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda.
	   Cunji is located on high ground overlooking Kuito. Its capture
would give the rebels a vantage point for artillery fire on the
center of the city whose former population of 100,000 has been
swollen by thousands of displaced people fleeing fighting in the
surrounding area.
	   Battles have focused on Bie province, whose capital is Kuito,
since fighting between the two sides restarted Dec. 4, ending a
four-year peace pact in the former Portuguese colony.
	   Kuito reportedly was mostly calm Tuesday.
	   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon said he expected the group's
leadership inside Angola to issue a statement on the peace accord
in the coming days.
	   The spokesman, Rui Oliveira, said the military situation in Bie
province was ``muddled.''
	   An International Red Cross spokesman in Luanda said the airport
at Huambo, the country's second-largest city, 110 kilometers (70
miles) west of Kuito, was closed to civilian flights.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the U.N.-brokered
1994 peace agreement that was supposed to end a two-decade civil
war that broke out after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

Jailed E. Timor rebel leader warns of threat against U.N. envoy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The jailed leader of East Timor's rebels
says he has information that radicals in the territory may be
planning to take a U.N. envoy hostage to draw attention to their
campaign for independence, according to a news report Wednesday.
	   In a two-page, handwritten letter sent to Portuguese state radio
RDP, Xanana Gusmao warned extremist groups against taking radical
action against U.N. envoy Jamsheed Marker, who arrived Tuesday in
the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
	   Gusmao, who is jailed in Jakarta, said that taking Marker
hostage would be ``an act of terrorism'' that could only damage
East Timor's fight for independence from Indonesia, according to
RDP.
	   There were no more details of the supposed kidnapping plan.
	   Marker was to meet Gusmao on Thursday and then travel some 1,900
kilometers (1,200) miles) to East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony, at the weekend.
	   The United Nations, which still regards Portugal as the
administering power in the half-island territory, is brokering
negotiations between Lisbon and Jakarta over East Timor's political
future.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in December 1975, after Portugal's
colonial rule ended, and annexed it a month later. Since then a
small band of separatist guerrillas _ formerly led by Gusmao _ have
been fighting Indonesian troops.

Arafat: Palestinians have a ``natural right'' to declare a state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS day in lead; no pickup

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinians have a ``natural right'' to
declare a state next May, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said
here Wednesday.
	   Speaking to reporters in Cairo after briefing Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak on U.S. Presidential Bill Clinton's visit to the
region, Arafat referred to the first Israel-Palestinian accord,
signed in 1993, as the base line of the peace process.
	   ``It is known that the Oslo agreement, which we signed at the
White House under the supervision of President Clinton, had five
years as a transitional period. This period ends on May 4, 1999
and, after that, it is our natural right to declare our independent
state,'' Arafat said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that any
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state would kill the peace
process.
	   A summit between Arafat, Clinton and Netanyahu on the
Israeli-Gaza Strip border on Tuesday failed to produce an Israeli
commitment to withdraw on schedule from more West Bank land.
	   Palestinians have accused Israel of wrecking Clinton's bid to
salvage the Wye River interim peace accord that the president
helped to negotiate in October.
	   Addressing the same news conference as Arafat, Mubarak said the
Wye accord would be fulfilled eventually.
	   ``I am confident that this agreement will be implemented,
whether one of the sides is satisfied or not. This is inevitable if
we want peace and stability in the region.''

Spanish lawyers concede Amnesty links, but say no Pinochet bias
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with morning arguments; trims pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for the Spanish government acknowledged
Wednesday that a judge linked to Amnesty International who ruled
against Gen. Augusto Pinochet has liberal views, but said these did
not sway him against the former Chilean dictator.
	   ``Some of your Lordships tend to take a more conservative
approach and some a more liberal approach to matters concerning
human rights,'' lawyer Alun Jones told a five-judge tribunal in the
House of Lords, Britain's highest court.
	   Discussion in British courts of the political views of judges is
highly unusual, underlining the uniqueness of the case, in which
Pinochet's lawyers seek to nullify a 3-2 ruling that he has no
immunity from prosecution as a former foreign head of state.
	   The 83-year-old general was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a
Spanish extradition warrant accusing him of genocide and other
crimes against humanity committed during his 17-year reign.
	   An official Chilean report says some 3,000 people were killed by
secret police after he overthrew an elected Marxist in 1973.
	   Pinochet's lawyers had asserted Tuesday, the start of this
week's two-day hearing, that the Lords' Nov. 25 ruling denying him
immunity should be overturned because one judge, Lord Justice
Leonard Hoffmann, is the director of Amnesty International's
fundraising arm.
	   In addition, Hoffmann's wife, Gillian, has worked since 1977 in
Amnesty's London office.
	   The human rights group says the Hoffmanns, South African
opponents of apartheid who came to Britain in the '60s, played no
part in its 25-year campaign to put Pinochet on trial.
	   ``He is hostile to the notion that people may be tortured, that
people may be abducted and murdered by forces representing a
controlling state, and he is therefore wholly favorable to the aims
of Amnesty International,'' Jones said Wednesday of Hoffmann.
	   ``These are uncontroversial aims,'' Jones added.
	   Both sides acknowledged, however, that a key question is why
Hoffmann did not disclose his close ties with Amnesty before the
first hearing, as is routine with judges.
	   Hoffmann has never commented publicly on the controversy.
	   Pinochet's lawyers returned to the Lords after failing to
persuade the British Cabinet member with the final say on
extradition, Home Secretary Jack Straw, that Hoffmann was biased.
	   Straw ruled Dec. 9 that Spain can start extradition proceedings
in the courts.
	   The process could take months or longer as Pinochet, under
police guard in a rented mansions 20 miles (30 kms) west of London,
fights every legal step.
	   Spain's lawyers maintain that the latest move in the Lords is a
desperate attempt by Pinochet to avoid extradition. They also
argued that the general's lawyers should have known of Hoffmann's
Amnesty links before the hearing.
	   In February, the head of the judiciary, Lord Irvine, sent a
letter to law firms and advocates in England endorsing an Amnesty
building fund appeal by Hoffmann, described as the head of Amnesty
International Charity.
	   Kingsley Napley, Pinochet's London law firm, pledged 1,000
pounds (dlrs 1,600) to the fund, but apparently made no connection
when Hoffmann was picked for the Pinochet tribunal.

Thai soccer miracle ends; South Koreans celebrate victories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kuwait soccer victory, South Korean baseball
gold, other late medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kuwait ended Thailand's ``miracle'' run
in Asian Games soccer Wednesday, scoring even before the Thais
touched the ball in a semifinal some fans in the host nation
couldn't bear to watch to the end.
	   That left the day's major celebrating to the South Koreans. U.S.
Major League pitcher Park Chan-ho led his team to a 13-1 trouncing
of archrival Japan for the baseball gold medal, and Kim Taek-soo
upset China's Liu Guoliang for the men's singles gold in table
tennis.
	   ``I am the champion,'' the elated Kim said, after leaping into
the air and then into his coach's arms. He had stopped a Chinese
sweep of all seven table tennis golds.
	   The Korean baseball team tossed Park and several other players
in the air, and ran a victory lap with two large Korean flags.
	   But at the 60,000-seat soccer stadium, which had been filled to
overflowing, some fans threw water bottles toward the field and
many more left early, unable to bear the final minutes of the
Thais' 3-0 loss to Kuwait.
	   In the first 28 seconds, Kuwait back Nohyr al-Shammari took the
ball down the flank and floated it across to the far post, where
Husain al-Khodhari headed past Thai goalie Chaiyong Khumpiam for
the first goal.
	   In the other semifinal, Iran frustrated China yet again, winning
1-0 and setting up an all-Middle Eastern final. China was weakened
by the absence of star striker Hao Haidong and its English coach,
Bobby Houghton, both serving suspensions.
	   Iran's striker Ali Daei, from Bayern Munich, sent a free kick
that Sayed Ali Mosavi-Hasanzadeh booted twice _ once into Chinese
goalie Jiang Jin and, on the rebound, into the net.
	   The Thais, who talked of a miracle after beating favored South
Korea in sudden death extra time despite having two players sent
off, still have a chance for a bronze medal in a game against
China.
	   South Korea's Park, who usually pitches for the Los Angeles
Dodgers, needed to throw only seven innings under baseball's mercy
rule, which shortens games to that limit if one team is leading by
10 runs. He struck out four and walked two.
	   Earlier, Taiwan, best known for its Little League exploits,
defeated cross-strait rival China 10-6 for the bronze medal.
	   In table tennis, Kim, the world No. 11, won 21-16, 21-14, 22-20
against Liu, the world No. 2 and the Olympic singles and doubles
champion.
	   Though the Chinese missed their first table tennis gold sweep in
20 years, they still were happy with six golds, after Wang Nan and
Li Ju won the women's doubles, 21-7, 21-8 against Hong Kong's Chan
Tan-lui and Song Ah-sim.
	   With some of their established stars left home, the Chinese were
developing a new generation of table tennis players here.
	   In all, China won four gold medals Wednesday, boosting its total
to 96 with three full days of competition left in the games. It
triumphed in women's epee team fencing, in softball with a 5-0
victory over Japan, and in women's sprint cycling.
	   South Korea had 51 after also winning four _ Kim's and the
baseball team's, plus one in archery and one in handball.
	   Third-place Japan raised its total to 43 with a victory each in
karate and men's sprint cycling.
	   The Philippines won its first gold of these games when Gandy
Valee and Romeo Villanueva beat Taiwan's Lai Chia-hsiung and Chang
Hao-ping 13-2 in the final of 9-ball pool doubles.
	   Japan had to share Wednesday's golds in its native sport of
karate with Kuwait and Iran. Japan's Ryoki Abe won the gold for
best style, but Kuwait's Jaber Alhammad and Iran's Ali-Reza
Katiraei won in actual combat.
	   That left Japan with four of the seven gold medals decided in
these games. Taiwan also had one.
	   Taiwan also picked up a gold in the taijiquan division of wushu,
a general term for Chinese martial arts. Chan Ming-shu outscored
Japan's Toshiya Watanabe and Vietnam's Nguyen Anh Minh. It was
Taiwan's 18th gold overall.
	   The Thais' hopes in soccer came as they already had accomplished
their best Asian Games ever, with 13 gold medals in hand.
	   Tamarine Tanasugarn, the women's top seed, gave them another
chance by beating China's Yi Jingqian 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 in the tennis
semifinals. She next faces third seed Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia,
who ousted China's Li Fang 7-6 (7-3), 6-1.
	   In the South Asian sport of kabaddi, Pakistan beat Japan 24-7
and won the silver medal. Defending champion India already had
climbed the gold with a perfect 6-0 record and did not play
Wednesday.
	   South Korea's men archers, like their women teammates the
previous day, swept the top three places in individual competition.
Korea's Han Seung-hoon beat teammate Kim Kyung-ho 113-112 in the
final. The bronze went to Japan's Wataru Haraguchi under rules
limiting one country to two medals in any one event.
	   South Korea won the men's team handball gold with a 29-18
victory over Kuwait.
	   In cycling, China's Wang Yan, the games record holder, beat
teammate Jiang Cuihua in the women's sprint. Her winning times of
14.463 and 13.450, however, were well behind her games record of
11.725 set in 1994.
	   In the men's sprint, Yuichiro Kamiyama beat Japanese teammate
Noriaki Mabuchi, but didn't beat the games record of 10.567 he had
set in preliminaries here.

Thousands of Zulus commemorate Battle of Blood River
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with color, quotes from ceremonies &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VRYHEID, South Africa (AP) _ Thousands of spear-wielding Zulus
on Wednesday commemorated an 1838 battle against whites in a spirit
of racial reconciliation, with a Zulu leader calling for whites and
black to build ``a new country.''
	   The Battle of Blood River, in which a small force of Boer
settlers shot down 3,000 Zulu warriors in the rolling hills of
Zululand on Dec. 16, 1838, has long been celebrated as a symbol of
Afrikaner power.
	   But Wednesday's commemorations came as the new South Africa is
rewriting its history.
	   Earlier in the day, several hundred Afrikaner descendants of
Dutch Boer settlers held their own ceremony with prayers and hymns.
	   The story goes that six days before the battle, the Boer force
made a covenant with God, vowing to render him thanks if victory
was theirs. The account gave rise to the holiday known as the Day
of the Vow, which since the end of apartheid in 1994 has been
called the Day of Reconciliation.
	   The Afrikaner ceremony _ one of the smallest such gatherings in
recent years _ was held on one side of the Blood River. The Zulu
ceremony was held on the other. Some Afrikaners crossed the river
and spoke to the Zulus in a gesture of reconciliation.
	   That spirit was also present among the 3,000 Zulus, who, dressed
in warrior outfits of fur loin coverings, beat their cowhide
shields with short fighting sticks and mock charged an imaginary
force.
	   ``Let us consider this the day of a new covenant which binds us
to the shared commitments of building a new country,'' said
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom
Party.
	   Buthelezi, who also is President Nelson Mandela's Home Affairs
Minister, was clad in a leopard skin and clasped a shield and spear
as he shared the stage with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and the
Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini.
	   Alongside the river, the government is building a memorial
commemorating the Zulu sacrifice. The memorial, about half the size
of a city block, stands unfinished in a muddy field, its red-brick
walls still lacking a roof. The government plans to place exhibits
in the structure, which stands across the river from an old
Afrikaner monument _ a bronze reconstruction of the circled ox
wagons from which the Boers fired on the Zulu army.
	   Descendants of the Zulu warriors saw no irony in celebrating
their forefathers' battlefield loss.
	   ``This is not a defeat we are celebrating,'' said Patrick
Mbatha, a 25-year-old Zulu. ``We are saying `Bravo' to the warriors
who gave their lives.''
	   The new monument in KwaZulu-Natal province, 380 kilometers (240
miles) southeast of Johannesburg, is part of the government's
efforts to correct what it considers the unbalanced history of
South Africa, where white nationalism was celebrated and Africans
often denigrated as a savage people to be subdued.
	   Other projects are planned. The house of Nobel Peace Prize
winner Albert Luthuli, an early ANC president, will become a
memorial. The government has also set aside 17 million rand (dlrs 3
million) for a museum celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela. A
theme park exploring the struggle to overcome apartheid is planned.

Russia says U.N. inspector overstepped his authority in Iraq

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign minister accused the chief U.N.
arms inspector of ``grossly exceeding'' his authority in Iraq, and
Moscow called Wednesday for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting
on the latest crisis in the Arab nation, a news report said.
	   Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who was in Madrid, Spain,
said U.N. weapons inspection chief Richard Butler did not have the
right to order U.N. weapons monitors out of Iraq, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The monitors left Baghdad on Wednesday.
	   The United States and Britain, the leading critics of Iraq, said
airstrikes are one possible option if Iraq does not fully cooperate
with inspectors.
	   But Russia, which has long-standing ties to Iraq, has
consistently opposed military action against it. Russia has one
several occasions acted as a mediator in confrontations between the
United Nations and Iraq.
	   Ivanov accused Butler of ``grossly exceeding his authority by
unilaterally ordering the evacuation of the special commission from
Iraq,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ``Unfortunately, the actions are leading to even more
complications and aggravating tensions around Iraq,'' said Ivanov,
who was in Spain to attend a peace conference on Bosnia.
	   ``Our point of view is that it is necessary to be patient now,
to assess the real situation and define what further steps are
necessary to be taken to continue the work of the special
commission,'' Ivanov was quoted as saying.
	   Iraq pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors a month
ago under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   But in his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Tuesday, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge. He said he could not give assurances that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed.
	   The arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security
Council can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Donor countries approve blueprint to advance Bosnian reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details of plan, quotes from Westendorp, Serb leader
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ World powers frustrated with the pace of
reconciliation in Bosnia approved Wednesday a plan to advance the
process and warned fractious ethnic leaders that foreign aid is not
open-ended.
	   The Bosnia Peace Implementation Council endorsed the blueprint
after a two-day meeting called to review progress in implementing
the Dayton peace accords, which ended Bosnia's 1992-1995 war among
Moslems, Croats and Serbs.
	   The council, which comprises more than 40 countries and
international organizations, set out a package of measures for
reforming the Bosnian economy, strengthening government
institutions and encouraging the return of tens of thousands of
refugees and displaced persons.
	   It stated that some success in these areas has already been
made, saying ``a lasting peace within Bosnia and Herzegovina is
starting to take root.''
	   But it warned that Bosnia is still in no condition to survive
without outside help.
	   ``Without the scaffolding of international support, it would
collapse,'' the council said in a 30-page declaration. The document
was hammered out around a large triangular table symbolizing
Bosnia's three ethnic groups.
	   The Dayton accord, reached in December 1995, carved Bosnia up
into a Serb Republic and a Moslem-Croat Federation, each with their
own government, and a nominal central government linking them. Some
30,000 troops of the NATO-led Stabilization Force keep the peace
among ethnic communities that remain deeply distrustful of each
other three years after the fighting stopped.
	   The international community's top peace coordinator, Carlos
Westendorp, said that in general terms Bosnia's biggest problem in
getting back on its feet is lingering ultra-nationalism. ``The
mentality that led to the war is still there,'' he said.
	   ``The international community has helped a lot and is willing to
continue helping. But it is high time that the authorities of that
country assume their responsibilities,'' he added.
	   On the aid front, the council reminded Bosnian leaders that
their Balkan nation is among the world's ``most assisted
countries'' and that this multi-billion dollar aid will soon start
to dwindle.
	   ``Bosnia and Herzegovina must use the time that remains to
prepare for life without total reliance on foreign aid, and to face
up to the challenge of transforming the economy to generate jobs
and a better standard of living.''
	   Specifically, leaders were urged to speed up sales of state
assets to promote a market-oriented economy, set up a properly
functioning capital market and banking system and fight corruption
and tax evasion.
	   The council said refugees returning to areas where they are a
minority often face obstruction if not outright hostility by local
authorities. So the council will now link aid disbursements to
cooperation in encouraging people to come back to their pre-war
homes.
	   The panel also said it wanted Serb authorities who dominate the
disputed city of Brcko to do more to encourage the return of
Moslems and Croats who made up the majority there before the war.
	   Brcko, under international administration but nominally part of
the Serb Republic, is crucial to the entity because it links the
two chunks of land that make up the Republic. Both the latter and
the federation claim the city, and an international arbitration
committee has twice postponed a ruling. It is now scheduled for
sometime next year.
	   The new hardline prime minister of the Serb Republic, Milorad
Dodik, sounded a surprisingly upbeat tone on cooperation with
Moslems and Croats, saying the communities were in fact working
together and would continue to do so.
	   ``We've started walking along this difficult path of peace,'' he
said.

Iran beats China in semifinal; Kuwait tops Thailand 3-0
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS. ADDS details, quotes. CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's soccer team wore gold medals
with pride Tuesday, then got dumped out of the Asian Games
semifinals by Kuwait.
	   The Thai team that enraptured the nation with its performances
was rewarded by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who gave each squad member
a small gold medal to wear as they walked on for the semifinal.
	   If the tactic was aimed at rattling a young Kuwaiti team playing
in front of an over-capacity crowd of about 70,000, including
former England great Sir Bobby Charlton, it went horribly wrong.
The Middle Eastern team won 3-0 to set up a game for real gold
medals against Iran. Iran's professional team ground out a 1-0
victory over China.
	   Thailand was dubbed the miracle team after it scored on a
long-range shot in extra time to win its quarterfinal against South
Korea, but failed to touch the ball before Kuwait went 1-0 ahead in
just 28 seconds Wednesday.
	   Kuwait left back Nohyr al-Shammari took the ball down the flank
and floated it across to the far post, where Husain al-Khodhari put
a weak header past Thai goalkeeper Chaiyong Khumpiam.
	   Kuwait could have sealed the game by the break but Farj Laheeb
twice had close range shots stopped by Chaiyong, who also robbed
Laheeb of another chance shortly after the break when he came a
long way out of the goal area to smother a through pass.
	   Then Laheeb scored his ninth goal of the tournament in the 54th
minute, finally beating Chaiyong with a powerful header following a
cross by midfield star Bader al-Halabeej.
	   Kuwait coach Milan Macala replaced al-Halabeej soon after and
the player looked disgusted at the decision, pushing away teammate
Ali Adel.
	   ``It was a good reaction that he was angry,'' Macala said. ``I
want my players to be angry.''
	   Thailand tried to find a way back into the match but was reduced
to 10 men at 73 minutes when Phathanapong Sripramote was sent off
for a second yellow card offense.
	   Still Thailand pushed everything forward and striker Kiatisuk
Senamuang missed two clear chances in the final 10 minutes.
	   With the hosts stretched at the back, Kuwait broke for a late
third goal through Khaled Shzadah, who knocked the ball in after
Chaiyoung could only swipe away a header with a one-hand save.
	   Some fans threw water bottles toward the field while many more
deserted the stadium, unable to bear the final minutes.
	   ``I thought we didn't have a lot of luck in front of goal
tonight,'' said Thailand's English coach Peter Withe. ``People said
our quarterfinal win was a miracle. It wasn't. It came through
sheer hard work. But because we conceded an early goal we had to
chase the game.''
	   The Kuwait victory stunned a crowd that overflowed the
60,000-seat Ratchamongkala Stadium, blocking corridors and
emergency exits. Riot police, some with dogs, stood by.
	   One fan who left with a smile was Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, the
president of the Kuwaiti soccer association and the top official of
the games in his role as president of the Olympic Council of Asia.
	   ``It's a wonderful result,'' Sheihk Ahmad said. ``It's a very
young team that can go on to great things.''
	   In the opening semifinal, Iran's star striker Ali Daei of Bayern
Munich was a constant worry to China's defense. He had a yellow
card in the 18th minute but set up the win when he played a 49th
minute free kick to Sayed Ali Mosavi-Hasanzadeh, who shot at
point-blank range on Chinese goalkeeper Jiang Jin. The ball
rebounded and Mosavi put away his fifth goal of the tournament.
	   China missed suspended striker Hao Haidong, while its English
coach, Bobby Houghton, was forced to watch from the stands after
getting a one-game suspension for using abusive language at
referees and a soccer official.
	   For Iranian coach Mansour Pourhydari, just happy to reach the
final, ``it made no difference'' who his team's gold medal opponent
might be.
	   ``We were a little tired. We played five matches in 10 days,''
he said.
	   Sheikh Ahmad said Iran would be favored in the gold medal game
on Saturday.
	   ``Iran are a professional side but we will be trying our best,''
he said.
	   The same day Thailand will play China and Withe said he hoped
Charlton might attend training Friday to help lift his squad.
	   ``They'll be dejected, they'll be lethargic,'' Withe said.
	   They'll also be chasing a real bronze medal to hang next to the
king's gold.

Palestinian leaders say reviewing their own peace commitments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to show Palestinians will review their own Wye
commitments, Palestinian anger at Netanyahu for refusing to release
security prisoners &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leaders said Wednesday they were
reviewing their own peace commitments following Israel's refusal to
meet a deadline to withdraw troops in the West Bank as stipulated
by the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords.
	   Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on U.S. President
Bill Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told the
president a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops on
Friday, as required by the Wye accord.
	   ``This is a clear violation of the agreement,'' said Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, returning to Gaza from Cairo, where he
briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Clinton visit. ``I
don't think that the American administration and President Clinton
will agree to this.''
	   Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said the Palestinian Cabinet
would review its own commitments to Wye at its weekly meeting
Friday.
	   Referring to Netanyahu's refusal to meet the withdrawal
deadline, Abbas said: ``It shows that the Israeli government
doesn't believe in peace, and this is what we are seeing on the
ground.''
	   Netanyahu's tough stance has frustrated the Americans.
	   Clinton had hoped his visit would move Netanyahu to back down
from his freeze on the process _ especially after the Palestine
National Council met an Israeli demand and formally renounced
clauses in its charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Netanyahu approved of the PNC vote, but said he would not move
forward until the Palestinians meet six other demands.
	   A release of prisoners _ a highly emotional issue for
Palestinians _ is due at the end of the month as part of Wye. The
Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of violating the accord by
freeing mostly criminals, not those held for anti-Israeli
activities, in the first round of releases in November.
	   ``By keeping (the prisoners) in jail, he is just like a plane
hijacker who is keeping passengers as hostages,'' Abbas said. ``He
must release them.''
	   The prime minister is trying to shore up support from
hard-liners in his coalition who have threatened to vote against
the government in a no-confidence motion on Monday.
	   However, some of the hawks have said they no longer trust
Netanyahu not to make concessions to the Palestinians, and are set
to vote against the government.
	   Eli Goldschmidt, caucus chairman of the opposition Labor Party,
on Tuesday smelled victory in an upcoming vote on early elections.
	   ``Now we have the 61 and it looks sure,'' said Goldschmidt who
is counting on at least nine legislators, including present and
former coalition members, to vote with Labor. There are 120
legislators in the Knesset.
	   Clinton appeared frustrated with the Israeli prime minister's
apparent obsession with domestic worries.
	   ``We'll just keep at it,'' Clinton said Tuesday, and announced
that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will return to the
Mideast in several weeks.
	   Palestinians said it was increasingly difficult to work with a
weakened government.
	   ``All the talk by Israeli officials about security is not the
security of the Israeli people, but the security of keeping their
seats in the government,'' said Gaza security chief Mohammmed
Dahlan.
	   Compounding Netanyahu's woes, his finance minister, Yaakov
Neeman has decided to quit. In what may have been a snowball
effect, Netanyahu's defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, a
supporter of the Wye accord, said he would have his own
announcement to make Friday. The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said
Mordechai would back a call for early elections.

Russian parliament passes bill on printing rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW grafs 8-10 with Russia expecting dlrs 3.4 billion from
World Bank next year. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament approved a bill Wednesday that allows
the government to print 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.2 billion) _ an
amount that will help pay the state's bills, but which may also
provoke more inflation.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
workers and pensioners, among others. But with inflation already
running at around 70 percent this year, the fresh infusion of cash
could push prices even higher.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, unanimously passed the
measure Wednesday on the final reading. President Boris Yeltsin's
government is authorized to print the new money until the end of
the year.
	   The bill now goes to parliament's upper house, which is expected
to approve it swiftly, and then to Yeltsin, who is expected to sign
it without delay.
	   The Russian government has already begun printing rubles in
recent months to cover its huge budget deficit. As expected, the
value of the currency has been declining and inflation has been
rising.
	   In an attempt to shore up the currency, the bill passed
Wednesday also requires Russian exporters to repatriate 75 percent
of their hard-currency earnings, up from the current 50 percent.
This will keep more foreign currency inside Russia.
	   Russia is struggling with its worst economic crisis since the
Soviet Union collapsed, and the government has been assembling a
series of measures to guide the country out of its depression.
	   In another development, Russia said it hopes for loans worth
dlrs 3.4 billion next year from the World Bank.
	   The head of the World Bank mission to Russia, Michael Carter,
met Russian officials Wednesday, and afterward Economics Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants expressed hope that the money would be
forthcoming.
	   Russia has factored in billions of dollars in international
loans in calculating next year's budget, but there's no guarantee
the money will materialize. International lenders froze their
disbursements after Russia's financial markets collapsed in August.
	   Meanwhile, parliament also was weighing several measures aimed
at streamlining the nation's unwieldy tax system in advance of a
debate on next year's budget.
	   The proposed bills seek to lower the value added tax, currently
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent. The
measures also call for revising the personal income tax tables to

	   The aim is to create tax incentives for ailing industries, and

Communist-dominated parliament's lower house, the State Duma.

Russian parliament passes bill on printing rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: NEW grafs 8-10 with Russia expecting dlrs 3.4 billion from
World Bank next year. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament approved a bill Wednesday that allows
the government to print 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.2 billion) _ an
amount that will help pay the state's bills, but which may also
provoke more inflation.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
workers and pensioners, among others. But with inflation already
running at around 70 percent this year, the fresh infusion of cash
could push prices even higher.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, unanimously passed the
measure Wednesday on the final reading. President Boris Yeltsin's
government is authorized to print the new money until the end of
the year.
	   The bill now goes to parliament's upper house, which is expected
to approve it swiftly, and then to Yeltsin, who is expected to sign
it without delay.
	   The Russian government has already begun printing rubles in
recent months to cover its huge budget deficit. As expected, the
value of the currency has been declining and inflation has been
rising.
	   In an attempt to shore up the currency, the bill passed
Wednesday also requires Russian exporters to repatriate 75 percent
of their hard-currency earnings, up from the current 50 percent.
This will keep more foreign currency inside Russia.
	   Russia is struggling with its worst economic crisis since the
Soviet Union collapsed, and the government has been assembling a
series of measures to guide the country out of its depression.
	   In another development, Russia said it hopes for loans worth
dlrs 3.4 billion next year from the World Bank.
	   The head of the World Bank mission to Russia, Michael Carter,
met Russian officials Wednesday, and afterward Economics Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants expressed hope that the money would be
forthcoming.
	   Russia has factored in billions of dollars in international
loans in calculating next year's budget, but there's no guarantee
the money will materialize. International lenders froze their
disbursements after Russia's financial markets collapsed in August.
	   Meanwhile, parliament also was weighing several measures aimed
at streamlining the nation's unwieldy tax system in advance of a
debate on next year's budget.
	   The proposed bills seek to lower the value added tax, currently
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent. The
measures also call for revising the personal income tax tables to
take into account the ruble's recent fall.
	   The aim is to create tax incentives for ailing industries, and
encourage more tax evaders to pay what they owe. But critics warn
that tax cuts may only result in even lower government revenues.
	   The measures are expected to win approval in the
Communist-dominated parliament's lower house, the State Duma.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As U.N. weapons inspectors evacuated Iraq on
Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes
could come quickly and without warning in the face of Saddam
Hussein's latest defiance.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday. ``I'm not now going to give him any warning of
what we might do.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed the Iraq crisis with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in a 15-minute phone call just after 9 p.m.
(2100 GMT) Tuesday, said a spokesman for Blair, speaking with
customary anonymity.
	   Blair also met with his cabinet's defense committee earlier
Tuesday to discuss Iraq, the spokesman said.
	   The spokesman said this weekend's start of the Muslim holy
festival of Ramadan was a ``factor'' that would be taken into
account by the government in determining its response.

Court frees jailed asylum-seeker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 20-year-old Nigerian woman held in Britain for
nearly seven months was freed Wednesday after an appeals court
ruled that the government was wrong to order her deportation.
	   Ganiyatu Sanusi, who has lived in Britain since her 13th
birthday, was immediately released after a three-judge panel ruled
that the Home Office had made ``an invalid deportation order,'' and
suggested she should be allowed to stay in Britain.
	   The court ruled that the government should not have ordered Miss
Sanusi be deported while an application for asylum was pending. She
had been living illegally in Britain since her initial six-month
visitor's visa expired. She married a British citizen two years
ago, but her applications to stay were still rejected by the Home
Office.
	   After her deportation was ordered, she applied for asylum, based
on her late father's political activities in Nigeria in support of
Chief Abiola.
	   But Miss Sanusi was arrested on May 12 and had been in custody
as an illegal alien since then.
	   The court suggested the Home Office allow her to stay,
considering that she has lived in Britain for so long and has done
well here.
	   Cal Harding, an American lawyer who represented her free of
charge because legal aid was withdrawn, said the ruling could
affect ``hundreds of others'' who are seeking asylum in Britain.
	   Miss Sanusi was in tears after being released.
	   ``I am so happy now,'' she said. ``This means I can now go back
to college to study accountancy.''

Thai soccer miracle ends; South Koreans celebrate victories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kuwait soccer victory, South Korean baseball
gold, other late medals &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kuwait ended Thailand's ``miracle'' run
in Asian Games soccer Wednesday, scoring even before the Thais
touched the ball in a semifinal some fans in the host nation
couldn't bear to watch to the end.
	   That left the day's major celebrating to the South Koreans. U.S.
Major League pitcher Park Chan-ho led his team to a 13-1 trouncing
of archrival Japan for the baseball gold medal, and Kim Taek-soo
upset China's Liu Guoliang for the men's singles gold in table
tennis.
	   ``I am the champion,'' the elated Kim said, after leaping into
the air and then into his coach's arms. He had stopped a Chinese
sweep of all seven table tennis golds.
	   The Korean baseball team tossed Park and several other players
in the air, and ran a victory lap with two large Korean flags.
	   But at the 60,000-seat soccer stadium, which had been filled to
overflowing, some fans threw water bottles toward the field and
many more left early, unable to bear the final minutes of the
Thais' 3-0 loss to Kuwait.
	   In the first 28 seconds, Kuwait back Nohyr al-Shammari took the
ball down the flank and floated it across to the far post, where
Husain al-Khodhari headed past Thai goalie Chaiyong Khumpiam for
the first goal.
	   In the other semifinal, Iran frustrated China yet again, winning
1-0 and setting up an all-Middle Eastern final. China was weakened
by the absence of star striker Hao Haidong and its English coach,
Bobby Houghton, both serving suspensions.
	   Iran's striker Ali Daei, from Bayern Munich, sent a free kick
that Sayed Ali Mosavi-Hasanzadeh booted twice _ once into Chinese
goalie Jiang Jin and, on the rebound, into the net.
	   The Thais, who talked of a miracle after beating favored South
Korea in sudden death extra time despite having two players sent
off, still have a chance for a bronze medal in a game against
China.
	   South Korea's Park, who usually pitches for the Los Angeles
Dodgers, needed to throw only seven innings under baseball's mercy
rule, which shortens games to that limit if one team is leading by
10 runs. He struck out four and walked two.
	   Earlier, Taiwan, best known for its Little League exploits,
defeated cross-strait rival China 10-6 for the bronze medal.
	   In table tennis, Kim, the world No. 11, won 21-16, 21-14, 22-20
against Liu, the world No. 2 and the Olympic singles and doubles
champion.
	   Though the Chinese missed their first table tennis gold sweep in
20 years, they still were happy with six golds, after Wang Nan and
Li Ju won the women's doubles, 21-7, 21-8 against Hong Kong's Chan
Tan-lui and Song Ah-sim.
	   With some of their established stars left home, the Chinese were
developing a new generation of table tennis players here.
	   In all, China won four gold medals Wednesday, boosting its total
to 96 with three full days of competition left in the games. It
triumphed in women's epee team fencing, in softball with a 5-0
victory over Japan, and in women's sprint cycling.
	   South Korea had 51 after also winning four _ Kim's and the
baseball team's, plus one in archery and one in handball.
	   Third-place Japan raised its total to 43 with a victory each in
karate and men's sprint cycling.
	   The Philippines won its first gold of these games when Gandy
Valee and Romeo Villanueva beat Taiwan's Lai Chia-hsiung and Chang
Hao-ping 13-2 in the final of 9-ball pool doubles.
	   Japan had to share Wednesday's golds in its native sport of
karate with Kuwait and Iran. Japan's Ryoki Abe won the gold for
best style, but Kuwait's Jaber Alhammad and Iran's Ali-Reza
Katiraei won in actual combat.
	   That left Japan with four of the seven gold medals decided in
these games. Taiwan also had one.
	   Taiwan also picked up a gold in the taijiquan division of wushu,
a general term for Chinese martial arts. Chan Ming-shu outscored
Japan's Toshiya Watanabe and Vietnam's Nguyen Anh Minh. It was
Taiwan's 18th gold overall.
	   The Thais' hopes in soccer came as they already had accomplished
their best Asian Games ever, with 13 gold medals in hand.
	   Tamarine Tanasugarn, the women's top seed, gave them another
chance by beating China's Yi Jingqian 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 in the tennis
semifinals. She next faces third seed Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia,
who ousted China's Li Fang 7-6 (7-3), 6-1.
	   In the South Asian sport of kabaddi, Pakistan beat Japan 24-7
and won the silver medal. Defending champion India already had
climbed the gold with a perfect 6-0 record and did not play
Wednesday.
	   South Korea's men archers, like their women teammates the
previous day, swept the top three places in individual competition.
Korea's Han Seung-hoon beat teammate Kim Kyung-ho 113-112 in the
final. The bronze went to Japan's Wataru Haraguchi under rules
limiting one country to two medals in any one event.
	   South Korea won the men's team handball gold with a 29-18
victory over Kuwait.
	   In cycling, China's Wang Yan, the games record holder, beat
teammate Jiang Cuihua in the women's sprint. Her winning times of
14.463 and 13.450, however, were well behind her games record of
11.725 set in 1994.
	   In the men's sprint, Yuichiro Kamiyama beat Japanese teammate
Noriaki Mabuchi, but didn't beat the games record of 10.567 he had
set in preliminaries here.

Sammer unlikely to come back this season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Matthias Sammer, the libero who led
Germany to the 1996 European Championship and was then voted the
continent's Player of the Year, is unlikely to come back this
season, his club coach said Wednesday.
	   Sammer, 31, is still in rehabilitation after his fifth surgery
on the left knee 14 months ago and his future career has been in
doubt.
	   ``He has been injured for quite a while now. If someone is in
the fitness room and hasn't run since nearly 15 months, he can't be
expected to be able to play,'' Borussia Dortmund coach Michael
Skibbe told the newspaper Die Welt.
	   Sammer will not attend Dortmund's Jan. 18-27 winter practice
camp in Turkey.
	   Sammer's contract with Dortmund expires at the end of the
season. If he is unable to resume his career, Sammer has been
promised another job in the club.
	   Dortmund won the Champions Cup in 1997, although Sammer already
played sparingly that season because of his chronic knee problems.
	   Sammer played 23 games for former East Germany and 51 for
Germany.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) - A Turkish cargo ship sank off Israel on
Wednesday and was abandoned by its crew.
	   The 1,000 ton freighter Dogruyolar had just left the Israeli
port of Haifa with a cargo of cement and was headed south along the
coast when its engine room began to fill up with water, said Haifa
port spokesman Yossi Rosenthal.
	   After the ship sent out a distress signal, the nine crew members
were rescued by Israeli coast guard and naval vessels, said Hakan
Abaci, an official at the Turkish Embassy in Tel Aviv.
	   The cause of the massive leak was not immediately known.

U.N. weapons monitors evacuate Baghdad

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors left Baghdad on
Wednesday, amid fears that Iraq's latest refusal to cooperate with
inspectors could lead to airstrikes.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Iraq's compliance.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed the crisis with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in a 15-minute phone call late Tuesday, a
spokesman for Blair in London said, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   ``This is obviously a very serious situation. All options are on
the table,'' one White House national security aide said Wednesday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler's report on Iraq's obstruction of
inspections as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to
trigger an American and British military strike on Iraq.''
	   He said the withdrawal of the inspectors ``means again that the
Special Commission is a tool in America's hand to implement its
policy of aggression.'' His remarks were carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes could come
quickly and without warning.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''
	   The United States has 22 warships and 201 aircraft in the
region, including 72 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
Eight of the warships carry cruise missiles. Britain has 22 strike
aircraft in the region.
	   Weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency arrived in Bahrain Wednesday
afternoon.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain. ``There
is nobody left behind.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused Butler of
overstepping his authority by ordering the evacuation of
inspectors. He called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting,
ITAR-Tass news agency reported in Moscow.
	   Ivanov was in Madrid on Wednesday for a peace conference on
Bosnia. Russia has consistently opposed military action against
Iraq.
	   In Baghdad, a U.N. spokesman said no decision had been made on
withdrawing the 400 U.N. employees monitoring humanitarian programs
in Iraq.
	   George Somerwill added, however, that they were prepared to
leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast Wednesday
and began playing patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos
training with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers.
	   Under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, Iraq had pledged
Nov. 14 to resume full cooperation with inspectors and allow
unfettered access to sites and documents.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge that made it impossible for him to assure that Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security
Council can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler said Iraq's claim that it does not possess banned weapons
or the ability to make them ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   He said inspectors were not able to gain access to the
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid
evidence of the presence of proscribed materials.''
	   At two other sites, negotiations ultimately cleared the way for
inspections, he said. But one building had been emptied of relevant
materials, and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any
disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   ``It remains the commission's strong view that, under the
present circumstances, relevant documentation must exist in Iraq
and that provision of such documentation is the best hope for
revealing the full picture'' of Iraqi weapons programs, he said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors left Baghdad on
Wednesday, amid fears that Iraq's latest refusal to cooperate with
inspectors could lead to airstrikes.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Iraq's compliance.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed the crisis with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in a 15-minute phone call late Tuesday, a
spokesman for Blair in London said, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   ``This is obviously a very serious situation. All options are on
the table,'' one White House national security aide said Wednesday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler's report on Iraq's obstruction of
inspections as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to
trigger an American and British military strike on Iraq.''
	   He said the withdrawal of the inspectors ``means again that the
Special Commission is a tool in America's hand to implement its
policy of aggression.'' His remarks were carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes could come
quickly and without warning.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''
	   The United States has 22 warships and 201 aircraft in the
region, including 72 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
Eight of the warships carry cruise missiles. Britain has 22 strike
aircraft in the region.
	   Weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency arrived in Bahrain Wednesday
afternoon.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain. ``There
is nobody left behind.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused Butler of
overstepping his authority by ordering the evacuation of
inspectors. He called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting,
ITAR-Tass news agency reported in Moscow.
	   Ivanov was in Madrid on Wednesday for a peace conference on
Bosnia. Russia has consistently opposed military action against
Iraq.
	   In Baghdad, a U.N. spokesman said no decision had been made on
withdrawing the 400 U.N. employees monitoring humanitarian programs
in Iraq.
	   George Somerwill added, however, that they were prepared to
leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast Wednesday
and began playing patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos
training with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers.
	   Under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, Iraq had pledged
Nov. 14 to resume full cooperation with inspectors and allow
unfettered access to sites and documents.
	   In his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday,
Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge that made it impossible for him to assure that Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Those arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security
Council can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Butler said Iraq's claim that it does not possess banned weapons
or the ability to make them ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   He said inspectors were not able to gain access to the
headquarters of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid
evidence of the presence of proscribed materials.''
	   At two other sites, negotiations ultimately cleared the way for
inspections, he said. But one building had been emptied of relevant
materials, and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any
disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   ``It remains the commission's strong view that, under the
present circumstances, relevant documentation must exist in Iraq
and that provision of such documentation is the best hope for
revealing the full picture'' of Iraqi weapons programs, he said.

 &UR; Serbs mourn, protest killings in western Kosovo city

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of Kosovo Serbs on Wednesday
grieved and protested the slayings of six young Serbs which have
dangerously inflamed already-high tensions in the separatist
province.
	   A mournful crowd of 5,000 gathered to remember the victims in a
tense silence that permeated the western city of Pec, where the
victims of the Monday night shooting were to be buried later in the
day.
	   Another 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a protest rally in the
capital Pristina.
	   Voicing grave concern at the dangerous turn of events this week
in Kosovo, senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke late Tuesday
condemned the deaths as ``appalling beyond words.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, renewed his
determination to suppress ``terrorism.'' A top government body for
the Serbian province, the Temporary Council for Kosovo, called the
killings were ``the most monstrous crime in the series of assaults
by Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   Many fear the Pec killings, along with a border clash this week
between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian rebels, move the
tense province closer to a renewal of all-out war.
	   At least 42 people are reported to have died at the two sites,
and the brutal barroom shooting of six Serbs in Kosovo's
third-largest city prompted protests and threats of retaliation
against rebels among the large Serbian population.
	   Holbrooke, who brokered the October agreement that halted more
than seven months of combat in the separatist Serbian province,
appears pessimistic of reaching a political settlement that could
stop the continuing carnage.
	   After more than five hours of talks with Milosevic in Belgrade,
he acknowledged Tuesday night that diplomats are nowhere near
bridging the huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethic Albanians
on the province's status.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic.
	   While the death toll from Monday's clash between border guards
and rebels trying to bring in arms from Albania was higher _ the
army said it killed 36 guerrillas _ the Pec killings raised more
alarm among international officials because they involved an attack
on civilians. Five teen-agers were among the dead.
	   People in the Pec crowd wept openly Wednesday as the six coffins
were brought to the main square and covered with wreaths. At least
one man in civilian clothing was seen armed with a machine gun.
	   ``Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' said Mirko Simonovic,
principal of the high school where four of the victims were
students. ``They were killed for the simple reason of being
Serbs.''
	   He concluded the speech with a demand that the state ``punish
the perpetrators and do away forever with Albanian terrorism.''
	   Pec, located 75 miles (45 miles) west of the capital Pristina,
has about 150,000 residents. Like Kosovo itself, the population is
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian, but several thousand Serbs also
live there.
	   In his statement, Milosevic said security forces ``will suppress
terrorism'' and that the ``terrorist bandits'' responsible for the
Pec shooting would be ``found, wherever they are.''
	   He also accused U.S. representatives in the U.N. Security
Council of ``losing credibility'' by blocking U.N. statements
denouncing ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Towns and cities have mostly escaped the violence that has
engulfed Kosovo villages this year since Serb forces launched an
offensive in February to crush pro-independence militants in the
province of Serbia _ the dominant republic left in Yugoslavia.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed in months of fighting
and in sporadic violence since the Oct. 12 informal cease-fire.
	   The deadliest clash in the two-month tenuous standoff since then
came Monday in a battle that international peace verifiers
confirmed was a showdown between the army and armed fighters of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Many residents of nearby border villages have fled this week
after the army sent in armored vehicles and helicopters to fight
dozens of KLA rebels it says escaped into the nearby mountains. An
army cordon around the area, which includes some settlements, has
prevented verifiers and residents from entering the sealed-off area
and it wasn't immediately clear whether the clash was continuing
for a third day Wednesday.

Trial opens in death of teenage basketball fan

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Amid heavy police security, the trial of
two policemen accused of taking part in the fatal beating of a
13-year-old boy opened Wednesday in northern Poland.
	   The death of Przemek Czaja in January sparked three nights of
rioting in the Baltic coast city of Slupsk that injured 101 people
and caused 200,000 zlotys (dlrs 57,000) in damage.
	   Police erected a temporary fence around the provincial
courthouse in Koszalin, 436 kilometers (260 miles) northwest of
Warsaw, for the trial. Entry was restricted to those with special
passes.
	   A former policeman, identified only as Dariusz W., is charged
with deliberately causing injury and unintentionally causing
Czaja's death. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.
	   Another policeman, identified as Robert K., faces up to five
years in prison if convicted of failing to help the injured boy,
who died at the scene.
	   Both defendants pleaded innocent. Police initially said the boy
died after falling and hitting his head on a post, but an autopsy
said the fatal wound was caused by a blow from a weapon like a
police baton.
	   Czaja was injured after attending a basketball game in Slupsk.
Police said they were reacting to hooliganism, but witnesses said
Czaja and others only were jaywalking when police attacked them.

Arafat: Palestinians have a ``natural right'' to declare a state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinians have a ``natural right'' to
declare a state next May, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told
reporters in Cairo on Wednesday.
	   ``It is known that the Oslo agreement, which we signed at the
White House under the supervision of President Clinton, had five
years as a transitional period. This period ends on May 4, 1999
and, after that, it is our natural right to declare our independent
state,'' Arafat said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that any
unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state would kill the peace
process.
	   A summit between Arafat, Clinton and Netanyahu on the
Israeli-Gaza Strip border on Tuesday failed to produce an Israeli
commitment to withdraw on schedule from more West Bank land.
	   Palestinians have accused Israel of wrecking Clinton's bid to
salvage the Wye River interim peace accord that the president
helped to negotiate in October.
	   Arafat was in Egypt to brief President Hosni Mubarak on U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to the region.

	   VRYHEID, South Africa (AP) _ Thousands of spear-wielding Zulus
on Wednesday commemorated an 1838 battle against whites, part of
the new South Africa's efforts to rewrite its history.
	   The Battle of Blood River, in which a small force of Boer
settlers shot down 3,000 Zulu warriors in the rolling hills of
Zululand on Dec. 16, 1838, has long been celebrated as a symbol of
Afrikaner power.
	   For the first time Wednesday, Zulus held their own celebrations
at the site, honoring their forefathers' heroic sacrifices.

Europarliament eyes no-confidence vote in Commission over fraud
</HEADLINE>
stance

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ The European Parliament set the stage
Wednesday for a de facto confidence vote in the European Commission
over perceived flaws in its anti-fraud policies.
	   Ahead of Thursday's vote, the 626-member parliament was split on
whether to endorse the 1996 accounts as finalized by the EU
executive amid questions of whether it spent that budget wisely.
	   EU Budget Commissioner Erkki Liikanen argues he has met all
demands for tighter financial controls.
	   Yet many in the parliament deny he has gone far enough to
guarantee regular fraud reports, to keep national justice officials
informed of investigations or to create an independent anti-fraud
office.
	   A vote withholding approval of the 1996 budget was first planned
for last March, but the Commission was given a reprieve. If carried
it would be seen as damaging to the Commission's standing and could
be followed by a formal no-confidence vote.
	   Under the EU treaty, the parliament can only fire the entire
20-member EU executive panel, not individual commissioners.
	   The European Commission is in Strasbourg where the parliament is
holding its monthly plenary session. Officials said Commission
President Jacques Santer was planned to hold a press conference
after Thursday's vote, scheduled for 9.30 am (0830GMT).
	   The Socialist Group, the largest faction in the European
parliament, is divided. Two thirds are in favor of a discharge, a
third is against. The European People's Party, the second largest
faction, is also divided.
	   The European Union has long been hounded by reports and
allegations of fraud.
	   On Nov. 17, the EU Court of Auditors estimated fraud and
financial irregularities amounted to 5 percent of the EU's 1997
budget of 83 billion European currency units (dlrs 97 billion)
budget.
	   Although fraud and financial mismanagement falls under the EU
heading, 85 percent of it is handled by national authorities on
behalf of the European Commission.
	   In recent weeks, there has been a stream of new allegations
aimed at the Commission involving financial mismanagement and
cronyism in its humanitarian aid and vocational training programs.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ World powers frustrated with the pace of
reconciliation in Bosnia approved Wednesday a plan to advance the
process and warned fractious ethnic leaders that foreign aid is not
open-ended.
	   The Bosnia Peace Implementation Council endorsed the blueprint
after a two-day meeting called to review progress in implementing
the Dayton peace accords, which ended Bosnia's 1992-1995 war among
Muslims, Croats and Serbs.
	   The council, which comprises more than 40 countries and
international organizations, set out a package of measures for
reforming the Bosnian economy, strengthening government
institutions and encouraging the return of tens of thousands of
refugees and displaced persons.
	   It stated that some success in these areas has already been
made, saying ``a lasting peace within Bosnia and Herzegovina is
starting to take root.''
	   But it warned that Bosnia is still in no condition to survive
without outside help.
	   ``Without the scaffolding of international support, it would
collapse,'' the council said in a 30-page declaration. The document
was hammered out around a large triangular table symbolizing
Bosnia's three ethnic groups.
	   The Dayton accord, reached in December 1995, carved Bosnia up
into a Serb Republic and a Muslim-Croat Federation, each with their
own government linked by a nominal central government. Some 30,000
troops of the NATO-led Stabilization Force keep the peace among
ethnic communities that remain deeply distrustful of each other
three years after the fighting stopped.
	   The international community's top peace coordinator, Carlos
Westendorp, said that in general terms Bosnia's biggest problem in
getting back on its feet is lingering ultra-nationalism. ``The
mentality that led to the war is still there,'' he said.
	   ``The international community has helped a lot and is willing to
continue helping. But it is high time that the authorities of that
country assume their responsibilities,'' he added.
	   On the aid front, the council reminded Bosnian leaders that
their Balkan nation is among the world's ``most assisted
countries'' and that this multi-billion dollar aid will soon start
to dwindle.
	   ``Bosnia and Herzegovina must use the time that remains to
prepare for life without total reliance on foreign aid, and to face
up to the challenge of transforming the economy to generate jobs
and a better standard of living,'' the council said.

French author fined for contesting crimes against humanity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French appeals court on Wednesday upheld the
conviction of an author for a 1996 book that calls into question
whether 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust.
	   Roger Garaudy, 85, received a six-month suspended prison
sentence and was fined 120,000 francs (dlrs 21,400) for contesting
the Holocaust in ``The Founding Myths of Israeli Politics.''
	   Garaudy, who converted to Islam in 1982, also received a
three-month suspended sentence and an additional 40,000 franc-fine
(dlrs 8,000) for inciting racial hatred.
	   In his book, Garaudy questioned the figure of 6 million for the
number of Jews killed by the Nazis in World War II, saying it was
much less, and denounced what he called ``Shoah business'' _
turning the tragedy into a calculated way of making money and
political gains.
	   During his trial, he said he was anti-Zionist, but not
anti-Semitic.
	   Garaudy's publisher, Pierre Guillaume, received a six-month
suspended sentence and fined 30,000 francs (dlrs 5,400) for
contesting the Holocaust.

Yemen kidnappers of Germans want jobs, roads and scholarships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Tribesmen who kidnapped four Germans last
week are demanding more jobs, roads and scholarships for the
release of their hostages, newspapers reported Wednesday.
	   A statement from the kidnappers was signed ``the hosts of the
four Germans'' and detailed demands for the release of the
hostages. It was published by most major newspapers.
	   The Germans _ three women and one man _ were abducted Dec. 7 by
three gunmen from the Bani Dhabyan tribe in Marib province, 170
kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital, San'a.
	   The German hostages were identified by the Yemen Times as
Norbert Degen, Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner.
The names could not be confirmed with the German Embassy.
	   The statement by the sheiks of the Bani Dhabyan tribe asked for
more schools, hospitals, telephone lines and roads in its poor
province. It also complained of the few jobs available.
	   ``We want the government to employ 200 of our tribesmen in the
army, find jobs for 150 people in the tourism industry and employ
150 people of our handicapped men and women. In addition, we would
like 25 scholarships in San`a University in the fields of medicine,
law and engineering,'' the statement said.
	   It was signed by tribal leaders, Ali Abdullah al-Humaidi and
Mohammed Ali Siraj, Al-Rai Al-Am newspaper reported.
	   Military helicopters hovered over Ra`id Mountain on Wednesday
where the hostages are being held, eyewitnesses said.
	   More than 150 members of an elite Yemeni force also arrived
Wednesday. There are already more than 250 troops in armored
vehicles circling the mountain where the Germans are believed held.
	   The show of force comes a day after the expiry of a deadline
given the kidnappers by President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
	   Kidnappings occur frequently in Yemen, large parts of which are
lawless and controlled by armed tribesmen who do not hesitate to
take the law in their hands to get their demands fulfilled. The
hostages _ often oil-industry workers, diplomats or tourists _ are
usually treated well and released unhurt.
	   In April, members of the same tribe released British hostages
after the government promised to build more roads in the area and
return a four-wheel drive vehicle that was seized in March.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament approved a bill Wednesday that allows
the government to print 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.2 billion) _ an
amount that will help pay the state's bills, but which may also
provoke more inflation.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
workers and pensioners, among others. But with inflation already
running at around 70 percent this year, the fresh infusion of cash
could push prices even higher.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, unanimously passed the
measure Wednesday on the final reading. President Boris Yeltsin's
government is authorized to print the new money until the end of
the year.
	   The bill now goes to parliament's upper house, which is expected
to approve it swiftly, and then to Yeltsin, who is expected to sign
it without delay.
	   The Russian government has already begun printing rubles in
recent months to cover its huge budget deficit. As expected, the
value of the currency has been declining and inflation has been
rising.
	   In an attempt to shore up the currency, the bill passed
Wednesday also requires Russian exporters to repatriate 75 percent
of their hard-currency earnings, up from the current 50 percent.
This will keep more foreign currency inside Russia.
	   Russia is struggling with its worst economic crisis since the
Soviet Union collapsed, and the government has been assembling a
series of measures to guide the country out of its depression.
	   In another development, Russia said it hopes for loans worth
dlrs 3.4 billion next year from the World Bank.
	   The head of the World Bank mission to Russia, Michael Carter,
met Russian officials Wednesday, and afterward Economics Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants expressed hope that the money would be
forthcoming.
	   Russia has factored in billions of dollars in international
loans in calculating next year's budget, but there's no guarantee
the money will materialize. International lenders froze their
disbursements after Russia's financial markets collapsed in August.
	   Meanwhile, parliament also was weighing several measures aimed
at streamlining the nation's unwieldy tax system in advance of a
debate on next year's budget.
	   The proposed bills seek to lower the value added tax, currently
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent. The
measures also call for revising the personal income tax tables to
take into account the ruble's recent fall.
	   The aim is to create tax incentives for ailing industries, and
encourage more tax evaders to pay what they owe. But critics warn
that tax cuts may only result in even lower government revenues.
	   The measures are expected to win approval in the
Communist-dominated parliament's lower house, the State Duma.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament approved a bill Wednesday that allows
the government to print 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.2 billion) _ an
amount that will help pay the state's bills, but which may also
provoke more inflation.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
workers and pensioners, among others. But with inflation already
running at around 70 percent this year, the fresh infusion of cash
could push prices even higher.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, unanimously passed the
measure Wednesday on the final reading. President Boris Yeltsin's
government is authorized to print the new money until the end of
the year.

With lawyers harassed, Chinese dissidents go to trial alone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to UPDATE with quotes from defendant's
wife; picks up 12th graf pvs `Dispirited by ... '
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With attorneys locked up, harassed or plain
scared, two prominent dissidents will defend themselves against
charges of subversion Thursday in China's highest-profile dissident
trials in two years.
	   Qin Yongmin's and Wang Youcai's families were running out of
options Wednesday to help the pair, leading organizers of a budding
opposition political party. Qin's family pleaded for a postponement
at Wuhan's Intermediate People's Court, but court officials denied
the request.
	   Police have detained one lawyer and threatened another, and
subtler pressures have been used on others, family members said.
Given the interference, Wang Youcai's wife assumes he will be
convicted.
	   ``Whether he has a lawyer or not, whatever he says, the
government has already decided,'' Hu Jiangxia said.
	   Qin and Wang will be tried separately, in cities 500 kilometers
(300 miles) apart and in proceedings attended only by family and a
few observers selected by the courts.
	   Qin, 44, and Wang, 31, are accused of inciting the subversion of
state power, apparently for helping to organize the China Democracy
Party. They face from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted
under the harshest aspects of the law.
	   By moving against Qin, Wang and the China Democracy Party, the
ruling Communist Party appears to be signaling its determination to
crush challenges to its monopoly on power. Authorities have
detained or questioned more than 30 people associated with the
party in a 17-day-old crackdown.
	   Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, and Wang, a student
leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are among
the most active and influential members of China's dissident
community. A third prominent member of the dissident community, Xu
Wenli, was also arrested in the crackdown, but not yet charged.
	   To prevent displays of solidarity outside Wang's trial, police
have detained at least ten dissidents in the eastern city of
Hangzhou, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported. The Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said many
more are missing and believed to be in custody.
	   To prosecute Wang, authorities violated the minimal rights
guaranteed suspects under Chinese law and ignored court orders, his
wife said.
	   ``Even the judge asked me to hire a lawyer, but while I was
doing this, some people were doing things to stop me,'' Hu Jiangxia
said.
	   During one meeting with a potential defense attorney, a police
official stormed in and said, ```Don't do anything for them. Don't
take this case. Whoever takes the case, you can't win,''' Hu
recounted.
	   Four law firms refused to take Qin's case, his brother Qin
Xiaoguang said. The Information Center said one lawyer who
initially agreed to represent Qin on Monday went missing for four
hours and then called Qin's family to withdraw.
	   Dispirited by the harsh treatment, Qin's family argued over
whether to attend the trial. Qin Xiaoguang said he and his father
have decided to stay away to protest the unfairness, but another
brother will go.
	   Three dissidents from northeastern China sent an open letter to
China's legislature and the Supreme People's Court appealing for
fair trials, the Information Center said. It added that authorities
violated China's own laws by not ensuring Wang and Qin have
adequate representation.
	   The letter was the latest in a string of petitions demonstrating
the appeal of both Wang and Qin and the idea of the China Democracy
Party.
	   Since Wang publicly announced in June that he and others in
Hangzhou were setting up the party, dissidents in at least 14
provinces and cities have set up party branches. Authorities have
refused their applications to register the party as required by
law.
	   Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has put on
trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. He
was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-year
sentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile.

Palestinian leaders say reviewing their own peace commitments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to show Palestinians will review their own Wye
commitments, Palestinian anger at Netanyahu for refusing to release
security prisoners &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leaders said Wednesday they were
reviewing their own peace commitments following Israel's refusal to
meet a deadline to withdraw troops in the West Bank as stipulated
by the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords.
	   Netanyahu on Wednesday briefed his Cabinet on U.S. President
Bill Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told the
president a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops on
Friday, as required by the Wye accord.
	   ``This is a clear violation of the agreement,'' said Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, returning to Gaza from Cairo, where he
briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the Clinton visit. ``I
don't think that the American administration and President Clinton
will agree to this.''
	   Arafat's deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, said the Palestinian Cabinet
would review its own commitments to Wye at its weekly meeting
Friday.
	   Referring to Netanyahu's refusal to meet the withdrawal
deadline, Abbas said: ``It shows that the Israeli government
doesn't believe in peace, and this is what we are seeing on the
ground.''
	   Netanyahu's tough stance has frustrated the Americans.
	   Clinton had hoped his visit would move Netanyahu to back down
from his freeze on the process _ especially after the Palestine
National Council met an Israeli demand and formally renounced
clauses in its charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Netanyahu approved of the PNC vote, but said he would not move
forward until the Palestinians met six other demands.
	   A release of prisoners _ a highly emotional issue for
Palestinians _ is due at the end of the month as part of Wye. The
Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of violating the accord by
freeing mostly criminals, not those held for anti-Israeli
activities, in the first round of releases in November.
	   ``By keeping (the prisoners) in jail, he is just like a plane
hijacker who is keeping passengers as hostages,'' Abbas said. ``He
must release them.''
	   The prime minister is trying to shore up support from
hard-liners in his coalition who have threatened to vote against
the government in a no-confidence motion on Monday.
	   However, some of the hawks have said they no longer trust
Netanyahu not to make concessions to the Palestinians, and are set
to vote against the government.
	   Eli Goldschmidt, caucus chairman of the opposition Labor Party,
on Tuesday smelled victory in an upcoming vote on early elections.
	   ``Now we have the 61 and it looks sure,'' said Goldschmidt who
is counting on at least nine legislators, including present and
former coalition members, to vote with Labor. There are 120
legislators in the Knesset.
	   Clinton appeared frustrated with the Israeli prime minister's
apparent obsession with domestic worries.
	   ``We'll just keep at it,'' Clinton said Tuesday, and announced
that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will return to the
Mideast in several weeks.
	   Palestinians said it was increasingly difficult to work with a
weakened government.
	   ``All the talk by Israeli officials about security is not the
security of the Israeli people, but the security of keeping their
seats in the government,'' said Gaza security chief Mohammmed
Dahlan.
	   Compounding Netanyahu's woes, his finance minister, Yaakov
Neeman has decided to quit. In what may have been a snowball
effect, Netanyahu's defense minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, a
supporter of the Wye accord, said he would have his own
announcement to make Friday. The Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot said
Mordechai would back a call for early elections.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Defense Ministry said two senior
Zimbabwean officers were killed and a flight sergeant was captured
when their helicopter gunship crashed behind rebel lines in eastern
Congo.
	   The dead were identified as Col. Afonso Kufa and Squadron Leader
Herbert Vundla. Sgt. Edson Sande survived the crash Sunday and was
believed captured, defense officials said in a statement.
	   Zimbabwe has admitted it suffered casualties in fighting for the
strategic town in Kabalo in eastern Congo in recent days but has
refused to give further information than the statement issued late
Tuesday.
	   Rebels fighting to topple Congolese President Laurent Kabila
claim to have killed 47 Zimbabwean soldiers, including two
commanders, in fighting over Kabalo, a key rebel-held port on the
Congo river, since the weekend.
	   The Defense Ministry said the dead officers were flying in a
French-built Alouette 3 helicopter of the Zimbabwe Air Force when
it crashed from a mechanical failure.
	   The rebels claimed they shot down the Zimbabwean gunship and a
jet fighter.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent troops and arms to
support Kabila in the four-month Congolese conflict.
	   An allied offensive has slowed but not stopped advances by the
rebels, who are backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   --
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Striking workers of the state-owned water
company began returning to work Wednesday, one day after the
military government signed an order to increase minimum wages.
	   The strike, which lasted over a week, had shut off water to the
populous commercial capital, forcing people to scramble for
supplies. Long lines of people carrying jugs of water became a
common sight in the crowded city.
	   Soon after taking power in June, military leader Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar promised to increase the minimum monthly wage
for federal civil servants from dlrs 9 to dlrs 61 _ a more than 600
percent increase _ effective September 1.
	   The increases were also to apply to state civil servants, but
were to be negotiated on a state-by-state basis. The Tuesday order
makes the dlrs 61 minimum wage applicable to all Lagos state
workers as well.
	   Lagos workers initiated the strike because the increase had
still not been applied to them.
	   The water situation would take at least two days to ease,
officials said.
	   --
	   ACCRA, Ghana, (AP) _ Authorities have closed a major regional
hospital after angry Muslim youths threatened the lives of staff
members, a news agency reported.
	   The Kintampo Government Hospital in Ghana's Brong-Ahafo region
was closed down Tuesday following repeated threats and an attack on
the hospital by the youths Thursday, the Ghana News Agency
reported.
	   According to hospital officials, the trouble started after a
doctor performed post-mortem examinations on the bodies of two
Muslims who had died in an accident.
	   Relatives had become angry after they had asked that the bodies
be released immediately for burial, but were asked to wait until
the results were completed. The family, like some other Muslims,
objects to having post-mortem exams performed.
	   The bodies were later released to the families, but aggrieved
family members began making threats and organized the Thursday
attack, the news agency said.
	   It was not clear when the hospital would be reopened.
	   Kintampo is located about 400 kms (240 miles) north of Accra.

Basuki, Tamarine advance to Asian Games women's final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Top seed Tamarine Tanasugarn gave host
Thailand another gold medal chance Wednesday, beating China's Yi
Jingqian 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 and advancing to the Asian Games tennis
final.
	   In Thursday's gold medal match, Tamarine, ranked No. 37 by the
WTA, will face third seed Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia, who found her
game in the first set tie-break and pounded out a 7-6 (7-3), 6-1
victory over China's Li Fang.
	   Errors hurt Yi as Tamarine converted six of 10 break points in
the baseline battle. The Thai, meanwhile, was nailing shots down
the line. On match point, Yi's shot hung on the net briefly before
falling back on her side.
	   A near-capacity crowd cheered on Tamarine with shouts of ``One
more time.''
	   Looking ahead to meeting Basuki, Tamarine said, ``I may have
beaten her three years ago (at the Southeast Asian Games), but I
don't think that will count for much. It's definitely going to be
close.''
	   Basuki, ranked No. 56, played evenly with No. 40 Li through the
first 12 games, but then took control, finishing off the first set
with a serve and volley.
	   Her heavy hitting from the baseline often left Li out of
position in the second set, but she mixed in shots like a lob
volley over Li's head.
	   ``I expect a lot from myself in the finals. I'm thinking very
positively and have high motivation right now,'' Basuki said. I'm
getting lots of support from the Indonesian people here. I just
hope I don't disappoint them.''
	   In men's quarterfinals, Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi beat South
Korea's Lee Hyung-taik 6-4, 7-5, and India's Mahesh Bhupathi
defeated Uzbekistan's Oleg Ogorodov 6-3, 3-6, 7-5.
	   South Korea's Yoon Yong-il and India's Srinath Prahlad had won
semifinal places on Tuesday.
	   India's best hope, Leander Paes, who stands 91st in the ATP
rankings, had to drop out of the games with an injury. He was the
only Asian in the rankings' top 100.

Khai says no apologies expected from former foes

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A day after South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung expressed regret over his country's role in the Vietnam
War for the first time, his Vietnamese counterpart said Wednesday
he doesn't expect any such apologies.
	   The expression of regret came during a meeting between Kim and
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai on the sidelines of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit here.
	   ``We are not asking anyone to apologize or provide us with
reparations,'' Khai told a news conference when asked if the United
States also should make a similar statement.
	   ``If they feel regret for what they did in the past, that's
their decision. We want to close the past, look to the future and
build better relations with other nations.''
	   However, he said he sometimes is irritated by criticism from
countries that invaded Vietnam and had to be driven out now
champion democracy and see Vietnam as a non-democratic country.
	   In a speech to a dinner Wednesday night hosted by Vietnamese
President Tran Duc Luong, Kim referred to an ``unfortunate period
between our two countries'' and expressed hope for ``a pregressive
and future-oriented bilateral relationship.''
	   He also said he hopes that North Korea, which maintains friendly
relations with Hanoi, ``will learn a great lesson from the policy
of reform and openness of Vietnam.''
	   South Korea sent 300,000 troops to Vietnam over about an
eight-year period, fighting alongside U.S. forces. More than 5,000
were killed.
	   It was Kim's first visit to Vietnam since he took office earlier
this year.

Leading Cypriot gangster shot dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) _ A leading Cypriot gangster was shot dead
Wednesday in the latest killing of a long-running gang war, police
said.
	   Gunmen in a car opened fire on Chambis Aeroporos, the leader of
gangland family, when his vehicle stopped at traffic lights in the
southern Cypriot port of Limassol, police said.
	   Chambis was hit by nine bullets and died instantly. His driver,
Chambis Onisiforou, a cousin, was slightly wounded, police said.
	   Chambis, 35, had survived a murder attempt in July 1995 when he
was shot and seriously wounded. He was confined to a wheelchair for
more than a year.
	   His younger brother, Andros, 32, was murdered in July.
	   Chambis, Andros, and a third brother were acquitted earlier this
year of the attempted murder of a rival gang leader.
	   Police believe the gang warfare, which has claimed nearly a
dozen victims in the past few years, is for the control of the
lucrative gambling and prostitution rings in the coastal towns of
Limassol and Larnaca.
	   Justice Minister Nicos Koshis has said the vice rings reap
profits of more than dlrs 2 million a month.

Inter meets Manchester United; Bayern Munich faces Kaiserslautern

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ronaldo goes to Old Trafford and the two German
teams, Bayern Munich and Kaiserslautern, meet each other in the
quarterfinals of the European Champions Cup.
	   Manchester United and Inter Milan, both runners-up in their
domestic leagues last season, were paired in Wednesday's draw. The
first leg is at Old Trafford March 3, and the second at San Siro
two weeks later.
	   The all-German matchup means that Bayern must get past the club
that edged it for the Bundesliga title last season. Right now,
Bayern is top and Kaiserslautern third in the standings.
	   The other quarterfinal pairings have defending titlist and
seven-time champion Real Madrid against Dynamo Kiev, a
quarterfinalist last season, and Juventus, attempting to make the
final for the fourth time in a row, against Greek titlist
Olympiakos.
	   Real Madrid initially drew Inter Milan. But UEFA secretary
Gerhard Aigner had already explained that teams who had qualified
from the same group in the previous round could not be drawn
together. Inter topped its group and Real was second, one of the
two best runners-up.
	   That put Inter back into the pot and, this time, Dynamo Kiev
came out, while Inter was drawn against Manchester United in the
most eye-catching matchup of the round.
	   ``I'm very happy. Manchester United is a great club,'' said
Inter vice president Gianmaria Visconte. ``It will be a fantastic
match. We always have admired Manchester United.''
	   Manchester United chief executive Martin Edwards said that
facing an Italian team was hard enough yet he relished the
opportunity of facing Ronaldo.
	   ``It's a tough draw and it's a great draw in one sense because
of Inter Milan's reputation,'' he said.
	   ``If you are going to win the European Cup you have to be
prepared to play the best teams at some stage. Italian teams have
proved in recent years that they are among the strongest in Europe,
while Inter Milan are a really good side who have arguably the
world's best player in Ronaldo.''
	   Kaiserslautern coach Otto Rehhagel, whose team has already lost
4-0 to Bayern in the Bundesliga this season, was unhappy to have
drawn the Munich powerhouse again.
	   ``That's the most difficult draw we could have gotten,'' he
said. ``Any other club would have been better, Bayern is the
strongest team in this competition.''
	   Bayern coach Ottmar Hitzfeld was delighted. ``It's a team we can
beat and we already did it in the Bundesliga. That's why I think we
can hope to reach the semis,'' he said.
	   Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz said he was thankful that his
team didn't draw Inter again.
	   ``We're very happy that Inter was thrown back into the pot
because they're such a difficult team,'' he said. ``But now we have
to stay focused on playing Dynamo Kiev if we want to win.
	   ``If we start being too relieved about not playing Inter and
thinking it's an easy draw, it would be easy to ruin our chances
and all work this far would be wasted.''
	   Dynamo Kiev president Grigory Surkis, whose team was knocked out
by Juventus at the same stage last season, said he prefered to face
the defending champion later in the competition.
	   ``If you have as your aim to come to the final, the best thing
is to play against the title holder in the final round,'' he said.
``But we will try our best.''
	   Juventus vice president Roberto Bettega said his team, which was
rated the 7-2 favorite by bookmakers Ladbrokes after the pairings,
wouldn't be fooled into thinking it had an easy draw in Greek club
Olympiakos.
	   ``We you start thinking who you want to draw, then you're
dreaming,'' the former Juventus striker said. ``Then there's
reality. The draw gave us Olympiakos and these are the games we
must win and we formulate a strategy for this draw. It will be
difficult because Olympiakos was first in their group and Greek
football is improving.''
	   In the considerably weaker Cup Winners Cup, defending champion
Chelsea faces Valerenga of Norway, thus avoiding Italy's Lazio and
Spanish league leader Mallorca.
	   Lazio meets Greek club Panionis and Mallorca visits Varteks of
Croatia in the first leg, which is March 4.
	   The other quarterfinal is Lokomotiv Moscow against Israeli club
Maccabi Haifa.
	   Only three nations have any interest in the UEFA Cup
quarterfinals with three Italian, three French and two Spanish
clubs going for the title.
	   Yet all three Italian or French teams or both Spanish clubs
could make it to the last four because they managed to avoid each
other. UEFA said it made no effort to keep clubs from the same
countries apart.
	   Olympique Marseille hosts Celta Vigo, which is second in the
Spanish standings, Bologna welcomes Lyon, Bordeaux receives Parma
and AS Roma goes to Atletico Madrid. The matches are March 2 and
16.

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Southeast Asian leaders vowed Wednesday to
take ``bold measures'' to battle a lingering economic crisis, and
Japan promised to provide billions of dollars in loans to help
kick-start a recovery.
	   But in the end, a two-day summit that began with low
expectations finished with little fresh to excite world markets and
investors.
	   The nine leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
clasped hands in a sign of unity at the closing ceremony, belying
the divisions that emerged during their deliberations and the
exceptions they are allowing in their action plan.
	   The agreements that they signed include plans to speed up
implementation of an ASEAN Free Trade Area and provide incentives
for investors over the next two years.
	   The idea is to liberalize their economies in an effort to
encourage a return by investors who have been scared away by the
region's worst economic crisis in a half-century.
	   But Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar were allowed extra time to
implement some of the ``bold measures,'' and exceptions are being
allowed in others.
	   The meeting came just a month after the broader Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit, and trying to put together consensus
on major initiatives proved difficult in a group that includes both
industrialized countries and some of the world's poorest nations.
	   Unity and cooperation were the best the leaders could really
offer.
	   ``You always have difficulties when you have to knock out
compromise that meets the minimum interest of all parties,''
Singapore Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar said. ``While there is
criticism, they must also appreciate that this is a consensus
document.''
	   A joint ASEAN declaration added a number of points from a
pre-summit draft, including a commitment to ``accelerating economic
and financial reforms'' and saying the ``international community
also has a responsibility to support our reform efforts through
bilateral and multilateral assistance.''
	   It also encouraged increased use of ASEAN currencies on trade
within the region and said an early-warning surveillance mechanism
has been put in place to encourage quick action to avoid emerging
risks.
	   After the summit, the leaders met with three ``dialogue
partners'': Japan, China and South Korea.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizi Obuchi presented details of 600
billion yen (dlrs 5.1 billion) in new low-interest loans he
announced earlier in the day to help troubled Asian countries
rebuild their devastated economies. The region's economic
powerhouse has announced other aid in recent weeks.
	   China heard concerns about disputes in the South China Sea, and
South Korea talked about its approach in dealing with North Korea.
	   At the closing session, Vietnam's Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
emphasized ASEAN's pledge of regional cooperation.
	   ``Now we have sufficient grounds to say that the Hanoi summit is
a real bridge joining two centuries, reflecting our determination
to strengthen unity and cooperation for the future of peace,
stability, and sustainable development, responding to the
aspirations of our peoples and the world community,'' he said.
	   But there were obvious disagreements on how best to fight the
regional crisis.
	   In speeches that opened the summit Tuesday, some leaders urged
more open markets to woo foreign investment and others defended the
practice of shielding their economies.
	   Malaysia and Vietnam were at one end of the spectrum, warning of
the dangers of globalization, while Singapore, Thailand and the
Philippines said it was inevitable and should be embraced.
	   As with the opening ceremony, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
again watched the proceedings from the front row.
	   Khai, who had pushed hard for Cambodia's entry into the
Southeast Asian brotherhood, reiterated that the nine-member
grouping had agreed to admit Cambodia, fulfilling its founding
pledge in 1967 to group all 10 Southeast Asian countries under the
ASEAN umbrella.
	   However, the timing of admission remains up in the air. Some
leaders have insisted that Cambodia first must fully establish the
credibility of a newly formed coalition government.
	   Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said ASEAN foreign
ministers will discuss the issue by phone, and a final decision
will be made by the chairman of the ASEAN standing committee.
	   That happens to be Jayakumar of Singapore, which was one of the
chief proponents of delaying Cambodia's membership.
	   ASEAN currently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

South Korea trounces Japan 13-1 in baseball's gold medal game

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS first inning score in fifth graf to 2-1; ADDS quotes

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Park
Chan-ho pitched a four-hitter and his teammates rapped out 14 hits
as South Korea trounced Japan 13-1 Wednesday for the baseball gold
medal of the Asian Games.
	   Park needed to pitch only seven innings under baseball's mercy
rule, which shortens games to that limit if one team is leading by
10 runs. He struck out four and walked two.
	   For winning gold, he and the other team members were promised
deferment from mandatory service in South Korea's military, he
said.
	   ``It's a really big thing for me because I will feel really
comfortable playing in the big leagues,'' he added. Without the
deferment, Park might have had to give up his position with the
Dodgers.
	   Earlier, Taiwan defeated cross-strait rival China 10-6 for the
bronze medal, breaking the game open with a seven-run seventh
inning.
	   Japan's only run was a first-inning homer by Kokichi Akune.
	   By the end of that inning, the Korean ``dream team,'' laden with
professionals, led 2-1 on a double and an error.
	   The Koreans added four more in the second on an RBI single, a
bases-loaded walk, a ground-out and a wild pitch.
	   After designated hitter Park Jae-hong doubled home two runs in
the third, Japan turned to its second reliever of the game, sidearm
pitcher Hitoshi Miyata. The first batter he faced, Kim Dong-joo,
doubled home Park, who went 3-for-4 and batted in three runs,
making it 9-1.
	   The Koreans added four runs in the fifth, capped by Cho
In-sung's two-run single.
	   Masahiro Kimura, who gave up four hits, three walks and five
earned runs in 1 1/3 innings, took the loss. He was one of four
Japanese pitchers for the six innings in which the South Koreans
batted.
	   When the game was halted after the top of the seventh, ecstatic
Korean players tossed several of their teammates into the air,
starting with Park Chan-ho. Then they ran a victory lap around the
field carrying two large Korean flags.
	   ``All my teammates played well,'' Park said. ``I feel
appreciation to the hitters, that they made a lot of runs, so I
could relax.''
	   Commenting on the military deferment, he added: ``I'm really
happy about that, that we got the gold medal, because everybody
that chose to play, they don't have to go (serve).''
	   The team was backed by a large and loud contingent of fans,
including an organized group called the Korea Han-kyoreh cheer
team, whose activities are meant to back reunification of South
Korea with isolationist North Korea.
	   Against a weaker Chinese side in Tuesday's semifinals, South
Korea's Kim Byung-hyun pitched six innings of hitless relief,
striking out 12, in a 9-2 victory.
	   China took a 2-0 fourth-inning lead in Wednesday's bronze medal
game, but Taiwan, famed for its Little League world titles, shot to
a 10-2 lead with three runs in the sixth and the big seventh.
	   In the seventh, Chen Chih-yuan singled in one run, another
scored on a double steal, Pan Chung-wei doubled home two, Lin
Kun-han hit a two-run homer, and Yang Sun-huan doubled in the last
one after China had brought in its second reliever, Lu Jiangang.
	   China scored four in the bottom of the seventh, and the last two
innings were scoreless.
	   Hsu Ming-chieh, who came on in relief of starter Chuan Chin-Her
in the fourth inning, picked up the victory. He gave up five hits
and three earned runs in 5 2/3 innings.
	   The loser was Zhang Wanjun, China's first of two relievers, who
yielded five hits and three earned runs.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres said Wednesday he supports the establishment of a Palestinian
state but urged that no step be taken unilaterally.
	   ``I am for a Palestinian state for the alternative to a
Palestinian state is a poor one,'' he said. But he suggested that
such a move should be negotiated.
	   Peres said his visit had helped dispel bad feelings between
Cyprus and Israel following last month's arrest on the island of
two Israelis on suspicion of spying.
	   Peres said he had ``very, very friendly talks'' with President
Glafcos Clerides, ``and I think all the problems were clarified.''
	   He added that the mission of the two Israelis who have been
described as Mossad agents ``was basically a mistake.''
	   The two Israelis were arrested on Nov. 6 and are to go on trial
for spying and gathering military information on Dec. 21.
	   Peres avoided revealing the nature of the two Israelis' mission
but indicated it was linked to anti-terrorism.
	   ``It wasn't bad intentions or any attempt to spy on Cyprus or
against Cyprus. This is nonsense. It is a local accident which we
regret very much,'' he added.

Partial results of massive Thai loan auction announced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Four bidders have been awarded nine of
39 tranches of outstanding loans auctioned off by Thailand's
Financial Restructuring Authority, in partial results of this
week's auction announced by the authority on Wednesday evening.
	   The FRA is overseeing the cleanup of the country's battered
banking and finance sector. The government has shut down 56
insolvent finance companies and taken over four commercial banks.
	   On Tuesday, 12 bids were submitted on 39 of 45 tranches in an
auction of 370 billion baht (dlrs 10.3 billion) worth of business
loans.
	   Results for the remaining 30 tranches will be announced on
Thursday. No bids were received for the six other tranches.
	   The four companies paid an average of 37 percent of the
aggregate outstanding balance, or the full value of the loans.
	   Kiatnakin Finance and Securities, a Thai firm, won five of the
nine tranches.
	   National Finance won two tranches of loans, while Phra Nakorn
Automobile Ltd. and Global Thai Finance and Securities were the
other winners.
	   Almost all of the 13,731 loans put up for auction via sealed
bids in 45 tranches are non-performing. The winning bids paid in a
range of 25 to 44 cents on the dollar.
	   Kiatnakin Finance is one of only two finance companies, out of
58 whose operations were suspended last year, that was able to come
up with a recapitalization plan good enough to avoid a liquidation
order by the central bank.
	   Kiatnakin sold new shares to a host of local and foreign
companies earlier this year.

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of Kosovo Serbs on Wednesday
mourned six slain Serbs whose deaths have dangerously inflamed
already-high tensions in the separatist province.
	   A mournful crowd of 5,000 gathered to remember the victims in a
tense silence that permeated the western city of Pec, where the
victims of the Monday night shooting were to be buried later in the
day.
	   Another 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a protest rally in the
capital Pristina.
	   Voicing grave concern at the dangerous turn of events this week
in Kosovo, senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on late Tuesday
condemned the deaths as ``appalling beyond words.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, renewed his
determination to suppress ``terrorism.'' A top government body for
the Serbian province, the Temporary Council for Kosovo, said the
killings were ``the most monstrous crime in the series of assaults
by Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population of Kosovo,
a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia.
	   Many fear the Pec killings, along with a border clash this week
between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian rebels, move the
tense province closer to a renewal of all-out war.
	   At least 42 people are reported to have died at the two sites,
and the brutal barroom shooting of six Serbs in Kosovo's
third-largest city prompted protests and threats of retaliation
against rebels among the large Serbian population.
	   Holbrooke, who brokered the October agreement that halted more
than seven months of combat in the separatist Serbian province,
appeared pessimistic about reaching a political settlement that
could stop the continuing carnage.
	   After more than five hours of talks with Milosevic in Belgrade,
he acknowledged Tuesday night that diplomats are nowhere near
bridging the huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethic Albanians
on the province's status.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters. He gave no
details on his talks with Milosevic.
	   While the death toll from Monday's clash between border guards
and rebels trying to bring in arms from Albania was higher _ the
army said it killed 36 guerrillas _ the Pec killings raised more
alarm among international officials because they involved an attack
on civilians. Five teen-agers were among the dead.
	   People in the Pec crowd wept openly Wednesday as the six coffins
were brought to the main square and covered with wreaths. At least
one man in civilian clothing was seen armed with a machine gun.
	   ``Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' said Mirko Simonovic,
principal of the high school where four of the victims were
students. ``They were killed for the simple reason of being
Serbs.''
	   He concluded the speech with a demand that the state ``punish
the perpetrators and do away forever with Albanian terrorism.''
	   Pec, located 75 miles (45 miles) west of the capital Pristina,
has about 150,000 residents. Like Kosovo itself, the population is
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian, but several thousand Serbs also
live there.
	   In his statement, Milosevic said security forces ``will suppress
terrorism'' and that the ``terrorist bandits'' responsible for the
Pec shooting would be ``found, wherever they are.''
	   He also accused U.S. representatives in the U.N. Security
Council of ``losing credibility'' by blocking U.N. statements
denouncing ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Towns and cities have mostly escaped the violence that has
engulfed Kosovo villages this year since Serb forces launched an
offensive in February to crush pro-independence militants.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed in months of fighting
and in sporadic violence since the Oct. 12 informal cease-fire.

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of Kosovo Serbs on Wednesday
mourned six slain Serbs whose deaths have dangerously inflamed
already-high tensions in the separatist province.
	   A mournful crowd of 5,000 gathered to remember the victims in a
tense silence that permeated the western city of Pec, where the
victims of the Monday night shooting were to be buried later in the
day.
	   Another 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a protest rally in the
capital Pristina.
	   Voicing grave concern at the dangerous turn of events this week
in Kosovo, senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on late Tuesday
condemned the deaths as ``appalling beyond words.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, renewed his
determination to suppress ``terrorism.'' A top government body for
the Serbian province, the Temporary Council for Kosovo, said the
killings were ``the most monstrous crime in the series of assaults
by Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population of Kosovo,
a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia.
	   Many fear the Pec killings, along with a border clash this week
between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian rebels, move the
tense province closer to a renewal of all-out war.
	   At least 42 people are reported to have died at the two sites,
and the brutal barroom shooting of six Serbs in Kosovo's
third-largest city prompted protests and threats of retaliation
against rebels among the large Serbian population.
	   Holbrooke, who brokered the October agreement that halted more
than seven months of combat in the separatist Serbian province,
appeared pessimistic about reaching a political settlement that
could stop the continuing carnage.
	   After more than five hours of talks with Milosevic in Belgrade,
he acknowledged Tuesday night that diplomats are nowhere near
bridging the huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethic Albanians
on the province's status.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters. He gave no
details on his talks with Milosevic.
	   While the death toll from Monday's clash between border guards

Bluefin tuna sushi main course at EU meeting on 1999 fishing quotas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union fisheries ministers are
set for a bitter fight Thursday over which fleets will be able to
catch dwindling quotas of bluefin tuna and take them to the
Japanese port markets, where they are a high-priced delicacy for
exclusive sushi tables.
	   The 15 EU fisheries ministers will also set the 1999 catch
quotas for other fish, but rivalry is expected to be at its most
bitter when the fate of about dlrs 250 million of bluefin tuna, one
of the world's most expensive fish, will be served at the
negotiating table.
	   ``It will be a big battle,'' said an EU official from Austria,
which will chair the meeting expected to last into Friday.
	   Bluefin tuna is one of the most sought-after fish for sushi and
sashimi. On the Tokyo fish market, prices can easily reach dlrs
15,000 a ton. Ahead of the financial crisis, prices were double and
one fish, which can weigh up to 700 kilos (1,500 pounds) was said
to have sold for a record dlrs 83,000 at auction.
	   Because of years of overfishing, the fish has become ever rarer,
and the 15-nation EU has seen its catch quota decline to 20,165 in
1999 compared to 28,108 tons this year. On top of that, the
international ICCAT that sets the Atlantic tuna quotas, has
penalized the EU an additional 4,029 tons for overfishing in 1997.
	   The resulting 16,136 tons have to be divided up between Italy,
Greece, Spain, Portugal and France. Greece and Italy overfished
their share of bluefin tuna in 1997 yet refuse to carry the full
penalty burden and are counting on more EU solidarity, the Austrian
official, who demanded anonymity, said. ``It would amount to
substantive losses for the two,'' the official said.
	   Under the EU's executive Commission proposals, Greece would lose
54 percent of its quota, even though its overfishing even exceeded
that, and Italy, which overfished its quota by about 30 percent
would lose 16 percent.
	   The quotas for other fish also reflect the dwindling stocks in
the Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean. The fishing industry has
already harshly criticized the cuts proposed by the EU Commission,
which will be the base for negotiations Thursday.
	   The Commission said it took into account scientific warnings
that several stock were in dire need of recovery before calling on
cuts. But it also considered the plight of fishers, it said.
	   Proposals for total allowable catches include a 47 percent cut
in Whiting in the northern Skagerrak and Kattegat, a 40 percent cut
in Saithe in northern waters and cuts by up to 30 percent in
Haddock.

Rebel Chechen warlord denies killing foreigners, defies government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSLAN MUSAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   URUS-MARTAN, Russia (AP) _ A leader of a militant Islamic group
in the breakaway region of Chechnya today denied accusations that
the group killed four kidnapped Westerners.
	   Chechnya introduced a one-month state of emergency after the
men's severed heads were found along a road last week. It was an
unusually gruesome display of lawlessness, even for Chechnya where
kidnappings have become a lucrative business since the war with
Russia in 1994-96.
	   The Chechen government has blamed Arbi Barayev, a warlord whose
fighters are based in Urus-Martan, Chechnya's second-largest city
located 12 miles southwest of the capital, Grozny.
	   But Barayev's second-in-command, Uvai Akhmadov, said
``accomplices'' of President Aslan Maskhadov were responsible for
the deaths. He didn't offer any evidence to support his claim.
	   ``We didn't cut the foreigners' heads,'' Akhmadov said as his
fighters patrolled the streets of Urus-Martan, guns in hand.
Earlier they dug trenches around the town.
	   ``We are ready for war. A true Muslim will go to heaven if he
dies for his faith,'' Akhmadov said.
	   The four men _ three from Britain and one from New Zealand _
were kidnapped Oct. 3 while installing a cellular phone system in
Chechnya. The government says they were killed as it was mounting a
rescue attempt.
	   Maskhadov, a top rebel military commander during the war with
Russia, won presidential elections in a landslide in early 1997
after Russian troops left. But he has been unable to impose his
authority.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Rome court Wednesday lifted restrictions on
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, leaving him free to leave the
country.
	   The ruling followed a decision by Germany to withdraw the
international arrest warrant it had issued for Ocalan, who was
wanted on terrorism charges, news reports said.
	   ``It is an unlawful decision and a violation of the
international consensus to fight against terrorism,'' Turkish
Deputy Premier and Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin told private NTV
television by telephone from Brussels.
	   ``If Germany does not want him, he has to be extradited to
Turkey where he committed murders,'' he added.
	   Sezgin also said that ``the necessary response will be given,''
but didn't elaborate.
	   A spokesman for Ocalan, Ahmed Yaman, said that for the time
being the Kurdish leader has no intention of leaving the Rome villa
where he has been kept under police surveillance so far.

Asian Games soccer high helps Thailand forget crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For two days, Thailand forgot about the
Asian crisis and dreamed again, of victory and gold medals and a
place in the soccer sun.
	   But the cheer that rose Monday over Bangkok when a gritty Thai
side, down two men, defeated mighty South Korea with an extra-time
goal in the Asian Games quarterfinals was replaced by a groan
Wednesday.
	   Thirty seconds into the semifinal, before a Thai player got a
foot on the ball, Kuwait's Husain al-Khodari headed home the first
of what became three Kuwaiti goals. The Thais never got on the
boards.
	   Gone were the dreams of a final Saturday against Iran. The
70,000 people packed into the seats, stairwells and corridors of
Rajamangala National Stadium screamed themselves hoarse for an
equalizer they never got.
	   ``Nobody thought we would lose in the first minute,'' said
Theeratham Pruangpradisit, 37, a telecoms manager who, in the Thai
way, smiled in the face of heartbreak. ``Two days ago, there was
lots of hope. Now, there's zero.''
	   Thailand was awarded the right to stage the 13th Asian Games
when its economy was still one of the Asian miracles.
	   Then came the Asian crisis, which struck first in Thailand and
brought crashing banks and millions of lost jobs. Organization of
the games fell into such chaos that they nearly were moved
elsewhere.
	   In the end, despite a lot of glitches, they came together _
something of a new Thai miracle, organizers said, and on Dec. 6,
the country settled into two weeks of sport.
	   ``This has been a good time to forget the economic crisis and
other problems,'' said Theeratham. ``Asian Games fever has been
great. Monday, we'll have to get back to the economy.''
	   For him, like many Thais, there's only one Asian Games sport:
soccer. And the games have been the renaissance of the national
soccer team from a disgrace to a semifinalist for the first time _
for Thailand, akin to winning a World Cup.
	   A few months ago, Thailand was banned from international play
for two months, along with Indonesia, after both sides played to
lose in the Tiger Cup to avoid facing host nation Vietnam in the
next round. The incident shamed the national soccer organization.
	   An Englishman, Peter Withe, was brought in as a new coach, but
his influence was thrown into doubt when his squad brawled with
Qatar's team during an Asian Games warm-up friendly three weeks
ago.
	   News accounts of the thrown match and brawl were the first times
the soccer team had ever been seen by so many world television
viewers.
	   Then came the games. Thailand drew two easy preliminary groups,
getting through with a mixed record that failed to impress next to
the prowess shown by continental powers South Korea, Iran, Japan
and China.
	   But in a tournament in which a previously unknown Kuwaiti has
scored nine goals and tiny Oman upset Iran, the Thais made it to
the quarterfinals _ where they were expected to fall to South
Korea.
	   When they instead won, national morale hit the highest level
seen since the currency was devalued July 2, 1997.
	   ``It's been a bad year,'' said Noi Srisuiriyachai, 28, an office
worker who took the day off to see the match. ``For two weeks at
least, people have been happy.''
	   Now what? Though riot police had deployed in force Wednesday,
fearing mass violence if Thailand lost, the stadium emptied with
people dancing, playing tambourines, smiling and singing.
	   Withe, the ebullient Englishman, summed it up:
	   ``Thailand, don't look disheartened. Just be proud of what your
players have done for you.''

International media commission bans Croatian TV program from Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's independent media
commission moved Wednesday to prevent Croatian television programs
from being broadcast within Bosnian territory, it said in a
statement.
	   The commission, charged with licensing and restructuring
Bosnia's media, denied Bosnian Croat-run broadcasting company
Erotel a license for distributing Croatian-made programs.
	   In a statement, the commission said Croatian, TV programs are
not compatible with the framework of the Bosnian peace agreement
and Erotel is ``an organization controlled by a foreign
government.''
	   Last September, the commission placed Erotel's transmitters,
facilities and frequencies under it's custody and ordered the
broadcaster to conform to international media standards being
enforced by the commission.
	   Since then, the commission has also participated in negotiations
between Erotel and Bosnian state TV, which has undergone changes to
meet the needs of Bosnia's three ethnic communities _ the Croats,
Muslims and Serbs.
	   Starting in January, Bosnian state TV is to establish a
predominantly Croat channel that will meet the needs of the Bosnian
Croat without reinforcing cultural or ethnic divisions. Croatian TV
programming had previously been characterized as inflammatory or at
least unhelpful for Bosnia's peace.
	   Many Bosnian Croats, especially those living in Croat controlled
areas in the southwest of the country view themselves as citizens
of neighboring Croatia and the territory they run as Croatian
proper.

Three U.S. researchers awarded Japan Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two U.S. scientists who enhanced understanding of
the immune system and an American researcher who pioneered a coding
system vital to information technology won the 1999 Japan Prize on
Tuesday.
	   The Tokyo-based Science and Technology Foundation of Japan
honored Wesly Peterson, 74, for his establishment of a coding
theory used to correct errors in digital communications systems,
making them reliable.
	   The foundation awarded Harvard University biochemistry
professors Jack Strominger, 73, and Don Wiley, 54, for their work
in clarifying the structures of antigens in the immune system.
	   The researchers will be presented their awards at a ceremony
scheduled for April 28 in Tokyo. Peterson will be awarded 50
million yen (dlrs 431,000), while Strominger and Wiley will receive
25 million yen (dlrs 216,000) each.
	   Peterson, a professor of information and computer sciences at
the University of Hawaii at Manoa, ``contributed significantly to
today's reliable digital communications,'' the selection committee
said.
	   Strominger and Wiley were credited with opening up ``a new
avenue of research for the detailed molecular understanding of
transplantation rejection, tumor immunity and the response to
foreign pathogens.''
	   The Japan Prize was first awarded in 1985. Winners are selected
from two fields each year.

Czech Senate elects speaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Libuse Benesova, deputy chairwoman
of the opposition Civic Democratic Party was narrowly elected
speaker of the Czech Republic's upper chamber of Parliament, state
radio reported Wednesday.
	   In a second round of voting, Benesova won approval from 40 of a
total 79 senators voting _ exactly the simple majority she needed
to be elected.
	   Incumbent Petr Pithart received 37 votes. Two votes were invalid
in the secret ballot and two senators were absent from the 81-seat
legislature.
	   Pithart beat Benesova in first-round voting 37-36, but missed
reelection when he failed to reach the simple majority of 40 votes.
	   Benesova's victory was expected after a stability pact was
struck between her party and the governing Social Democrats
following the June 1998 early general elections.
	   Czech Premier Milos Zeman's Social Democrats won in June, with
the Civic Democratic Party of former Premier Vaclav Klaus a close
second, but neither of them were able to form a majority
government.
	   Under the deal, the Civic Democratic Party ensured the passage
of Zeman's minority cabinet in Parliament in exchange for top
parliamentary posts.

Lawmakers approve appointment of spokesman for Tung
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A legislative committee on Wednesday approved a
plan to appoint a spokesman for Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa, and pay him twice as much as either of the top U.S. or
British press secretaries.
	   Although most legislators agree that Tung needs to brush up his
image, some were outraged by the fat paycheck proposed for his spin
doctor.
	   If approved, Stephen Lam, a career civil servant who would
become Tung's chief spokesman and media strategist, would make a
monthly salary of 181,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 23,205).
	   By comparison, White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart makes
80,560 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 10,328) a month, while British
Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, makes
98,450 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12,621), the South China
Morning Post reported.
	   ``I don't think Mr. Lam has any reason to convince us his
workload is much higher than the White House spokesman,'' the Post
quoted Democratic Party legislator Lee Wing-tat as saying.
	   Hong Kong has a population of 6.6 million, compared with 271
million in the United States.
	   Despite the public outrage, the legislature's establishment
committee approved the plan after heavy government lobbying
Wednesday.
	   The finance committee will next vote on the proposal.
	   Tung, defending the proposal, told reporters Wednesday his
spokesman would have ``a very important responsibility to
communicate with you and with the community at large about
government policies.''
	   The former shipping tycoon, a pragmatic conservative who was
handpicked by Beijing to lead Hong Kong after it regained the
former British colony's sovereignty in July, 1997, has said he
needs a friendlier image.

Asia using African example, says official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Asian soccer chiefs were just following
the successful example set by Africa when that continent threatened
to boycott the 1994 World Cup, a leading official said Thursday.
	   Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, president of the Kuwaiti soccer
federation and the Olympic Council of Asia, said he could not
understand a negative reaction to the Asian Football Confederation
threats to boycott the 2002 Cup over the issue of qualification
spots.
	   Japan and South Korea are co-hosts for the 2002 World Cup and
will be exempt from a possible boycott. The AFC said Tuesday it
would send a delegation to meet world governing body FIFA to
discuss the allocation of places for Asia in 2002.
	   Asia had three direct qualifiers for this year's World Cup, with
another team, Iran, advancing after a playoff with Oceania leader
Australia.
	   FIFA has announced it will allow two other teams to join Japan
and South Korea in 2002 but the AFC is seeking another chance,
bringing its allocation to 2 1/2 through qualification.
	   ``Some people in Japan and Korea say we should not have
threatened a boycott but we are not considering a boycott on
political grounds such as in Moscow Olympics in 1980,'' Sheihk
Ahmad said Wednesday. ``This is a sports case.''
	   He said Africa got away with threats before the 1994 Cup, played
in the United States, and was able to get three teams into the
finals instead of the two first set by FIFA.
	   ``I don't know why there was a bad reaction,'' Sheikh Ahmad
said. ``Africa threatened a boycott in the United States and it
worked. I hope FIFA understands our point and we deal with it like
a family.''
	   The formula of a boycott exempting Japan and South Korea
balances the demands of Arab members to retaliate against FIFA
while taking into account the millions spent by the two Asian
nations to jointly stage the cup finals.
	   Committee members said Asia was not ``treated fairly or taken
seriously'' by FIFA despite being home to 40 percent of the world's
population and comprising a large number of television viewers.

Kosovo's Rugova receives Sakharov peace prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ Ibrahim Rugova, leader of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians, was awarded the European Parliament's Sakharov
peace prize on Wednesday for his efforts to find a peaceful outcome
to the province's drive for independence.
	   Rugova, who was selected for the prize in October, received the
award during a ceremony in Strasbourg, where the Parliament is
holding its monthly session.
	   ``This prize represents, for me and for the people of Kosovo, an
important recognition of our pacifist struggle and of our
sacrifices,'' the 54-year old Rugova told the European parliament.
	   Kosovo's population is almost 90 percent ethnic Albanian, many
of whom want independence from Serbia or at least union with
next-door Albania.
	   Rugova was elected as head of the biggest Albanian party, the
pro-independence League of Democratic Kosovo, in 1989, when
Belgrade revoked Kosovo's nearly two decades of autonomy.

Europarliament eyes no-confidence vote in Commission over fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ The European Parliament set the stage
Wednesday for a de facto confidence vote in the European Commission
over perceived flaws in its anti-fraud policies.
	   Ahead of Thursday's vote, the 626-member parliament was split
over whether to endorse the 1996 accounts as finalized by the EU
executive amid questions of whether it spent that budget wisely.
	   EU Budget Commissioner Erkki Liikanen argues he has met all
demands for tighter financial controls.
	   Yet many in the parliament deny he has gone far enough to
guarantee regular fraud reports, to keep national justice officials
informed of investigations or to create an independent anti-fraud
office.
	   A vote withholding approval of the 1996 budget was first planned
for last March, but the Commission was given a reprieve. If passed,
it would be seen as damaging to the Commission's standing and could
be followed by a formal no-confidence vote.
	   Under the EU treaty, the parliament can only fire the entire
20-member EU executive panel, not individual commissioners.
	   The European Union has long been hounded by reports and
allegations of fraud.
	   On Nov. 17, the EU Court of Auditors estimated fraud and
financial irregularities amounted to 5 percent of the EU's 1997
budget of 83 billion European currency units (dlrs 97 billion)
budget.
	   In recent weeks, there has been a stream of new allegations
aimed at the Commission involving financial mismanagement and
cronyism in its humanitarian aid and vocational training programs.

Imelda Marcos, daughter asked to testify in Senate hearing on
</HEADLINE>
wealth claims

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The widow of dictator Ferdinand
Marcos and her eldest daughter have been asked to testify in a
Senate investigation into her latest claims that Marcos entrusted
his fabulous wealth to his associates, a senator said Wednesday.
	   Imelda Marcos early this month claimed that her family owns much
of the country and plans to sue her husband's former ``cronies''
who have refused to turn over the wealth he entrusted to them.
	   Senator Aquilino Pimentel Jr, chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon
committee, said he has sent an invitation to Mrs. Marcos and her
daughter, Imee Marcos-Manotoc, who is also a member of the House of
Representatives.
	   A lawyer for Mrs. Marcos, who requested anonymity, said he has
advised her not to appear at the hearing on Friday.
	   Mrs. Marcos and her lawyers reportedly are planning to sue to
try to recover at least 500 billion pesos (dlrs 12.65 billion) in
equity in more than 100 top Philippine corporations that were
allegedly entrusted by Marcos to his associates.
	   ``We practically own everything in the Philippines,'' Mrs.
Marcos was quoted as saying.
	   ``The senators who want to grill her and ask for evidence of
ownership of the 500 billion pesos just want to gather more
information in aid of prosecution, which is not their duty in the
first place,'' Mrs. Marcos' lawyer said.
	   ``This is Mrs. Marcos' legal fight against the cronies and the
senators should instead help her recover those assets in the hands
of trustees so she can distribute them to the Filipino people,''
the lawyer added.
	   Senator Raul Roco, chairman of the Senate committee on banks,
said he has asked the Securities and Exchange Commission, to submit
documents showing ownership and capitalization of at least 20 of
the 100 firms identified by Mrs. Marcos.
	   Mrs. Marcos claims her family had controlling interests in such
companies as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., the
biggest telecommunications firm in the country, in which Hong
Kong-based First Pacific recently acquired controlling interest; as
well as San Miguel Corp., the largest food and beverage
conglomerate in the nation.
	   She also claims ownership of major shares in the United Coconut
Planters Bank and Allied Bank and Asia Brewery _ both owned by
business tycoon Lucio Tan, who is also chairman and majority owner
of the ailing Philippine Airlines.
	   The government has said Marcos illegally enriched himself during
his 20-year administration. It has put claims on Marcos' wealth,
including about dlrs 570 million in his Swiss deposits now held in
an escrow account in a Philippine bank.
	   His Swiss accounts are also being claimed by 9,539 Filipinos who
won a class action suit for human rights violations against the
Marcos estate and were awarded dlrs 2 billion in damages.
	   Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986 and died in exile
in Hawaii three years later. He denied any wrongdoing.

With lawyers harassed, Chinese dissidents go to trial alone
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 5th graf pvs `Qin ... ' with 2 grafs to UPDATE with
Wang's brother and sister told not to attend trial; picks up 6th
graf pvs `Qin, 44 ... '
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With attorneys locked up, harassed or plain
scared, two prominent dissidents will defend themselves against
charges of subversion Thursday in China's highest-profile dissident
trials in two years.
	   Qin Yongmin's and Wang Youcai's families were running out of
options Wednesday to help the pair, leading organizers of a budding
opposition political party. Qin's family pleaded for a postponement
at Wuhan's Intermediate People's Court, but court officials denied
the request.
	   Police have detained one lawyer and threatened another, and
subtler pressures have been used on others, family members said.
Given the interference, Wang Youcai's wife assumes he will be
convicted.
	   ``Whether he has a lawyer or not, whatever he says, the
government has already decided,'' Hu Jiangxia said.
	   Qin and Wang will be tried separately, in cities 500 kilometers
(300 miles) apart and in proceedings attended only by some family
members and a few observers selected by the courts.
	   Police held Wang's brother and sister for more than 8 hours
Wednesday and ordered them not to attend the trial. To make sure,
Wang Youhua said they were told to return to the police station
Thursday.
	   Qin, 44, and Wang, 31, are accused of inciting the subversion of
state power, apparently for helping to organize the China Democracy
Party. They face from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted
under the harshest aspects of the law.
	   By moving against Qin, Wang and the China Democracy Party, the
ruling Communist Party appears to be signaling its determination to
crush challenges to its monopoly on power. Authorities have
detained or questioned more than 30 people associated with the
party in a 17-day-old crackdown.
	   Qin, a democracy campaigner for 20 years, and Wang, a student
leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy movement, are among
the most active and influential members of China's dissident
community. A third prominent member of the dissident community, Xu
Wenli, was also arrested in the crackdown, but not yet charged.
	   To prevent displays of solidarity outside Wang's trial, police
have detained at least ten dissidents in the eastern city of
Hangzhou, a Hong Kong-based rights group reported. The Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said many
more are missing and believed to be in custody.
	   To prosecute Wang, authorities violated the minimal rights
guaranteed suspects under Chinese law and ignored court orders, his
wife said.
	   ``Even the judge asked me to hire a lawyer, but while I was
doing this, some people were doing things to stop me,'' Hu Jiangxia
said.
	   During one meeting with a potential defense attorney, a police
official stormed in and said, ```Don't do anything for them. Don't
take this case. Whoever takes the case, you can't win,''' Hu
recounted.
	   Four law firms refused to take Qin's case, his brother Qin
Xiaoguang said. The Information Center said one lawyer who
initially agreed to represent Qin on Monday went missing for four
hours and then called Qin's family to withdraw.
	   Dispirited by the harsh treatment, Qin's family argued over
whether to attend the trial. Qin Xiaoguang said he and his father
have decided to stay away to protest the unfairness, but another
brother will go.
	   Three dissidents from northeastern China sent an open letter to
China's legislature and the Supreme People's Court appealing for
fair trials, the Information Center said. It added that authorities
violated China's own laws by not ensuring Wang and Qin have
adequate representation.
	   The letter was the latest in a string of petitions demonstrating
the appeal of both Wang and Qin and the idea of the China Democracy
Party.
	   Since Wang publicly announced in June that he and others in
Hangzhou were setting up the party, dissidents in at least 14
provinces and cities have set up party branches. Authorities have
refused their applications to register the party as required by
law.
	   Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has put on
trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. He
was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-year
sentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile.

Human Rights Watch: Russia's state orphanages brutal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tens of thousands of children are confined in
brutal conditions in Russian state orphanages and systematically
deprived of fundamental rights, the Human Rights Watch advocacy
group charged in a report released Wednesday.
	   About 200,000 orphaned and abandoned children live in state
institutions in Russia. Many are subjected to physical and
psychological abuse, and are deprived of medical treatment, social
stimulation and other care.
	   Worst off are the approximately 30,000 children incarcerated in
homes for the disabled, said Kathleen Hunt, the report's author.
They are written off as ineducable, and in some institutions they
are locked in dark rooms, tied to benches and straitjacketed, or
left in their beds permanently.
	   The report documented instances when orphanage staff members
struck children, shoved their heads in toilets, and squeezed their
hands in a vise. It said that staff members encouraged what the
children call hazing or abuse by older children, locked children in
freezing rooms for days, and punished attempts to run away by
sending children to psychiatric hospitals.
	   Staff members also give the children strong sedatives without
medical supervision.
	   Children in the institutions are exposed ``to appalling levels
of abuse and neglect that stunt their development and relegate them
to a social underclass,'' Hunt told a news conference in Moscow.
	   ``Abandoned infants, toddlers and older children with
disabilities are ``languishing in terminal idleness, deprived of
touch, sound, visual stimulation and love.''
	   Russia's political and economic turmoil has taken a heavy toll
on families. The number of children put in state custody each year
has doubled over the past five years, to some 113,000 a year, Human
Rights Watch said. Some are then provided with guardians and escape
institutionalization.
	   Others are stamped for life in the orphanages, where few manage
to develop the skills necessary to cope with everyday life.
According to data collected by Russia's Prosecutor General, about
6,000 of the 15,000 children released each year when they reach
maturity will be homeless. About 40 percent get involved in crime,
30 percent become alcoholics or drug addicts, and 10 percent commit
suicide.
	   The ones judged ``oligophrenic'' (having small brains) at age
four have virtually no chance of appealing the diagnosis later in
life, and are condemned to a life in closed institutions.
	   Human Rights Watch said that the abuse in orphanages was
occurring ``with the knowledge of officials at the highest
levels.''
	   It called on officials to stop encouraging parents to surrender
their disabled children to the state, and urged that children's
mental state be diagnosed after extensive observation _ not in a
single session by doctors who have never seen the child before.
	   Orphanage officials attribute the problems to chronic
underfunding, faced by many Russian state institutions.
	   In the long term, Russia should aim to remove as many children
as possible from state institutions and provide them with
alternative forms of upbringing, such as day care for children
living at home, foster families and small, innovative children's
homes where staff help the children develop to their full
potential, Human Rights Watch said.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ World powers frustrated with the pace of
reconciliation in Bosnia approved Wednesday a plan to advance the
process and warned fractious ethnic leaders that foreign aid is not
open-ended.
	   The Bosnia Peace Implementation Council endorsed the blueprint
after a two-day meeting called to review progress in implementing
the Dayton peace accords, which ended Bosnia's 1992-1995 war among
Moslems, Croats and Serbs.
	   The council, which comprises more than 40 countries and
international organizations, set out a package of measures for
reforming the Bosnian economy, strengthening government
institutions and encouraging the return of tens of thousands of
refugees and displaced persons.
	   It stated that some success in these areas has already been
made, saying ``a lasting peace within Bosnia and Herzegovina is
starting to take root.''
	   But it warned that Bosnia is still in no condition to survive
without outside help.
	   ``Without the scaffolding of international support, it would
collapse,'' the council said in a 30-page declaration. The document
was hammered out around a large triangular table symbolizing
Bosnia's three ethnic groups.
	   The Dayton accord, reached in December 1995, carved Bosnia up
into a Serb Republic and a Moslem-Croat Federation, each with their
own government, and a nominal central government linking them. Some
30,000 troops of the NATO-led Stabilization Force keep the peace
among ethnic communities that remain deeply distrustful of each
other three years after the fighting stopped.
	   The international community's top peace coordinator, Carlos
Westendorp, said that in general terms Bosnia's biggest problem in
getting back on its feet is lingering ultra-nationalism. ``The
mentality that led to the war is still there,'' he said.
	   ``The international community has helped a lot and is willing to
continue helping. But it is high time that the authorities of that
country assume their responsibilities,'' he added.
	   On the aid front, the council reminded Bosnian leaders that
their Balkan nation is among the world's ``most assisted
countries'' and that this multi-billion dollar aid will soon start
to dwindle.
	   ``Bosnia and Herzegovina must use the time that remains to
prepare for life without total reliance on foreign aid, and to face
up to the challenge of transforming the economy to generate jobs
and a better standard of living.''
	   Specifically, leaders were urged to speed up sales of state
assets to promote a market-oriented economy, set up a properly
functioning capital market and banking system and fight corruption
and tax evasion.
	   The council said refugees returning to areas where they are a
minority often face obstruction if not outright hostility by local
authorities. So the council will now link aid disbursements to
cooperation in encouraging people to come back to their pre-war
homes.
	   The panel also said it wanted Serb authorities who dominate the
disputed city of Brcko to do more to encourage the return of
Moslems and Croats who made up the majority there before the war.
	   Brcko, under international administration but nominally part of
the Serb Republic, is crucial to the entity because it links the
two chunks of land that make up the Republic. Both the latter and
the federation claim the city, and an international arbitration
committee has twice postponed a ruling. It is now scheduled for
sometime next year.
	   Serb Republic Prime Minister Milorad Dodik sounded a
surprisingly upbeat tone on cooperation with Moslems and Croats,
saying the communities were in fact working together and would
continue to do so.
	   ``We've started walking along this difficult path of peace,'' he
said.

Leading Cypriot gangster shot dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) _ A leading Cypriot gangster was shot dead
Wednesday in the latest killing of a long-running gang war, police
said.
	   Gunmen in a car opened fire on Chambis Aeroporos, the leader of
gangland family, when his vehicle stopped at traffic lights in the
southern Cypriot port of Limassol, police said.
	   Chambis was hit by nine bullets and died instantly. His driver,
Chambis Onisiforou, a cousin, was slightly wounded, police said.
	   Chambis, 35, had survived a murder attempt in July 1995 when he
was shot and seriously wounded. He was confined to a wheelchair for
more than a year.
	   His younger brother, Andros, 32, was murdered in July.
	   Chambis, Andros, and a third brother were acquitted earlier this
year of the attempted murder of a rival gang leader.
	   Police believe the gang warfare, which has claimed nearly a
dozen victims in the past few years, is for the control of the
lucrative gambling and prostitution rings in the coastal towns of
Limassol and Larnaca.
	   Justice Minister Nicos Koshis has said the vice rings reap
profits of more than dlrs 2 million a month.

Czech Senate elects opposition leader as speaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Libuse Benesova, deputy chairwoman
of the opposition Civic Democratic Party, was narrowly elected
speaker of the Czech Republic's upper chamber of Parliament, state
radio reported Wednesday.
	   In a second round of voting, Benesova won approval from 40 of a
total 79 senators voting _ exactly the simple majority she needed
to be elected.
	   Incumbent Petr Pithart received 37 votes. Two votes were ruled
invalid in the secret ballot and two senators were absent from the
81-seat legislature.
	   Pithart beat Benesova in first-round voting 37-36, but missed
re-election when he failed to reach the 40-vote majority.
	   Benesova's victory was expected after a pact was struck between
her party and the governing Social Democrats following the June
general elections.
	   Czech Premier Milos Zeman's Social Democrats won, with the Civic
Democratic Party of former Premier Vaclav Klaus a close second, but
neither of them were able to form a majority government.
	   Under the deal, the Civic Democratic Party ensured the passage
of Zeman's minority Cabinet in Parliament in exchange for top
parliamentary posts.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Chinese vice president not responding
in discussion on Spratlys &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-ASEAN Summit &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao did not
directly respond to comments about the disputed Spratly Islands in
a meeting with Southeast Asian leaders Wednesday, Philippine
President Joseph Estrada said.
	   ``Unfortunately when I raised that question ... the vice
president of China did not elaborate anything. Maybe he was pressed
for time,'' Estrada said.
	   Estrada told a news conference that Hu did not suggest any
initiatives to ease tensions over Mischief Reef, a part of the
Spratlys where the Philippines has accused China of building up a
military presence.
	   Tensions over conflicting claims to the Spratlys were discussed
at a meeting between Hu and leaders of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations following the organization's annual summit.
	   The Spratlys, which sit astride busy sea lanes in the South
China Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and
in part by Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
	   Each country except Brunei has soldiers stationed there, and all
except China and Taiwan are ASEAN members.
	   Last month, Manila lodged a protest with Beijing after Chinese
workers began enlarging buildings erected on Mischief Reef. Both
countries claim the reef.
	   China says the concrete structures are shelters for fishermen,
but Manila says they could be used militarily because of their
extensive docking areas and satellite communications equipment.
	   China and the Philippines will hold further talks on the issue
at the ministerial level ``when conditions are right,'' Foreign
Secretary Domingo Siazon told reporters earlier.
	   Siazon said all sides recommitted themselves to follow earlier
pacts _ calling for a peaceful resolution of the various claims _
at the meeting with the ASEAN leaders.
	   ``I hope that the message got through that the ASEAN countries
really wish to have improved relations with China,'' Siazon said.
``I think everyone in this conference is sincere in wanting to find
a peaceful solution to the South China Sea issue.''
	   Siazon had warned Tuesday that the disputed islands have become
``an accident waiting to happen,'' and ASEAN foreign ministers were
said to be sharply critical of China's role in the Spratlys during
a private meeting Saturday.
	   Those criticisms were contained in an internal ASEAN document
not distributed to the press, ASEAN sources said.
	   Siazon said the issue was raised ``very diplomatically,'' in the
meeting with Hu.
	   In its final declaration on the Hanoi summit, ASEAN called on
all disputants to ``exercise restrain and to refrain from taking
actions that are inimical to the peace, security and stability of
Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region.''
	   ASEAN also includes Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore and
Thailand.

Trial opens in death of teenage basketball fan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Amid heavy police security, the trial of
two policemen accused of taking part in the fatal beating of a
13-year-old boy who was leaving a basketball game opened Wednesday
in northern Poland.
	   The death of Przemek Czaja in January sparked three nights of
rioting in the Baltic coast city of Slupsk that injured 101 people
and caused 200,000 zlotys (dlrs 57,000) in damage.
	   Police erected a temporary fence around the provincial
courthouse in Koszalin, 436 kilometers (260 miles) northwest of
Warsaw, for the trial. Entry was restricted to those with special
passes.
	   A former policeman, identified only as Dariusz W., is charged
with deliberately causing injury and unintentionally causing
Czaja's death. If convicted, he faces up to 15 years in prison.
	   Another policeman, identified as Robert K., faces up to five
years in prison if convicted of failing to help the injured boy,
who died at the scene.
	   Both defendants pleaded innocent. Police initially said the boy
died after falling and hitting his head on a post, but an autopsy
said the fatal wound was caused by a blow from a weapon like a
police baton.
	   Czaja was injured after attending a basketball game in Slupsk.
Police said they were reacting to hooliganism, but witnesses said
Czaja and others only were jaywalking when police attacked them.

Doping-tainted doctor dropped from ski star's staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A former East German doctor convicted of
giving performance-enhancing drugs is being dropped from the
training center used by Austrian ski star Hermann Maier, the
Austrian news agency APA said Wednesday.
	   The doctor, Bernd Pansold, is leaving at the end of the year,
said Heinrich Bergmueller, chief of the independent Obertauern
Olympic training center.
	   Maier, double Olympic gold medalist at the Nagano Olympics this
winter, came under increasing pressure to severe his ties with
Pensold after his conviction by a Berlin court earlier this month.
	   A Berlin court found the former East German physiologist guilty
of administering performance-enhancing drugs to nine underage
athletes from 1975-84 even though he knew the drugs were dangerous.
Pensold was fined 14,000 marks (dlrs 8,200).
	   Over the weekend, the Austrian Skiing Federation stepped up
pressure on Maier to cut his ties to Pensold. The Obertauern center
is not under the federation's jurisdiction.
	   Maier, last season's overall World Cup champion, has always
rejected any doping allegations and said he used Pensold as a
performance analyst, paying for his services out of his own pocket.
	   Pensold, in an interview with the upcoming edition of the Wiener
magazine, also rejected any doping accusations.
	   ``I would be an idiot if I _ with the reputation I have _ gave
drugs to Hermann Maier,'' Pensold was quoted as telling the
magazine in excerpts released in advance of publication.
	   Pensold said he was only using his 30 years of experience as a
sports doctor to devise Maier's practice and stamina training.
	   ``Any doping investigator could check us daily. But nobody has
ever come,'' Pensold said.
	   Pensold said that if the entire Austrian skiing team used his
training methods, any competition in the world in the next few
years would turn into ``Austrian nationals.''

Civil aviation strike threatens to disrupt Christmas travel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A planned strike by airport workers in
Greece threatens to seriously disrupt pre-Christmas travel for
thousands of people.
	   Employees have scheduled daily work stoppages between 6 a.m. and
10 a.m. and again between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Dec. 21-23, the
union for civil aviation workers said.
	   The strikes could cause dozens of flight cancellations and
delays as passengers gear up to travel for Christmas and the New
Year.
	   The workers, who include airport maintenance and ground crews,
are demanding the immediate hiring of staff to cover increased
demands in smaller, regional airports around the country.
	   Civil aviation telecommunications employees have also declared
separate work stoppages for Friday and Saturday with the same
demands.
	   The previous strike staged by the 2,700-strong civil aviation
union over four days in September was declared illegal by an Athens
court.

Peace group: big increase in Jewish settlement construction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has allowed the construction of housing
in Jewish settlements in the West Bank to more than double, Peace
Now said Wednesday, an assessment likely to further anger
Palestinians already frustrated with the peace process.
	   There were 1,420 homes started in the settlements in the first
half of 1998, the leader of the peace activist group said in a
statement, 136 percent more than in the same period last year.
	   In the second half of 1998, construction of 640 homes began in
the settlements, 121 percent more than in the same period of 1997,
Mossi Raz said.
	   The figures were obtained from a report of the Israeli
government's Central Bureau of Statistics, Raz said.
	   Only a minority of the houses were being built by the government
itself, but private construction requires government approval.
	   Settlers have placed mobile homes on eight new sites in the
vicinity of the settlements since U.S.-brokered negotiations at Wye
River, Maryland, revived the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians in October.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has called on the settlers to
seize the hilltops to ensure that they do not come under
Palestinian control.
	   Peace Now said that its officials spotted 43 trailers on
hilltops in a helicopter flight.
	   The Palestinians, who wish to establish an independent state in
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, say settlement expansion violates
the 1993 Oslo accords because it is a unilateral act which
threatens to predetermine the final outcome of negotiations.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains that
expansion of the settlements is not prohibited by the Oslo accords
and that the settlements should be expanded to accommodate
``natural population growth.''
	   The Palestinians accused Netanyahu this week of not being
serious about the Wye accords because of his refusal to move ahead
with a scheduled troop withdrawal from the West Bank and with
prisoner releases.
	   Netanyahu says he wants to see solid evidence that the
Palestinians are containing incitement and collecting illegal
weapons.
	   Peace Now leader Raz said the trailer parks are illegal and
called on the Israeli Civil Administration in the West Bank to
enforce the law and evacuate the settlers with their trailers.
	   Civil Administration officials have stopped digging of ditches
for drainage and other infrastructure systems at the trailer
settlements, but have refrained from removing the settlers or their
trailers.
	   The settlers say the seizure of the hilltops is legal because
each of them is within the master-plan of the adjacent settlement.
	   There was no immediate response from the Civil Administration.

Philippines to meet China in semis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Philippines' pro basketball lineup
stumbled to a defeat by South Korea on Wednesday, giving it a tough
semifinal against China at the Asian Games.
	   South Korea's 103-83 victory was built around center Seo
Jang-Hoon who shot a game high 26, playing a key role in offense
and defense as he got several opponents into foul trouble.
	   ``The whole thing was just a shellshock experience,'' said
Philippines' coach Tim Cone. ``We weren't shooting three-pointers
and running fast breaks like we usually do. They got us behind
early and they just kept on going.''
	   The Chinese team has been impressive throughout the tournament
and appears on course to win the Asian Games title for a fourth
time in succession. The Philippines, which prepared well for this
tournament, holds the record of titles at four and must lift to
prevent China equaling the mark.
	   China wrapped up an unbeaten run through the preliminaries with
a 99-59 win over Taiwan and Sun Jun scored 20 points to lead four
players finishing in double figures.
	   South Korea will face Kazakstan in the other men's semifinals.
Kazakstan battled back from a 34-27 deficit at half-time to beat
Iran 61-55.
	   China's women's team had a late scare before overcoming South
Korea 80-73 to set up a gold medal game against Japan. Japan, which
beat China during the preliminary rounds, won its semifinal 95-76
against Taiwan.
	   China led by as much as 18 with five minutes to play but let the
Koreans narrow to 73-77 before clinching to win.
	   China's coach Zhang Bin said his team was not concerned that it
had already lost once to Japan here.
	   ``We not going to be affected by the loss two days ago,'' Zhang
said. ``If players can control themselves and not lose their nerves
they're going to win.''

	   ROME (AP) _ A five-story apartment house collapsed Wednesday,
killing at least 13 people and leaving about 20 people believed
buried in the rubble.
	   About 12 hours after the building collapsed, rescue workers
pulled out two survivors from under the rubble. They were described
by police as a man and a woman in their mid-sixties.
	   The two were reportedly in good condition and were taken to a
nearby hospital for a check-up.
	   Among the 13 bodies retried were those of three children.
	   As many as 38 people were believed to have lived in the
apartment house. News reports that five residents were rescued soon
after the building collapsed were later denied.

Authorities exhuming body of banker who died under bridge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with body exhumed, CORRECTS to one son present &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COMO, Italy (AP) _ As his son and a judge looked on, the body of
Vatican-connected financier Roberto Calvi was exhumed Wednesday to
determine whether his 1982 death was murder or suicide.
	   Prosecutors hope a new examination of the body will shed light
on the death of Calvi, whose corpse was found hanging from
Blackfriars Bridge in London following Italy's biggest postwar
banking scandal.
	   Calvi was known as ``God's banker'' for his close ties to the
Vatican.
	   Calvi's wooden coffin was taken from the family tomb, sealed
with lead and loaded onto a hearse for the trip to the morgue in
nearby Milan for tests.
	   Despite the passing years, Italian Judge Otello Lupacchini said
he was certain that today's forensic medicine can determine the
cause of death.
	   Banco Ambrosiano, in which the Vatican bank held a significant
stake, collapsed in 1982 when it could not collect dlrs 1.4 billion
in loans made to shell companies in Latin America.
	   Calvi, the bank's chairman, was found dead days later.
	   Roman businessman Flavio Carboni has been charged with
conspiracy to commit homicide in connection with the case.
	   Prosecutors asked for the exhumation after Carboni's lawyers
presented a report based on a preliminary examination of the body
that indicated Calvi hanged himself.
	   ``What do I think of the exhumation? It was Carboni's right to
seek it in his defense. For us, it's traumatic,'' said Carlo Calvi,
who flew in from his home in Montreal, Canada.
	   Except for the tomb in the cemetery in Drezzo, a town on the
shores of Lake Como near Switzerland, the family no longer has ties
to the area.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Philippines' pro basketball lineup
stumbled to a defeat by South Korea on Wednesday, giving it a tough
semifinal against China at the Asian Games.
	   South Korea's 103-83 victory was built around center Seo
Jang-hoon who shot a game high 26, playing a key role in offense
and defense as he got several opponents into foul trouble.
	   ``The whole thing was just a shellshock experience,'' said
Philippines' coach Tim Cone. ``We weren't shooting three-pointers
and running fast breaks like we usually do. They got us behind
early and they just kept on going.''
	   The Chinese team has been impressive throughout the tournament
and appears on course to win the Asian Games title for a fourth
time in succession. The Philippines, which prepared well for this
tournament, holds the record of titles at four and must lift to
prevent China equaling the mark.
	   China wrapped up an unbeaten run through the preliminaries with
a 99-59 win over Taiwan and Sun Jun scored 20 points to lead four
players finishing in double figures.
	   South Korea will face Kazakstan in the other men's semifinal.
Kazakstan battled back from a 34-27 deficit at halftime to beat
Iran 61-55.
	   China's women's team had a late scare before overcoming South
Korea 80-73 to set up a gold medal game against Japan. Japan, which
beat China during the preliminary rounds, won its semifinal 95-76
against Taiwan.
	   China led by as much as 18 with five minutes to play but let the
Koreans narrow to 73-77 before clinching to win.
	   China's coach Dong Zhiquan said his team was not concerned that
it had already lost once to Japan here.
	   ``We not going to be affected by the loss two days ago,'' Zhang
said. ``If players can control themselves and not lose their nerves
they're going to win.''

Havel's flu not improving, doctors say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The condition of President Vaclav
Havel, who has been down with a flu since the weekend, is not
improving, doctors said Wednesday.
	   Czech radio quoted Ilja Kotik, Havel's doctor, as saying that
the president is still running a mild fever of just under 38
degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit).
	   Despite the lingering fever, doctors have decided against
hospitalization, Kotik said. Instead, Havel has been placed under
round-the-clock medical supervision at his country residence in
Lany, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Prague.
	   Havel, 62, fought off a life-threatening case of pneumonia in
August and underwent emergency surgery for a ruptured colon in
April.
	   A former chain smoker, Havel has been hospitalized five times
since December 1996, when a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor
were removed.
	   The president fell ill over the weekend and will take a break
from his duties until Monday when doctors will decide on future
treatment.

Swiss president meets Russian prime minister

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Swiss President Flavio Cotti met Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Wednesday and signed a joint statement
on technological and financial cooperation.
	   ``The main signal which I want to send is that we are interested
in an inflow of capital into Russia,'' Primakov said after the pair
signed the agreement. ``We will unconditionally establish favorable
conditions for that to take place.''
	   Cotti said: ``A full and open dialogue with Russia is necessary
for the security of Europe and the world.''
	   Primakov stressed the importance of Russia's relations with
Switzerland and joked over the Swiss policy of electing presidents
for only one year.
	   ``Excuse me if I sound like I am interfering into your domestic
Swiss affairs, but I'm really disappointed that you have presidents
for only one year at a time,'' he said.
	   Cotti, who arrived in the Russian capital from St. Petersburg in
the morning, will wrap up his three-day visit on Thursday, when he
is scheduled to meet with President Boris Yeltsin, Moscow Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov and other Russian leaders.
	   In St. Petersburg, Cotti told regional officials that Swiss
private industry remains interested in Russian markets despite
Russia's financial woes.
	   Cotti, accompanied to Moscow by several Swiss business leaders,
reiterated his call for closer economic cooperation in an interview
published on Wednesday in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
	   ``We, the Swiss people, continue to believe in the huge economic
potential of Russia,'' he said.
	   `We hope that Russia will continue economic reforms and create
proper conditions for investors to make profits,'' he said. ``I
don't see any reason to doubt the long-term prospects of economic
cooperation with Russia.''

Seven men arrested for forging one billion lei
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Police have arrested seven men,
accused of fusing Romania's market with one billion lei's worth of
counterfeit notes, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
	   On Saturday, Bucharest police arrested a man after he tried to
buy a bottle of wine with a false bill in a local supermarket,
arousing the suspicion of the cashier who called the authorities,
said Col. Dumitru Secrieru.
	   Once in custody the man, identified as 54-year-old Tem
Frencz-Yoszef, informed police of the network. Over the next couple
of days, the other six men were arrested, four of them with
criminal records.
	   According to Secrieru, Marius Constantina, 21, of Bucharest,
allegedly began printing false 50,000 lei (dlrs 5) bills on his
computer earlier this year. His cousin, Silvica Ciontu, 31, a
sergeant in the Romanian army, distributed the money across
Romania.
	   During the arrests, police found about 55 million lei (dlrs
5,500) in the home of another suspect, Daniel Sandu, 28, also an
army sergeant and member of the gang. The rest of the fake cash has
not been recovered, but Secrieru said the bills have the same
series, so they can easily be spotted.
	   Newspapers published the series on Wednesday, in hopes of
helping police recover the estimated one billion lei (dlrs 100,000)
believed to be on the market in the country.
	   If found guilty, the men risk sentences of up to 15 years in
prison.

Eritrea acquires 10 Russian MiG-29s
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JULIA STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Russian MiG-29 jet fighter planes were
seen flying over Asmara this week, confirming speculation that the
Eritrean Air force had acquired as many as 10 of the aircraft as
its border dispute with Ethiopia continues to fester.
	   More than a dozen officials from the Russian Ministry of
Aviation Production have been in the Eritrean capital, and Russian
pilots and technicians have also been seen.
	   There has been no official comment on the additions to the
Eritrean air force, which greatly increase its power and range.
	   Until now, the air force consisted of six Italian Aermacchi
training jets converted to attack aircraft, eight Finnish Rodigo
trainers and a couple Mi-17 helicopters.
	   Earlier this month, Russia struck a deal to sell neighboring
Ethiopia fighter jets, combat helicopters and other military
hardware.
	   Defense sources say four Su-27 fighters and several Mi-24 and
Mi-8 helicopters are expected to be delivered by the end of the
month.
	   According to analysts, Ethiopia already owns 70 Soviet-era
MiG-23s, and an Israeli firm recently agreed to sell Addis Ababa 10
upgraded MiG-21 Lancer fighters.
	   Eritrea is embroiled in a seven-month standoff in its border
dispute with its larger southern neighbor. There has been relative
calm since battles in May and June, but both sides have been
importing millions of dollars worth of weaponry and reinforcing
troops.
	   It is estimated that 200,000 soldiers now face each other along
the common, 625-mile border.
	   In June, Eritrea and Ethiopia carried out air strikes against
each other. Ethiopian MiG-28s strafed Asmara's air base and
civilian airports, killing 30 civilians.

Swedish group proposes first steps toward 'Middle East OSCE'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Although the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process remains stalled, the time is right to begin aiming even
higher and work for a comprehensive Middle East security regime,
the repsected Stockholm International Peace Reasearch Institute
said Wednesday.
	   In a new report, the organization proposes broad principles for
developing ''an OSCE for the Middle East,'' said report author
Peter Jones, referring to the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is playing a growing role in European
peace efforts.
	   The report comes after 18 months of meetings of political and
academic figures from the Middle East and the West, including
Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt. Palestinian
legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad also took part in the meetings.
	   ''Further progress in the (Israeli-Palestinian) peace process is
necessary to create a political climate for consideration of a
regional security regime,'' Jones said, but noted that the process'
halting progress so far has made many officials willing to consider
the ambitious idea of regional security.
	   Jones said the Middle East presents several unique challenges in
developing regional security, among them that it is the one area in
the world still severely plagued by ''asymmetric relations ... the
smaller countries genuinely fear for their existence.''
	   Middle East countries also generally work with a ''zero-sum
mentality,'' in which one country's success comes with another's
defeat, he said.
	   ''They have to try to overcome this,'' said Jones. ''Cooperative
security is the only possible basis for a Middle East security
regime.''
	   A fundamental objective of such a regime would be to establish a
weapons of mass destruction-free zone and a ''regional security
center,'' a body where officials could go for ''regular and
substantive exhanges,'' said Jones, a Canadian who led the project
for SIPRI.
	   SIPRI, highly regarded for its annual assessments of worldwide
armaments and security issues, can use its prestige to promote
discussion of the ideas and does not intend the report to be a
specific model, Jones said.
	   ''It's the first statement of a vision,'' he said. ''It's not a
statement of 'Here is a vision, or forget it'.''

Former player signs three-year deal to train PSV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Eric Gerets, the trainer of
reigning Belgian league champion Club Brugge, signed a three-year
deal Wednesday to coach PSV Eindhoven.
	   Former PSV defender Gerets will replace Englishman Bobby Robson
as trainer at the end of this season, the Eindhoven club announced.
	   PSV tried to lure Gerets away from Brugge last season, but he
turned the club down, saying he wanted to serve out his contract
with the Belgians.
	   Robson was signed from Barcelona as a one-season trainer last
year to bridge the gap between former coach Dick Advocaat who
transferred to Glasgow Rangers last summer and Gerets.
	   Under Robson, PSV has had a disastrous start to the season. The
team is seventh in the 18-team Dutch league and has been knocked
out of Europe's Champions League.
	   Former right back Gerets' first job at PSV will be to patch up
its leaky defense. The club has conceded 34 goals in 18 games this
season, while scoring a league-leading 44 times.

A Christmas wish: Reunite crown prince and ex-girlfriend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch group that simply refuses
to accept the prince's breakup with his ex-girlfriend is hoping the
Christmas spirit _ and a little nudge _ will bring the couple back
together.
	   Thousands of Christmas cards showing Prince Willem Alexander and
Emily Bremers dressed for a royal wedding were sent to people
including Queen Beatrix, other royals and Cabinet members.
	   Johan Vlemmix, chairman of the Willem Alexander and Emily
Foundation, seems to think that the pair will see the picture,
realize they were meant to be together and rush back into each
other's arms.
	   ``We suspect that they still have great feeling for each
other,'' Vlemmix told the daily De Telegraaf. ``Who knows, maybe it
will work out during Christmas.''
	   The prince, who is next in line for the throne, broke up this
fall with Bremers, a commoner and the daughter of an orthodontist.
Many had thought the couple would marry, though the queen is said
to oppose any marriage between her son and a commoner.
	   The card depicts Bremers in a white bridal gown and Willem
Alexander, sporting his royal sash and medals, standing by a golden
carriage. It reads, ``Merry Christmas and a Happy and Healthy
1999.''
	   The Royal House had no comment about the cards, a spokesman for
the family said Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's non-oil exports for the period March
to November had a total value of dlrs 1.7 billion, down 13 percent
from the same time span last year, the Iran Daily reported
Wednesday.
	   The paper did not give any reason for the downturn.
	   Iran has been trying to boost the non-oil sector of its economy
as its revenues have fallen dramatically with the plummeting oil
price.
	   Iran's non-oil exports consists mainly of carpets, pistachio
nuts, caviar and handicrafts.
	   ____
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Persons traveling from Iran to the Emirates,
Saudi Arabia and Syria will not be allowed to take hand-made
carpets with them, an Iranian economic newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   The Abrar-Eqtesadi said the Cabinet had decided to bar the
casual export of carpets in a bid to boost non-oil exports.
	   Carpets exported through official channels are taxed by the
government.
	   Hand-made carpets and caviar are Iran's main non-oil exports.
They bring in about dlrs 2 billion per year in revenues.
	   Tourists traveling to the Emirates, and pilgrims going to Syria
or Saudi Arabia, often take carpets to sell abroad.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Hundreds of Jordanians have flocked to the
Iranian trade exhibition in Amman to buy Persian carpets, food,
furniture, and silver jewelry.
	   It is Iran's first trade exhibition in Jordan and coincides with
meetings of the Jordanian-Iranian committee in Amman to discuss
trade and industrial cooperation. The Jordanian delegation is led
by Minister of Trade and Industry, Mohammed Saleh, and the Iranian
by Trade Minister Gholam Rida Shafi'i.
	   The annual trade is worth dlrs 26 million annual and the balance
is heavily in Jordan's favor. Iran imports large quantities of
Jordanian phosphate and potash while Jordan imports Iranian food
and machinery.

Miners protest continues to spread
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ An underground sit-in by coal miners
spread to 12 more mines Wednesday to protest proposed pension
changes and the possible closing of inefficient mines.
	   A total of 24 mines in the Silesia region of southern Poland
were taking part in the protest Wednesday afternoon, with another
indicating it would join in later, the PAP state news agency
reported. The total number of miners involved was 193, according to
PAP.
	   Ten miners from the Czeczott mine in Miedzna-Wola, 340
kilometers (200 miles) south of Warsaw, started the sit-in 650
meters (about 600 yards) underground on Thursday to protest the new
pension proposal.
	   The lower chamber of parliament has approved changing the
retirement rules, setting age limits of 65 for men and 60 for
women. Under the current formula, miners could retire with full
pensions after 25 years of work, no matter their age.
	   The government said the new law would allow early retirement for
people working in harmful conditions until 2006.
	   But unions representing miners insist on the current system
remaining unchanged. They plan a vote next week on a possible
general strike over the pension issue and a restructuring plan for
the ailing mine industry.
	   The restructuring plan adopted by the lower parliament chamber
in November would reduce production from 137 million tons last year
to 110 million tons in 2002. Wage increases would be limited and
the number of jobs would be cut by more than 40 percent _ from
245,000 now to 138,000 in three years.
	   Restructuring loss-making industries such as mining, steel and
transportation is part of Poland's strategy to reform its economy
after decades of communist rule and prepare for membership in the
European Union.
	   Coal mining, once the country's leading hard-currency earner
during communist times, is still heavily subsidized under Poland's
market reforms that began in 1990.

Autissier survives knockdown; Thiercelin takes over lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHEILA NORMAN-CULP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marc Thiercelin of France captured the lead in
the second leg of the Around Alone regatta on Wednesday after
Isabelle Autissier's 18-meter (60-foot) yacht was knocked on its
side by a wave in the southern Indian Ocean.
	   Autissier, the lone woman in the race that began last September
in Charleston, South Carolina, fell to third today, 67 kilometers
(36 nautical miles) back, after Tuesday's mishap. Giovanni Soldini
of Italy was in second, 39 kilometers (21 nautical miles) behind
Thiercelin, as the 14-boat fleet surged over waves as big as
three-story houses.
	   After leaving Cape Town, South Africa, on Dec. 5, the solo
sailors have travelled more than 5,400 kilometers (3,000 miles)
southeastward and had passed one of the two mandatory course marks
en route to Auckland, New Zealand. Strong westerly winds up to 80
kph (50 mph) and icy seas were testing both the racers and their
equipment.
	   ``The waves are starting to get a little vicious, running every
which way,'' Autissier reported in a dispatch Tuesday. ``One of
them blindsided the boat while I was brewing a cup of tea.''
	   Mike Golding and Josh Hall, both of Britain, also had were
tipped and had their masts hit the water in the last few days.
	   In an unusual move during rough weather last week, the sailors
agreed among themselves that it was too dangerous to go south of
the Kerguelen Islands. Autissier had supported the move, even
though she said it cut into her lead.
	   In Class II, for boats under 15 meters (50 feet), Jean-Pierre
Mouligne of France on Wednesday pulled to within 9 kilometers (8
nautical miles) of the leader, Mike Garside of Britain. Brad Van
Liew of the United States was in third, 438 kilometers (237
nautical miles) behind Garside.
	   Robin Davie of Charleston was the only racer still in Cape Town
on Wednesday, frantically trying to wrap up repairs to his boat. He
hoped to leave in the next few days.
	   The nine-month, 50,000-kilomter (27,000-mile) race is sailed in
four stages. The racers will leave Auckland in February, stopping
at Punta del Este, Uruguay, before returning to Charleston.

Serbs mourn, protest killings in western Kosovo city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of Kosovo Serbs on Wednesday
grieved and protested the slayings of six young Serbs which have
dangerously inflamed already-high tensions in the separatist
province.
	   A mournful crowd of 5,000 gathered to remember the victims in a
tense silence that permeated the western city of Pec, where the
victims of the Monday night shooting were buried later in the day.
	   Another 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a protest rally in the
capital Pristina.
	   There was no outbreak of unrest at either gathering, although
fear or unrest was so high in Pec that Serb police sent four
busloads of officers to provide security. International verifiers
were not in evidence, a day after some Serbs took out their anger
at the killings by hurling stones or spitting at armored U.S.
observer vehicles.
	   Voicing grave concern at the dangerous turn of events this week
in Kosovo, senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke late Tuesday
condemned the Pec deaths as ``appalling beyond words.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, renewed his
determination to suppress ``terrorism.'' A top government body for
the Serbian province, the Temporary Council for Kosovo, called the
killings were ``the most monstrous crime in the series of assaults
by Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   Many fear the Pec killings, along with a border clash the same
day between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian rebels, move the
tense province closer to a renewal of all-out war.
	   At least 42 people are reported to have died at the two sites,
and the brutal barroom shooting of six Serbs in Kosovo's
third-largest city prompted protests and threats of retaliation
against rebels among the large Serbian population.
	   Holbrooke, who brokered the October agreement that halted more
than seven months of combat in the separatist Serbian province,
appeared pessimistic of reaching a political settlement that could
stop the carnage.
	   After more than five hours of talks with Milosevic in Belgrade,
Holbrooke acknowledged Tuesday night that diplomats are nowhere
near bridging the huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethic
Albanians on the province's status.
	   The ethnic Albanians want eventual independence, while the Serbs
are willing to grant no more than expanded self rule within the
Serbian republic.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters, without
detailing his talks with Milosevic.
	   While the death toll from Monday's clash between border guards
and rebels trying to bring in arms from Albania was higher _ the
army said it killed 36 guerrillas _ the Pec killings raised more
alarm among international officials because they involved an attack
on civilians. Five teen-agers were among the dead.
	   People in the Pec crowd wept openly Wednesday as the six coffins
were brought to the main square and covered with wreaths. At least
one man in civilian clothing was seen armed with a submachine gun.
	   ``They were slain while drinking in a cafe by shots in their
back. Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' said Mirko Simonovic,
principal of the high school where four of the victims were
students.
	   ``They were killed for the simple reason of being Serbs.''
	   He concluded the speech with a demand that the state ``punish
the perpetrators and do away forever with Albanian terrorism.''
	   Pec, located 75 miles (45 miles) west of the capital Pristina,
has about 150,000 residents. Like Kosovo itself, the population is
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian, but several thousand Serbs also
live there.
	   In his statement, Milosevic said security forces ``will suppress
terrorism'' and that the ``terrorist bandits'' responsible for the
Pec shooting would be ``found, wherever they are.''
	   He also accused U.S. representatives in the U.N. Security
Council of ``losing credibility'' by blocking U.N. statements
denouncing ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Towns and cities have mostly escaped the violence that has
engulfed Kosovo villages this year since Serb forces launched an
offensive in February to crush pro-independence militants in the
province of Serbia _ the dominant republic left in Yugoslavia.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed in months of fighting
and in sporadic violence since the Oct. 12 informal cease-fire.
	   The deadliest clash in the two-month tenuous standoff since then
came Monday in a battle that international peace verifiers
confirmed was a showdown between the army and armed fighters of the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Many residents of nearby border villages have fled this week
after the army sent in armored vehicles and helicopters to fight
dozens of KLA rebels it says escaped into the nearby mountains.
	   An army cordon around the area, which includes some settlements,
has prevented verifiers and residents from entering the sealed-off
area and it wasn't immediately clear whether the clash was
continuing for a third day Wednesday.

Peace group: big increase in Jewish settlement construction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has allowed the construction of housing
in Jewish settlements in the West Bank to more than double, a peace
group said Wednesday in an assessment likely to further anger
frustrated Palestinians.
	   There were 1,420 homes started in the settlements in the first
half of 1998, the leader of Peace Now said in a statement. That was
136 percent more than in the same period last year.
	   In the second half of 1998, construction of 640 homes began in
the settlements, 121 percent more than in the same period of 1997,
Mossi Raz said.
	   The figures were obtained from a report of the Israeli
government's Central Bureau of Statistics, Raz said.
	   Settlers have placed mobile homes on eight new sites in the
vicinity of the settlements since U.S.-brokered negotiations
revived the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians in
October.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has called on the settlers to
seize the hilltops to ensure that they do not come under
Palestinian control.
	   Peace Now said that its officials spotted 43 trailers on
hilltops in a helicopter flight.
	   The Palestinians, who wish to establish an independent state in
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, say settlement expansion violates
the 1993 Oslo accords because it unilaterally changes the status
quo in the territories prior to the final outcome of negotiations.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintains that
expansion of the settlements is not prohibited by the Oslo accords
and that the settlements should be expanded to accommodate
``natural population growth.''

Dragons, drummers lend accent to wushu competition at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With drummers, a dancing dragon and
displays of high kicking to a disco beat, the Asian Games raised
the curtain Wednesday on one of its more esoteric sports _ the
ancient martial art of wushu.
	   The Chinese word wushu means martial skill, and in competition
athletes go through martial arts routines and are marked by a panel
of judges as in gymnastics.
	   Wushu originated in China centuries ago and has been part of the
Asian Games since 1990. This time, organizers also included
fighting wushu for the first time. Athletes in protective padding
are divided into weight categories and fight each other, scoring
points in a way similar to boxing.
	   Fighting was included to make the sport more exciting, said Mak
Kwok Ching, leader of an eight-member team from Hong Kong taking
part in the competition along with other countries such as China,
the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore and host Thailand.
	   Wushu fans like Mak who want the sport made an Olympic event are
pinning their hopes on China being awarded the 2008 Olympics and
including wushu in the games.
	   The first wushu gold medal was won Wednesday by Taiwan's Chan
Ming-shu in the men's event of the graceful art of shadow-boxing
called taijiquan. Japan's Toshiya Watanabe took silver, with Nguyen
Anh Minh of Vietnam getting bronze.
	   Taijiquan is practiced by millions of people across Asia each
day, often at dawn in parks and squares and, in Hong Kong, in the
shadow of skyscrapers. Practioners aim to develop what they call
``qi,'' an inner energy believed to help promote health and blood
circulation. Unlike in many other sports, age is not a limit when
practicing taiqijuan's slow, graceful movements.
	   ``It's a lifetime sport,'' said Mak. ``You can go up to 60, 70,
80 and still carry on.''
	   In competition, athletes perform a set routine and are marked on
form, style and the accuracy of their movements, Mak said. ``It's
the gracefulness, the smoothness, the relaxing atmosphere projected
that counts,'' he said.
	   Wushu also has a combined competition in which athletes perform
explosively energetic and acrobatic routines with swords, spears
and barefisted, again before a panel of judges.
	   At the competition's opening ceremony Wednesday, wushu experts
in brightly colored pajama-style suits put on an acrobatic display
of high-kicking and leaping that drew gasps of appreciation and
applause from the crowd.
	   One did a routine with a shining silver sword, lunging,
thrusting and chopping at imaginary assailants as he danced and
somersaulted across the blue-carpeted floor. Another put on a
similarly acrobatic routine with a stave.
	   Others boxed and kicked at the air, stamping feet on the ground
for emphasis, in routines that would not have looked out of place
in a Jackie Chan kung-fu movie. In a contrast of modernity and
tradition, some of the routines were performed to disco tunes and
in one case, the theme tune to the movie ``Chariots of Fire.''
	   The lights were also switched off and ultraviolet lamps brought
in to illuminate a long glow-in-the-dark dragon that was carried
and made to dance and squirm by people dressed in black.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors evacuated Baghdad on
Wednesday, a day after the chief U.N. arms inspector said Iraq had
reneged on its promise of full cooperation.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance, and Iraq said it is ready to
face an attack.
	   Weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency left their headquarters in buses
and cars without any notice. They later flew in a special U.N.
plane to the Gulf state of Bahrain.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain.
``There is nobody left behind.''
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed the Iraq crisis with
U.S. President Bill Clinton in a 15-minute phone call late Tuesday,
a spokesman for Blair in London said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Early Wednesday, Clinton met with his top national security
advisers and one White House official called it ``a very serious
situation.''
	   In Iraq, President Saddam Hussein chaired a special joint
meeting of the decision-making Revolutionary Command Council and
the ruling Baath Party. A statement issued after the meeting said
the leadership ``reviewed all necessary precautions and measures to
confront the American-British aggression.''
	   ``It has become undoubtedly clear that they have been planning
for a long time to ... launch once again another aggression ...
pushed by malice and hatred,'' the statement said.
	   In Baghdad, a U.N. spokesman said no decision had been made on
withdrawing the 400 U.N. humanitarian monitors from Iraq.
	   George Somerwill added, however, that they were prepared to
leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast Wednesday
and began playing patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos
training with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers.
	   The pullout came hours after chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler submitted a report to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday,
saying Iraq had failed to cooperate with UNSCOM as it had pledged
to avert a threatened U.S.-British attack on Nov. 14.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed Butler's report
as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to trigger an
American and British military strike on Iraq.''

Havel's flu not improving, doctors say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The condition of President Vaclav
Havel, who has been down with a flu since the weekend, is not
improving, doctors said Wednesday.
	   Czech radio quoted Ilja Kotik, Havel's doctor, as saying that
the president is still running a mild fever of just under 38
degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit).
	   Despite the lingering fever, doctors have decided against
hospitalization, Kotik said. Instead, Havel has been placed under
round-the-clock medical supervision at his country residence in
Lany, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Prague.
	   Havel, 62, fought off a life-threatening case of pneumonia in
August and underwent emergency surgery for a ruptured colon in
April.
	   A former chain smoker, Havel has been hospitalized five times
since December 1996, when a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor
were removed.
	   The president will take a break from his duties until Monday
when doctors will decide on future treatment.

Swedish group proposes first steps toward 'Middle East OSCE'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Although the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process remains stalled, the time is right to begin aiming even
higher and work for a comprehensive Middle East security regime,
the respected Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said
Wednesday.
	   In a new report, the organization proposes broad principles for
developing ``an OSCE for the Middle East,'' said report author
Peter Jones, referring to the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is playing a growing role in European
peace efforts.
	   The report comes after 18 months of meetings of political and
academic figures from the Middle East and the West, including
Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt. Palestinian
legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad also took part in the meetings.
	   ``Further progress in the (Israeli-Palestinian) peace process is
necessary to create a political climate for consideration of a
regional security regime,'' Jones said, but noted that the process'
halting progress so far has made many officials willing to consider
the ambitious idea of regional security.
	   Jones said the Middle East presents several unique challenges in
developing regional security, among them that it is the one area in
the world still severely plagued by ``asymmetric relations ... the
smaller countries genuinely fear for their existence.''
	   Middle East countries also generally work with a ``zero-sum
mentality,'' in which one country's success comes with another's
defeat, he said.
	   ``They have to try to overcome this,'' said Jones. ``Cooperative
security is the only possible basis for a Middle East security
regime.''
	   A fundamental objective of such a regime would be to establish a
weapons of mass destruction-free zone and a ``regional security
center,'' a body where officials could go for ``regular and
substantive exchanges,'' said Jones, a Canadian who led the project
for SIPRI.
	   SIPRI, highly regarded for its annual assessments of worldwide
armaments and security issues, can use its prestige to promote
discussion of the ideas and does not intend the report to be a
specific model, Jones said.
	   ``It's the first statement of a vision,'' he said. ``It's not a
statement of 'Here is a vision, or forget it'.''

Government introduces bill to change patent laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Under pressure from the World Trade
Organization, the Indian government Wednesday introduced a bill in
Parliament to amend the 1970 patent laws to provide exclusive
marketing rights to foreign agrochemical and pharmaceutical
companies selling their products here.
	   The introduction of the bill by Industry Minister Sikander Bakht
was vehemently opposed by leftist parties that argued working
people will be hurt because foreigners will destroy indigenous
business. Reformists say patent protections will make India a more
attractive place to do business for foreigners.
	   No date was set for a debate or vote on the bill. It is expected
to pass, with support from the main governing Bharatiya Janata
Party and the main opposition Congress party.
	   The new law will bind India to start giving patents from the
year 2005, but the WTO has asked New Delhi to provide a mechanism
to receive applications beginning next April.
	   The existing 1970 law catered for process patent, but did not
provide for product patent.
	   India began opening up its socialist-patterned economy seven
years ago under Congress. Reformists say the economy will be
strengthened by new ideas and entrepreneurs.
	   The United States recently raised a dispute against India at the
WTO alleging non-fulfillment of obligations in providing marketing
rights to foreign companies.
	   A panel set up by the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO ruled
that India had not complied with its obligations, and asked India
to set up a mechanism for receiving patent applications.

 &UR; Serbs mourn, protest killings in western Kosovo city &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of Serbs, many weeping,
gathered today to mourn six slain countrymen whose deaths have
dangerously inflamed tensions in the separatist province of Kosovo.
	   A crowd of 5,000 assembled to remember the victims in a tense
silence that permeated the western city of Pec, where the victims
of the Monday night shooting were to be buried later today. Another
2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a protest rally in the provincial
capital of Pristina.
	   As mourners sobbed, the six coffins were brought to Pec's main
square and covered with wreaths. At least one man in civilian
clothing was seen armed with a submachine gun.
	   ``Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' said Mirko Simonovic,
principal of the high school where four of the victims were
students. ``They were killed for the simple reason of being
Serbs.''
	   He concluded with a demand that the state ``punish the
perpetrators and do away forever with Albanian terrorism.''
	   Many fear the Pec killings, along with a border clash this week
between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian rebels that killed at
least 36 rebels, move Kosovo closer to a renewal of war.
	   The brutal barroom shooting of six Serbs in Kosovo's
third-largest city prompted protests and threats of retaliation
against rebels, who want independence. Ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of the population of Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's
main republic of Serbia.
	   Voicing grave concern at the dangerous turn of events this week,
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke condemned the deaths as ``appalling
beyond words.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, renewed his
determination to suppress rebel ``terrorism.'' A top government
body for the Serbian province called the Serb killings were ``the
most monstrous crime in the series of assaults by Albanian
terrorist gangs.''
	   Holbrooke, who brokered an agreement in October that halted more
than seven months of combat in Kosovo, appeared pessimistic about
reaching a political settlement that could stop the carnage.
	   After more than five hours of talks with Milosevic in Belgrade,
Holbrooke acknowledged Tuesday night that diplomats are nowhere
near bridging the huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethic
Albanians on the province's status.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters. He gave no
details on his talks with Milosevic.
	   While the death toll from Monday's clash between border guards
and rebels trying to bring in arms from Albania was higher _ the
army said it killed 36 guerrillas _ the Pec killings raised more
alarm among international officials because they involved an attack
on civilians.
	   Pec, located 45 miles west of Pristina, has about 150,000
residents. Like Kosovo itself, the population is overwhelmingly
ethnic Albanian, but several thousand Serbs also live there.
	   In his statement, Milosevic said security forces ``will suppress
terrorism'' and that the ``terrorist bandits'' responsible for the
Pec shooting would be ``found, wherever they are.''
	   He also accused U.S. representatives in the U.N. Security
Council of ``losing credibility'' by blocking U.N. statements
denouncing ethnic Albanian ``terrorists.''
	   Towns and cities have mostly escaped the violence that has
engulfed Kosovo villages this year since Serb forces launched an
offensive in February to crush pro-independence militants.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed and 300,000 forced from
their homes since Milosevic launched his crackdown on separatists
in February.

Royal princes attend annual lunch for Prince Charles' employees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princes William and Harry joined in a Christmas
lunch Wednesday for the private secretaries, personal assistants,
valets, grooms and gardeners who work for their father, Prince
Charles.
	   The teen-age princes spent the first day of their school holiday
at the traditional turkey lunch, held at London's Ritz Hotel.
	   In a private room lit by candlelight and decorated with festive
balloons and streamers, the three princes joined about 100 staff
members.
	   On the guest list were all Charles' employees, from both
Highgrove, his country house, and St. James's Palace, his London
residence.
	   The police officers who protect the three princes throughout the
year also were invited.
	   This is the boys' second Christmas without their mother,
Princess Diana, who died in an August 1997 car crash in Paris.

Two politicians freed on bail more than a year after failed coup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Two politicians accused of involvement in
a failed coup were freed on bail Wednesday after more than a year
in prison awaiting completion of their trial on treason charges.
	   High Court Judge Japhet Banda ruled that prosecutors have so far
failed to prove treason charges against Dean Mung'omba, head of the
small opposition Zambia Democratic Congress party, and Nakatindi
Wina, a tribal princess in the ruling party, within a reasonable
time after the Oct. 28, 1997, coup attempt.
	   Banda ordered them released on dlrs 2,500 bail apiece. The trial
will continue.
	   Banda said 109 witnesses called by the state since their treason
trial began six months ago had not directly implicated Mung'omba
and Wina in the plot to overthrow President Frederick Chiluba.
	   Mung'omba, an economist and former banker, served as a deputy
finance minister in Chiluba's government until he quit to form his
own opposition group.
	   Earlier this month, Wina was expelled from Chiluba's ruling
Movement for Multiparty Democracy party.
	   Until her arrest on allegations of helping bankroll the October
coup attempt, Wina was head of the party's women's league.
	   Junior military officers attempting to overthrow Chiluba stormed
the state broadcast center on Oct. 28, 1997. The uprising was
quickly quashed by loyal troops.
	   Seventy-seven soldiers are facing treason charges that carry the
death penalty.

Report: 25 IOC members may have been bribed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with U.S. newsaper reporting Hodler accusing as many as
25 IOC members have accepted bribes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The Olympic executive whose
accusations of bribery and blackmail rocked the IOC says as many as
25 members might have received favors or cash for votes in four
recent elections to choose sites for the games.
	   ``That's the absolute maximum because I trust all the others,''
Marc Hodler was quoted as saying in Wednesday's editions of USA
Today. The International Olympic Committee has 115 members.
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old senior member of the IOC executive board,
has not identified any IOC members who may have taken bribes.
	   The IOC began investigating the successful bid by Salt Lake City
for the 2002 Winter Olympics after Salt Lake organizers disclosed
they had made payments of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarship funds
to 13 people, including six relatives of IOC members.
	   Hodler also said Salt Lake organizers have turned over 25 pages
listing payments in its ``humanitarian assistance'' program.
	   ``They've got a lot of information. They're not limited to the
scholarships,'' Hodler told the newspaper.
	   Hodler said the new summary details dls 630,000 in payments,
some of it unrelated to IOC members.
	   Earlier, Hodler said he went public Saturday with allegations of
corruption in the Olympic bidding process because he feared a
cover-up of the Salt Lake scandal.
	   ``The feeling crept up on me that certain people are afraid of
this case and wanted to sweep everything under the carpet,'' Hodler
told the Zurich daily Neue Zuercher Zeitung on Wednesday.
	   ``Because of various misunderstandings, I was under the
impression that some of my colleagues might try not to uncover
mistakes made by some members of the IOC and lay all the blame on
the Salt Lake City organizing committee,'' he also told Zurich's
Tages-Anzeiger daily. ``I'm not acting for Salt Lake City but for
justice.''
	   Hodler said Saturday that Salt Lake City had been
``blackmailed'' by agents promising to secure votes during its
Olympic bid. He said four agents, including one member of the IOC,
had been involved in vote-buying schemes over the past 10 years.
	   He cited supposed irregularities in the elections of at least
four Olympic cities _ Atlanta; Nagano, Japan; Sydney, Australia;
and Salt Lake.
	   ``In don't enjoy being a member of a club that has a bad
reputation,'' Hodler told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung.
	   ``I'm a lawyer and, as such, I can't do anything without proof.
In contrast to what you might believe, I'm probably the best friend
of IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.''
	   Hodler said he wanted to ``exert pressure'' on the IOC to change
its election procedure for Olympic cities, putting the decision in
the hands of a small group rather than the entire IOC membership.

BMW chief sees more job cuts at Rover group
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that job cuts Pischetrieder commented on aleady
agreed to with union, other details.

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ BMW's British unit Rover Group Ltd.,
which saw 2,500 job cuts this year, may face the same amount of
layoffs in 1999, BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder said.
	   ``In 1999 there could again be 2,500 fewer positions at Rover,''
he said at a journalists club meeting late Tuesday. At the
beginning of 1998, Rover had a work force of 40,000, he noted.
	   Juerg Dinner, a BMW spokesman on Wednesday clarified that
Pischetsrieder was referring to 2,500 job cuts through normal
attrition such as retirement that had been agreed to with union
representatives last month.
	   Total job reductions of the Rover group this year were also
2,500, with 1,500 of them since July, the spokesman said.
	   Pischetsrieder also warned that Rover's fleet management
business poses a depreciation risk for the BMW group, citing a more
than 15 percent drop in used car prices in Britain over the past
six months.
	   BMW's Rover provides automobiles to rental companies that it
agrees to buy back after a certain period at a previously agreed
price. It then sells them as used cars.
	   His statements mark the first time that BMW was outspoken about
possible rental contract losses, which analysts say might require a
provision of between 200 million and 250 million marks (dlrs 120
million and dlrs 150 million) this year.

	   Excerpts from the text of a statement issued after a meeting of
the decision-making Revolutionary Command Council and the Baath
Party on Wednesday.
	   ___
	   The leadership reviewed all necessary precautions and measures
to confront the American-British aggression.
	   It has become undoubtedly clear that they have been planning for
a long time to try their doomed luck to launch once again another
aggression as they are being pushed by their malice and hatred and
by Zionism, which feeds the Satan's grudge.
	   They want to achieve their ambition by making the whole Arab
nation kneel under their feet ... and think that the leadership and
the people in Baghdad and Iraq who represent the spirit of the
nation will kneel too.
	   Depend on God to knock out the dreams out of their empty heads
and prove ... that they will be the losers as they had lost and
failed during the great encounter of the mother of all battles ...
let this encounter be a crown embroidered by faith, virtue and
glory.

Former Beatle claims collector tried to sell stolen lyrics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOSHEN, New York (AP) _ Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney says the
original handwritten lyrics to ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band'' that a collector offered to sell him in August were stolen
from his London home 30 years ago.
	   McCartney wants the lyrics returned and filed a ``show-cause''
order in New York Supreme Court last month demanding that one
collector reveal the name of another who now has the lyric sheet in
his possession.
	   A photocopy of what appeared to be the lyric sheet was sent to
him by collector Gary J. Zimet with a dlrs 550,000 offer to sell
the original on behalf of an unidentified friend, McCartney said.
	   Zimet said on Tuesday that he had revealed the collector's name
to McCartney, but would not reveal it publicly.
	   McCartney claims the lyric sheet was stolen from his home in
late 1967 or early 1968, according to court documents. Zimet denies
the lyrics were stolen.
	   Peter S. Cane, a lawyer for the unnamed owner of the lyrics,
said McCartney's statements are intended to lower the market value
of the lyrics. He said McCartney has not pursued any legal action
against his client.
	   In his affidavit, McCartney states the lyric sheet ``belongs
exclusively to me,'' and he hopes to eventually take legal action
to recover it.
	   Last year, when 60-year-old Lily Evans, the widow of Beatles
road manager Mal Evans, wanted to sell a scrap of paper with the
original lyrics to ``With a Little Help From My Friends,'' from the
same album, McCartney filed an injunction against her.
	   Zimet, 45, has owned a business called Moments in Time for about
20 years that deals in hard-to-find autographs. The collector
gained attention earlier this year when he put up for auction an
album that the late Beatle John Lennon reportedly autographed for
Mark David Chapman, who became Lennon's killer. The deadline for
bids in that auction is next month.

Family battle to regain land roils east German suburb

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with court ruling against heirs. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TELTOW, Germany (AP) _ Seehof, in the Berlin suburb of Teltow,
is a quiet neighborhood of well-tended homes, bordered by parks, a
nature preserve and a waterway.
	   Yet the calm belies a storm that has surrounded Seehof since
German reunification in 1990.
	   The 500 or so houses were built on the Seehof farm, once owned
by one of Berlin's wealthiest families, the Saberskys. They fled
Nazi Germany in the 1930s because they were Jewish, ending up in
the United States and elsewhere.
	   For decades, the family could not seek restitution because the
land was in communist East Germany. Now with the Wall gone and
Teltow looking like prime real estate, the heirs want to regain
title to the 84 hectares (208 acres), worth dlrs 170 million or
more.
	   The prospect frightens many of the 1,500 people who have lived
in Seehof for decades. With so much at stake, the battle has become
increasingly bitter, with accusations of anti-Semitism, greed and
dishonest politics.
	   Although several decisions have gone against them, the family is
pushing ahead. But their latest appeal was rejected Wednesday by
the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin.
	   In a decision that dealt only with land that now belongs to
Teltow _ streets and parks _ the court found that the transfer of
those parcels to the city in 1934 ``did not result by force out of
racist grounds.''
	   The judges said they would decide on the bulk of the parcels _
where the houses now stand _ in February.
	   ``It's a very sad day,'' said one American descendant, Peter
Sonnenthal, after the ruling. ``But this is only a skirmish.''
	   In an earlier interview, Sonnenthal, a former lawyer for the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission who helped bring down Wall
Street titans Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, said he's not one to
shy from a fight.
	   Sonnethal, 44, conceded he stands to make a lot of money but
insists he does not intend to force anyone from his home.
	   ``We're fighting a decision that says my family wasn't
persecuted,'' he said. ``But the truth is this property was owned
by my family and stolen by the Nazis and that's what must be
addressed.''
	   The family has won small victories, getting three parcels back
in 1995, including the grand, three-story villa where Sonnenthal's
grandfather, Albert Sabersky, once lived.
	   The villa quickly sold for dlrs 4.8 million. Sonnenthal and his
sister received half as sole heirs to Albert Sabersky; the rest was
divided among 16 other heirs.
	   Still, the state office charged with deciding restitution claims
denied the bulk of their claim. Deputy director Josefine Ewers says
the Saberskys ``without a question'' were persecuted by the Nazis _
but not when it came to selling their farm.
	   Both sides have spent years searching through old archives,
digging out maps, aerial photos and records. The case hinges on
whether the land was used as a farm or intended for development,
whether the Saberskys sold under pressure and what happened to the
money.
	   The Saberskys, mainly bankers and grain traders, bought Seehof
in 1878. They maintained it as a farm but drew up plans to develop
a strip along the water where other wealthy Berliners had started
building country homes.
	   But when the Nazis came to power in 1933 and started banning
Jews from professions _ including farming _ the family hired a Nazi
real-estate broker to begin selling all of Seehof.
	   ``They knew what was coming,'' Sonnenthal said. ``They sold it
off as fast as they could.''
	   The family claims the Saberskys sold the farm under pressure for
about half the market value, and that the broker charged them an
exorbitant commission _ reaching 50 percent after the 1938
anti-Jewish pogrom known as Kristallnacht.
	   They also say the Nazis confiscated the proceeds, and the family
never saw the money.
	   Ewers, of the restitution office, says records show the family
was not really farming the land but instead was preparing it for
development with intent to sell. If the family was not farming, she
argues, it would not have been under pressure from the Nazis'
banning the profession for Jews.
	   She says the broker's commission was reasonable considering all
they asked him to do. She also disputes Sonnethal's claim that the
family never saw any money from its financial agent, noting it used
the same man in the 1950s.
	   Sonnenthal says Ewers and the court acted under political
pressure, ignoring his evidence to protect homeowners _ and voters.
She denies it.
	   Charges that the family is only after money reflect shades of
anti-Semitism, he says, as do the swastikas that appeared in the
neighborhood during the seven-year court battle.
	   He has offered to drop claims to any home if the occupant pays
10,000 to 15,000 marks (dlrs 6,000 to dlrs 9,000) _ about 10
percent of the market value.
	   ``As a Jew returning to Germany, I will not make a victim out of
anyone who suffered under communism,'' he says. ``We set the price
intentionally low.''
	   About 120 people have accepted the offer or are in the process
of doing so. The majority are holding out _ taking their chances
with the courts.
	   Sonnenthal, now in private practice in Denver, said the federal
court's decision that each of the housing parcels will be decided
individually in February boded well for his family.
	   ``I think we have a very good chance of getting those parcels
sold after Kristallnacht back,'' he said. That would amount to 89
homes.
	   No decision on whether to appeal to the Constitutional Court,
Germany's highest, will be made till after that, he said.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Dry and stable high pressure at the middle and upper levels of
the atmosphere has relinquished its strong drying affects on the
local area overnight, as a modest increase in middle-level moisture
has moved into the northeast Caribbean.
	   Meanwhile, at the lower levels of the atmosphere, weak high
pressure and light winds across the area yesterday will be replaced
by this afternoon with moderate easterly trade winds and modest
amounts of low-level moisture.
	   This is expected to begin producing widely scattered to
scattered showers on a more regular basis across the northeast
Caribbean through Thursday. Due to the increased moisture, a few
showers will produce moderate to briefly heavy rainfall and a few
rain amounts could reach near one inch across portions of Puerto
Rico today.
	   Showers moving across the Virgin Islands overnight are expected
to reach east and northeast Puerto Rico around sunrise and should
move across the island through noon. Widely scattered afternoon
showers are also expected across western and interior Puerto Rico.
	   North-northeast swells affecting the local Atlantic waters since
Monday afternoon have died across the local waters, leaving just
mild trade winds and low seas across the regional waters.

Rebel forces increase pressure on besieged Angolan city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with comments from nurse at Kuito hospital
saying rebel attack repelled &QL; 
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Government forces defending the besieged
city of Kuito pushed back a rebel attack Wednesday after eight
hours of fierce fighting, according to reports.
	   The UNITA rebels moved on Cunji, seven kilometers (four miles)
outside Kuito, shortly before daybreak, the private radio station
Radio Eclesia reported from the city, which lies about 500
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda.
	   A nurse at Kuito hospital said the government forces had
repelled the attack after eight hours of intense combat and that
the city was calm in the afternoon.
	   ``The government is in control ... UNITA is retreating,'' the
nurse, who did not give his name, told Portuguese radio TSF.
	   He said dozens of wounded, including civilians and soldiers,
were arriving at the hospital.
	   Cunji is located on high ground overlooking Kuito. Its capture
would give the rebels a vantage point for artillery fire on the
center of the city whose former population of 100,000 has been
swollen by thousands of displaced people fleeing fighting in the
surrounding area.
	   Battles have focused on Bie province, whose capital is Kuito,
since fighting between the two sides restarted Dec. 4, ending a
four-year peace pact in the former Portuguese colony.
	   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon said he expected the group's
leadership inside Angola to issue a statement on the peace accord
in the coming days.
	   The spokesman, Rui Oliveira, said the military situation in Bie
province was ``muddled.''
	   An International Red Cross spokesman in Luanda said the airport
at Huambo, the country's second-largest city, 110 kilometers (70
miles) west of Kuito, was closed to civilian flights.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the U.N.-brokered
1994 peace agreement that was supposed to end a two-decade civil
war that broke out after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons monitors left Baghdad on
Wednesday, amid fears that Iraq's latest refusal to cooperate with
inspectors could lead to airstrikes.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's compliance, and Iraq said it is ready to
face an attack.
	   ``This is obviously a very serious situation. All options are on
the table,'' one White House national security aide said Wednesday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair discussed the crisis with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in a 15-minute phone call late Tuesday, a
spokesman for Blair in London said, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   Weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission and the
International Atomic Energy Agency left their headquarters
Wednesday in buses and cars without any notice. They later flew in
a special U.N. plane to the Gulf state of Bahrain.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain.
``There is nobody left behind.''
	   In Iraq, President Saddam Hussein chaired a special joint
meeting of the decision-making Revolutionary Command Council and
the ruling Baath Party. A statement issued after the meeting said
the leadership ``reviewed all necessary precautions and measures to
confront the American-British aggression.''
	   ``It has become undoubtedly clear that they have been planning
for a long time to ... launch once again another aggression ...
pushed by malice and hatred,'' the statement said.
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast Wednesday
and began playing patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos
training with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers.
	   In Baghdad, a U.N. spokesman said no decision had been made on
withdrawing the 400 U.N. employees monitoring humanitarian programs
in Iraq.
	   George Somerwill added, however, that they were prepared to
leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   The pullout came hours after chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler submitted a report to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday,
saying Iraq had failed to cooperate with UNSCOM as it had pledged
to avert a threatened U.S.-British attack on Nov. 14.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed Butler's report
as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to trigger an
American and British military strike on Iraq.''
	   He said the withdrawal of the inspectors ``means again that the
Special Commission is a tool in America's hand to implement its
policy of aggression.'' His remarks were carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes could come
quickly and without warning.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''
	   The United States has 22 warships and 201 aircraft in the
region, including 72 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
Eight of the warships carry cruise missiles. Britain has 22 strike
aircraft in the region.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused Butler of
overstepping his authority by ordering the evacuation of
inspectors. He called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting,
ITAR-Tass news agency reported in Moscow.
	   Ivanov was in Madrid on Wednesday for a peace conference on
Bosnia. Russia has consistently opposed military action against
Iraq.

Baghdad,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain.
``There is nobody left behind.''
	   In Iraq, President Saddam Hussein chaired a special joint
meeting of the decision-making Revolutionary Command Council and
the ruling Baath Party. A statement issued after the meeting said
the leadership ``reviewed all necessary precautions and measures to
confront the American-British aggression.''
	   ``It has become undoubtedly clear that they have been planning
for a long time to ... launch once again another aggression ...
pushed by malice and hatred,'' the statement said.
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast Wednesday
and began playing patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos
training with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers.
	   In Baghdad, a U.N. spokesman said no decision had been made on
withdrawing the 400 U.N. employees monitoring humanitarian programs
in Iraq.
	   George Somerwill added, however, that they were prepared to
leave ``should it become necessary.''
	   The pullout came hours after chief weapons inspector Richard
Butler submitted a report to the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday,
saying Iraq had failed to cooperate with UNSCOM as it had pledged
to avert a threatened U.S.-British attack on Nov. 14.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed Butler's report
as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to trigger an
American and British military strike on Iraq.''
	   He said the withdrawal of the inspectors ``means again that the
Special Commission is a tool in America's hand to implement its
policy of aggression.'' His remarks were carried by the official
Iraqi News Agency.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes could come
quickly and without warning.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday morning. ``I'm not now going to give him any
warning of what we might do.''
	   The United States has 22 warships and 201 aircraft in the
region, including 72 aboard the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
Eight of the warships carry cruise missiles. Britain has 22 strike
aircraft in the region.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused Butler of
overstepping his authority by ordering the evacuation of
inspectors. He called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting,
ITAR-Tass news agency reported in Moscow.
	   Ivanov was in Madrid on Wednesday for a peace conference on
Bosnia. Russia has consistently opposed military action against
Iraq.

Eight jailed as police break heroin ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A court on Wednesday jailed eight
people in connection with an alleged international ring that is
believed to have smuggled 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of heroin into
Denmark over an 18-month period.
	   Earlier this year, German and Czech police arrested eight people
believed to be part of the ring. Two of those arrested in Germany
have confessed smuggling heroin to Denmark, police said.
	   Two Danish nationals _ believed to be the ringleaders in Denmark
_ were arrested Tuesday in Copenhagen. Police declined to identify
them but said they originate from Croatia and Albania's Kosovo
region.
	   Police said 67 kilograms (147 pounds) of the uncut brown heroin
already had been sold in Denmark.
	   The eight people were ordered to be held for 27 days pending the
investigation. They were charged with planning and organizing the
smuggling, and face up to 10 years in jail each.

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of Kosovo Serbs on Wednesday
mourned six slain Serbs whose deaths have dangerously inflamed
already-high tensions in the separatist province.
	   A mournful crowd of 5,000 gathered to remember the victims in a
tense silence that permeated the western city of Pec, where the
victims of the Monday night shooting were buried later in the day.
	   Another 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a protest rally in the
capital Pristina.
	   There was no outbreak of unrest at either gathering, although
fear or unrest was so high in Pec that Serb police sent four
busloads of officers to provide security. International verifiers
were not in evidence, a day after some Serbs took out their anger
at the killings by hurling stones or spitting at armored U.S.
observer vehicles.
	   Voicing grave concern at the dangerous turn of events this week
in Kosovo, senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on late Tuesday
condemned the deaths as ``appalling beyond words.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, meanwhile, renewed his
determination to suppress ``terrorism.'' A top government body for
the Serbian province, the Temporary Council for Kosovo, said the
killings were ``the most monstrous crime in the series of assaults
by Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population of Kosovo,
a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia.
	   Many fear the Pec killings, along with a border clash this week
between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian rebels, move the
tense province closer to a renewal of all-out war.
	   At least 42 people are reported to have died at the two sites,
and the brutal barroom shooting of six Serbs in Kosovo's
third-largest city prompted protests and threats of retaliation
against rebels among the large Serbian population.
	   Holbrooke, who brokered the October agreement that halted more
than seven months of combat in the separatist Serbian province,
appeared pessimistic about reaching a political settlement that
could stop the continuing carnage.
	   After more than five hours of talks with Milosevic in Belgrade,
he acknowledged Tuesday night that diplomats are nowhere near
bridging the huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethic Albanians
on the province's status.
	   ``The gap between the Serbs and the Albanians on the future of
Kosovo ... is very grave,'' Holbrooke told reporters. He gave no
details on his talks with Milosevic.
	   While the death toll from Monday's clash between border guards
and rebels trying to bring in arms from Albania was higher _ the
army said it killed 36 guerrillas _ the Pec killings raised more
alarm among international officials because they involved an attack
on civilians. Five teen-agers were among the dead.
	   People in the Pec crowd wept openly Wednesday as the six coffins
were brought to the main square and covered with wreaths. At least
one man in civilian clothing was seen armed with a machine gun.
	   ``They were slain while drinking in a cafe by shots in their
back. Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' said Mirko Simonovic,
principal of the high school where four of the victims were
students.
	   ``They were killed for the simple reason of being Serbs.''
	   He concluded the speech with a demand that the state ``punish
the perpetrators and do away forever with Albanian terrorism.''

Former player signs three-year deal to coach PSV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Eric Gerets, the manager of
reigning Belgian league champion Club Brugge, signed a three-year
deal Wednesday to coach PSV Eindhoven beginning next season.
	   The former PSV defender will replace Englishman Bobby Robson.
PSV tried to lure Gerets away from Brugge last season, but he
turned the club down, saying he wanted to serve out his contract
with the Belgians.
	   Robson lef Barcelona after last season and signed a one-season
deal with PSV to serve in the interim between coach Dick Advocaat,
who transferred to Glasgow Rangers last summer, and Gerets.
	   Under Robson, PSV has had a disastrous start. The team is
seventh in the 18-team Dutch league and has been eliminated from
the Europe's Champions League.
	   Former right back Gerets' first job at PSV will be to patch up
its leaky defense. The club has conceded 34 goals in 18 games this
season, while scoring a league-leading 44 times.

Rebel forces increase pressure on besieged Angolan city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with comments from nurse at Kuito hospital
saying rebel attack repelled &QL; 
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan forces defending the besieged city
of Kuito pushed back a rebel attack Wednesday after eight hours of
fierce fighting, according to reports.
	   The UNITA rebels moved on Cunji, seven kilometers (four miles)
outside Kuito, shortly before daybreak, the private radio station
Radio Eclesia reported from the city, which lies about 500
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda.
	   A nurse at Kuito hospital said that the government forces had
repelled the attack after eight hours of intense combat and that
the city was calm in the afternoon.
	   ``The government is in control ... UNITA is retreating,'' the
nurse, who did not give his name, told Portuguese radio TSF.
	   He said dozens of wounded, including civilians and soldiers,
were arriving at the hospital.
	   Cunji is located on high ground overlooking Kuito. Its capture
would give the rebels a vantage point for artillery fire on the
center of the city whose former population of 100,000 has been
swollen by thousands of displaced people fleeing fighting in the
surrounding area.
	   Battles have focused on Bie province, whose capital is Kuito,
since fighting between the two sides restarted Dec. 4, ending a
four-year peace pact in the former Portuguese colony.
	   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon said he expected the group's
leadership inside Angola to issue a statement on the peace accord
in the coming days.
	   The spokesman, Rui Oliveira, said the military situation in Bie
province was ``muddled.''
	   An International Red Cross spokesman in Luanda said the airport
at Huambo, the country's second-largest city, 110 kilometers (70
miles) west of Kuito, was closed to civilian flights.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the U.N.-brokered
1994 peace agreement that was supposed to end a two-decade civil
war that broke out after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

Arguments erupt over equestrian medal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's equestrian team refused
Wednesday to return a bronze medal in individual dressage
competition that was rescinded under a rule denying any country a
medal sweep in any Asian Games event.
	   South Korean riders won the top three places in the event
Tuesday, but the bronze was ordered awarded to fourth placer
Toshihide Takechi of Japan under the rule limiting one country to
two medals.
	   South Korea insisted the bronze belonged to Choi Myung-jin, who
was third behind compatriots Sun Jung-kyun and Shing Chang-moo.
	   Officials of the Olympic Council of Asia, the games' governing
body, were trying to find a solution after South Korea lost bronzes
in two other sports earlier in the games under the same rules.
	   ``The OCA will have another meeting again to find a resolution
for this. The South Koreans have claimed equestrian has no such
regulation and they prefer to stick with the rules of the horse
riding,'' said an official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
	   Under the OCA rule, South Korea lost bronze medals in bowling
and archery.
	   A Thai equestrian officer at the army base site of the
competition said Wednesday that equestrian has its own practice and
the OCA's rule should not replace it.
	   The South Koreans had made the same argument unsuccessfully in
the bowling.
	   Meanwhile, the first qualifying round for team show jumping
started Wednesday at the base in Saraburi province, 90 minutes'
drive north of Bangkok.
	   Japanese rider Toshiki Masui, on Grand Slam, led with no penalty
points, completing 11 jumps in 86.40 seconds. South Korean rider
Sohn Bong-gak made a smooth ride on Starlight, with no penalty and
a time of 94.11 seconds.
	   Third was Japan's Tadayoshi Kani on Kincraig with 4 penalty
points. The Philippines' 1998 Southeast Asian World Cup Champion
Marie Leviste was next.
	   Spectators applauded when Iran's Tara Ardalan moved to fifth
place on a borrowed horse.
	   Iran spent dlrs 16,000 to lease four horses after its own horses
were rejected for the competition and sent back to the United
States two weeks ago. Officials said they lacked the required
vaccination against diseases peculiar to East Asia.

	   The leadership reviewed all necessary precautions and measures

U.N. seeks dlrs 1.3 billion to hard-hit countries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations on Wednesday appealed for some
dlrs 1.3 billion to feed and care for refugees and hungry people
next year in some of the world's hardest-hit countries from Congo
to North Korea.
	   The first-ever combined global appeal by U.N. agencies for the
next year was aimed at combatting ``donor fatigue'' in wealthier
nations increasingly tired of apparently never-ending conflicts and
man-made disasters.
	   An appeal for Sudan, which has yet to be finalized, is expected
to take the total to around dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   Last year U.N. agencies appealed separately for a total dlrs 2.2
billion, but less than half of that came in.
	   This year's figure ``is roughly equivalent to a half day's total
military expenditure but will serve to protect some 25 million
people from starvation or disease,'' said Sergio Vieira de Mello,
the U.N.'s emergency relief coordinator.
	   The largest single appeals were for famine-stricken North Korea
_ dlrs 376 million _ and the countries of former Yugoslavia _ some
dlrs 359 million.
	   But many of the nations are in Africa _ Congo, Uganda, Burundi,
Somalia, Tanzania, Angola, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau.
	   The poor response previously was partly due to the way the
appeals were presented, Vieira said.
	   ``Weariness on the part of donors in the face of conflicts which
go on from one year to the next, and I think the example of Sudan
is possibly the most scandalous, is also a phenomenon we must try
to understand,'' Vieira said.
	   Since 1983 more than 1.5 million people have died in fighting
between rebels and government forces and resulting famines in
southern Sudan. An estimated 4 million Sudanese have been
displaced.
	   This year's appeal for Sudan brought one of the best responses _
over 80 percent _ but Vieira contended that, with dlrs 1 million a
day being spent on airlifts, ``donors can't carry on paying such
bills.''
	   An appeal for the Yugoslav province of Kosovo was also
three-quarters covered. But the picture was less rosy elsewhere.
	   This year's appeal for Tajikistan, for example, brought in less
than 30 percent of the dlrs 34.6 million sought, Vieira said.
	   The former Soviet republic's economy is in shambles following a
five-year civil war between the secular government, backed by
Russia, and the mostly Islamic opposition.
	   In some of the volatile countries covered by Wednesday's appeal,
the United Nations faces an uphill struggle in getting aid to the
people who need it.
	   It is asking for a total dlrs 185 million for Afghanistan,
having withdrawn international staff four months ago and buried a
colleague killed by renegade Taliban soldiers.
	   Dlrs 26 million is destined for Congo, where rebels took up arms
against President Laurent Kabila in August.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Wednesday it
will take Belgium and Italy to court for violating EU rules on the
recognition of diplomas of job-seekers from other EU countries.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive body, said it will sue
Belgium for refusing to carry out a comparative examination of the
qualifications of architects from other EU countries who want to
work in Belgium.
	   The Commission is also suing Belgium for rejecting diplomas
earned by captains of ocean-going vessels after a man with a
Netherlands diploma in captaincy was asked by Belgium authorities
to repeat his training.
	   Italy violated EU laws in the dentistry sector, by imposing
restrictive residency rules on dentists wishing to register as
professionals, and by allowing doctors to practise as dentists, a
Commission statement said.
	   The latter is inconsistent with EU rules ``harmonizing minimum
training requirements for dental practitioners ... to create a
specific profession of dental practitioner that is separate from
that of doctor,'' the statement said.

Cook says airstrikes against Iraq could come without warning

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As U.N. weapons inspectors evacuated Iraq on
Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes
could come quickly and without warning in the face of Saddam
Hussein's latest defiance.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday. ``I'm not now going to give him any warning of
what we might do.''
	   Speaking Wednesday in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Tony
Blair said the Iraqi dictator posed a threat to the world, adding,
``I'm quite satisfied that if we should choose to use force, we
have the necessary legal authority to do so.''
	   Blair's spokesman, speaking on customary anonymity, said this
weekend's start of the Muslim holy festival of Ramadan would be
taken in account as the government determined its response.
	   On Tuesday, a report by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler accused Saddam of not meeting promises made last month to
fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors and of imposing new
restrictions on their work.
	   Blair told lawmakers that Saddam has engaged in ``a plan of
deceit to prevent these weapons of mass destruction from being
located and destroyed.''
	   ``What the report details isn't merely the obstruction itself,''
the prime minister said. ``The obstruction directly relates to
documents, sites and personnel that would give clues as to the
whereabouts of the weapons of mass destruction and the capability
to make them.''
	   William Hague, leader of the opposition Conservative Party,
pledged his party's backing for aggression against Iraq.
	   ``I can assure the prime minister of the full support of the
opposition for the use of military action in the days ahead,
provided that action has clear and achievable objectives,'' Hague
said.
	   He told Blair that it must be a ``prime objective of Western
policy to remove Saddam Hussein from power.''
	   Blair discussed the Iraq crisis with U.S. President Bill Clinton
in a 15-minute phone call Tuesday night, the prime minister's
spokesman said.

 &UR; Netanyahu: early elections if he unable to stabilize his coalition

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will announce
Wednesday that will agree to early elections if he is unable to
stablize his shaky coalition, an Israeli official said.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Netanyahu
would first seek to bring disenchanted coalition members back into
the fold or try to form a national unity government with the dovish
Labor.
	   The official said Netanyahu preferred to hold elections within
two to three months if there was no other option.
	   Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu favored a May date for
elections and was expected to announce his support for early
balloting later Wednesday.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian Rostovtsev winning men's 20K &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSRBLIE, Slovakia (AP) _ Pavel Rostovtsev of Russia overcame two
shooting errors with a strong skiing performance to clinch his
first biathlon World Cup victory by winning a 20-kilometer race
Wednesday.
	   Rostovtsev, who had two penalty minutes added to his time,
clocked 52 minutes, 25 seconds to edge Vesa Hietalahti of Finland
by 8.4 seconds. Hietalahti has one missed target.
	   Rene Cattarinussi of Italy was third, 23.3 seconds behind the
winner. The Italian had two missed targets.
	   Rostovtsev opened a five-point lead over Ole Einar Bjoerndalen
of Norway in World Cup standings. The Olympic champion and overall
World Cup winner missed a staggering total of nine targets and
finished 77th.
	   Uschi Disl of Germany captured her second consecutive biathlon
World Cup victory when she overcame a shooting error and won a
15-kilometer competition.
	   ``I never thought I'd get away with only one shooting mistake,''
said the 28-year-old, who won the relay gold medal with Germany at
the Nagano Olympics in February.
	   Rostovstev, 27,
	   Disl, a five-time world champion, posted a time of 44 minutes,
34.2 seconds, including a one-minute penalty for one missed target,
from the prone position on the first stop at the shooting range.
	   Albina Achatova of Russia went perfect in shooting and took
second place in 45:56.5.
	   Magdalena Forsberg of Sweden retained her World Cup lead after
four events when she finished third, in 46:14.0. Forsberg, the
defending World Cup champion, lost the victory by missing two
targets on the final shooting stop, from the standing position.
	   Disl, who won her 16th career World Cup event, now has 98
points, while Forsberg leads with 110.
	   Biathlon combines cross-country skiing with target shooting. In
the 15K and 20K events, the racers make four stops at the range,
shooting twice from the prone and twice from the standing position.

Bosnian Muslims protest murder conviction before U.S. Embassy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Several hundred Bosnian
Muslim survivors of massacres by Serbs protested today outside the
U.S. Embassy against the murder conviction of three Muslims by a
Bosnian Serb court.
	   A small protest by Muslim women outside the embassy in the
Bosnian capital swelled to about 200 demonstrators, who waved
banners and broke through a security line and approached the gate.
	   The protesters were survivors from Srebrenica, a Muslim town in
eastern Bosnia where thousands of Muslim civilians were
systematically executed when Bosnian Serb forces overran the
enclave in 1995.
	   They were demonstrating against a Bosnian Serb court which on
Saturday sentenced three Muslim men from Srebrenica to prison for
murder, two receiving 20-year sentences, the third an 11-year
sentence.
	   Embassy officials promised to pass on a letter from the
protesters to President Clinton.
	   The imprisoned Muslim men were charged with murdering four Serbs
who went missing in the Srebrenica region and were never found.
There was no proof presented at the trial that they had been
killed. The defendants signed confessions, but later said they were
forced to do so.
	   Last year the men were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment each,
but international officials monitoring the Bosnian peace agreements
demanded a retrial, calling the first proceedings a sham.
	   International officials condemned Saturday's ruling, but said
they could do nothing more in the case. The men are now on hunger
strike.
	   The three men escaped the 1995 massacres at Srebrenica and
survived for months in the wild. They surrendered to U.S. soldiers
in May 1996 and were handed over to Bosnian Serb police.

Swedish group proposes first steps toward 'Middle East OSCE'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS typo in 'respected' in lede. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Although the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process remains stalled, the time is right to begin aiming even
higher and work for a comprehensive Middle East security regime,
the respected Stockholm International Peace Reasearch Institute
said Wednesday.
	   In a new report, the organization proposes broad principles for
developing ``an OSCE for the Middle East,'' said report author
Peter Jones, referring to the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is playing a growing role in European
peace efforts.
	   The report comes after 18 months of meetings of political and
academic figures from the Middle East and the West, including
Israel, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt. Palestinian
legislator Ziad Abu Zayyad also took part in the meetings.
	   ``Further progress in the (Israeli-Palestinian) peace process is
necessary to create a political climate for consideration of a
regional security regime,'' Jones said, but noted that the process'
halting progress so far has made many officials willing to consider
the ambitious idea of regional security.
	   Jones said the Middle East presents several unique challenges in
developing regional security, among them that it is the one area in
the world still severely plagued by ``asymmetric relations ... the
smaller countries genuinely fear for their existence.''
	   Middle East countries also generally work with a ``zero-sum
mentality,'' in which one country's success comes with another's
defeat, he said.
	   ``They have to try to overcome this,'' said Jones. ``Cooperative
security is the only possible basis for a Middle East security
regime.''
	   A fundamental objective of such a regime would be to establish a
weapons of mass destruction-free zone and a ``regional security
center,'' a body where officials could go for ``regular and
substantive exhanges,'' said Jones, a Canadian who led the project
for SIPRI.
	   SIPRI, highly regarded for its annual assessments of worldwide
armaments and security issues, can use its prestige to promote
discussion of the ideas and does not intend the report to be a
specific model, Jones said.
	   ``It's the first statement of a vision,'' he said. ``It's not a
statement of 'Here is a vision, or forget it'.''

President says Iran is best route for Central Asian energy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami said Wednesday
that Iran is likely to emerge as the main route for Central Asian
oil and gas, despite U.S. efforts to seek alternative routes.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying
that European countries were seeking the best route for Central
Asian oil and gas, and were unlikely to be swayed by the United
States.
	   The United States has discouraged foreign investments in Iran's
energy industry, and encouraged investments in Central Asia that
seek to channel crude fuel through routes other than through Iran.
	   Energy experts say Iran is the most economical and viable outlet
for oil and gas from Central Asia.
	   ``Despite all the efforts by the United States and the Zionists
to prevent transfer of the Central Asian energy to Europe and to
open waters through Iran, I am of the belief that Iran would be the
route for transfer of the energy,'' Khatami told Oil Ministry
officials.
	   Khatami also underscored the importance of oil in the Iranian
economy.
	   He noted that for the past 50 years 90 percent of Iran's foreign
exchange revenues and 60 percent of its domestic income has come
from oil.

Duvalier, interviewed in France, says he has nothing to fear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ousted Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, in an
interview made available Wednesday, gave himself credit for helping
to bring democracy to his country and said he has nothing to fear
from a movement to bring him to trial for crimes against humanity.
	   ``I am absolutely not afraid because I have done nothing
wrong,'' Duvalier was quoted as saying in an interview in the
weekly news magazine VSD, which goes on newsstands Thursday.
	   ``During the 1980s, I put the country on the road to democracy,
and I abolished the death penalty in 1983.''
	   The interview was conducted by a French journalist and author
who was contacted by someone close to Duvalier and driven to
interview the former dictator, known as Baby Doc, ``somewhere in
France.''
	   Duvalier said his ``greatest desire'' is to be able to return to
Haiti.
	   Asked if he would be interested in returning to politics, he
responded, ``Why not?''
	   Named president for life at age 19 following the death of his
father in 1971, Duvalier, 47, has lived in France since February
1986, when a popular uprising forced him into exile.
	   Encouraged by the arrest in Britain of former Chilean military
ruler Augusto Pinochet, Haitian-born photographer Gerald Bloncourt
has started a committee in Paris to bring Duvalier to trial.
	   Bloncourt said on Tuesday he had gathered ``the necessary
elements'' for a lawsuit and would announce legal action at a news
conference on Friday.
	   But Duvalier played down human rights abuses during his
dictatorship, particularly by the private militia known as the
Tontons Macoutes.
	   ``Those who you call the Tontons Macoutes might have committed
certain crimes,'' Duvalier said. ``But I must say that,
unfortunately, Haitians would say they lived much better then than
now.''
	   Duvalier has been spotted recently in both Paris and Cannes,
police sources said Tuesday, challenging the official French line
that the government has lost track of him and he may have left the
country.
	   Asked if he is in contact with French authorities, he replied:
``The interior minister has answered the question clearly.''
	   The French Interior Ministry said recently it had lost track of
him and that he ``probably'' had left the country.
	   ``Don't you think that French authorities have better things to
do than worry about someone who has lived discretely for 13
years?'' Duvalier said.
	   Reports that the former dictator left Haiti with a vast fortune
have been greatly exaggerated, Duvalier said, adding that he has
been reduced to living off gifts from friends and supporters.

Russia says U.S. holding up food aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's agriculture minister accused the United
States on Wednesday of stalling on promised food aid by introducing
new demands for control over its distribution, a news report said.
	   Agriculture Minister Gennady Kulik said Russia was ready to sign
amendments to the Russian-U.S. agreement reached last month on dlrs
625 million in food aid and loans. The new measures would envisage
additional controls to ensure that the 3.1 million tons of food
reaches those who need it most.
	   But the U.S. side was not satisfied with the measures, which is
causing ``unjustifiable'' delays, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted
Kulik as saying in Moscow. It gave no details of the provisions.
	   He predicted that aid promised by the European Union would
likely reach Russia before the U.S. aid.
	   Past food aid deals have been tainted by corruption, and U.S.
officials have stressed in their negotiations with Russia that they
wanted to avoid any hint of scandal in this aid program. Russia has
promised to keep tight control over the food.
	   Christopher Goldthwait, general sales manager for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture foreign service, told Russian journalists
Tuesday that the United States could halt the aid if any is stolen,
ITAR-Tass said. He said the first batch of food would likely arrive
Jan. 1.
	   Russia's poor grain harvest this year on top of this autumn's
economic crisis have prompted fears that some Russians could go
hungry this winter.

likely reach Russia before the U.S. aid.
	   Past food aid deals have been tainted by corruption, and U.S.
officials have stressed in their negotiations with Russia that they
wanted to avoid any hint of scandal in this aid program. Russia has
promised to keep tight control over the food.
	   Christopher Goldthwait, general sales manager for the U.S.
Department of Agriculture foreign service, told Russian journalists
Tuesday that the United States could halt the aid if any is stolen,
ITAR-Tass said. He said the first batch of food would likely arrive
Jan. 1.
	   Russia's poor grain harvest this year on top of this autumn's
economic crisis have prompted fears that some Russians could go
hungry this winter.

Germans hopeful now that England rocked by bribing scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany is ready to step in and send a
team to the Confederation Cup next year, hoping such a move would
help its bid to stage the 2006 World Cup.
	   And the bribery scandal in English soccer could further enhance
Germany's chances to land the lucrative competition, German media
speculated Wednesday.
	   The Germans, reigning European champion, turned down FIFA's
invitation to send a team to the inaugural edition of the
Confederation Cup in December 1996.
	   But now, they are making plans to take part, should France, the
World Cup champion, again decline to participate.
	   ``After we turned down the first edition, we see the
participation in the next Confederation Cup as a sporting and
political obligation,'' said Wolfgang Niersbach, spokesman for the
German Soccer Federation (DFB).
	   He said the Bundesliga was supporting the idea and would arrange
its schedule in such a way that the national team can take part.
	   The Confederation Cup has been moved from January to July or
August in Mexico.
	   ``The DFB would be collecting merits in FIFA by taking part in
the Confederation Cup,'' said the sports news agency SID.
	   ``And while the English federation is being rocked by a bribery
scandal, Franz Beckenbauer, as chief of the German bid, is securing
worldwide sympathies,'' SID commented.
	   The English Football Association was hit by the biggest scandal
in its 135-year history on Tuesday over a 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5
million) loan to the Welsh FA which the media interpreted as a
cash-for-votes scandal to get chairman Keith Wiseman into FIFA and
UEFA committees. Chief executive Graham Kelly quit and the
executive committee voted unanimously for Wiseman to step down too.
	   Beckenbauer, World Cup champion as a player in 1974 and as coach
in 1974, on Tuesday was officially named head of a DFB committee
guiding Germany's bid.

Court says German zoo can accept controversial baby elephants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 4 grafs with new details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ The Cologne Administrative court on
Wednesday cleared the way for Dresden's zoo to import four baby
elephants, ruling that reasons given by the environment ministry
against their import were insufficient.
	   However, the federal office for nature protection said later it
had filed an appeal with the high state administrative court in
Muenster. No one could be immediately contacted at the appeals
court for comment.
	   The decision came a day after Dresden zoo director Hubert
Luecker filed the complaint against cancellation of an import
permit by Environment Minister Juergen Trittin.
	   The four African elephants, along with three intended for the
zoo in Basel, Switzerland, were to be flown to Frankfurt later
Wednesday. a Cologne court spokesman said. But Erfurt zoo directgor
Norbert Neuschulz said he'd be surprised if the animals arrived in
Germany before Christmas.
	   The elephants, which were to be sent this month to the Dresden
and Erfurt zoos in eastern Germany, were part of a group of 30
young elephants captured in August from herds in Botswana and taken
to a South African farm.
	   A South African judge ruled early this month that the animals
had been abused and deprived of water at the farm. He granted
temporary custody to the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.
	   But according to the German Embassy in South Africa, the
accusations against the animal farm were largely groundless.
	   Trittin last week said that Germany would protest the abuse of
the animals by not accepting them in its zoos, even after the South
African judge approved their export.
	   Norbert Otto, a federal lawmaker from Erfurt, demanded in
parliament Tuesday that Trittin take steps to prevent the animals
from being put to sleep in South Africa.
	   In addition, the cultural minister of Saxony, of which Dresden
is the capital, asked the state's 740,000 school children to write
letters of protest urging Trittin to allow the elephants into
Germany.

Jamaica raises money laundering reporting threshold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The Jamaican parliament has passed
money laundering legislation raising the reporting threshold for
banks from dlrs 10,000 to dlrs 50,000.
	   All ``suspicious'' transactions of any amount must still be
reported, the law says. The changes were passed Tuesday.
	   The change was made to ease restrictions on tourism-related
businesses that transact large amounts of money in foreign
currency, said National Security Minister Keith Knight.
	   The amendments also raise the reporting threshold for foreign
currency exchange house from dlrs 5,000 to dlrs 8,000.
	   Under Jamaican law, banks are required to report transactions
above the threshold to the island's director of public prosecution.
Some government bodies, international agencies and diplomatic
offices are given exemptions.
	   During debate in parliament, the opposition Jamaica Labor Party
claimed that the amendment forces banks to do more detective work
instead of automatically reporting transactions.
	   Knight disagreed. ``Suspicious transactions are those which
institutions deem unusual given the habits of a particular
customer, but the judgement will always rest with the director of
public prosecutions,'' he said.

Israeli parliament delegation meets Polish prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Leaders of Israel's Knesset, or
parliament, met Wednesday with Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek to
discuss several issues straining Polish-Israeli relations.
	   The Knesset delegation, headed by chairman Dan Tichon, was in
Poland on a four-day visit.
	   According to the PAP state news agency, Buzek and the delegation
discussed Poland's cancellation last week of a contract to buy
Israeli-made missiles for its Huzar helicopters. At the time,
Israel warned of possible legal action over the decision by Buzek's
Cabinet.
	   Few details of Wednesday's talks were immediately available. PAP
reported that other subjects discussed included the scores of
crosses erected next door to the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, and the
question of returning property lost by Polish Jews in the
Holocaust.
	   A statement by Buzek's office said both sides agreed that
problems in Polish-Jewish relations should be discussed openly and
solved in the spirit of compromise.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The Presidents of Ukraine and Macedonia
called Wednesday for political talks on neighboring Kosovo saying
the solution for the province should be autonomy within Yugoslavia.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and his Macedonian counterpart
Kiro Gligorov also signed an agreement on friendship and
cooperation, pledging to further improve relations between the two
countries.
	   Ukraine has sent 50 unarmed observers to Kosovo as part of an
2,000-men international mission tasked with monitoring a shaky
truce in the province. A still-forming NATO mission in Macedonia is
aimed at protecting the observers in case of danger.
	   ``Our views are completely compatible _ solution for the Kosovo
crisis is only possible by peaceful means, by giving the province
autonomy while respecting the territorial integrity of
Yugoslavia,'' said Kuchma.
	   ``We agreed that the situation in Kosovo is complex and
worrying,'' added Gligorov.

U.N. Security Council calls emergency meeting on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with U.N. Security Council calling
emergency meeting, report that U.S. personnel being pulled out,
comments from Butler and secretary-general Annan; changes headline
to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council called an
emergency meeting Wednesday to discuss chief inspector Richard
Butler's report that Iraq failed to cooperate with U.N. monitors,
which has again raised the threat of U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   Butler said Wednesday morning that he ordered all staff from the
U.N. Special Commission, which he heads, and the International
Atomic Energy Agency to leave Baghdad because ``they are not able
to do their work adequately.''
	   A plane carrying some staff landed in Bahrain but others were
leaving by road and Butler said he did not know whether they were
out of Iraq. ``That's my most important concern, that everyone is
out and safe,'' he said.
	   There were about 140 U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday morning he had been
told by Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh that the United
States is also asking U.S. personnel in the region to leave.
	   Some other U.N. personnel have left and those remaining have
assembled in one location in Baghdad ``for their own safety,''
Annan said.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's full compliance with the inspectors who
are trying to verify Iraq's disarmament _ a view reiterated Tuesday
night by a U.S. diplomat.
	   ``We believe we have the authority we need under previous
Security Council resolutions to act and all options are on the
table,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``It's pretty serious and makes some strong conclusions.''
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz called it ``a bad
report'' and said it was ``intended to trigger American and British
military strike on Iraq,'' according to the Iraqi News Agency.
	   Russia and France, who called the council meeting, contend along
with China that the Security Council must sanction any military
action.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov Wednesday accused Butler of
overstepping his authority by ordering all personnel from the
commission, known as UNSCOM, to leave.
	   A resolution adopted by the council says a comprehensive review
of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions _ which Baghdad
desperately wants _ would only go ahead if Butler reported that
Iraq had resumed full cooperation with inspectors.
	   In his report to Annan on Tuesday, Butler said that ``Iraq's
conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in either the
fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited weapons
programs.''
	   Iraq pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors and
allow unfettered access to sites and documents on Nov. 14, under
threat of U.S. and British airstrikes. Butler accused Baghdad of
blocking access to two sites and hindering inspection of others.
	   The chief inspector said Wednesday morning that he that
regretted having to report ``that we can't adequately do our job
under these circumstances.
	   ``It made logical sense therefore to pull our people out and
we'll see where this goes in the future,'' Butler said.
	   Arriving at the United Nations Wednesday morning, the
secretary-general was asked whether a military assault was now
warranted. ``Well, I think it's an issue for the council,'' he
replied.
	   Annan helped defuse crises with Iraq in February and November
only to have Baghdad not fulfill its promises. He said he had not
spoken to the Iraqis since the report was issued.
	   In a letter to the council president accompanying the report,
Annan suggested that council members had three options:
	   _They could decide that Iraq's performance does not justify a
comprehensive review at this time.
	   _They could decide that Iraq should be given additional time to
provide full cooperation.
	   _They could proceed with a comprehensive review ``on the premise
that it is sufficiently important to know precisely what has been
achieved in the area of disarmament over the entire period since
1991.''
	   Under the cease-fire resolution that ended the Gulf War in 1991,
sanctions against the sale of oil, the mainstay of Iraq's economy,
cannot be lifted until UNSCOM and the IAEA certify that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction _ chemical, biological and nuclear as
well as long-range missiles _ have been destroyed.
	   The Iraqis believe a comprehensive review offers the quickest
route to lifting sanctions. But the United States insists there is
no link, and a review will only show what Iraq needs to do to fully
disarm.
	   While Butler's 10-page report was hard-hitting and fairly
negative, the IAEA's report concluded that Iraq had provided ``the
necessary level of cooperation'' to enable its nuclear inspectors
to complete their work ``efficiently and effectively.''
	   Mohamed El Baradei, the IAEA's director general, said in a
letter to Annan that Iraq pledged to cooperate with the IAEA to
resolve ``the few remaining questions and concerns related to
Iraq's clandestine nuclear program.''
	   In contrast, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction,
evasion and subterfuge that he said made it impossible ``without
further verification'' to assure the Security Council that
Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.
	   Butler said the U.N. Special Commission had ``clear evidence
that Iraq had taken advance actions at certain of the locations
planned for inspection in order to defeat the purposes of
inspection.''
	   During the past week, inspectors searching for material related
to banned weapons programs went to six locations and were allowed
to search the Taji military facility, a special security
organization cable office, and a private residence, Butler said.
	   But inspectors trying to enter the ruling Baath Party
headquarters _ where they had ``solid evidence of the presence of
proscribed materials'' _ couldn't gain access because Iraq
initially declared it to be a ``sensitive'' site subject to special
procedures and later introduced new requirements, including a
letter indicating what was being sought, Butler said.
	   At two other sites declared ``sensitive'' by Iraq, negotiations
ultimately cleared the way for inspections, he said. But one
building had been emptied of relevant materials, and the other
``had been prepared to avoid any disclosure of relevant materials
and the team assessed Iraq had expected their arrival,'' he said.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.

German publisher sets up committee to investigate Nazi era
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG said
Wednesday it was appointing an independent committee to research
its activities during the Nazi era after a German sociologist
challenged the official company history as a myth.
	   In a statement, the company said the panel would consist of a
historian, a theologian and an expert in literature and meet
``international standards'' for researching corporate histories.
	   It said it was responding to an article published by Hersch
Fischler of Duesseldorf in a Swiss newspaper in October. In that
article, titled ``Bright Future, Dark Past,'' Fischler accused
Bertelsmann of covering up its Nazi ties in the 1930s and '40s.
	   Bertelsmann was founded in 1835 in the town of Guetersloh as a
publisher of prayer books and hymnals.
	   In a corporate history prepared for its 150th anniversary in
1985, the company maintained it was shut down by the Nazis in 1943
because of the devout Christianity of its then-boss, Heinrich Mohn.
	   Fischler, however, reported Mohn was a ``passive'' member of the
SS who avoided arrest when the Nazis investigated Bertelsmann for
illegally procuring paper and profiteering.
	   Bertelsmann also published pro-Hitler books used by the Nazi
propaganda machine in the 1930s and '40s as well as ``blood and
soil'' action stories glorifying battles and anti-Semitic works,
Fischler found.
	   Bertelsmann said its booklist during the Nazi era ``probably
passed on the discussion of the time in its entire breadth and
variety.''
	   But it noted that the titles cited by Fischler were relatively
few considering the thousands of publications put out by
Bertelsmann over the period, adding that a large number of its
theological books were banned by the Nazis.
	   Nevertheless, it said the company, including majority
shareholder Reinhard Mohn, son of its wartime leader, ``recognized
its responsibility without reservation'' to present a complete
corporate history.
	   Bertelsmann, which resumed operations in 1947, is now the
world's third largest media company, operating in 53 countries with
60,000 employees and annual revenues of 26 billion marks (dlrs 16
billion).
	   Along with its global magazine and music businesses, it owns
half of Europe's largest commercial broadcaster, CLT-UFA. Following
the purchase of Random House this year, Bertelsmann is also the
world's largest English-language publisher of trade books.
	   It has a joint venture with the AOL online service and in
October paid dlrs 200 million for half of the Barnes &AMP; Noble
Internet bookstore.

President says Iran is best route for Central Asian energy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami said Wednesday
that Iran is likely to emerge as the main route for Central Asian
oil and gas, despite U.S. efforts to seek alternative routes.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying
that European countries were seeking the best route for Central
Asian oil and gas, and were unlikely to be swayed by the United
States.
	   The United States has discouraged foreign investments in Iran's
energy industry, and encouraged investments in Central Asia that
seek to channel crude fuel through routes other than through Iran.
	   Energy experts say Iran is the most economical and viable outlet
for oil and gas from Central Asia.
	   ``Despite all the efforts by the United States and the Zionists
to prevent transfer of the Central Asian energy to Europe and to
open waters through Iran, I am of the belief that Iran would be the
route for transfer of the energy,'' Khatami told Oil Ministry
officials.
	   Khatami also underscored the importance of oil in the Iranian
economy.
	   He noted that for the past 50 years 90 percent of Iran's foreign
exchange revenues and 60 percent of its domestic income has come
from oil.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Benny McCarthy scored both
goals as South Africa beat Egypt 2-1 Wednesday, avenging an African
Cup of Nations loss earlier in the year.
	   South Africa played with poise and composure in the Nelson
Mandela Challenge. After soaking up the initial early offensives by
the Pharoahs, Bafana Bafana took control.
	   But Egypt scored first when Ahmed Hasan volleyed a pass from
Hesham Hanafy past South African goalkeeper Hans Vonk in the 35th
minute.
	   The lead became shortlived when McCarthy connected with the ball
in the box, left-footing it past goalkeeper Nader El Sayed in the
40th minute.
	   South Africa sealed Egypt's fate when Ajax star McCarthy headed
in midfielder Quinton Fortune's free kick in the 74th minute.
	   It was an explosive tussle between Africa's two soccer
heavyeights, with the game flowing from one end of the pitch to the
other. The match also marked Trott Moloto's first time at the helm
of the South African national team since he was named coach on Dec.
3.
	   Moloto had previously been interim coach since taking over from
Frenchman Philippe Troussier.
	   Bafana Bafana _ or ``The Boys'' as the team is known in the Zulu
language _ had been the African Cup of Nations champions until they
lost the cup to Egypt on Feb. 28. For South Africa, Wednesday was
sweet revenge.

 &UR; As talk of early elections heats up, Netanyahu addresses issue &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Israel-Elections &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will
announce Wednesday that he will call early elections if he is
unable to stabilize his shaky coalition, an Israeli official said.
	   With such an announcement, Netanyahu would avoid being forced
into early elections by the opposition in a critical vote in
parliament Monday. He would also be able to set a date for voting
that is most suitable to him.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Netanyahu
would first seek to bring disenchanted coalition members back into
the fold or try to form a national unity government with the dovish
opposition Labor Party.
	   The official said that if there is no other option, Netanyahu
will prefer to hold elections within two to three months, ahead of
May 4 _ the date that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has set for
a declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
	   Holding the vote before May would allow Netanyahu to use
Arafat's threat as campaign issue. Netanyahu opposes Palestinian
statehood and in the 1996 race portrayed Labor has having made too
many concessions to the Palestinians.
	   The next scheduled elections are in May 2000.
	   Netanyahu said he would address the issue of early elections at
a candlelighting ceremony for the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah on
Wednesday evening.
	   Netanyahu's government is threatened by an alliance of
disgruntled former Cabinet ministers, dovish opposition legislators
upset by his refusal to withdraw troops in the West Bank and by
coalition hawks who fear he'll do just that.
	   The six-party coalition suffered a blow when Finance Minister
Yaakov Neeman announced Tuesday evening he would resign and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he would make an important
political announcement this week.
	   Since coming to power, Netanyahu has been engaged in a balancing
act between keeping the talks with the Palestinians alive while not
making concessions that would prompt hard-liners in his coalition
to try and bring him down.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's three-day visit this week, during
which he tried to revive the Wye accord, forced the issue.
Netanyahu told the president he would not withdraw troops on
Friday, citing repeated Palestinian violations of the accord.
	   In response, Labor said it would no longer back the government
in crucial votes, as it had done in recent weeks, to ensure that
the Wye accord is carried out.
	   Meir Shetreet, the chairman of the ruling coalition, said he was
having difficulties mustering a majority in parliament.
	   A crucial test will come on Monday. On that day, parliament will
vote either on a motion of no confidence in the government or a
bill to hold early elections and Labor believes it has enough
supporters to win either.
	   Netanyahu himself had instigated the no-confidence motion on
Dec. 7 as part of an elaborate parliamentary maneuver to delay the
vote of the early elections bill by two weeks.
	   Netanyahu could get the no confidence motion withdrawn at the
last minute, leaving only the early elections bill on the table.
	   Communications Minister Limor Livnat urged Netanyahu to join
forces with Labor and set up a broad-based government.
	   The recommendation was surprising because Livnat is one of the
staunchest opponents of the Wye agreement. In a Likud-Labor
government, there would be a much strong push to implement Wye.
	   Livnat said she's had a change of heart. After the visit of
Clinton to Gaza, she said, ``we have to admit that a Palestinian
state will be declared and recognized by the nations of the
world.''

Blair promises to back bid despite scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed continued full
support Wednesday for England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup
despite a bribery scandal sweeping through the Football
Association.
	   Speaking in Parliament and without refering directly to the
scandal, Blair said the bid still had the government's complete
backing.
	   ``If there is to be a bid from this part of the world, we should
carry on fighting for it,'' he said.
	   The biggest scandal to hit the FA in its 135-year history led to
the resignation of its leading official on Tuesday as well as a
unanimous vote for the chairman to quit.
	   Chief executive Graham Kelly and chairman Keith Wiseman
unilaterally agreed a 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5 million) loan to
the Welsh FA without consulting the rest of the executive
committee.
	   The papers interpreted it as a move to gain a vote for Wiseman
in an election for FIFA and UEFA executive committees and charged
that the two men had dragged English soccer into an unprecedented
and damaging scandal.
	   While clubs and fans digested Tuesday's stunning events, several
newspapers said that the crisis had virtually killed off England's
bid to stage the 2006 World Cup. Other candidates include Germany,
Brazil, Morocco, Ghana and Egypt with South Africa also expected to
enter a bid.
	   The Times of London said that the England bid had now ``lost its
credibility'' and stood no chance at all if Wiseman stayed as
chairman. Although he has refused to resign, he may be forced out
by a meeting of the 91-member FA Council Jan. 4.
	   The tabloid Daily Mirror said the scandal had put the future of
England coach Glenn Hoddle in doubt and ``could shatter'' hopes of
staging the 2006 World Cup.
	   ``Kelly has cost us the World Cup'' headlined the Sun. ``Now
there are fears that the 9 million pound (dlrs 15 million) campaign
to stage the 2006 finals will prove a disastrous waste of money,''
the paper said.
	   Geoff Hurst, the only player to score a World Cup final
hat-trick and one of the ambassadors of the England bid, maintained
that the events at FA headquarters would not harm the campaign.
	   ``It is unfortunate, but we don't believe it is going to have
any long-term effect,'' said the 1966 World Cup star. ``I am
confident that once these events are over there will be no damage.
	   ``Graham Kelly has done a lot of work over the years, and on a
personal note I am sorry to see him go. But this change will in no
way affect the future of the bid.
	   ``David Davies said today that bringing the World Cup in 2006 is
an absolute priority, and we welcome that.''
	   Davies, an executive director of the FA and main spokesman for
the organization, has temporarily taken over from Kelly while the
executive committee takes steps to appoint a successor. He is a
strong candidate to take the job full time.
	   Davies acknowledged that Tuesday's events took the spotlight
away from the bid.
	   ``It is clearly unhelpful at this time, but the fact of the
matter is that (2006 World Cup campaign leader) Alex McGivan and
Sir Bobby Charlton are in Thailand furthering a bid which was
launched 18 months ago, and all the evidence is it is going very
well,'' he said.
	   ``Ultimately the bid will be decided on where are the best
facilities, which is the country that could stage the World Cup
best _ and FIFA have said that only last night.''
	   Davies denied that other leading bidders would gain from the FA
crisis.
	   ``Germany have had their problems as well; South Africa have had
their problems,'' he said, without elaborating. ``We will overcome
this, and I notice today that Franz Beckenbauer is heading
Germany's bid.
	   ``Well, Sir Bobby Charlton, Sir Geoff Hurst and Gary Lineker
have been travelling the world on behalf of the FA in recent
times.''

Ukraine's parliament moves to halt energy privatization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament moved Wednesday to
freeze privatization in the energy sector and investigate
violations allegedly made by senior government officials in the
process.
	   Lawmakers gave preliminary approval to a resolution on a
moratorium on energy sector privatization. It is slated for final
approval next week.
	   The resolution labels the situation in Ukraine's energy sector
as ``critical'' and ordered the chief prosecutor's office to check
the legality of recent government decisions concerning energy
privatization. Ukraine has faced chronic energy supply problems
since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   The resolution ordered the Cabinet's privatization agency, the
State Property Fund, to stop selling energy companies until
parliament approves a law on regulating energy privatization.
	   The State Property Fund was also ordered to suspend tenders for
the sale of energy companies, and to revoke results of tenders
whose winners failed to fulfill their promises after the buyouts.
	   Wednesday's vote came several weeks after the Cabinet announced
plans to start offering controlling stakes in dozens of state-run
energy companies.
	   All the companies hold a monopoly or near monopoly on
electricity supplies in their regions, and are considered among
Ukraine's most attractive properties.
	   Earlier this year, the State Property Fund had offered stakes in
18 of Ukraine's 27 regional energy facilities, but managed to sell
only 9 of them.
	   The poor results led the Cabinet to suspend the program this
fall to work out more attractive conditions for potential
investors, including Western energy companies.
	   However, deputies argued Wednesday that many government
officials were aiming to illegally profit from energy privatization
by selling stakes to companies linked to them.
	   Ukraine's government is relying on energy companies for much of
next year's projected privatization revenues of 800 million hryvna
(dlrs 233 million), which the former Soviet republic badly needs to
meet its foreign debt obligations and cover mounting wage arrears.
	   Privatization efforts in Ukraine have moved slowly, and were
complicated this year by the economic crisis in neighboring Russia
and the exodus of foreign investors from Ukraine's shaky financial
market.

Spanish lawyers concede Amnesty links, but say no Pinochet bias

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers for the Spanish government acknowledged
Wednesday that a judge linked to Amnesty International who ruled
against Gen. Augusto Pinochet has liberal views, but said these did
not sway him against the former Chilean dictator.
	   ``Some of your Lordships tend to take a more conservative
approach and some a more liberal approach to matters concerning
human rights,'' lawyer Alun Jones told a five-judge tribunal in the
House of Lords, Britain's highest court.
	   Discussion in British courts of the political views of judges is
highly unusual and underlines the uniqueness of the case, in which
Pinochet's lawyers seek to nullify a 3-2 ruling that he has no
immunity from prosecution as a former foreign head of state.
	   At the end of the two-day hearing, the judges said they might
render their decision Thursday morning. If not, it will not be
announced until after Christmas, they said.
	   The 83-year-old general was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a
Spanish extradition warrant accusing him of genocide and other
crimes against humanity committed during his 17-year reign.
	   An official Chilean report says some 3,000 people were killed by
secret police after he overthrew an elected Marxist in 1973.
	   Pinochet's lawyers had asserted Tuesday, the start of the
hearing, that the Lords' Nov. 25 ruling denying him immunity should
be overturned because one judge, Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann, is
the director of Amnesty International's fundraising arm.
	   In addition, Hoffmann's wife, Gillian, has worked since 1977 in
Amnesty's London office.
	   The human rights group says the Hoffmanns, South African
opponents of apartheid who came to Britain in the '60s, played no
part in its 25-year campaign to put Pinochet on trial.
	   ``He (Hoffmann) is hostile to the notion that people may be
tortured, that people may be abducted and murdered by forces
representing a controlling state, and he is therefore wholly
favorable to the aims of Amnesty International,'' Jones said
Wednesday.
	   ``These are uncontroversial aims,'' Jones added.
	   Both sides acknowledged, however, that a key question is why
Hoffmann did not disclose his close ties with Amnesty before the
first hearing, as is routine with judges.
	   Pinochet's attorney, Clare Montgomery, said Wednesday that any
reasonable person would believe Hoffmann must have been predisposed
against Pinochet, adding, ``That appearance cannot be allowed to
stand.''
	   The tribunal's chief judge, Lord Justice Nicolas
Browne-Wilkinson, appeared to be receptive to her argument, telling
the opposing attorneys at one point, ``The first thing I ever
learned about English law _ which is justice being done and being
seen to be done _ that seems to be going overboard completely.''
	   Pinochet's lawyers returned to the Lords after failing to
persuade the British Cabinet member with the final say on
extradition, Home Secretary Jack Straw, that Hoffmann was biased.
	   Straw ruled Dec. 9 that Spain can start extradition proceedings
in the courts.
	   The process could take months or longer as Pinochet, under
police guard in a rented mansions 20 miles (30 kms) west of London,
fights every legal step.
	   Spain's lawyers maintain that the latest move in the Lords is a
desperate attempt by Pinochet to avoid extradition. They also
argued that the general's lawyers should have known of Hoffmann's
Amnesty links before the hearing.

Croatia's World Cup captain says he might be gone soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Zvonomir Boban, Croatia's World Cup captain,
is unhappy about being reined in by AC Milan coach Alberto
Zaccheroni and won't be with the Italian League club next season,
the players said in an interview published Wednesday.
	   ``I'll leave Milan. Maybe I'll stay until June, but I could also
leave around Christmas,'' Boban told the Gazzetta dello Sport
newspaper. ``Right now, the conditions are not right to continue
(playing) here.''
	   The midfielder has appeared in eight of Milan's 13 games this
season, often as a susbstitute. He entered with 11 minutes left in
Sunday's 1-0 win over Vicenza, a victory that pushed Milan into
second place in Serie A.
	   But Boban, 30, said the lack of playing time is not the crux of
his complaint.
	   ``It's not because I don't play. ... I seem to represent a
strategic problem. I think I am a very creative player, but the
coach prefers having central midfielders play defensively,'' he
said.
	   ``I could play every game, and score 20 goals, but I would leave
anyway.''
	   Since joining Milan in 1992, Boban has helped the club win three
Serie A titles and one European Champions Cup. He has scored 13
goals in 143 league games.
	   Zaccheroni is in is first year as Milan's coach, and has
redesigned the club completely. Milan finished in the middle of the
standings each of the past two seasons.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will
announce Wednesday that he will call early elections if he is
unable to stabilize his shaky coalition, an Israeli official said.
	   With such an announcement, Netanyahu would pre-empt a tough
challenge to his coalition in parliament next week and be able to
set a date for voting that is most suitable to him.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Netanyahu
would first seek to bring disenchanted coalition members back into
the fold or try to form a national unity government with the dovish
opposition Labor Party.
	   The official said that if there is no other option, Netanyahu
will prefer to hold elections within two to three months, ahead of
May 4 _ the date that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has set for
a declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
	   Holding the vote before May would allow Netanyahu to use
Arafat's threat as campaign issue. Netanyahu opposes Palestinian
statehood and in the 1996 race portrayed Labor has having made too
many concessions to the Palestinians.
	   The next scheduled elections are in May 2000.
	   Netanyahu said he would address the issue of early elections at
a candlelighting ceremony for the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah on
Wednesday evening.
	   Netanyahu's government is threatened by an alliance of
disgruntled former Cabinet ministers, dovish opposition legislators
upset by his refusal to withdraw troops in the West Bank and by
coalition hawks who fear he'll do just that.
	   The six-party coalition suffered a blow when Finance Minister
Yaakov Neeman announced Tuesday evening he would resign and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he would make an important
political announcement this week.
	   Since coming to power, Netanyahu has been engaged in a balancing
act between keeping the talks with the Palestinians alive while not
making concessions that would prompt hard-liners in his coalition
to try to bring him down.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's three-day visit this week forced
the issue. Netanyahu told the president he would not withdraw
troops on Friday, citing repeated Palestinian violations of the Wye
accord, which the United States brokered in October.
	   In response, Labor said it would no longer back the government
in crucial votes, as it had done in recent weeks, to ensure that
the accord was carried out.
	   Meir Shetreet, the chairman of the ruling coalition, said he was
having difficulties mustering a majority in parliament.
	   A crucial test will come Monday. On that day, parliament will
vote either on a motion of no confidence in the government or a
bill to hold early elections and Labor believes it has enough
supporters to win either.
	   Netanyahu himself instigated the no-confidence motion on Dec. 7
as part of an elaborate parliamentary maneuver to delay the vote of
the early elections bill by two weeks.
	   Netanyahu could get the no confidence motion withdrawn at the
last minute, leaving only the early elections bill on the table.
	   Communications Minister Limor Livnat urged Netanyahu to join
forces with Labor and set up a broad-based government.
	   The recommendation was surprising because Livnat is one of the
staunchest opponents of the Wye agreement. In a Likud-Labor
government, there would be a much stronger push to implement Wye.
	   Livnat said she's had a change of heart. After the visit of
Clinton to Gaza, she said, ``we have to admit that a Palestinian
state will be declared and recognized by the nations of the
world.''

Illegal trade in Vietnamese wildlife threatens species
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A flourishing illegal trade in tigers and other
wildlife in Vietnam continues to threaten the future of many
species, and government efforts to stop it have been ineffective,
according to a new study by the World Wide Fund for Nature.
	   The report, released Wednesday as part of the nature group's
Year of the Tiger Campaign, said 69,000 animals from Vietnam were
confiscated en route to domestic and overseas markets between June
1996 and June 1997, representing ``just the tip of the iceberg.''
	   ``Urgent measures are needed to crack down on this trade to
conserve what is left of Vietnam wildlife,'' said James Compton,
the report's author. ``Hunting and wildlife trade levels are at
their seasonal peak now, but without immediate action they are set
to rise even higher with the demand for extra cash around the
Vietnamese New Year.''
	   Compton said Vietnam plays three important roles in the wildlife
trade: It is a major source of wildlife, it consumes wildlife
products, and it serves as a major trade corridor for as much as 90
percent of wildlife trade bound for more lucrative markets, such as
China.
	   Small mammals and reptiles make up the bulk of the trade, but
larger animals, including tigers, Asiatic black bears, sun bears,
clouded leopards and langurs are also traded, the report said.
	   Government efforts to clamp down on the trade are hampered by
lack of resources, the report said. Also, fines imposed on traders
who are caught are so low that some regard them as overhead, it
said.
	   The report calls for a range of measures, including boosting the
Forest Protection Department responsible for policing wildlife
trade; rigorous checking of air freight, sea freight and
cross-border road traffic; and providing alternatives to medicines
for which some endangered species are sought.

Palestinian leaders say reviewing their own peace commitments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS throughout to update with Palestinians remaining
committed to Wye; will be UPDATED with Netanyahu announcement at
1800 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians said Wednesday they will stick to
their Wye River accord commitments, despite an Israeli freeze on
the process _ an apparent effort to cultivate the U.S.-Palestinian
friendship that blossomed during this week's Clinton visit.
	   Netanyahu on Wednesday morning briefed his Cabinet on U.S.
President Bill Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told
the president a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops on
Friday, as required by the Wye accord.
	   An Israeli official speaking on condition of anonymity later
said Netanyahu would announce Wednesday night that he will agree to
early elections if he is unable to stabilize his shaky coalition.
Netanyahu's office said he would make announcement ``regarding
elections'' at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).
	   That would further delay implementation of the agreement
brokered by Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October.
	   Netanyahu says he wants solid evidence that the Palestinians are
fulfilling their commitment to contain anti-Israel violence and to
round up illegal weapons.
	   The Palestinians want quid-pro-quo for acceding on Monday to the
Israeli demand that the Palestine National Council convene and
renounce clauses in its charter calling for Israel's destruction.
Clinton attended that meeting.
	   Palestinian officials said Netanyahu's actions brought his
commitment to the peace process into question.
	   ``It shows that the Israeli government doesn't believe in peace,
and this is what we are seeing on the ground,'' said Mahmoud Abbas,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy.
	   Still, Palestinians remained committed to the process, and would
continue to fulfill its requirements.
	   ``We shall continue to carry out our commitments and we shall
push ... for full implementation from Israel,'' said Nabil Shaath,
a top Palestinian negotiator returning with Arafat from Egypt,
where the Palestinian leader briefed President Hosni Mubarak on the
Clinton visit.
	   Shaath even indicated that the Palestinians were willing a
post-Wye demand from Netanyahu that Arafat back off a promise to
declare statehood by May. The declaration would come only if Israel
delays agreements, he said.
	   Despite his denials, Israelis and Palestinians saw Clinton's
tour of Gaza as conferring tacit approval of Palestinian statehood.
	   Clinton also moved Palestinians in his speeches when he
expressed understanding at the pain that resulted from years of
dislocation and occupation.
	   ``The United States has taken long strives toward neutrality and
a lack of bias regarding Palestinians and Israelis,'' Mahmoud Abbas
told Voice of Palestine radio.
	   Arafat could not resist intimating his new-found closeness to
Clinton when he was asked to react to Netanyahu's freeze on troop
withdrawal.
	   ``I don't think that the American administration and President
Clinton will agree to this,'' he said _ a speculation unimaginable
just a month ago.
	   Netanyahu is trying to shore up support from hard-liners in his
coalition who have threatened to vote against the government in a
no-confidence motion on Monday.
	   Some of the hawks have said they no longer trust Netanyahu not
to make concessions to the Palestinians, and are set to vote
against the government.
	   The prime minister would first seek to bring disenchanted
coalition members back into the fold or try to form a national
unity government with the dovish Labor party, the Israeli official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said Netanyahu would hold elections within two to
three months if there was no other option.
	   Palestinians said it was increasingly difficult to work with a
weakened government.
	   ``All the talk by Israeli officials about security is not the
security of the Israeli people, but the security of keeping their
seats in the government,'' said Gaza security chief Mohammmed
Dahlan.
	   Clinton also appeared frustrated with the Israeli prime
minister's apparent obsession with domestic worries.
	   ``We'll just keep at it,'' Clinton said Tuesday, and announced
that U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will return to the
Mideast in several weeks.

Germans hopeful now that England rocked by bribing scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Fixes dates in last graf, to correct from 1974 to 1990 as

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany is ready to step in and send a
team to the Confederation Cup next year, hoping such a move would
help its bid to stage the 2006 World Cup.
	   And the bribery scandal in English soccer could further enhance
Germany's chances to land the lucrative competition, German media
speculated Wednesday.
	   The Germans, reigning European champion, turned down FIFA's
invitation to send a team to the inaugural edition of the
Confederation Cup in December 1996.
	   But now, they are making plans to take part, should France, the
World Cup champion, again decline to participate.
	   ``After we turned down the first edition, we see the
participation in the next Confederation Cup as a sporting and
political obligation,'' said Wolfgang Niersbach, spokesman for the
German Soccer Federation (DFB).
	   He said the Bundesliga was supporting the idea and would arrange
its schedule in such a way that the national team can take part.
	   The Confederation Cup has been moved from January to July or
August in Mexico.
	   ``The DFB would be collecting merits in FIFA by taking part in
the Confederation Cup,'' said the sports news agency SID.
	   ``And while the English federation is being rocked by a bribery
scandal, Franz Beckenbauer, as chief of the German bid, is securing
worldwide sympathies,'' SID commented.
	   The English Football Association was hit by the biggest scandal
in its 135-year history on Tuesday over a 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5
million) loan to the Welsh FA which the media interpreted as a
cash-for-votes scandal to get chairman Keith Wiseman into FIFA and
UEFA committees. Chief executive Graham Kelly quit and the
executive committee voted unanimously for Wiseman to step down too.
	   Beckenbauer, World Cup champion as a player in 1974 and as coach
in 1990, on Tuesday was officially named head of a DFB committee
guiding Germany's bid.

President says Iran is best route for Central Asian energy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami said Wednesday
that Iran is likely to emerge as the main route for Central Asian
oil and gas, despite U.S. efforts to seek alternative routes.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying
that European countries were seeking the best route for Central
Asian oil and gas, and were unlikely to be swayed by the United
States.
	   The United States has discouraged foreign investments in Iran's
energy industry, and encouraged investments in Central Asia that
seek to channel crude fuel through routes other than through Iran.
	   Energy experts say Iran is the most economical and viable outlet
for oil and gas from Central Asia.
	   ``Despite all the efforts by the United States and the Zionists
to prevent transfer of the Central Asian energy to Europe and to
open waters through Iran, I am of the belief that Iran would be the
route for transfer of the energy,'' Khatami told Oil Ministry
officials.

Government troops kill seven militants in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Army soldiers raided two hideouts of
separatist militants in the high mountains of India's northern
Kashmir state Wednesday killing seven of them in a 10-hour
gunbattle.
	   A spokesman for the army said this was the largest number of
militants killed in any single encounter in the last two months.
All of them were Pakistani or Afghan nationals, he said.
	   The army has launched an offensive to hunt out militants who are
being forced by the snow and extreme cold to descend to warmer
areas in the plains. Nearly 40 militants have been killed this
winter as part of the army's winter offensive.

Fugitive ex-president gets house arrest after returning to

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Fugitive former President Canaan Banana,
convicted on sodomy and homosexual assault charges, was placed
under house arrest Wednesday after returning from neighboring South
Africa.
	   Banana, 63, was reportedly handed over to Zimbabwe police by
South African authorities in a deal seen as a major thaw in
strained relations between the two countries.
	   The state-controlled Chronicle newspaper, published in Bulawayo
in southern Zimbabwe, reported Banana was arrested in South Africa
under a ``bilateral arrangement'' agreed by Zimbabwe President
Robert Mugabe and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa on
Sunday.
	   However, Banana's lawyers said Wednesday he surrendered
voluntarily at the border Tuesday and was whisked to Harare in a
limousine accompanied by Zimbabwean detectives.
	   No comment was immediately available from authorities in South
Africa, which was observing a national holiday on Wednesday.
	   The High Court in Harare ordered Banana held under police guard
at his mansion in the luxury suburb of Mount Pleasant until
sentencing on Dec. 23.
	   The former president was convicted on Nov. 26 of 11 gay sex
charges shortly after he had jumped bail and fled the country,
first to neighboring Botswana and then to South Africa.
	   Banana said he fled to escape political persecution and meet
with friends, including Mandela.
	   ``I left the country because I was in possession of dangerous
information, so I had to share it with my real friends,'' Banana
said without elaborating.
	   On Sunday, Mandela said he discussed the case with Mugabe and
the two leaders reached a ``common position'' on Banana, believed
to be an agreement to persuade him to return home, possibly as part
of a deal for a light sentence or even a pardon from Mugabe.
	   Banana, a Methodist minister and theology professor, served as
ceremonial president after independence in 1980 until 1987.
	   Mandela triggered controversy when he saw Banana at his Pretoria
residence at Banana's request this month.
	   Mugabe has described homosexuals as ``lower than pigs and dogs''
and criticized South Africa for legalizing same-sex partnerships
among adults.
	   Zimbabwe and South Africa have also differed sharply over
Zimbabwe's deployment of 8,000 troops in Congo to support President
Laurent Kabila against ethnic Tutsi rebels backed by Rwanda and
Uganda. South Africa repeatedly called for negotiations to end the
conflict.
	   Banana's return from hiding in South Africa and Sunday's talks
between Mandela and Mugabe came after South Africa admitted the two
leaders were barely on speaking terms in recent weeks over their
opposing political views.
	   In recent days, Mugabe and prosecutors appeared to be softening
their positions against Banana.
	   Zimbabwe's chief state prosecutor Augustine Chikumira, who
agreed to Banana's house arrest Wednesday, said that under Zimbabwe
law, Banana faced a fine or prison term but that there was no
maximum penalty.
	   Earlier, state prosecutors had said Banana faced up to 22 years
in jail for the 11 convictions.
	   Mugabe, at a church assembly last week, praised Banana for his
political role combating racism in the church before independence.
The state media has also urged Zimbabweans to forgive Banana, seen
as a sign of a likely pardon.
	   Banana was prosecuted after revelations of his predatory
homosexuality were made in the murder trial of a police inspector.
The policeman had killed a colleague for taunting him over a
three-year sexual relationship Banana forced on him while
president.

Prosecutors may lose retirement privileges for communist
</HEADLINE>
collaboration &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Thirteen communist-era prosecutors could
have their retirement privileges stripped for collaborating with
the communist system more than four decades ago, officials
announced Wednesday.
	   The Justice Ministry did not reveal the names of the 13 because
they can appeal the decision in the next two weeks, said ministry
spokeswoman Barbara Makosa-Stepkowska.
	   They were the first prosecutors cited under a law passed in
August that deprives judges and prosecutors of bonuses, such as
early retirement packages or extra pension benefits, if they
cooperated with the communist authorities from 1944-56.
	   Those losing the special benefits still receive a regular
pension.
	   In an earlier decision, the National Court Board, Poland's top
judicial body, recommended stripping 17 judges of their retirement
privileges. A final decision was expected next year.
	   The government is currently reviewing files of 2,500 retired
judges and prosecutors active during the designated period to
determine if more collaborators should be punished.
	   Under pressure from communist officials strengthening their
power in the 1940s and 50s, many judges and prosecutors pushed for
and passed unfair verdicts _ often the death penalty _ on thousands
of opposition figures.

Teachers resume work in Suriname as part of labor truce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ Teachers in Suriname have agreed to
work half-days as part of a labor truce reached last week.
	   Teachers on Wednesday reported to work for the first time since
early November but left at 10:30 a.m.
	   A coalition of opposition politicians, labor unions and a
business association agreed to suspend protests until Jan. 19 to
avoid conflicts with Christians' Christmas celebrations and
Muslims' observance of the holy month of Ramadan.
	   The president of the federation of teachers' unions, Robby
Naarendorp, said Tuesday the ministry of education has deducted
strike days from teachers' salaries and transferred some teachers
to other schools.
	   However, most teachers reported to their usual workplaces
Wednesday.

As talk of early elections heats up, Netanyahu addresses issue

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will
announce Wednesday that he will call early elections if he is
unable to stabilize his shaky coalition, an Israeli official said.
	   With such an announcement, Netanyahu would avoid being forced
into early elections by the opposition in a critical vote in
parliament Monday. He would also be able to set a date for voting
that is most suitable to him.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Netanyahu
would first seek to bring disenchanted coalition members back into
the fold or try to form a national unity government with the dovish
opposition Labor Party.
	   The official said that if there is no other option, Netanyahu
will prefer to hold elections within two to three months, ahead of
May 4 _ the date that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has set for
a declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
	   Holding the vote before May would allow Netanyahu to use
Arafat's threat as a campaign issue. Netanyahu opposes Palestinian
statehood and in the 1996 race portrayed Labor has having made too
many concessions to the Palestinians.
	   The next scheduled elections are in May 2000.
	   Netanyahu said he would address the issue of early elections at
a candlelighting ceremony for the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah on
Wednesday evening.
	   Netanyahu's government is threatened by an alliance of
disgruntled former Cabinet ministers, dovish opposition legislators
upset by his refusal to withdraw troops in the West Bank and by
coalition hawks who fear he'll do just that.
	   The six-party coalition suffered a blow when Finance Minister
Yaakov Neeman announced Tuesday evening he would resign and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he would make an important
political announcement this week.
	   Since coming to power, Netanyahu has been engaged in a balancing
act between keeping the talks with the Palestinians alive while not
making concessions that would prompt hard-liners in his coalition
to try and bring him down.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton's three-day visit this week, during
which he tried to revive the Wye accord, forced the issue.
Netanyahu told the president he would not withdraw troops on
Friday, citing repeated Palestinian violations of the accord.
	   In response, Labor said it would no longer back the government
in crucial votes, as it had done in recent weeks, to ensure that
the Wye accord is carried out.
	   Meir Shetreet, the chairman of the ruling coalition, said he was
having difficulties mustering a majority in parliament.
	   A crucial test will come on Monday. On that day, parliament will
vote either on a motion of no confidence in the government or a
bill to hold early elections and Labor believes it has enough
supporters to win either.
	   Netanyahu himself had instigated the no-confidence motion on
Dec. 7 as part of an elaborate parliamentary maneuver to delay the
vote of the early elections bill by two weeks.
	   Netanyahu could get the no confidence motion withdrawn at the
last minute, leaving only the early elections bill on the table.
	   Communications Minister Limor Livnat urged Netanyahu to join
forces with Labor and set up a broad-based government.
	   The recommendation was surprising because Livnat is one of the
staunchest opponents of the Wye agreement. In a Likud-Labor
government, there would be a much stronger push to implement Wye.
	   Livnat said, 19th graf pvs.

Dutch commission backs blood banks' ban on gay donors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Blood banks that rejected five
homosexual men as donors were not discriminating against them but
simply trying to protect the blood supply, a Dutch panel said
Wednesday.
	   The independent Equal Opportunities Commission ruled that blood
and sperm banks have the right to refuse to accept donations from
homosexual men because they are obliged to limit as much as
possible the risk of HIV infection, Dutch television reported.
	   The five men, backed by the nation's biggest gay rights lobby
group, had argued that rejecting homosexual men as donors
constituted discrimination against those who practice safe sex and
are in steady monogamous relationships.
	   Research in the Netherlands has shown that 63 percent of AIDS
patients are homosexual or bisexual men.

Peace group: big increase in Jewish settlement construction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new trailer settlement, 9th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has allowed the construction of housing
in Jewish settlements in the West Bank to more than double, Peace
Now said Wednesday, an assessment likely to further anger
Palestinians already frustrated with the peace process.
	   There were 1,420 homes started in the settlements in the first
half of 1998, the leader of the peace activist group said in a
statement, 136 percent more than in the same period last year.
	   In the second half of 1998, construction of 640 homes began in
the settlements, 121 percent more than in the same period of 1997,
Mossi Raz said.
	   The figures were obtained from a report of the Israeli
government's Central Bureau of Statistics, Raz said.
	   Only a minority of the houses were being built by the government
itself, but private construction requires government approval.
	   Settlers have placed mobile homes on eight new sites in the
vicinity of the settlements since U.S.-brokered negotiations at Wye
River, Maryland, revived the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians in October.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has called on the settlers to
seize the hilltops to ensure that they do not come under
Palestinian control.
	   Peace Now said that its officials spotted 43 trailers on
hilltops outside eight different settlements, during a helicopter
flight. A ninth trailer park was reported by Israel Radio, near the
settlement of Eli.

Little media comment, but much public disgust over impeachment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When the Monica Lewinsky scandal first broke, there
was plenty of reaction in Europe, where the whole thing was seen as
a silly show of American puritanism at its worst.
	   But in the past few days, there has been little media commentary
_ mostly because nobody can really believe President Bill Clinton
might actually be impeached.
	   ``People thought everything was OK once the Democrats did well
in November,'' said Philippe Labro, a novelist and head of France's
biggest radio network, RTL.
	   ``They didn't know this big machine _ the House Judiciary
Committee _ was rolling onwards. They haven't paid attention, and
that's too bad, because soon we're going to hear that Clinton has
been impeached.''
	   On Paris streets Wednesday, nobody questioned was aware of the
planned vote Thursday in the House of Representatives. But
Parisians were unanimous in their disgust at the idea of
impeachment.
	   ``Fortunately for politicians in France, we don't sue them every
time they have an affair,'' said secretary Chrystelle Gibaut, 26.
``We would have plenty of them in the same sad situation.''
	   Olivier Sarfati, a 34-year-old lawyer, said the whole affair was
a purely political attack on Clinton.
	   ``All of this is very sad not only for America, but for the
image of democracy in the world,'' he said.
	   Jean Louis Grimal, a 54-year-old newspaper vendor, agreed. ``It
is stupid,'' Grimal said. ``They are confusing family issues with
politics. Appalling.''
	   None of France's major newspapers had an editorial on the
subject Wednesday. They've all been focused on something closer to
home: the bitter feud diving the far-right National Front.
	   ``We don't really understand the U.S. legal procedures,'' said
Erik Izraelewicz, in charge of editorials at Le Monde. ``But if the
Senate won't remove the president from office, then what is the
significance of this House vote?''
	   In Russia, the proceedings also got little attention. President
Boris Yeltsin's foes in parliament are trying to impeach him for
the Chechnya war and Russia's devastating economic decline, which
many Russians find more upsetting than Clinton's actions.
	   ``Americans have lost their minds,'' said Leila Pasenkova, a
31-year-old leather trader in Moscow. ``Of course he did something
wrong but this punishment is worse than the crime.
	   ``Besides, I like Clinton. He's charismatic. He hasn't done to
America what Yeltsin has done to Russia.''
	   There was heavier media coverage in Britain, where the tabloid
Sun ran a headline Wednesday saying ``No-hoper Bill.''
	   The Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland wrote: ``The Houdini
of modern politics is in his tightest-ever jam. He needs to work
some magic fast.''
	   The Dutch daily De Volkskrant said Republicans have ``scarcely
been able to convincingly clarify how Clinton's mistakes in the
trivial sex scandal are serious enough to justify impeachment.''

Parliament chamber votes to eliminate compulsory sex education
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Compulsory sex education in Polish schools
would end before it started under an amendment passed Wednesday by
the lower chamber of parliament.
	   The Sejm voted 219-175 to eliminate a provision that requires
high schools to offer the course called ``Knowledge on human sexual
life.'' The amendment now goes to the Senate chamber.
	   Under the amendment, the education minister would decide what
sex education courses, if any, should be offered.
	   Rightist supporters of the governing Solidarity-led coalition
supported the amendment, saying compulsory sex education was
approved by the previous leftist government in 1996 in an effort to
counter the influence of the church in predominantly Catholic
Poland.
	   Despite the requirement, compulsory sex education never started
in Polish schools due to political wrangling and bureaucratic
delays. It was supposed to begin this year.
	   A leftist member of parliament, Jozef Oleksy, said halting
compulsory sex education would be ``a huge loss for Polish youth.''
	   ``We are heading for Europe where education includes preparing
children for adult life, including sexual life,'' Oleksy said.
``Meanwhile, we are moving away from this.''

Russian parliament passes bill on printing rubles

that agreement reached on treasury bills, other details; ADDS

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government won some promises of cash
Wednesday to pay its huge bills: a go-ahead from parliament to
print 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.2 billion), and bids for a stake in
a giant natural gas company.
	   Russia also claimed Wednesday that it had reached a deal with
foreign investors on restructuring defaulted treasury bonds _ but
the deal appeared to be news to the foreign investors.
	   Russia's default on the bonds in August helped send its
financial markets into a nosedive and prompted foreign lenders to
freeze aid to Russia. The country is now mired in its worst
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Wednesday that the
treasury bills, or GKOs, will be exchanged by March 15 for new
bonds with maturities of four to five years.
	   In London, however, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst said
Wednesday that Russia's proposal to restructure dlrs 10 billion
worth of GKOs is ``not an agreed solution between two sides.''
	   ``We did not agree to these terms,'' Kasper Bartholdy, CSFB's
Russian debt analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   CSFB and Deutsche Bank head the committee of six banks
negotiating with Russia over the repayment of the treasury bonds.
	   Deutsche Bank has also released a statement saying no final
agreement had been inked, and stressing creditors' displeasure with
comments from Russian officials about a deal. Deutsche Bank said
``a number of key issues'' remain outstanding.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's parliament unanimously approved a bill
Wednesday that allows the government to print 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.2 billion) before the end of the year.
	   With only two weeks left before 1998 is over, the bill barely
has enough time to clear the upper chamber of parliament and be
authorized by President Boris Yeltsin.
	   However, the government has already said it has printed 13.5
billion rubles (dlrs 648 million) in October and November without
waiting for parliament approval.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
huge debts to foreign creditors and Russian workers and pensioners.
But printing money could provoke more inflation, which already is
running at about 70 percent this year.
	   With the value of the ruble declining, the government is trying
to get its hands on hard currency. The bill approved Wednesday also
requires Russian exporters to sell 75 percent of their
hard-currency earnings to the government, up from the current 50
percent.
	   In another good sign for Russia's struggling economy, the
government received at least two bids from foreign companies for a
2.5 percent stake in the state-controlled natural gas giant,
Gazprom, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The government was asking at least dlrs 651 million for the
stake _ significantly more than its market price.

Russian parliament passes bill on printing rubles

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government won some promises of cash
Wednesday to pay its huge bills: a go-ahead from parliament to
print 25 billion rubles (dlrs 1.2 billion), and bids for a stake in
a giant natural gas company.
	   Russia also claimed Wednesday that it had reached a deal with
foreign investors on restructuring defaulted treasury bonds _ but
the deal appeared to be news to the foreign investors.
	   Russia's default on the bonds in August helped send its
financial markets into a nosedive and prompted foreign lenders to
freeze aid to Russia. The country is now mired in its worst
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Wednesday that the
treasury bills, or GKOs, will be exchanged by March 15 for new
bonds with maturities of four to five years.
	   In London, however, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst said
Wednesday that Russia's proposal to restructure dlrs 10 billion
worth of GKOs is ``not an agreed solution between two sides.''
	   ``We did not agree to these terms,'' Kasper Bartholdy, CSFB's
Russian debt analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   CSFB and Deutsche Bank head the committee of six banks
negotiating with Russia over the repayment of the treasury bonds.
	   Deutsche Bank has also released a statement saying no final
agreement had been inked, and stressing creditors' displeasure with
comments from Russian officials about a deal. Deutsche Bank said
``a number of key issues'' remain outstanding.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's parliament unanimously approved a bill
Wednesday that allows the government to print 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.2 billion) before the end of the year.
	   With only two weeks left before 1998 is over, the bill barely
has enough time to clear the upper chamber of parliament and be
authorized by President Boris Yeltsin.
	   However, the government has already said it has printed 13.5
billion rubles (dlrs 648 million) in October and November without
waiting for parliament approval.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
huge debts to foreign creditors and Russian workers and pensioners.
But printing money could provoke more inflation, which already is
running at about 70 percent this year.
	   With the value of the ruble declining, the government is trying
to get its hands on hard currency. The bill approved Wednesday also
requires Russian exporters to sell 75 percent of their
hard-currency earnings to the government, up from the current 50
percent.
	   In another good sign for Russia's struggling economy, the
government received at least two bids from foreign companies for a
2.5 percent stake in the state-controlled natural gas giant,
Gazprom, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The government was asking at least dlrs 651 million for the
stake _ significantly more than its market price.
	   Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants expressed hope Wednesday
that Russia still may get dlrs 3.4 billion next year in loans from
the World Bank. He spoke optimistically after the head of the World
Bank mission to Russia, Michael Carter, met with Russian officials
Wednesday.
	   Russia has factored in billions of dollars in international
loans in calculating next year's budget, despite no guarantee that
the money will materialize.

Authorities exhume four bodies to find out truth about miners'
</HEADLINE>
rampage

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Authorities exhumed Wednesday the
bodies of four unidentified people allegedly slain during the 1990
miners' rampage in Bucharest, in an attempt to shed light on the
murky events surrounding the incident.
	   The Association of the Miners' Rampage Victims claim that 60
people were killed by the miners during the June 1990 rampage and
has been searching for the past eight years for those considered
responsible. State officials, however, say only six people were
killed when the coal miners were brought to the capital to help
disperse anti-government protesters.
	   Armed with clubs, the miners rampaged through Bucharest for two
days, beating civilians who were protesting the government of
former President Ion Iliescu.
	   Miron Cozma, then leader of the miners, brought the group to
Bucharest in 1990, in response to a call for help from Iliescu, who
later thanked him for helping restore order.
	   Slightly more than a year later, Cozma led the miners to the
capital a second time, to protest against the policies of
then-Prime Minister Petre Roman. Following the rampage Roman was
forced to resign.
	   Last year a Bucharest court brought charges against Cozma for
allegedly undermining the power of state in the second round of
protests, in Sept. 1991. The case was thrown out early this year
and Cozma was released, due to lack of evidence, because no miner
would testified against him.
	   But prosecutors have continued searching for evidence, and they
say the four bodies will be identified and the autopsy results will
be released in two weeks, adding more information at the miners
rampage files.
	   Cozma was recently reelected the leader of the 24,000 miners in
Jiu Valley, a coal basin in southeastern Romania.

Germany seeks to avoid upsetting French with nuclear exit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Fears of upsetting France prompted German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to intervene Wednesday in a Cabinet
row about the means to abandon nuclear power production.
	   Schroeder, Environment Minister Juergen Trittin and Economics
Minister Werner Mueller will cooperate to draft a law for the
phase-out of atomic energy after the ministers clashed over the
repercussions of abandoning nuclear reprocessing contracts with
French and British companies.
	   ``This is above all meant as a sign of respect for France,''
Schroeder's spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, said.
	   Trittin, of the environmentalist Green Party, said this week he
believed German companies would be able to quit reprocessing
contracts with European partners without threat of damages claims
from France.
	   ``Trittin's opinion wasn't shared by everyone,'' Heye said,
alluding to both legal worries from the economics minister and
political doubts on the part of Schroeder.
	   Heye said responsibility for drafting the changes to Germany's
nuclear power law remains with the environment ministry, but the
chancellery and the economics ministry will now represent ``their
differing viewpoints.''
	   The government hopes that the smoldering row, which threatened a
rift between industry-friendly Schroeder and the Greens, his junior
coalition partner, is now over.
	   Parameters of a legislative revision are scheduled to be agreed
by senior politicians from both parties on Jan. 13 and be submitted
to parliament shortly thereafter. So-called consensus talks with
Germany's nuclear power industry to find a timetable for a phase
out will start at the end of January, Heye said.

Bulgarian parliament approves 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's Parliament on Wednesday
approved a 1999 budget that envisages a deficit of 2.8 percent of
the gross domestic product.
	   The budget reflects the intention of the reform-minded
government to accelerate economic growth and create conditions that
favor the introduction of a sound market economy, in place of the
current, weak economy still dominated by state-owned firms and
burdened with a dlrs 9 billion foreign debt.
	   The budget foresees revenues of 4.5 trillion leva (dlrs 2.7
billion) and expenditures of 4.9 trillion leva (dlrs 2.9 billion)
and a deficit of 435.6 billion leva (dlrs 262 million).
	   The budget foresees inflation of 6.6 percent, a 3.7 percent rise
in GDP.
	   Last year Bulgaria's economy contracted by 6.9 percent and
inflation amounted to 576.8 percent. According to Finance Minister
Muravei Radev inflation in the coming year would remain under 10
percent, while GDP growth is estimated at 4 percent.
	   Bulgaria's relative financial stability today is due to the
currency board that was established in July 1997 to prevent the
central bank from printing money to cover deficits.

AC Milan's French winger says he'd like to play for Gullit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ French winger Ibrahim Ba said Wednesday he's
close to moving from Serie A club AC Milan to England's Newcastle.
	   ``I know that Milan has already spoken to the English
officials,'' Ba said. ``I had a meeting with (Newcastle coach Ruud)
Gullit, and I would be prepared to leave in January.''
	   Ba, 25, joined Milan from France's Bordeux before the 1997-98
season and has scored one goal in 38 games in Italy.
	   But he's appeared in just seven of Milan's 13 games this season.
	   ``I'm down, how couldn't I be? I never play,'' Ba said.
	   He's the latest Milan player to say we wants out, after German
'keeper Jens Lehmann and Croat midfielder Zvonomir Boban.
	   The club is in second place in the Italian League with a 7-3-1
record.

Parliament votes to cut number of ministries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's parliament voted on
Wednesday to abolish five ministries, as part of an effort to
streamline government work and speed up economic reforms.
	   Parliament voted to abolish the ministries from 22 to 17,
following a request by the government, an official statement from
the parliament said.
	   Under the proposal, the ministries of privatization and reform
will cease to exist and be absorbed by the office of the premier.
The communications, research and tourism ministries will all be
downgraded to national agencies. Leaders of national agencies are
not members of the government.
	   The changes will come into effect when they are formally
approved by President Emil Constantinescu in the coming weeks.

Peace group: big increase in Jewish settlement construction

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new new settlement in 7th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has allowed the construction of housing
in Jewish settlements in the West Bank to more than double, a peace
group said Wednesday in an assessment likely to further anger
frustrated Palestinians.
	   There were 1,420 homes started in the settlements in the first
half of 1998, the leader of Peace Now said in a statement. That was
136 percent more than in the same period last year.
	   In the second half of 1998, construction of 640 homes began in
the settlements, 121 percent more than in the same period of 1997,
Mossi Raz said.
	   The figures were obtained from a report of the Israeli
government's Central Bureau of Statistics, Raz said.
	   Settlers have placed mobile homes on eight new sites in the
vicinity of the settlements since U.S.-brokered negotiations
revived the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians in
October.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon has called on the settlers to
seize the hilltops to ensure that they do not come under
Palestinian control.
	   Peace Now said that its officials spotted 43 trailers on
hilltops outside eight different settlements, during a helicopter
flight. A ninth trailer park was reported by Israel Radio, near the
settlement of Eli.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Finalist for the last three seasons, Juventus is
the new favorite to win the Champions Cup after Wednesday's
quarterfinal draw in Geneva.
	   La Juve, which only squeezed into the last eight after its first
win in six group matches, was paired with outsider Olympiakos of
Greece.
	   That meant it avoided the big names in the draw, Real Madrid,
Inter Milan, Bayern Munich and Manchester United.
	   Bookmakers Ladbrokes installed the Turin team, which lost 1-0 to
Real Madrid in last season's final, as the 7-2 favorite.
	   Seven-time and defending titlist Real Madrid, which faces Dynamo
Kiev of Ukraine, is 4-1 joint second favorite with Bayern, which
meets its German rival Kaiserslautern.
	   Inter Milan, favorite before the draw, is now fourth at 9-2,
paired with another soccer giant, Manchester United. Ladbrokes has
dropped United to 5-1.
	   Kiev is rated a 9-1 shot, Kaiserslautern is 12-1 and Olympiakos
25-1.
	   Ladbrokes makes Lazio the 6-4 favorite in the Cup Winners Cup
ahead of defending titlist Chelsea, which is 7-4. Lazio faces Greek
club Panionis while Chelsea faces Valerenga of Norway.
	   The three Italians clubs in the UEFA Cup are also top of the
odds list.
	   Parma, which faces Bordeaux, is the 11-4 favorite, Roma, which
meets Atletico Madrid, is 7-2 and Bologna, which plays Lyon, is
5-1.

Palestinian leaders say reviewing their own peace commitments

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians said Wednesday they will stick to
their Wye River accord commitments, despite an Israeli freeze on
the process _ an apparent effort to cultivate the U.S.-Palestinian
friendship that blossomed during this week's Clinton visit.
	   Netanyahu on Wednesday morning briefed his Cabinet on U.S.
President Bill Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told
the president a day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops on
Friday, as required by the Wye accord.
	   An Israeli official speaking on condition of anonymity later
said Netanyahu would announce Wednesday night that he will agree to
early elections if he is unable to stabilize his shaky coalition.
Netanyahu's office said he would make announcement ``regarding
elections'' at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).
	   That would further delay implementation of the agreement
brokered by Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October.
	   Netanyahu says he wants solid evidence that the Palestinians are
fulfilling their commitment to contain anti-Israel violence and to
round up illegal weapons.
	   The Palestinians want quid-pro-quo for acceding on Monday to the
Israeli demand that the Palestine National Council convene and
renounce clauses in its charter calling for Israel's destruction.
Clinton attended that meeting.
	   Palestinian officials said Netanyahu's actions brought his
commitment to the peace process into question.
	   ``It shows that the Israeli government doesn't believe in peace,
and this is what we are seeing on the ground,'' said Mahmoud Abbas,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy.
	   Still, Palestinians remained committed to the process, and would
continue to fulfill its requirements.
	   ``We shall continue to carry out our commitments and we shall
push ... for full implementation from Israel,'' said Nabil Shaath,
a top Palestinian negotiator returning with Arafat from Egypt,
where the Palestinian leader briefed President Hosni Mubarak on the
Clinton visit.
	   Shaath even indicated that the Palestinians were willing to
consider a post-Wye demand from Netanyahu that Arafat back off a
promise to declare statehood by May. The declaration would come
only if Israel delays agreements, he said.

Dutch commission backs blood banks' ban on gay donors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Blood banks that rejected five
homosexual men as donors were not discriminating against them, but
simply trying to protect the blood supply, a Dutch panel said
Wednesday.
	   The independent Equal Opportunities Commission ruled that blood
and sperm banks have the right to refuse to accept donations from
homosexual men because they are obliged to limit as much as
possible the risk of HIV infection, Dutch television reported.
	   The five men, backed by the nation's biggest gay rights lobbying
group, had argued that rejecting homosexual men as donors
constituted discrimination against those who practice safe sex and
are in steady monogamous relationships.
	   Research in the Netherlands has shown that 63 percent of AIDS
patients are homosexual or bisexual men.

Beat Generation featured in Milan library
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A new library dedicated to British and
American literature, notably works by Beat Generation poets, opened
Wednesday in Milan.
	   With Beat poet Gregory Corso on hand, Fernanda Pivano unveiled
her collection of 35,000 volumes and magazines, letters,
photographs and unedited material.
	   Pivano, 81, became a friend of Ernest Hemingway in 1948 and
eventually translated his work into Italian.
	   In addition to the works of Hemingway and the Beat Generation
poets, Pivano has translated and studied the major works of
American literature including Sherwood Anderson, William Faulkner,
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Thorton Wilder, Richard Wright and Gertrude
Stein.
	   The library, funded by the Benetton Foundation, is open to the
public by appointment only. Next year, the library will have
extended hours and visitors will probably not need appointments.

Palestinian leaders say reviewing their own peace commitments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout to update with Palestinians remaining
committed to Wye; will be UPDATED with Netanyahu announcement
scheduled for 1800 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians said Wednesday they will stick to
their Wye River accord commitments, despite an Israeli freeze on
the process _ an apparent effort to cultivate the U.S.-Palestinian
friendship that blossomed during this week's visit by U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   Netanyahu on Wednesday morning briefed his Cabinet on Clinton's
three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a day
earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops on Friday, as required
by the Wye accord.
	   An Israeli official speaking on condition of anonymity later
said Netanyahu would announce Wednesday night that he will agree to
early elections if he is unable to stabilize his shaky coalition.
Netanyahu's office said he would make an announcement ``regarding
elections'' at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT).
	   That would further delay implementation of the agreement
brokered by Clinton in October.
	   Netanyahu says he wants solid evidence that the Palestinians are
fulfilling their commitment to contain anti-Israel violence and to
round up illegal weapons.
	   The Palestinians want quid-pro-quo for acceding on Monday to the
Israeli demand that the Palestine National Council convene and
renounce clauses in its charter calling for Israel's destruction.
Clinton attended that meeting.
	   Palestinian officials said Netanyahu's actions brought his
commitment to the peace process into question.
	   ``It shows that the Israeli government doesn't believe in peace,
and this is what we are seeing on the ground,'' said Mahmoud Abbas,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy.
	   Still, Palestinians remained committed to the process, and would
continue to fulfill its requirements.
	   ``We shall continue to carry out our commitments and we shall
push ... for full implementation from Israel,'' said Nabil Shaath,
a top Palestinian negotiator returning with Arafat from Egypt,
where the Palestinian leader briefed President Hosni Mubarak on the
Clinton visit.
	   Shaath even indicated that the Palestinians were willing to
consider a post-Wye demand from Netanyahu that Arafat back off a
promise to declare statehood by May. The declaration would come
only if Israel delays agreements, he said.
	   Despite his denials, Israelis and Palestinians saw Clinton's
tour of Gaza as conferring tacit approval of Palestinian statehood.
	   Clinton also moved Palestinians in his speeches when he
expressed understanding of the pain that resulted from years of
dislocation and occupation.
	   ``The United States has taken long strives toward neutrality and
a lack of bias regarding Palestinians and Israelis,'' Mahmoud Abbas
told Voice of Palestine radio.
	   Arafat could not resist intimating his new-found closeness to
Clinton when he was asked to react to Netanyahu's freeze on troop
withdrawal.
	   ``I don't think that the American administration and President
Clinton will agree to this,'' he said _ a speculation unimaginable
just a month ago.
	   Netanyahu is trying to shore up support from hard-liners in his
coalition who have threatened to vote against the government in a
no-confidence motion on Monday.
	   Some of the hawks have said they no longer trust Netanyahu not
to make concessions to the Palestinians, and are set to vote
against the government.
	   The prime minister would first seek to bring disenchanted
coalition members back into the fold or try to form a national
unity government with the dovish Labor party, the Israeli official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said Netanyahu would hold elections within two to
three months if there was no other option.
	   Palestinians said it was increasingly difficult to work with a
weakened government.
	   ``All the talk by Israeli officials about security is not the
security of the Israeli people, but the security of keeping their
seats in the government,'' said Gaza security chief Mohammmed
Dahlan.

Russian parliament passes bill on printing rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 7th pvs, `Russia is ...' to UPDATE with
Russia expecting $3.4 billion from World Bank next year. EDITS
thereafter to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament approved a bill today that
allows the government to print $1.2 billion _ an amount that will
help pay the state's bills, but may also provoke more inflation.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
workers and pensioners, among others. But with inflation already
running at around 70 percent this year, the fresh infusion of cash
could push prices even higher.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, unanimously passed the
measure today on the final reading. President Boris Yeltsin's
government is authorized to print the new money until the end of
the year.
	   The bill now goes to parliament's upper house, which is expected
to approve it swiftly, and then to Yeltsin, who is expected to sign
it without delay.
	   The Russian government has already begun printing rubles in
recent months to cover its huge budget deficit. As expected, the
value of the currency has been declining and inflation has been
rising.
	   In an attempt to shore up the currency, the bill passed today
requires Russian exporters to repatriate 75 percent of their
hard-currency earnings, up from the current 50 percent. This will
keep more foreign currency inside Russia.
	   Also today, Russia said it hopes for loans worth $3.4 billion
next year from the World Bank.
	   Russia has factored in billions of dollars in international
loans in calculating next year's budget, but there's no guarantee
the money will materialize. International lenders froze their
disbursements after Russia's financial markets collapsed in August.
	   The head of the World Bank mission to Russia, Michael Carter,
met with Russian officials today, and afterward, Economics Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants expressed hope that the money would be
forthcoming.
	   Parliament also was weighing several measures aimed at
streamlining the nation's unwieldy tax system in advance of a
debate on next year's budget.
	   The proposed bills seek to lower the value added tax, currently
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent. The
measures also call for revising the personal income tax tables to
take into account the ruble's recent fall.
	   The aim is to create tax incentives for ailing industries, and
encourage more tax evaders to pay what they owe. But critics warn
that tax cuts may only result in even lower government revenues.
	   The measures are expected to win approval in the
Communist-dominated parliament's lower house, the State Duma.

Family battle to regain land roils east German suburb

	   TELTOW, Germany (AP) _ Seehof, in the Berlin suburb of Teltow,
is a quiet neighborhood of well-tended homes, bordered by parks, a
nature preserve and a waterway.
	   Yet the calm belies a storm that has surrounded Seehof since
German reunification in 1990.
	   The 500 or so houses were built on the Seehof farm, once owned
by one of Berlin's wealthiest families, the Saberskys. They fled
Nazi Germany in the 1930s because they were Jewish, ending up in
the United States and elsewhere.
	   For decades, the family could not seek restitution because the
land was in communist East Germany. Now with the Wall gone and
Teltow looking like prime real estate, the heirs want to regain
title to the 84 hectares (208 acres), worth dlrs 170 million or
more.
	   The prospect frightens many of the 1,500 people who have lived
in Seehof for decades. With so much at stake, the battle has become
increasingly bitter, with accusations of anti-Semitism, greed and
dishonest politics.
	   Although several decisions have gone against them, the family is
pushing ahead. But their latest appeal was rejected Wednesday by
the Federal Administrative Court in Berlin.
	   In a decision that dealt only with land that now belongs to
Teltow _ streets and parks _ the court found that the transfer of
those parcels to the city in 1934 ``did not result by force out of
racist grounds.''
	   The judges said they would decide on the bulk of the parcels _
where the houses now stand _ in February.
	   ``It's a very sad day,'' said one American descendant, Peter
Sonnenthal, after the ruling. ``But this is only a skirmish.''
	   In an earlier interview, Sonnenthal, a former lawyer for the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission who helped bring down Wall
Street titans Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky, said he's not one to
shy from a fight.
	   Sonnethal, 44, conceded he stands to make a lot of money but
insists he does not intend to force anyone from his home.
	   ``We're fighting a decision that says my family wasn't
persecuted,'' he said. ``But the truth is this property was owned
by my family and stolen by the Nazis and that's what must be
addressed.''
	   The family has won small victories, getting three parcels back
in 1995, including the grand, three-story villa where Sonnenthal's
grandfather, Albert Sabersky, once lived.
	   The villa quickly sold for dlrs 4.8 million. Sonnenthal and his
sister received half as sole heirs to Albert Sabersky; the rest was
divided among 16 other heirs.
	   Still, the state office charged with deciding restitution claims
denied the bulk of their claim. Deputy director Josefine Ewers says
the Saberskys ``without a question'' were persecuted by the Nazis _
but not when it came to selling their farm.
	   Both sides have spent years searching through old archives,
digging out maps, aerial photos and records. The case hinges on
whether the land was used as a farm or intended for development,
whether the Saberskys sold under pressure and what happened to the
money.
	   The Saberskys, mainly bankers and grain traders, bought Seehof
in 1878. They maintained it as a farm but drew up plans to develop
a strip along the water where other wealthy Berliners had started
building country homes.
	   But when the Nazis came to power in 1933 and started banning
Jews from professions _ including farming _ the family hired a Nazi
real-estate broker to begin selling all of Seehof.
	   ``They knew what was coming,'' Sonnenthal said. ``They sold it
off as fast as they could.''
	   The family claims the Saberskys sold the farm under pressure for
about half the market value, and that the broker charged them an
exorbitant commission _ reaching 50 percent after the 1938
anti-Jewish pogrom known as Kristallnacht.
	   They also say the Nazis confiscated the proceeds, and the family
never saw the money.
	   Ewers, of the restitution office, says records show the family
was not really farming the land but instead was preparing it for
development with intent to sell. If the family was not farming, she
argues, it would not have been under pressure from the Nazis'
banning the profession for Jews.
	   She says the broker's commission was reasonable considering all
they asked him to do. She also disputes Sonnethal's claim that the
family never saw any money from its financial agent, noting it used
the same man in the 1950s.
	   Sonnenthal says Ewers and the court acted under political
pressure, ignoring his evidence to protect homeowners _ and voters.
She denies it.
	   Charges that the family is only after money reflect shades of
anti-Semitism, he says, as do the swastikas that appeared in the
neighborhood during the seven-year court battle.
	   He has offered to drop claims to any home if the occupant pays
10,000 to 15,000 marks (dlrs 6,000 to dlrs 9,000) _ about 10
percent of the market value.
	   ``As a Jew returning to Germany, I will not make a victim out of
anyone who suffered under communism,'' he says. ``We set the price
intentionally low.''
	   About 120 people have accepted the offer or are in the process
of doing so. The majority are holding out _ taking their chances
with the courts.
	   Sonnenthal, now in private practice in Denver, said the federal
court's decision that each of the housing parcels will be decided
individually in February boded well for his family.
	   ``I think we have a very good chance of getting those parcels
sold after Kristallnacht back,'' he said. That would amount to 89
homes.
	   In the meantime, Sonnenthal said he was considering whether to
appeal Wednesday's ruling to the Constitutional Court, Germany's
highest.

U.N. inspectors evacuate Baghdad, raising specter of U.S. attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with air strike imminent; U.N. emergency meeting,

 &UR; With AP Photos BAG 101-110
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors on Wednesday left
Baghdad abruptly in a convoy of buses and cars, accusing Iraq of
obstructing their search for the country's illegal weapons.
	   Their departure without any notice pointed at imminent
U.S.-British air strikes, which were suspended last month after
Iraq pledged to fully cooperate with the inspectors of the United
Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM.
	   A top U.S. military official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the strike will be either Wednesday or Thursday.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said any U.S.-British
attack on Iraq will come quickly and without warning. And Prime
Minister Tony Blair told Parliament that any attack would have the
``necessary legal force.'' Lawmakers murmured ``Hear! Hear!.''
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council called an emergency
meeting for later Wednesday.
	   Hours after some 140 UNSCOM inspectors were evacuated, Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein called a special joint meeting of the
decision-making Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath
Party.
	   The mood _ reflected in a statement after the meeting _ was
defiant.
	   The statement said the leadership reviewed steps to ``confront
the American-British aggression.''
	   It is clear that they are planning to ``launch once again
another aggression.'' But ``depend on God to knock the dreams out
of their empty heads,'' the statement said.
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast and played
patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos training with
machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.
But there was no panic in the streets.
	   A strike, if it comes, will be from the Gulf where the United
States has amassed a huge armada, including an aircraft carrier and
warships bristling with Tomahawk cruise missiles.
	   Returning from a Middle East tour, President Bill Clinton met
with his top national security advisers to consider military
strikes. One White House national security aide called it ``a very
serious situation.''
	   A senior defense official said U.S. forces in the Gulf are in
``an execute mode.''
	   Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Early Wednesday, three trucks loaded with luggage left the U.N.
headquarters in Baghdad. About a half-hour later, three busloads of
weapons inspectors also left the U.N. compound, followed by four
white U.N. cars carrying spare tires on top.
	   Most of the inspectors flew aboard a special U.N. plane from an
airbase outside Baghdad to the Gulf state of Bahrain.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain.
``There is nobody left behind.''
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is monitoring
Iraq's compliance on dismantling its nuclear program, also withdrew
its staff from Baghdad. UNSCOM is responsible for eliminating
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until these weapons of mass destruction are destroyed, the
United Nations will lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq says it has complied with every U.N. demand, and accuses
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler of prolonging the
inspections at the behest of the United States.
	   The crisis follows a report by Butler on Tuesday to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in which he said Iraq's claim to be
free of banned weapons ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   But verification is impossible as Iraq is obstructing, evading
and thwarting the inspectors, he said.
	   Butler cited the inspectors' inability to enter the headquarters
of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid evidence of the
presence of proscribed materials.''
	   At two other sites, one building had been emptied of relevant
materials, and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any
disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed Butler's report
as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to trigger an
American and British military strike on Iraq.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also accused Butler of
overstepping his authority by ordering the evacuation.
	   Russia has consistently opposed military action against Iraq.
	   The U.S. military build up in the Gulf has been going on since
August when Iraq suspended the inspectors's work. The standoff
continued until Oct. 31 when Iraq also suspended cooperation with
UNSCOM monitors, who looked after previously inspected sites.
	   The United States had nearly attacked Iraq on Nov. 14 but
President Clinton ordered a stand down at the eleventh hour to give
Iraq another chance to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The United States has 24,100 military men and women in the Gulf.
There are also 22 warships and 201 aircraft, including 72 aboard
the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. Britain has 22 strike aircraft
in the region.
	   While the weapons inspectors have left, no decision has been
made on on withdrawing the 400 U.N. humanitarian monitors from
Iraq, U.N. spokesman George Somerwill said in Baghdad.
	   However, they were prepared to leave ``should it become
necessary,'' he said.

U.N. panel clears dlrs 181 million for corporations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. panel overseeing compensation for loss
and damage caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Wednesday
approved dlrs 181 million for companies involved in a hydroelectric
dam project.
	   The 10 corporations took part in the Bekhma dam project in Iraq,
whose construction was halted after the 1990 invasion, Mojtaba
Kazazi, secretary of the U.N. Compensation Commission, told
reporters.
	   The award fell far short of the total dlrs 856 million they had
claimed.
	   The largest shares of the money went to Turkish and Bosnian
firms. U.S. company Overseas Bechtel was awarded some dlrs 4
million, and firms from Croatia, Yugoslavia and Germany were also
compensated.
	   Resolving the latest batch of compensation claims from
individuals, the U.N. commission awarded another dlrs 53 million to
129 claimants.
	   Compensation awards approved by the 15-nation commission are
paid using Iraqi oil sales approved by the U.N. Security Council.
	   In total, the commission has received around 2.6 million
compensation demands for a total of some dlrs 240 billion from
individuals, governments and corporations seeking compensation for
loss and damage caused by the invasion of Kuwait.
	   Processing the claims is expected to take several more years.

U.N. seeks dlrs 1.3 billion to hard-hit countries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The United Nations on Wednesday appealed for dlrs
1.3 billion to feed and care for refugees and hungry people in some
of the world's hardest-hit countries from Congo to North Korea.
	   The global appeal by U.N. agencies was aimed at combating
``donor fatigue'' in wealthier nations increasingly tired of
apparently never-ending conflicts and man-made disasters.
	   An appeal for Sudan, which has yet to be finalized, is expected
to bring the total appeal for next year to dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   Last year U.N. agencies appealed separately for a total of dlrs
2.2 billion, but less than half of that came in.
	   This year's figure ``is roughly equivalent to a half day's total
military expenditure but will serve to protect some 25 million
people from starvation or disease,'' said Sergio Vieira de Mello,
the U.N.'s emergency relief coordinator.
	   The largest single appeals were for famine-stricken North Korea
_ dlrs 376 million _ and the countries of the former Yugoslavia _
some dlrs 359 million.
	   Many of the other nations are in Africa: Congo, Uganda, Burundi,
Somalia, Tanzania, Angola, Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau.
	   The poor response previously was partly due to the way the
appeals were presented, Vieira said.
	   ``Weariness on the part of donors in the face of conflicts which
go on from one year to the next, and I think the example of Sudan
is possibly the most scandalous, is also a phenomenon we must try
to understand,'' Vieira said.
	   Since 1983 more than 1.5 million people have died in fighting
between rebels and government forces and resulting famines in
southern Sudan. An estimated 4 million Sudanese have been
displaced.
	   This year's appeal for Sudan brought one of the best responses _
over 80 percent _ but Vieira contended that, with dlrs 1 million a
day being spent on airlifts, ``donors can't carry on paying such
bills.''
	   An appeal for the Yugoslav province of Kosovo was also
three-quarters covered. But the picture was less rosy elsewhere.
	   This year's appeal for Tajikistan, for example, brought in less
than 30 percent of the dlrs 34.6 million sought, Vieira said.

American striker training with London club
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ American forward Eric Wynalda is getting a tryout
with Charlton Athletic.
	   The 29-year-old veteran of three World Cups is training with the
south London club, which is going through a goalscoring drought and
is sliding close to the Premier League's relegation zone.
	   Charlton was promoted to the top flight last season after seven
seasons in the lower divisions.
	   Wynalda, who also has played in the German Bundesliga, spent
last season with the San Jose Clash of Major League Soccer. He has
scored 32 goals in 102 appearances for the United States and played
against Germany and Yugoslavia at the World Cup in France.
	   If the striker impresses Charlton manager Alan Curbishley in
training, the club may offer him a contract and apply for a work

Serbs mourn, protest killings in western Kosovo city

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of Serbs, many weeping,
gathered today to mourn six slain countrymen whose deaths have
inflamed tensions in the separatist province of Kosovo.
	   A crowd of 5,000 assembled in the western city of Pec, where
unknown assailants on Monday opened fire in a Serb-run bar. Another
2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a protest rally today in the
provincial capital of Pristina.
	   Despite fears of unrest, the gatherings were peaceful, with four
busloads of Serb police providing security in Pec. International
monitors were not in evidence, a day after some Serbs took out
their anger at the killings by hurling stones or spitting at
armored U.S. observer vehicles.
	   As mourners sobbed, the six coffins were brought to Pec's main
square and covered with wreaths. The victims were buried later in
the day.
	   ``Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' said Mirko Simonovic,
principal of the high school where four of the dead were students.
	   ``They were killed for the simple reason of being Serbs.''
	   He concluded with a demand that the state ``punish the
perpetrators and do away forever with Albanian terrorism.''
	   Serbs blame ethnic Albanian rebels for the killings, which have
prompted protests and threats of retaliation.
	   Many fear the killings, along with a border clash this week
between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian rebels that killed at
least 36 rebels, move Kosovo closer to a renewal of war.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population of Kosovo,
a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia.
	   Voicing concern at the dangerous turn of events, U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke condemned the deaths as ``appalling beyond
words.''
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic renewed his determination
to suppress rebel ``terrorism.'' A top government body for the
Serbian province said the Serb killings were ``the most monstrous
crime in the series of assaults by Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   Holbrooke, who brokered an agreement in October that halted more
than seven months of combat in Kosovo, appeared pessimistic about
reaching a political settlement that could stop the carnage.
	   After more than five hours of talks with Milosevic in Belgrade,
Holbrooke acknowledged Tuesday night that diplomats are nowhere
near bridging the huge divide between Serbs and Kosovo's ethic
Albanians on the province's status.
	   Pec, 45 miles west of Pristina, is Kosovo's third-largest city
with about 150,000 residents. Like Kosovo itself, the population is
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian, but several thousand Serbs also
live there.
	   Towns and cities have mostly escaped the violence that has
engulfed Kosovo villages this year since the Serb assault on
militant separatists that began in February.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed and 300,000 forced from
their homes.

U.N. inspectors evacuate Baghdad, raising specter of U.S. attack

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors on Wednesday
abruptly left Baghdad in a convoy of buses and cars, accusing Iraq
of obstructing their search for the country's illegal weapons.
	   Their departure, without any notice, pointed at imminent
U.S.-British air strikes, which were suspended last month after
Iraq pledged to fully cooperate with the inspectors of the United
Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM.
	   A top U.S. military official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the strike will be either Wednesday or Thursday.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said any U.S.-British
attack on Iraq will come quickly and without warning. And Prime
Minister Tony Blair told Parliament that any attack would have the
``necessary legal force.'' Lawmakers murmured ``Hear! Hear!.''
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council called an emergency
meeting for later Wednesday.
	   Hours after some 140 UNSCOM inspectors were evacuated, Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein called a special joint meeting of the
decision-making Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath
Party.
	   The mood _ reflected in a statement after the meeting _ was
defiant.
	   The statement said it is clear that they are planning to
``launch once again another aggression.'' But ``depend on God to
knock the dreams out of their empty heads,'' the statement said.
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast and played
patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos training with
machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.
	   There was no panic in the streets.
	   A strike, if it comes, will likely come from the Gulf where the
United States has amassed a huge armada, including an aircraft
carrier and warships bristling with Tomahawk cruise missiles.
	   Returning from a Middle East tour, U.S. President Bill Clinton
met with his top national security advisers to consider military
strikes. One White House national security aide called it ``a very
serious situation.''
	   A senior defense official said U.S. forces in the Gulf are in
``an execute mode.''
	   Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Early Wednesday, three trucks loaded with luggage left the U.N.
headquarters in Baghdad. About a half-hour later, three busloads of
weapons inspectors also left the U.N. compound, followed by four
white U.N. cars.
	   Most of the inspectors flew to the Gulf state of Bahrain aboard
a special U.N. plane from an airbase outside Baghdad.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain.
``There is nobody left behind.''
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is monitoring
Iraq's compliance on dismantling its nuclear program, also withdrew
its staff from Baghdad. UNSCOM is responsible for eliminating
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until these weapons of mass destruction are destroyed, the
United Nations will not lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Iraq says it has complied with every U.N. demand, and accuses
chief weapons inspector Richard Butler of prolonging the
inspections at the behest of the United States.
	   The crisis follows a report by Butler on Tuesday to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in which he said Iraq's claim to be
free of banned weapons ``cannot be accepted without further
verification.''
	   But verification is impossible as Iraq is obstructing, evading
and thwarting the inspectors, he said.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed Butler's report
as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to trigger an
American and British military strike on Iraq.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov also accused Butler of
overstepping his authority by ordering the evacuation.
	   Russia has consistently opposed military action against Iraq.
	   The U.S. military build up in the Gulf has been going on since
August when Iraq suspended the inspectors' work. The standoff
continued until Oct. 31 when Iraq also suspended cooperation with
UNSCOM monitors, who looked after previously inspected sites.
	   The United States nearly attacked Iraq on Nov. 14, but Clinton
ordered a stand down at the eleventh hour to give Iraq another
chance to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The United States has 24,100 military men and women in the Gulf.
There are also 22 warships and 201 aircraft, including 72 aboard
the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. Britain has 22 strike aircraft
in the region.
	   While the weapons inspectors have left, no decision has been
made on on withdrawing the 400 U.N. humanitarian monitors from
Iraq, U.N. spokesman George Somerwill said in Baghdad.
	   However, they were prepared to leave ``should it become
necessary,'' he said.

Russian parliament passes bill on printing rubles

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament approved a bill today that
allows the government to print $1.2 billion _ an amount that will
help pay the state's bills, but may also provoke more inflation.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
workers and pensioners, among others. But with inflation already
running at around 70 percent this year, the fresh infusion of cash
could push prices even higher.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, unanimously passed the
measure today on the final reading. President Boris Yeltsin's
government is authorized to print the new money until the end of
the year.
	   The bill now goes to parliament's upper house, which is expected
to approve it swiftly, and then to Yeltsin, who is expected to sign
it without delay.
	   The Russian government has already begun printing rubles in
recent months to cover its huge budget deficit. As expected, the
value of the currency has been declining and inflation has been
rising.
	   In an attempt to shore up the currency, the bill passed today
requires Russian exporters to repatriate 75 percent of their
hard-currency earnings, up from the current 50 percent. This will
keep more foreign currency inside Russia.
	   Also today, Russia said it hopes for loans worth $3.4 billion
next year from the World Bank.
	   Russia has factored in billions of dollars in international
loans in calculating next year's budget, but there's no guarantee
the money will materialize. International lenders froze their
disbursements after Russia's financial markets collapsed in August.
	   The head of the World Bank mission to Russia, Michael Carter,
met with Russian officials today, and afterward, Economics Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants expressed hope that the money would be
forthcoming.
	   Parliament also was weighing several measures aimed at
streamlining the nation's unwieldy tax system in advance of a
debate on next year's budget.
	   The proposed bills seek to lower the value added tax, currently
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent. The
measures also call for revising the personal income tax tables to
take into account the ruble's recent fall.
	   The aim is to create tax incentives for ailing industries, and
encourage more tax evaders to pay what they owe. But critics warn
that tax cuts may only result in even lower government revenues.
	   The measures are expected to win approval in the
Communist-dominated parliament's lower house, the State Duma.

UEFA says cup final venues won't be moved for same-country clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ UEFA said Wednesday it won't change the venues for
this season's UEFA Cup and Champions Cup finals if both finalists
come from the same country.
	   The two Italian teams left in the Champions Cup _ Juventus and
Inter Milan _ avoided each other in the draw for the quarterfinals.
	   Only three countries _ Italy, France and Spain _ have teams in
the last eight of the UEFA Cup, and Wednesday's draw produced no
same-country pairings.
	   Whoever the finalists, they will play the match as scheduled at
the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on May 12, UEFA said in a statement.
	   It said it wanted ``to avoid any speculation at any time that,
should the two finalists belong to one of the three national
associations which still have participants in the UEFA Cup, the
final would be moved to that country.''
	   The same goes for the Champions Cup final, which will take place
May 26 at Barcelona's Camp Nou, UEFA said.
	   Last season's UEFA Cup final, in which Inter Milan beat fellow
Italian team Lazio 3-0, was played in Paris.

Zulus hold own celebration at site of Afrikaner myth

	   BLOOD RIVER BATTLEGROUND, South Africa (AP) _ In a dramatic
challenge to the white man's legacy, thousands of Zulus Wednesday
marked the slaughter of 3,000 of their forebears in a battle that
became a mythical underpinning of apartheid rule.
	   The post-apartheid, black-led government unveiled a new monument
here dedicated to the losing side in the 1838 Battle of Blood
River, when 468 Boers defeated a force of 10,000 Zulus and suffered
only three injuries.
	   The project is one of the most prominent examples of a concerted
effort to correct what most blacks consider to be the imbalances of
official history here.
	   For years, Afrikaner nationalists had held ceremonies at their
own monuments across the river to honor the victory by their
ancestors. One government leader referred to the Zulus as a
``heathen horde.''
	   Afrikaners believe that six days before the battle, the Boer
force made a covenant with God, vowing to render him thanks if
victory was theirs.
	   The account gave rise to the holiday known as the Day of the
Vow, a reference point for Afrikaner power and entitlement. Since
the end of apartheid in 1994, the holiday was renamed the Day of
Reconciliation.
	   Officials estimated some 5,000 people attended under the hot sun
of KwaZulu-Natal province, once the heartland of the Zulu kingdom.
	   Dressed in traditional fur loin coverings and head gear, a
regiment of Zulu ``warriors'' raised fighting sticks and slapped
their cowhide shields in mock battle charges.
	   The 3.5 million-rand (dlrs 600,000) monument, a roofless red
brick structure about 100 feet (30 meters) long, stood unfinished
in a muddy field opposite the Afrikaner memorials -- a museum and
lifesize metal reconstruction of a circle of covered ox wagons.
	   Officials pushed the theme of reconciliation.
	   ``Let us consider this the day of a new covenant which binds us
to the shared commitments of building a new country,'' said
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom
Party and Home Affairs minister.
	   But the monument serves another purpose for the black majority.
With political power won in all-race elections in 1994 and economic
power still elusive, culture is another front in molding a new
South Africa.
	   Other projects are planned. The house of Nobel Peace Prize
winner Albert Luthuli, an early ANC president, will become a
memorial. The government has also set aside 17 million rand (dlrs 3
million) for a museum celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela. A
theme park exploring the struggle to overcome apartheid is planned.
	   ``If you look around, all the heritage sites declared in the
past were just promoting white history, and all the history of
black people has been neglected,'' Musa Xulu, a deputy director
general of the Culture Ministry, said in an interview.
	   ``We are balancing history,'' he said.
	   But Wednesday's events at Blood River, which is about 350
kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Johannesburg, showed that is
not easy.
	   Across the river, as the Zulus danced and chanted, a prim
congregation of several hundred Afrikaners held a prayer and hymn
service.
	   Pastor Chris Jordaan compared the fear of the Boers to the fear
of Afrikaners today in post-apartheid South Africa. ``But we must
maintain our belief in God. The god of our past is the God of our
future,'' he said.
	   Another group of far-right Afrikaners held their own service. A
banner read, ``Apartheid is holy.''
	   Farmer Kobus van der Walt, 36, called the Zulu celebration a
``political thing.''
	   ``It's just to try to diminish the Afrikaner and stomp him into
the ground,'' he said.
	   The war goes on over history. Some historians have cast doubt on
whether the vow was ever taken or whether only three Boers were
injured.
	   ``This is not a defeat we are celebrating,'' said Patrick
Mbatha, a 25-year-old Zulu. ``We are saying `Bravo' to the warriors
who gave their lives. They didn't defeat us. They tricked us. The
history that we know of this battle we got from the Boers.''
	   Provincial ANC official Jacob Zuma said compared the Zulu attack
to the struggle to defeat apartheid. In both causes, ``We didn't
surrender.''

	   BLOOD RIVER BATTLEGROUND, South Africa (AP) - The Battle of
Blood River occurred within the history of the Great Trek, which
started in the mid-1830s and was a defining influence on Afrikaner
identity.
	   Chafing under British colonial rule and seeking more space,
Boers, the descendants of Dutch settlers, packed up their ox wagons
and headed into the African interior.
	   After a series of disastrous defeats, a Boer force of 468 camped
near what the Zulus called Ncome River and set up a circle of
covered ox wagons.
	   At dawn on Dec. 16, 1838, some 10,000 Zulu warriors attacked the
Boers' circle of covered wagons. The commandoes fired on wave after
wave of the warriors, armed mainly with spears, and when the
attackers faltered, they charged.
	   Many fighters for King Dingane were picked off as they tried to
clamber up the side of a gully. Others were hunted down as they hid
in a ditch.
	   More than 3,000 Zulus lay dead, their blood making the river run
red and causing the Boers to rename it.
	   Only three Boers were said to have been injured.
	   The day only became a celebration a generation later, when
Afrikaners again in competition with the British instituted the
legend to light a fire under Afrikaner nationalism.
	   When revisionist historians in the early 1980s cast doubt on the
``Vow of the Covenant,'' they were reviled by hardline Afrikaners.
One was spattered with tar by a far-right activist.

Governor of Romania's central bank remains in job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Lawmakers on Wednesday reappointed
Mugur Isarescu to another six-year term as governor of the National
Bank of Romania and appointed a new board.
	   Parliament spokesman Stefan Caliga said all members of the board
are financial and banking experts without any involvement in
political life.
	   Isarescu was supported by lawmakers from the reform-minded
ruling coalition, although the opposition _ made up by leftists and
nationalists _ refused to vote and withdrew from the parliament
session, because their proposals for the central bank board have
not been taken into consideration, Caliga said.
	   Isarescu first took the job in 1990, shortly after the
anti-communist revolt in December 1989. He is currently the
longest-serving Romanian official in office.
	   Analysts have praised Isarescu for its tight monetary policy and
for keeping the central bank out of political influences.
	   Isarescu is expected to maintain a strict control on inflation
and allow just a slow depreciation of the national currency, the
leu.

Peace group: big increase in Jewish settlement construction

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has allowed the construction of housing
in Jewish settlements in the West Bank to more than double, Peace
Now said Wednesday, an assessment likely to further anger
Palestinians already frustrated with the peace process.
	   There were 1,420 homes started in the settlements in the first
half of 1998, the leader of the peace activist group said in a
statement, 136 percent more than in the same period last year.
	   In the second half of 1998, construction of 640 homes began in
the settlements, 121 percent more than in the same period of 1997,
Mossi Raz said.
	   The figures were obtained from a report of the Israeli
government's Central Bureau of Statistics, Raz said.
	   Only a minority of the houses were being built by the government
itself, but private construction requires government approval, and
the government assists in infrastructure.
	   The parliamentary finance committee on Wednesday approved a
government appropriation of 27 million shekels (dlrs. 6.5 million)
for more construction of houses and infrastructure in the
settlements.
	   Settlers have placed mobile homes on nine new sites in the
vicinity of the settlements since U.S.-brokered negotiations at Wye
River, Maryland, revived the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians in October.

Greens praise Italian decision on Ocalan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's Green Party on Wednesday
applauded the decision of an Italian court that Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan is free to leave the country and said some
European Union state should issue him papers to travel freely
abroad.
	   The ruling by a Rome court followed a decision by Germany to
withdraw the international arrest warrant it had issued for Ocalan
on terrorism charges. A spokesman for Ocalan, Ahmed Yaman, said the
Kurdish leader has no immediate plans to leave the Rome villa where
he has been kept under police surveillance.
	   Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers party, or PKK, was
detained in Rome on Nov. 12 when he arrived on a flight from
Moscow. He is wanted in his native land of Turkey for trial on
terrorism charges. But Italy refuses to return him to Turkey
because he faces a possible death sentence there.
	   In a press conference, the foreign affairs spokeswoman for the
Greens, Doris Pollet-Kammerlander, called the Rome decision ``right
and just.''
	   She said Austria or some other EU member state should issue
Ocalan international travel papers, known as ``laissez-passe
documents,'' allowing him to move abroad freely.
	   Pollet-Kammerlander said that Ocalan is in effect a ``stateless
person'' and that issuing him such documents would reflect his
``real personal situation.''

Schroeder travels to eastern Germany to learn region's problems

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with session over, quote &QL;

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder headed with
most of his Cabinet to the former communist east Wednesday to show
solidarity with the economically troubled region.
	   Since taking office in October, Schroeder has been eager to
dispel critics' charges that he had taken little interest in
eastern Germany's problems _ high unemployment tops the list _
since unification in 1990.
	   Now he is launching a series of regular talks with eastern
governors by meeting Saxony's Kurt Biedenkopf, whose area leads the
four other eastern states in closing the economic gap with richer
western Germany.
	   To add weight to the effort, most Cabinet members accompanied
Schroeder for the afternoon meeting in the state capital Dresden.
	   Although few new initiatives were agreed on, Biedenkopf said the
meeting was worthwhile nonetheless.
	   ``One extremely important result is that the meeting happened at
all,'' Biedenkopf said. ``This means the signals have changed in
the priority of rebuilding the east.''
	   The chancellor promised in his inaugural address last month to
hold special Cabinet sessions in the east every two months. He has
also appointed a minister for eastern German affairs, and has
promised to continue massive doses of government aid.
	   Schroeder's bid to reach out to eastern Germans, who make up
about a fifth of the population, is part of a historic eastward
shift of the nation's center of gravity brought on by unification.
	   Next fall, with the government's move from Bonn in the west,
Schroeder will be governing a united Germany from Berlin for the
first time since the Nazi defeat in World War II.
	   Eastern Germans helped lift Schroeder and his Social Democrats
into power by turning against Helmut Kohl in September elections,
their gratitude for the chancellor who unified Germany worn out.
	   But a poll published last week by the Leipziger Volkszeitung
newspaper showed barely half of all easterners think the 7-week-old
center-left government is doing a good job.
	   Topics for Wednesday's talks include Saxony's economic situation
and ways to put young people to work, the future of government aid
to the east and the continuing cleanup of polluted industrial sites
left over from communist times.

Boat skipper may not be fit to stand trial: lawyer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ The skipper of a boat who allegedly
threatened American and Spanish tourists with a flare during a
cruise off Australia's northeast coast may be medically unfit to
face trial, his lawyer said Wednesday.
	   Troy Dallman, 29, faced Cairns Magistrates Court on three
charges of assault and one of going armed in public in a manner to
cause fear.
	   The charges arise from an eight-day dive trip from the
Queensland state resort town of Port Douglas to Thursday Island, on
the northern tip of Australia's Cape York, which passengers and
crew have described as ``the cruise from hell.''
	   Passengers and crew of the Reef Explorer say they were forced to
bind Dallman with duct tape and tie him to a bunk after he
threatened them during the trip in October.
	   Dallman's lawyer Trevor Lewis told the court a medical opinion
on his client which he had just obtained might lead to a request
that prosecution be halted.
	   Dallman was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward after the cruise.
	   The six American and two Spanish tourists on board the boat
allege Dallman became unstable after equipment failures during the
trip and that he believed the crew of the boat were plotting
against him.
	   The tourists have filed separate civil action against dive
company Reef Adventures alleging breach of contract, negligence and
breach of statutory duty.
	   The Queensland Transport Department is investigating the events
surrounding the cruise and the condition of the vessel.
	   No plea was entered in court Wednesday. Dallman was released on
bail and was ordered to reappear on Feb. 3.

English star returns to Italy as coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former England captain David Platt flew to Italy
Wednesday preparing to take a coaching appointment at Sampdoria,
one of his former clubs.
	   The 32-year-old midfielder, who played 62 times for England,
hitting 27 goals, will appear at a news conference at the club in
Genoa on Thursday and could become the youngest coach in Serie A.
	   ``For several years I have had a driving ambition to move into
management, but I never thought for a moment that I might be
fortunate enough to have the opportunity to start my management
career with one of the world's greatest clubs,'' Platt said before
leaving.
	   Platt retired as a player over the summer, following a 14-year
career in which he played for Serie A sides Sampdoria, Bari and
Juventus, plus English clubs Crewe, Aston Villa and Arsenal. He
scored 209 goals in 500 matches.
	   Sampdoria (3-4-6) fired first-year coach Luciano Spalletti
following a 5-2 loss at Lazio of Rome on Sunday. The defeat dropped
the club into 14th place in the 18-team league, just one point out
of the relegation zone.

Russia's human rights commissioner defends anti-Semitic remarks

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's official defender of human rights said
Wednesday that ethnic Russians should have a special status in
their country, and warned against prosecuting a Communist lawmaker
who accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in Russia.
	   ``The (anti-Semitic) remarks that we are hearing are remarks by
rather educated and knowledgeable people,'' Russia's Human Rights
Commissioner Oleg Mironov said.
	   ``I condemn such statements, but I don't think that the majority
of Russia's population condemns them,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
quoted him as saying. ``The Russian idea is being voiced. And it
should be voiced in a country where the majority of the population
is Russian.''
	   Prominent Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin said Tuesday that
Russia's post-Soviet collapse would not have happened if Russia's
government was not made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.''
He also accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the country.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of
Jews and other minorities in prominent positions, but they have
always been outnumbered by ethnic Russians.
	   Officials in Yeltsin's staff and the Cabinet strongly condemned
Ilyukhin's statements.
	   Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky on Wednesday called for
banning the Communist party, and said the government should use
force to get rid of the party if necessary.
	   Berezovsky, who is Jewish, was reiterating calls that many
Russian liberals made last month, after the Communist Party refused
to censure another member, lawmaker Albert Makashov, for similar
anti-Semitic remarks.
	   ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock,
and not in the Duma,'' Berezovsky said.
	   But Mironov, the human rights commissioner, insisted that
anti-Semites should not be persecuted or prosecuted because their
statements have a broad appeal in Russia.
	   ``Maybe one should just have some kind of talks, discussions,
disputes with them.'' Any harsher action could ignite an ``ethnic
fire'' in Russia, Mironov was quoted as saying.
	   Mironov also insisted that there is no anti-Semitism in Russia,
because none of the ``representatives of that ethnic group'' have
ever complained to him about any discrimination against the Jews.
	   Ilyukhin was unrepentant about his statements. ``What kind of
democracy is it when a Russian man can't speak the truth?'' he
asked Wednesday.
	   Since Soviet-era tacit discrimination against Jews was
abolished, virulent grass-roots anti-Semitism has flared up in
Russia, with bombings of synagogues, desecration of Jewish
cemeteries, a growing neo-Nazi movement, and widespread
anti-Semitic remarks.
	   Regarding Ilyukhin's statements, presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin said: ``All of this is a system of carefully thought out
views, which tear to shreds the principle of internationalism that
the Communist Party is proclaiming.''
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said parliament ``must
rigorously curb such statements or else it will utterly discredit
itself.''
	   Russia's Ethnic Policy Ministry issued a statement saying it
``decisively condemns the hypocritical position of those political
parties and political activists who, while declaring their
adherence to internationalism and the friendship of peoples, fail
to rebuke ethnic separatism, national chauvinism, and
anti-Semitism.''
	   Yeltsin's chief of staff, Nikolai Bordyuzha, said Ilyukhin's
remarks ``not only undermine the Duma's authority, but also
Russia's international authority.''

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan forces defending the besieged city
of Kuito pushed back a rebel attack Wednesday after eight hours of
fierce fighting in which dozens of civilians were killed, according
to reports.
	   The UNITA rebels moved on Cunji, seven kilometers (four miles)
outside Kuito, shortly before daybreak, the private radio station
Radio Eclesia reported from the city, which lies about 500
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda.
	   Dozens of civilians sheltering at Cunji train station were
killed when the rebels attacked with automatic weapons and
grenades, the Radio Eclesia correspondent said.
	   Government jet fighters reportedly dropped bombs on the
advancing rebel troops.
	   A nurse at Kuito hospital said that the government forces had
repelled the attack after eight hours of intense combat and that
the city was calm in the afternoon.
	   ``The government is in control ... UNITA is retreating,'' the
nurse, who did not give his name, told Portuguese radio TSF.
	   He said dozens of wounded, including civilians and soldiers,
were arriving at the hospital.
	   Captured rebel soldiers were paraded through the streets of
Kuito in front of angry crowds, Radio Eclesia reported.
	   Cunji is located on high ground overlooking Kuito. Its capture
would give the rebels a vantage point for artillery fire on the
center of the city whose former population of 100,000 has been
swollen by thousands of displaced people fleeing fighting in the
surrounding area.
	   World Food Program spokeswoman Maria Flynn said about 30,000
displaced people had converged on Kuito in recent days.
	   Battles have focused on Bie province, whose capital is Kuito,
since fighting between the two sides restarted Dec. 4, ending a
four-year peace pact in the former Portuguese colony.
	   Carlos Veloso, who coordinates U.N. humanitarian assistance in
Angola, told a news conference that aid agencies' food and medicine
stocks in Bie would last for two months at the current rate of
consumption.
	   He estimated that the renewed fighting had displaced 400,000
people across the country.
	   Some 25,000 had arrived in Huambo, the country's second-largest
city, 110 kilometers (70 miles) west of Kuito, while more than
50,000 were in Luena, 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of Luanda,
according to Flynn of the WFP.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the U.N.-brokered
1994 peace agreement that was supposed to end a two-decade civil
war that broke out after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

Friday launch expected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ Hoping to catch the right wind,
British tycoon Richard Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett
and Swedish balloonist Per Linsdrandt will take off Friday on the
latest attempt to circle the globe in a balloon, organizers
announced.
	   The trio has been waiting for weeks for favorable weather
conditions to launch their ICO Global Challenge balloon after
several failed attempts.
	   The launch is to take place at a military air base near
Marrakech's Menara airport. The exact time was not immediately
available.
	   Bob Rice, ICO Global chief meteorologist in London, said last
week that a small window of good weather was expected this week.
	   ``What we're doing is just waiting for a realigning of upper
winds that allows us to get out of Marrakech with a certain amount
of dignity,'' he said.
	   Bad weather conditions have dogged the balloonists.
	   An unexpected storm caused Fossett to crash his Solo Spirit in
the South Pacidif last August nine days after it lifted off.
	   Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first
person to trek the globe in a balloon. The only time he managed to
take off, in January 1997, his balloon crashed a day after takeoff,
landing in the Algerian desert.
	   Branson and Fossett, one-time rivals, were putting their money
and energy together to tackle the challenge.
	   At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for
favorable weather to launch their balloon -- from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

Israel watching Iraq crisis closely
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is closely watching growing tensions
between Iraq and the United States, officials said Wednesday.
	   U.S. naval and air forces in the Gulf were ``in execute mode''
as President Bill Clinton met Wednesday with his top national
security advisers to consider military strikes in response to
Iraq's latest defiance of international arms inspectors.
	   ``We are being updated on the steps that the United States is
taking on this issue,'' said Aviv Bushinsky, the spokesman for
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Iraq directed Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War,
although Israel was not a participant in the U.S.-led effort to
drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
	   Since that war, U.N. inspectors have sought to ensure that Iraq
had divested itself of a weapons of mass destruction capability.
	   Failure to cooperate with the inspectors has precipitated
several near-attacks by U.S. and British forces on Iraq.
	   During such crises, Israelis have been placed on alert for a
possible chemical attack from Iraq.
	   A senior Netanyahu aide sought to compare the latest U.S.-Iraq
crisis with Israeli-Palestinian tensions.
	   ``We are prepared for any eventuality, but we would like to
point out that in this case it becomes quite clear that promises
and written agreements are only as good as the will to implement
it,'' David Bar-Illan said.
	   Israel has frozen its peace process with the Palestinians,
saying they have failed to implement commitments in the Wye River
accords, brokered by Clinton in October.
	   Clinton believes the Palestinians have made progress and has
urged Israel to go forward with the Wye agreement.

Fog delays flights across north India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Fog worsened by industrial pollution
delayed flights across northern India Wednesday leaving passengers
stranded at airports, domestic agencies reported.
	   Some airlines were forced to cancel there flights from the
Indian capital to other parts of northern India because of the fog.
Temperatures fell to nearly 5 degrees celcius (40 degrees
fahrenheit), two degrees below normal, the United News of India
reported.
	   Several flights left many hours behind schedule and some
international flights had to be diverted to the southern city of
Bombay. Passengers complained of poor transit facilities and
airline staff had a difficult time soothing angry travelers.
	   With visibility worsening at night, airline officials said
flights were likely to be delayed further, UNI reported.
	   According to the weather department, a combination of moisture,
low temperature, no winds and stable atmospheric conditions caused
the fog. The heavy fog enveloped the region stretching from
neighboring Pakistan in the west to the Varanasi town in eastern
India.
	   The fog was likely to continue for two more days, the weather
office said.

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Anger mixed with tears Wednesday as six
young Serbs were buried in Kosovo after being slain in a
``monstrous'' shooting that prompted protests and warnings of
reprisals from their countrymen.
	   The barroom killings in Pec, which Serbs blame on Kosovo
Albanian separatist rebels, have further inflamed ethnic passions
in the Serbian province amid escalating fears of a return to war.
	   A policeman enroute to the funeral reportedly shot and killed a
suspected rebel in the latest of dozens of deaths since an October
truce. Some ethnic Albanians elsewhere complained of harassment
connected to the killings.
	   Monday's shootings came on the bloodiest day since the
cease-fire agreement ended months of fighting between Serbian
forces and rebels bent on independence for the predominantly
Albanian-populated province. At least 42 people were killed that
day in Pec and in a border clash between the Kosovo Liberation Army
and the Yugoslav army, which claimed to have killed 36 guerrillas.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic renewed his determination
to suppress rebel ``terrorism'' and declared that the ``terrorist
bandits'' responsible for the Pec shooting would be found. A top
government body for Kosovo called the killings ``the most monstrous
crime in the series of assaults by Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   Busloads of Serb police stood by in Kosovo's third-largest city
in case of unrest or attack at an emotional ceremony attended by
5,000 in the central square. Many wept openly. Some speakers
demanded Serb authorities halt ``Albanian terrorism'' immediately.
At least one man in civilian clothing carried a submachine gun.
	   ``Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' said Mirko Simonovic,
principal of the high school where four of the victims were
students.
	   ``They were slain while drinking in a cafe by shots in their
back. ... They were killed for the simple reason of being Serbs.''
	   A tense silence permeated the western Kosovo city, punctured by
the pealing of church bells and the weeping of relatives of the
dead. Later, about 2,000 people walked in a procession to the
cemetery where the six were buried after their wailing mothers
kissed them farewell.
	   ``Their only sin was that they came from another religion,
another faith, another people,'' said Patriarch Pavle of the
Serbian Orthodox Church.
	   An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a rally in the
provincial capital Pristina, protesting the slayings.
	   No incidents were reported at either gathering. But a policeman
going to the funeral was reported to have shot and killed a man in
a Kosovo Liberation Army uniform after two suspected guerrillas
attacked him, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Also, ethnic Albanians in at least three towns were the target
of harassment, according to the Albanians' Kosovo Information
Center. It said Albanian schoolchildren were beaten up by Serb
civilians in Kosovska Mitrovica and Obilic and stone-throwers
smashed windows of Albanian-owned shops in Urosevac.
	   International verifiers, whose presence is supposed to ease
tension and restore public confidence, were nowhere to be seen in
Pec, a day after some Serbs took out their anger at the killings by
hurling stones or spitting at armored U.S. observer vehicles.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the shootings, which
happened when masked gunmen sprayed a bar full of Serbs, including
some victims playing pool. The rebels' political representative,
Adem Demaci, suggested the Serbian regime may have been behind the
attack, saying it did not ``fall within the concept of the KLA's
liberation fight.''
	   But Serb politicians and others accuse ethnic Albanian rebels
and warn of retribution.
	   Vuk Draskovic, a nationalist opposition leader in Serbia, said
in comments published Wednesday that if ``Albanian terrorism''
isn't defeated, ``the Serb people will take their defense into
their own hands.''
	   Serbian Deputy Premier Tomislav Nikolic said: ``The state will
not be able to tolerate much longer such terrorist acts of madmen
in Kosovo, and will take measures to secure order, peace and
stability.''
	   Pec, located 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina, has
about 150,000 residents, including several thousand Serbs.
	   Towns and cities have mostly escaped the violence that has
engulfed Kosovo villages this year since Serb forces launched an
offensive in February to crush pro-independence militants.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed and 300,000 forced from
their homes since Milosevic began a crackdown on separatists in
February.
	   Mothers of the bar shooting victims joined other Pec women
Wednesday in sending an open letter to Milosevic, telling him:
``Our trust in you obliges you to defend our children.''

Most passengers from stricken cruise ship leave St. Maarten
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ Hundreds of tourists who
abandoned ship when a cruise liner struck a Caribbean reef were
flying home to the United States Wednesday.
	   Most of the 2,557 tourists evacuated from the Monarch of the
Seas on Tuesday were flying to Miami or San Juan, Puerto Rico, or
had already arrived, said Gloria Jacaruso, spokeswoman for Royal
Caribbean International.
	   Some tourists, unwilling to shorten their vacations, were
staying in the island of St. Maarten, 150 miles (240 kilometers)
east of Puerto Rico.
	   The Monarch slammed into a reef less than a mile off Philipsburg
at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, opening a 120-foot-by-3-foot gash in the
forward left side of the hull. The crew decided to beach the
74,000-ton ship on sand in Great Bay harbor to prevent it from
sinking, and all passengers were safely evacuated. No one was hurt.
	   Investigators from the U.S. Coast Guard, Dutch St. Maarten and
Royal Caribbean were on the scene, trying to determine what caused
the accident.
	   The Monarch's draft is 25 feet (7 meters), while the shallowest
part of the reef sits 10 feet (3 meters) underwater. The reef
appears on navigational charts and is marked by a lighted beacon
and a radar reflector on a buoy, said harbor master Sunny Hoo.
	   No decision had been made on how to refloat the ship and where
to repair it, Jacaruso said.
	   Another Royal Caribbean ship, the Nordic Empress, arrived in St.
Maarten Wednesday on a regularly scheduled stop and took on some of
the Monarch's 813 crew. Other crew members were to fly to the
United States, Jacaruso said.
	   Passengers were being given refunds and certificates for another
free cruise to be used over the next year.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has allowed the construction of housing
in Jewish settlements in the West Bank to more than double, a peace
group said Wednesday in an assessment likely to further anger
frustrated Palestinians.
	   There were 1,420 homes started in the settlements in the first
half of 1998, the leader of Peace Now said in a statement. That was
136 percent more than in the same period last year.
	   In the second half of 1998, construction of 640 homes began in
the settlements, 121 percent more than in the same period of 1997,
Mossi Raz said.
	   The figures were obtained from a report of the Israeli
government's Central Bureau of Statistics, Raz said.
	   Settlers have placed mobile homes on nine new sites in the
vicinity of the settlements since U.S.-brokered negotiations
revived the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians in
October.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ An evangelical minister's prophecy
of a devastating earthquake in Puerto Rico has failed to come true
despite the worries of thousands of his followers.
	   Seismologists said Wednesday that earthquake sensors on Tuesday,
the date of the supposed disaster, reported nothing more than the
usual tiny rumbles on this Caribbean island.
	   Minister Douglas Marti had predicted the disaster since October,
and thousands of members of his Defenders of the Faith Church
filled a baseball stadium in northern Arecibo two weeks ago to pray
for the island's survival.
	   Marti claimed three young girls warned him of the earthquake
during dreams. On Wednesday, Primera Hora newspaper reported him
saying he was convinced the earthquake could still come.
	   ``I predicted Hurricanes Georges and Andrew,'' Marti said. ``I
have never been wrong.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign minister accused the chief U.N.
arms inspector of ``grossly exceeding'' his authority in Iraq, and
Moscow called Wednesday for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting
on the latest crisis in the Arab nation.
	   Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who was in Madrid, Spain,
said U.N. weapons inspection chief Richard Butler did not have the
right to order U.N. weapons monitors out of Iraq.
	   The monitors left Baghdad on Wednesday.
	   The United States and Britain, the leading critics of Iraq, said
airstrikes are one possible option if Iraq does not fully cooperate
with inspectors.
	   But Russia, which has long-standing ties to Iraq, has
consistently opposed military action against it. Russia has one
several occasions acted as a mediator in confrontations between the
United Nations and Iraq.
	   Ivanov accused Butler of ``grossly exceeding his authority by
unilaterally ordering the evacuation of the special commission from
Iraq.''
	   ``Unfortunately, the actions are leading to even more
complications and aggravating tensions around Iraq,'' said Ivanov,
who was in Spain to attend a peace conference on Bosnia. His
remarks were carried on Russian television.
	   ``Our point of view is that it is necessary to be patient now,
to assess the real situation and define what further steps are
necessary to continue the work of the special commission,'' Ivanov
said.
	   A liberal Russian lawmaker blamed the increased tensions around
Iraq on internal affairs in the United States, including the debate
about impeaching President Clinton.
	   ``Many connect the conflict with domestic affairs in America,
the looming impeachment and the need to mobilize public opinion
toward something very patriotic and combative,'' Vladimir Lukin,
head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, was quoted by the
ITAR-Tass news agency as saying.
	   That has made airstrikes on Iraq ``quite possible'' this time,
he said.
	   Iraq pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors a month
ago under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   But in his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Tuesday, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge. He said he could not give assurances that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed.
	   The arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security
Council can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

UEFA says cup final venues won't be moved for same-country clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ UEFA said Wednesday it won't change the venues for
this season's UEFA Cup and Champions Cup finals even if both
finalists come from the same country.
	   The two Italian teams left in the Champions Cup _ Juventus and
Inter Milan _ avoided each other in the draw for the quarterfinals.
	   Teams from only three countries _ Italy, France and Spain _ make
up the quarterfinal field of the UEFA Cup, and Wednesday's draw
produced no same-country pairings.
	   Whichever teams make the finals, they will play the match as
scheduled at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on May 12, UEFA said in
a statement.
	   It said it wanted ``to avoid any speculation at any time that,
should the two finalists belong to one of the three national
associations which still have participants in the UEFA Cup, the
final would be moved to that country.''
	   The same goes for the Champions Cup final, which will take place
May 26 at Barcelona's Camp Nou, UEFA said.
	   Last season's UEFA Cup final, in which Inter Milan beat fellow
Italian team Lazio 3-0, was played in Paris.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan forces defending the besieged city
of Kuito pushed back a rebel attack Wednesday after eight hours of
fierce fighting in which dozens of civilians were killed, according
to reports.
	   The UNITA rebels moved on Cunji, seven kilometers (four miles)
outside Kuito, shortly before daybreak, the private radio station
Radio Eclesia reported from the city, which lies about 500
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital, Luanda.
	   Dozens of civilians sheltering at Cunji train station were
killed when the rebels attacked with automatic weapons and
grenades, the Radio Eclesia correspondent said.
	   Government jet fighters reportedly dropped bombs on the
advancing rebel troops.
	   A nurse at Kuito hospital said that the government forces had
repelled the attack after eight hours of intense combat and that
the city was calm in the afternoon.
	   ``The government is in control ... UNITA is retreating,'' the
nurse, who did not give his name, told Portuguese radio TSF.
	   He said dozens of wounded, including civilians and soldiers,
were arriving at the hospital.
	   Captured rebel soldiers were paraded through the streets of
Kuito in front of angry crowds, Radio Eclesia reported.
	   Cunji is located on high ground overlooking Kuito. Its capture
would give the rebels a vantage point for artillery fire on the
center of the city whose former population of 100,000 has been
swollen by thousands of displaced people fleeing fighting in the
surrounding area.
	   World Food Program spokeswoman Maria Flynn said about 30,000
displaced people had converged on Kuito in recent days.
	   Battles have focused on Bie province, whose capital is Kuito,
since fighting between the two sides restarted Dec. 4, ending a
four-year peace pact in the former Portuguese colony.
	   Carlos Veloso, who coordinates U.N. humanitarian assistance in
Angola, told a news conference that aid agencies' food and medicine
stocks in Bie would last for two months at the current rate of
consumption.
	   He estimated that the renewed fighting had displaced 400,000
people across the country.
	   Neither side has acknowledged the collapse of the U.N.-brokered
1994 peace agreement that was supposed to end a two-decade civil
war that broke out after the southwest African nation's 1975
independence from Portugal.
	   The fighting was halted by a 1991 peace deal, but the agreement
collapsed a year later after UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ rejected its
defeat in the country's first elections.

	   ROME (AP) _ A five-story apartment house collapsed Wednesday,
killing at least 18 people and leaving about a dozen people
believed buried in the rubble.
	   About 12 hours after the building collapsed, rescue workers
pulled out a husband and wife, holding on to each other, from under
the rubble. They were described by police as a man and a woman in
their mid-sixties.
	   The man suffered leg fractures and the woman was taken into
surgery for suspected internal injuries, authorities said.
	   Among the 18 bodies retrieved were those of three children.

Israel watching Iraq crisis closely
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is closely watching growing tensions
between Iraq and the United States, officials said Wednesday.
	   U.S. naval and air forces in the Gulf were ``in execute mode''
as U.S. President Bill Clinton met Wednesday with his top national
security advisers to consider military strikes in response to
Iraq's latest defiance of international arms inspectors.
	   ``We are being updated on the steps that the United States is
taking on this issue,'' said Aviv Bushinsky, the spokesman for
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Iraq directed Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War,
although Israel was not a participant in the U.S.-led effort to
drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
	   Since that war, U.N. inspectors have sought to ensure that Iraq
had divested itself of a weapons of mass destruction capability.
	   Failure to cooperate with the inspectors has precipitated
several near-attacks by U.S. and British forces.
	   During such crises, Israelis have been placed on alert for a
possible chemical attack from Iraq.
	   A senior Netanyahu aide sought to compare the latest U.S.-Iraq
crisis with Israeli-Palestinian tensions.
	   ``We are prepared for any eventuality, but we would like to
point out that in this case it becomes quite clear that promises
and written agreements are only as good as the will to implement
it,'' David Bar-Illan said.

Little public reaction, but much disgust over impeachment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 13 grafs to ADD political background. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When the Monica Lewinsky scandal first broke,
bemused Europeans saw the whole thing as a silly _ and somewhat
alarming _ show of American puritanism at its worst.
	   But nobody thought it would go as far as it has. Europeans now
find it hard to believe that impeachment of President Bill Clinton
is a distinct possibility.
	   ``People thought everything was OK once the Democrats did well
in November,'' said Philippe Labro, a novelist and head of France's
biggest radio network, RTL.
	   ``They didn't know this big machine _ the House Judiciary
Committee _ was rolling onwards. They haven't paid attention, and
that's too bad, because soon we're going to hear that Clinton has
been impeached.''
	   On Paris streets Wednesday, nobody questioned was aware of the
planned vote Thursday in the House of Representatives. But
Parisians were unanimous in their disgust at the idea of
impeachment.
	   ``Fortunately for politicians in France, we don't sue them every
time they have an affair,'' said secretary Chrystelle Gibaut, 26.
``We would have plenty of them in the same sad situation.''
	   Olivier Sarfati, a 34-year-old lawyer, said the whole affair was
a purely political attack on Clinton.
	   ``All of this is very sad not only for America, but for the
image of democracy in the world,'' he said.
	   Jean Louis Grimal, a 54-year-old newspaper vendor, agreed. ``It
is stupid,'' Grimal said. ``They are confusing family issues with
politics. Appalling.''
	   None of France's major newspapers had an editorial on the
subject Wednesday. They've all been focused on something closer to
home: the bitter feud diving the far-right National Front.
	   ``We don't really understand the U.S. legal procedures,'' said
Erik Izraelewicz, in charge of editorials at Le Monde. ``But if the
Senate won't remove the president from office, then what is the
significance of this House vote?''
	   In most European countries, a leader would be felled by a
parliamentary motion like a vote of no confidence, part of the
normal political system.
	   In France, a prime minister can be kicked out by parliament _ it
happened in 1962 to Georges Pompidou, for his policies, but he was
later reinstated. For a president, though, the procedure is much
more complicated, and it hasn't happened in modern France, where
the president is generally regarded as untouchable.

Cook says airstrikes against Iraq could come without warning
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Foreign Office coments, edits to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As U.N. weapons inspectors evacuated Iraq on
Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said airstrikes
could come quickly and without warning in the face of Saddam
Hussein's latest defiance.
	   ``We said last time we would not be giving formal warnings to
Saddam Hussein,'' Cook said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
interview Wednesday. ``I'm not now going to give him any warning of
what we might do.''
	   Speaking Wednesday in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Tony
Blair said the Iraqi dictator posed a threat to the world, adding,
``I'm quite satisfied that if we should choose to use force, we
have the necessary legal authority to do so.''
	   On Tuesday, a report by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler accused Saddam of not meeting promises made last month to
fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors and of imposing new
restrictions on their work.
	   Blair told lawmakers that Saddam has engaged in ``a plan of
deceit to prevent these weapons of mass destruction from being
located and destroyed.''
	   ``What the report details isn't merely the obstruction itself,''
the prime minister said. ``The obstruction directly relates to
documents, sites and personnel that would give clues as to the
whereabouts of the weapons of mass destruction and the capability
to make them.''
	   Blair's spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity, said this
weekend's start of the Muslim holy festival of Ramadan would be
taken into account as the government determined its response.
	   But a spokesman for the Foreign Office said later that although
Ramadan is a factor, ``I don't think we would see it as an
overriding consideration.''
	   The Foreign Office has also said the prospect of military action
would not be held up by emergency Security Council meetings being
called for by the Russians.
	   ``We have never seen another Security Council process as
necessary,'' the spokesman said with customary anonymity. ``(U.N.
Secretary-General) Kofi Annan himself said on November 15 that he
was not sure, if there was a next time, that there would be further
diplomatic initiatives.''
	   William Hague, leader of the opposition Conservative Party,
pledged his party's backing for aggression against Iraq.
	   ``I can assure the prime minister of the full support of the
opposition for the use of military action in the days ahead,
provided that action has clear and achievable objectives,'' Hague
said.
	   He told Blair that it must be a ``prime objective of Western
policy to remove Saddam Hussein from power.''
	   Blair discussed the Iraq crisis with U.S. President Bill Clinton
in a 15-minute phone call Tuesday night, the prime minister's
spokesman said.

Alpine principality denies report's allegations on looted art
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) _ The tiny principality of
Liechtenstein Wednesday rejected as false allegations made in an
official Swiss report that its royal family acquired significant
amounts of Nazi-looted art during World War II.
	   ``During that time no major art purchases were made,'' said a
government statement.
	   The family of the country's then-ruler, Prince Franz Josef,
concentrated instead on decorating its palaces, and made a point of
avoiding individual art works confiscated by the Nazis, said the
statement.
	   It said it was puzzling that it was included in a Swiss report
anyway, but that it would have been better if had been treated as a
victim for its own art losses in the war rather than as a villain.
	   The report commissioned by the Swiss government and released
last Friday was mainly aimed at Switzerland. It said Swiss dealers
and collectors played a major part in World War II trafficking in
Nazi-looted art.
	   The Liechtenstein government statement said the only documents
that could be found in archives concerned a desk acquired by the
prince from a dealer in 1943, which came from Berlin.
	   The documents showed the prince was at pains to make sure the
desk had not been taken from Jews, it said.
	   Its owner was a non-Jewish Hungarian woman who sold it and other
household possessions in a normal auction because she was moving to
Romania on marrying her second husband, a Romanian, the statement
said.
	   It was unclear whether she bought the desk in London or whether
it belonged to her first husband, who was Jewish, but died in 1932
before the Nazis came to power, the statement said.
	   Liechtenstein, like neighboring Switzerland, remained neutral in
World War II. But its royal family had holdings in the former
Austro-Hungarian empire. It still has a claim for art treasures
seized by the government of Czechoslovakia at the end of the war.
	   Franz Josef was able to rescue his art collection from the
family's Vienna palace, but had to leave the family archive behind.
Russian forces seized the archive and Russia returned them only
last year.

Top UEFA official being investigated by Rome prosecutors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Prosecutors notified Antonio Matarrese, a UEFA vice
president and former head of the Italian soccer federation, on
Wednesday that he is being investigated in connection with a probe
into the use of performance-enhancing substances in Italian soccer.
	   The formal notice of investigation arrived at Italian soccer
federation headquarters just hours before an exhibition match
commemorating the federation's centennial, the ANSA news agency
reported.
	   Matarrese resigned as head of the federation following Italy's
poor showing at the 1996 European Championships.
	   He is the latest in a series of top sports officials to be drawn
into the the doping scandal that broke during the summer and has
led to the resignation of Italian Olympic Committee President Mario
Pescante and the closing of the country's drug-testing laboratory.

	   ROME (AP) _ A five-story apartment house collapsed Wednesday,
killing at least 18 people and leaving about a dozen people
believed buried in the rubble.
	   About 12 hours after the building collapsed, rescue workers
pulled out a husband and wife, holding on to each other, from under
the rubble. They were described by police as a man and a woman in
their mid-sixties.
	   The man suffered leg fractures and the woman was taken into
surgery for suspected internal injuries, authorities said.
	   Among the 18 bodies retrieved were those of three children.

Alpine principality denies report's allegations on looted art
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) _ The tiny principality of
Liechtenstein on Wednesday rejected allegations that its royal
family acquired significant amounts of Nazi-looted art during World
War II.
	   ``During that time no major art purchases were made,'' said a
government statement.
	   The family of the country's then-ruler, Prince Franz Josef,
concentrated instead on decorating its palaces, and made a point of
avoiding individual art works confiscated by the Nazis, said the
statement.
	   It said it was puzzling that the allegations were included in a
Swiss report, and it should be considered a victim for its own art
losses in the war rather than a villain.
	   The report commissioned by the Swiss government and released
last Friday was mainly aimed at Switzerland. It said Swiss dealers
and collectors played a major part in World War II trafficking in
Nazi-looted art.
	   The Liechtenstein government statement said the only documents
that could be found in archives concerned a desk from Berlin
acquired by the prince from a dealer in 1943.
	   The documents showed the prince was at pains to make sure the
desk had not been taken from Jews, it said.
	   Liechtenstein, like neighboring Switzerland, remained neutral in
World War II. But its royal family had holdings in the former
Austro-Hungarian empire. It still has a claim for art treasures
seized by the government of Czechoslovakia at the end of the war.
	   Franz Josef was able to rescue his art collection from the
family's Vienna palace, but had to leave the family archive behind.
Russian forces seized the archive and Russia returned them only
last year.

Space chief: international space station priority for Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The only way Russia can commit its scarce
resources to the new international space station and keep its aging
Mir station in orbit is if it finds new funding sources, the
nation's space chief said Wednesday.
	   Next year's draft budget now under review in the Russian
parliament earmarks a meager 3 billion rubles (dlrs 143 million)
for space research, Russian Space Agency director Yuri Koptev said
at a news conference.
	   ``The amount is clearly inadequate and is likely to further
shrink because of inflation,'' he said.
	   Koptev has said that Russia will have to spend about dlrs 270
million next year to provide a long-delayed key module for the new
international station, along with two cargo ships. Russia is
dealing with its worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   The first two elements of the dlrs 40 billion, 16-nation station
are already in orbit. The Russian-built Zarya module was
successfully launched last month, and the crew of the U.S. space
shuttle Endeavour linked it with the American-made Unity connecting
chamber earlier this month.
	   The Endeavour returned to Earth late Tuesday.
	   Koptev said Russia will raise additional funds by selling more
hardware to NASA. He said he had already held preliminary talks
with NASA officials on selling an escape capsule for the new
station and hoped to sign the contract early next year.
	   Russia has failed to meet two target dates for construction of
the station's crew compartment, putting the whole project more than
a year behind schedule. Struggling to prevent further delays,
Russia has already sold its early research time on the station to
NASA for dlrs 60 million.
	   The crew module is now set to blast off next summer, and the new
station will not be inhabitable until at least early 2000.
	   Koptev stressed that Russia's partners wouldn't tolerate further
delays.
	   ``Every year of delay costs Americans dlrs 2 billion, and
hundreds of millions dollars for the Europeans,'' Koptev said.
	   Koptev reiterated that officials still hope to keep the Mir
space station in orbit past the current target date of the middle
of next year, but that would only happen if extra money is found.
	   ``The current amount of financing doesn't allow that,'' he said.
	   Space officials have promised to decide on Mir's fate this
month, but Koptev said the decision is likely to be announced early
next year.
	   Under the current plan, Russians are to send a joint crew of
Russian, French and Slovak astronauts to Mir next February. Two
Russians are then expected to stay on the Mir to gradually lower
its orbit to prepare for sinking the 120-ton station in the ocean.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ World time trial and Spanish Vuelta
champion Abraham Olano has signed with ONCE for the 1999 season,
the team's sports director said Wednesday.
	   Jose Antonio Montero said the 28-year-old Spaniard has left
Banesto and signed a two-year deal with ONCE.
	   ``Abraham Olano will reinforce the team in a very important
way,'' Montero told the state-run news agency EFE.
	   At ONCE, Olano will join countrymen Mikel Zarrabeitia and David
Echevarria and Frenchman Laurent Jalabert.
	   Both teams, Banesto and ONCE, are based in Spain.
	   ``I have always liked the work ethic of ONCE and I wanted to see
if it would have a big effect on Abraham Olano's body,'' Olano told
the private radio station COPE after signing the contract.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council held an
emergency meeting Wednesday to discuss chief inspector Richard
Butler's report that Iraq failed to cooperate fully with U.N.
monitors, which has again raised the threat of U.S. and British
airstrikes.
	   The council met for about 90 minutes and agreed to resume
consultations on Iraq later Wednesday.
	   Butler ordered all staff from the U.N. Special Commission, which
he heads, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to leave
Baghdad overnight.
	   However, Russia, France and China expressed anger that the
council wasn't consulted before the pullout.
	   ``I was given to believe that I should act immediately,'' Butler
told reporters as he entered the council chamber. ``There was no
time. The secretary-general was consulted. I talked with him. He
agreed. I did what I had to do.''
	   But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused Butler of
overstepping his authority. And a Chinese diplomat said: ``We are
very much concerned about this issue.'' He noted that Butler also
had pulled inspectors out of Baghdad during last month's crisis
without consultation.
	   Butler apparently made his decision late Tuesday night after
speaking to Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   Burleigh told him that the United States considered the report
``to be a very serious matter'' and had extended its program
allowing U.S. government personnel in the region to leave
voluntarily. Butler was told he ``might want to consider taking
whatever prudent measures he deemed appropriate,'' a U.S. diplomat
said.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's full compliance with the inspectors who
are trying to verify Iraq's disarmament _ a view reiterated by the
U.S. diplomat.
	   ``We believe we have the authority we need under previous
Security Council resolutions to act and all options are on the
table,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz called it ``a bad
report'' and said it was ``intended to trigger American and British
military strike on Iraq,'' according to the Iraqi News Agency.
	   Russia and France, who called the council meeting, contend along
with China that the Security Council must sanction any military
action.
	   The Chinese diplomat indicated that Beijing believes Butler's
report was too negative.
	   ``The report should be balanced because what we see is
sufficient cooperation has been extended to UNSCOM,'' the Chinese
diplomat said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Butler said Wednesday morning that he ordered all staff to leave
Baghdad because ``they are not able to do their work adequately.''
	   A plane carrying some staff landed in Bahrain but others were
leaving by road and Butler said he did not know whether they were
out of Iraq. ``That's my most important concern, that everyone is
out and safe,'' he said.
	   There were about 140 U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said 66 U.N. personnel, including 10
dependents, left Baghdad Wednesday _ seven by plane and the rest by
road to Amman, Jordan.
	   After consultations between U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
and other U.N. officials in New York, he said it was decided that
142 other U.N. staff members would remain at U.N. headquarters in
the Canal Hotel in Baghdad Wednesday night.

 &UR; Saddam, preparing for war, puts Iraq under four commands &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES Urgent series; minor editing; background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday
divided Iraq into four military commands and handed their control
to four trusted aides, state media reported.
	   The move was apparently aimed at preventing any civil uprising
against his rule in case the imminent U.S.-British attacks deal
severe blows to his authority.
	   Saddam will, however, retain control over the air force, air
defense units and missile units, television and radio stations
announced, interrupting normal programming.
	   The air defense, rather than ground forces, will be Saddam best
hope to counter any air strikes.
	   The reports said Saddam issued a presidential decree to make the
changes.
	   After the end of the 1991 Gulf War that routed Saddam's forces
from Kuwait, 14 provinces in the Shiite south as well as Kurdish
north rebelled against the government, but were put down brutally.
	   The media reports said the Intelligence Department, controlled
by a close relative of the president, and the Special Security, run
by his son, Qusai, will remain untouched. Special Security is
responsible for Saddam's personal security.
	   The elite Saddam's Commandos, run by Saddam's other son, Odai,
will also stay with him, the media reported. The Commandos help the
Special Security and the Intelligence in their work.
	   Leaving the three units in trusted hands implied that in case of
a personal threat to Saddam, he will continue to have the support
of key loyal forces.
	   The media reports said the four new military commands set up in
Iraq are:
	   The Northern Region, comprising the three Kurdish governorates
of Sulemaniya, Irbil and Dohuk and the northern governorate of
Mosul. The region will be commanded by the vice chairman of the
decision-making Revolutionary Command Council, Izzat Ibrahim.
	   The southern region consisting of Basra, Dhikar, Misan and Waset
to be commanded by an RCC member, Ali Hasan al-Majid, a cousin of
Saddam.
	   The Central Euphrates region consisting of predominantly Shiite
areas of Babylon, Karbala, Najaf, Qadissiya and Muthana will be led
by Deputy Prime Minister Mohammed Hamza al-Zubeidi, an RCC member.
	   The Central region of Baghdad, Salahdin, Anbar, Diyala will be
commanded by Defense Minister Hashim Ahmed Sultan.
	   Each commander will have all government sources under his
command, the presidential decree said.
	   In case of communications breakdown, the Intelligence, the
Special Security and Saddam's Commandos will convey messages
between the various regions, the broadcasts said.
	   The announcement comes as Iraq prepares for imminent air strikes
following the withdrawal of U.N. inspectors from Iraq earlier
Wednesday.
	   The unexpected evacuation was ordered by chief U.N. weapons
inspector who accused Iraq of failing to keep its promise of fully
cooperating with the inspectors searching for Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.

	   LONDON (AP)_ Share prices rose strongly Wednesday on the London
Stock Exchange.
	   The blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
closed up 73.3 points, or 1.3 percent, at 5,630.4, and provisional
volume for the entire market stood at 834 million shares, compared
with 730 million on Tuesday.
	   The FTSE 100 managed a strong finish even as early losses on
Wall Street cast a pall over global markets.
	   ``We don't feel that this market is to be trusted, and we
continue to take a cautious approach as we move into 1999,'' said
Jeremy Batstone, head of research and a fund manager at Natwest
Stockbrokers. ``If this rally continues, we would urge investors to
prune their portfolios and look at safety first.''

Blair promises to back bid despite scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS McGivan quote &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed continued full
support Wednesday for England's bid to host the 2006 World Cup
despite a bribery scandal sweeping through the Football
Association.
	   Speaking in Parliament and without refering directly to the
scandal, Blair said the bid still had the government's complete
backing.
	   ``If there is to be a bid from this part of the world, we should
carry on fighting for it,'' he said.
	   The biggest scandal to hit the FA in its 135-year history led to
the resignation of its leading official on Tuesday as well as a
unanimous vote for the chairman to quit.
	   Chief executive Graham Kelly and chairman Keith Wiseman
unilaterally agreed a 3.2 million pound (dlrs 5 million) loan to
the Welsh FA without consulting the rest of the executive
committee.
	   The papers interpreted it as a move to gain a vote for Wiseman
in an election for FIFA and UEFA executive committees and charged
that the two men had dragged English soccer into an unprecedented
and damaging scandal.
	   While clubs and fans digested Tuesday's stunning events, several
newspapers said that the crisis had virtually killed off England's
bid to stage the 2006 World Cup. Other candidates include Germany,
Brazil, Morocco, Ghana and Egypt with South Africa also expected to
enter a bid.
	   The Times of London said that the England bid had now ``lost its
credibility'' and stood no chance at all if Wiseman stayed as
chairman. Although he has refused to resign, he may be forced out
by a meeting of the 91-member FA Council Jan. 4.
	   The tabloid Daily Mirror said the scandal had put the future of
England coach Glenn Hoddle in doubt and ``could shatter'' hopes of
staging the 2006 World Cup.
	   ``Kelly has cost us the World Cup'' headlined the Sun. ``Now
there are fears that the 9 million pound (dlrs 15 million) campaign
to stage the 2006 finals will prove a disastrous waste of money,''
the paper said.
	   Alec McGivan, one of the officials leading the English bid, said
he couldn't understand the media's reaction.
	   ``Everyone in English soccer wants us to stage the World Cup in
2006 and we are determined to prove to the world that England will
provide the best venue for the tournament,'' he said from Bangkok,
where he is promoting the bid while attending the Asian Games.
	   ``We have a very strong case and we have no intention of being
deflected from it. This bid is bigger than any individuals.''

Russian parliament passes bill to print rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government won the go-ahead from
parliament Wednesday to begin printing $1.2 billion worth of rubles
in a bid to help pay the state's crushing debt, but the move could
stoke already high inflation.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the extra rubles to pay
off workers and pensioners, among others. But with inflation
running at around 70 percent this year, the cash injection could
push prices even higher.
	   In a bid to cover its huge budget deficit, the government has
already printed $648 million worth of rubles since October without
waiting for parliament approval.
	   The bill passed unanimously Wednesday by the lower house, the
State Duma, allows a total $1.2 billion worth of rubles to be
printed in the next two weeks.
	   The bill also requires Russian exporters to repatriate 75
percent of their hard-currency earnings, up from the current 50
percent in a bid to shore up foreign currency reserves.
	   The government meanwhile has drafted a budget for 1999 that
assumes foreign lenders will provide new loans which have not been
promised and restructure massive amounts of previous debt Russia
has failed to pay.
	   Russia defaulted on many of its treasury bonds in August,
sending financial markets into a nosedive and prompting foreign
lenders to freeze aid to Russia. The country is now mired in its
worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants, after talks between the
World Bank representative in Moscow, expressed hope Russia could
receive $3.4 billion in loans from the World Bank next year.
	   But negotiations with foreign creditors over the defaulted
treasury bonds snagged when Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov
announced a deal had been reached _ a claim lenders quickly denied.
	   Zadornov claimed an agreement was reached to reissue $10 billion
dollars in bonds with maturities of four to five years.
	   Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse-First Boston, which are leading
negotiations with Russia, said they had not agreed to the Russian
terms.
	   In a rare good sign for the government's coffers, at least two
foreign companies have offered bids for a 2.5 percent stake in the
state-controlled natural gas giant, Gazprom, the Interfax news
agency reported Wednesday.
	   The government is asking at least $651 million for the stake _
significantly more than its market price.
	   Before debating the 1999 budget, parliament will first weigh
measures to streamline the nation's unwieldy tax system in a bid to
create incentives for ailing industries and persuade tax evaders to
pay what they owe.
	   Bills have been proposed to lower the value-added tax, currently
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent.

Broncos, Vikings place nine players each in annual all-star game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jerry Rice, who missed almost all of 1997 with
knee injuries, made it back to the the U.S. National Football
League's Pro Bowl on Wednesday, selected for the season-ending
all-star game along with a player who some say may break his
records, Minnesota rookie Randy Moss.
	   Not surprisingly, the Denver Broncos and Minnesota Vikings, who
lead their conferences with 13-1 records, placed the most players
on the team, nine each.
	   The Vikings on the roster for the Feb. 7 game in Honolulu are:
Moss, receiver Cris Carter, tackle Todd Steussie, guard Randall
McDaniel, center Jeff Christy, quarterback Randall Cunningham,
defensive tackle John Randle, inside linebacker Ed McDaniel and
kicker Gary Anderson.
	   Moss, the only rookie on either squad, is a starter, along with
Randall McDaniel, Christy and Randle.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday
divided Iraq into four military commands and handed their control
to four trusted aides, state media reported.
	   The move was apparently aimed at preventing any civil uprising
against his rule in case the imminent U.S.-British attacks deal
severe blows to his authority.
	   Saddam will, however, retain control over the air force, air
defense units and missile units, television and radio stations
announced.
	   The air defense, rather than ground forces, will be Saddam's
best hope to counter any air strikes.
	   The reports said Saddam issued a presidential decree to make the
changes.
	   After the end of the 1991 Gulf War that routed Saddam's forces
from Kuwait, 14 provinces in the Shiite south as well as Kurdish
north rebelled against the government, but were brutally cowed.
	   The media reports said the Intelligence Department, controlled
by a close relative of the president, and the Special Security, run
by his son Qusai will remain untouched. Special Security is
responsible for Saddam's personal security.
	   The elite Saddam's Commandos, run by Saddam's other son, Odai,
will also stay with him, the media reported.
	   Leaving the three units in trusted hands implied that in case of
a personal threat to Saddam, he will continue to have the support
of key loyal forces.
	   The media reports said the four new military commands would
consist of the northern region, southern region, central Euphrates
region and central region including Baghdad. They will each be led
by Saddam's close allies.
	   Each commander will have all government resources under his
command, the presidential decree said.
	   The announcement comes as Iraq prepares for imminent air strikes
following the withdrawal of U.N. inspectors earlier Wednesday.
	   The unexpected evacuation was ordered by chief U.N. weapons
inspector who accused Iraq of failing to keep its promise of fully
cooperating with the inspectors searching for Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.

Marseille to launch TV channel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Marseille is set to become the first
soccer club in continental European to launch its own television
channel, the club said Wednesday.
	   The channel, called ``OMTV,'' will be available between 4 p.m.
and 8 p.m. every day, and cost customers 35 francs (dlrs six) a
month.
	   It will run over the network of pay television station Canal
Plus and begin transmission on January 16.
	   In an effort to bolster their marketing, English clubs Leeds
United and Manchester United have created TV stations.
	   Marseille is the first outside England to follow suit.
	   ``The local, regional and national press constitute a good
vehicle for Marseille, but we need more to counterbalance the
opinion of the written press,'' said club president Robert-Louis
Dreyfus, who is also president of sportswear giant Adidas.
	   In addition to merchandising, the channel will feature news,
quizzes and replays of classic matches.
	   After winning the European Cup in 1993, Marseille was rocked by
corruption scandals and was expelled from the French first
division.
	   But the club has bounced back.
	   It lies top of the French first division and has qualified for
the quarterfinals of the UEFA Cup.
	   The club spent 15 million francs (dlrs 2.6 million) to set up
OMTV and is hoping to sign up 12,000 subscribers by the end of
1999.
	   ``That figure seems possible because we know that we have
100,000 people who follow us in France,'' said the club's deputy
president Jean-Michel Roussier.

 &UR; TEL AVIV, Israel: the Palestinians &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Netanyahu was applauded by the Likud faithful as he swore not to
give up further territory unless the Palestinians met his
conditions.
	   Those included swearing off incitement to violence; rounding up
illegally-held weapons; reducing the Palestinian police force; and
backing off declared aspirations to statehood or to a presence in
Jerusalem.
	   ``These are the correct principles which are needed for the
state of Israel, to ensure its future,'' he said. ``It is necessary
to unite most of the (political) forces behind them.''
	   The Palestinians reject the conditions as unrealistic, and as
beyond commitments they made at Wye River, Md. in October at
U.S.-brokered talks.
	   ``What emerged in Netanyahu's speech is a freeze of the peace
process,'' said Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator. ``He
knows very well that the Palestinian side has fulfilled all its
commitments.''
	   Netanyahu faces a no-confidence vote on Monday. Hardliners have
said they will not vote for him because they do not believe his
pledges not to withdraw from more territory.
	   In his speech he accused them of wanting to ``rip up Oslo and
Wye.'' The Oslo peace agreement nwas negotiated by Israel in 1993.
	   Barak has already begun organizing for new elections.

Parliament chamber votes to eliminate compulsory sex education
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Compulsory sex education in Polish schools
would end before it would start under an amendment passed Wednesday
by the lower chamber of parliament.
	   The Sejm voted 219-175 to eliminate a provision that requires
high schools to offer the course called ``Knowledge on human sexual
life.'' The amendment now goes to the Senate chamber.
	   Under the amendment, the education minister would decide what
sex education courses, if any, should be offered.
	   Rightist supporters of the governing Solidarity-led coalition
supported the amendment, saying compulsory sex education was
approved by the previous leftist government in 1996 in an effort to
counter the influence of the church in predominantly Catholic
Poland.
	   Despite the requirement, political wrangling and bureaucratic
delays postponed compulsory sex education from starting. It was
supposed to begin this year.
	   A leftist member of parliament, Jozef Oleksy, said halting
compulsory sex education would be ``a huge loss for Polish youth.''
	   ``We are heading for Europe where education includes preparing
children for adult life, including sexual life,'' Oleksy said.
``Meanwhile, we are moving away from this.''

Most passengers from stricken cruise ship leave St. Maarten

<TEXT>
	   PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten (AP) _ Hundreds of tourists who
abandoned ship when a cruise liner struck a Caribbean reef were
flying home to the United States Wednesday.
	   Most of the 2,557 tourists evacuated from the Monarch of the
Seas on Tuesday were flying to Miami or San Juan, Puerto Rico, or
had already arrived, said Gloria Jacaruso, spokeswoman for Royal
Caribbean International.
	   Some tourists, unwilling to shorten their vacations, were
staying in the island of St. Maarten, 150 miles (240 kilometers)
east of Puerto Rico.
	   The Monarch slammed into a reef less than a mile (kilometer) off
Philipsburg at 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, opening a 120-foot-by-3-foot gash
(40-meter-by-1-meter) in the forward left side of the hull. The
crew decided to beach the 74,000-ton ship on sand in Great Bay
harbor to prevent it from sinking, and all passengers were safely
evacuated. No one was hurt.
	   Investigators from the U.S. Coast Guard, Dutch St. Maarten and
Royal Caribbean were on the scene, trying to determine what caused
the accident.
	   The Monarch's draft is 25 feet (7 meters), while the shallowest
part of the reef sits 10 feet (3 meters) underwater. The reef
appears on navigational charts and is marked by a lighted beacon
and a radar reflector on a buoy, said harbor master Sunny Hoo.
	   No decision had been made on how to refloat the ship and where
to repair it, Jacaruso said.
	   Another Royal Caribbean ship, the Nordic Empress, arrived in St.
Maarten Wednesday on a regularly scheduled stop and took on some of
the Monarch's 813 crew. Other crew members were to fly to the
United States, Jacaruso said.
	   Passengers were being given refunds and certificates for another
free cruise to be used over the next year.

Canadian downhill teras knee ligament in practice

<TEXT>
	   VALGARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Canadian downhiller Ed Podivinsky
suffered a potentially season-ending knee injury Wednesday in the
opening practice for back-to-back World Cup races in this north
Italian valley.
	   Th 28-year-old Canadian skier fell at a bump along the icy
Saslong course and Canada's head coach Max Gartner said he possibly
tore the anterior cruciate ligament of the left knee.
	   ``He will fly home tomorrow to undergo full medical
examinations,'' Gartner said. ``If the ligament is fully torn, it's
a season ending injury. It's an unfortunate accident.''
	   This season includes the World Alpine Skii Championships in
Vail, Colo., in February.
	   Podivinsky, a bronze medalist in the 1994 Olympic downhill who
already had his right knee reconstructed, did not fall but forced
on his left knee as he landed on a bump following a jump.
	   He stopped along the track, in pain, as the practice as
temporarily suspended.
	   The Canadian, whose only World Cup career victory dates back to
Saalbach in 1994, was considered the top Canadian entry in the two
downhills here.

Serbs mourn, protest killings in western Kosovo city

<TEXT>
	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Anger mixed with tears Wednesday as six
young Serbs were buried in Kosovo after being slain in a
``monstrous'' shooting that prompted protests and warnings of
reprisals from their countrymen.
	   The barroom killings in Pec, which Serbs blame on Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian rebels, have further inflamed ethnic passions in
the Serbian province amid escalating fears of a return to war.
	   A policeman enroute to the funeral reportedly shot and killed a
suspected rebel in the latest of dozens of deaths since an October
truce. Some ethnic Albanians elsewhere complained of harassment
connected to the killings.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed and 300,000 forced from
their homes since Milosevic began a crackdown on separatists in
February.
	   Monday's shootings came on the bloodiest day since the
cease-fire agreement ended months of fighting between government
forces and rebels bent on independence for Kosovo, the
predominately ethnic Albanian province of Yugoslavia's main
republic of Serbia. At least 42 people were killed that day in Pec
and in a border clash between the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
Yugoslav army, which claimed to have killed 36 guerrillas.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic renewed his determination
to suppress rebel ``terrorism'' and declared that the ``terrorist
bandits'' responsible for the Pec shooting would be found. A top
government body for Kosovo called the killings ``the most monstrous
crime in the series of assaults by Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   Busloads of Serb police stood by in Kosovo's third-largest city
in case of unrest or attack at an emotional ceremony attended by
5,000 people in the central square. Many wept. Some speakers
demanded Serb authorities halt ``Albanian terrorism'' immediately.
At least one man in civilian clothing carried a submachine gun.
	   ``Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' said Mirko Simonovic,
principal of the high school where four of the victims were
students.
	   ``They were slain while drinking in a cafe by shots in their
back. ... They were killed for the simple reason of being Serbs,''
he said.
	   A tense silence permeated the western Kosovo city, punctured by
the pealing of church bells and the weeping of relatives. About
2,000 people later walked in a procession to the cemetery where the
six were buried after their wailing mothers kissed them farewell.
	   ``Their only sin was that they came from another religion,
another faith, another people,'' said Patriarch Pavle of the
Serbian Orthodox Church.
	   An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a rally in the
provincial capital Pristina, protesting the slayings.
	   No incidents were reported at either gathering. But a policeman
going to the funeral was reported to have shot and killed a man in
a Kosovo Liberation Army uniform after two suspected guerrillas
attacked him, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Also, ethnic Albanians in at least three towns were the target
of harassment, according to the Albanians' Kosovo Information
Center. It said Albanian schoolchildren were beaten up by Serb

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Anger mixed with tears Wednesday as six
young Serbs were buried in Kosovo after being slain in a
``monstrous'' shooting that prompted protests and warnings of
reprisals from their countrymen.
	   The barroom killings in Pec, which Serbs blame on Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian rebels, have further inflamed ethnic passions in
the Serbian province amid escalating fears of a return to war.
	   A policeman enroute to the funeral reportedly shot and killed a
suspected rebel in the latest of dozens of deaths since an October
truce. Some ethnic Albanians elsewhere complained of harassment
connected to the killings.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed and 300,000 forced from
their homes since Milosevic began a crackdown on separatists in
February.
	   Monday's shootings came on the bloodiest day since the
cease-fire agreement ended months of fighting between government
forces and rebels bent on independence for Kosovo, the
predominately ethnic Albanian province of Yugoslavia's main
republic of Serbia. At least 42 people were killed that day in Pec
and in a border clash between the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
Yugoslav army, which claimed to have killed 36 guerrillas.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic renewed his determination
to suppress rebel ``terrorism'' and declared that the ``terrorist
bandits'' responsible for the Pec shooting would be found. A top
government body for Kosovo called the killings ``the most monstrous
crime in the series of assaults by Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   Busloads of Serb police stood by in Kosovo's third-largest city
in case of unrest or attack at an emotional ceremony attended by
5,000 people in the central square. Many wept. Some speakers
demanded Serb authorities halt ``Albanian terrorism'' immediately.
At least one man in civilian clothing carried a submachine gun.
	   ``Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' said Mirko Simonovic,
principal of the high school where four of the victims were
students.
	   ``They were slain while drinking in a cafe by shots in their
back. ... They were killed for the simple reason of being Serbs,''
he said.
	   A tense silence permeated the western Kosovo city, punctured by
the pealing of church bells and the weeping of relatives. About
2,000 people later walked in a procession to the cemetery where the
six were buried after their wailing mothers kissed them farewell.
	   ``Their only sin was that they came from another religion,
another faith, another people,'' said Patriarch Pavle of the
Serbian Orthodox Church.
	   An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs attended a rally in the
provincial capital Pristina, protesting the slayings.
	   No incidents were reported at either gathering. But a policeman
going to the funeral was reported to have shot and killed a man in
a Kosovo Liberation Army uniform after two suspected guerrillas
attacked him, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Also, ethnic Albanians in at least three towns were the target
of harassment, according to the Albanians' Kosovo Information
Center. It said Albanian schoolchildren were beaten up by Serb
civilians in Kosovska Mitrovica and Obilic and stone-throwers
smashed windows of Albanian-owned shops in Urosevac.
	   International verifiers, whose presence is supposed to ease
tension and restore public confidence, were nowhere to be seen in
Pec, a day after some Serbs took out their anger at the killings by
hurling stones or spitting at armored U.S. observer vehicles.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the shootings, which

some victims playing pool. The rebels' political representative,
Adem Demaci, suggested the Serbian regime may have been behind the
attack, saying it did not ``fall within the concept of the KLA's

	   But Serb politicians and others accuse ethnic Albanian rebels
and warn of retribution.
	   Vuk Draskovic, a nationalist opposition leader in Serbia, said
in comments published Wednesday that if ``Albanian terrorism''
isn't defeated, ``the Serb people will take their defense into
their own hands.''

Regional lawmakers vote tobacco ban derogation to keep Belgian
</HEADLINE>
Grand Prix &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Wallonia's regional parliament approved
a controversial decree Wednesday to hold on to tobacco advertising
at the Belgian Formula One Grand Prix, despite national legislation
banning such ads on health grounds as of Jan. 1, 1999.
	   The defiant move of the Walloon legislators is now expected to
set off a legal tug-of-war over which piece of legislation gets
precedence and to further sour relations between Wallonia, where
the Spa-Francorchamps circuit is located, and Flanders, which
pushed hardest for the anti-tobacco legislation.
	   ``It is regrettable to take a decision like that when you don't
get your way at a national level,'' said Belgian Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene. ``Fortunately, it can be challenged by the
court,'' he said.
	   The national anti-tobacco law will bar as of 1999 tobacco
sponsors from advertising at sports and cultural events, including
the hugely successful Belgian Grand Prix.
	   But Wallonia's Minister-President Robert Collignon has lobbied
hard to keep the race on the international Formula One calendar,
indicating a local derogation to the law could be obtained.
	   On Wednesday the Walloon parliament approved such a derogation
by a 55-8 vote with one abstention. The environmentalist Ecolo
party was the only group to vote against.
	   ``It's a dangerous game,'' said Dehaene.
	   Tobacco sponsorship and advertising is Formula One's economic
lifeline and a ban would have made it likely that the race was cut.
	   The Belgian anti-tobacco law goes beyond plans by the 15
European Union nations to phase out tobacco ads by October 2006.
	   Wallonia, Belgium's depressed southern region, has claimed that
the loss of the Belgian Grand Prix would have serious economic
consequences for the Spa region, which draws an estimated dlrs 30
million from the Formula One weekend alone.
	   The Belgian Grand Prix has long been a favorite among drivers,
who love the daring curves and natural scenery around the 6.9
kilometer (4.3 mile) track that cuts through the hills and woods of
the Ardennes.
	   Wednesday's move however is bound to worsen relations between
the Dutch-speaking Flemings and the francophone Walloons. Elections
are set for June 13 next year and the parties, all split along
linguistic lines, have increasingly stressed the political language
divide.

Controversial Russian tycoon calls for ban of Communists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A business tycoon appealed Wednesday for a ban on
the Communist Party, going so far as to say that force should be
used if need be to prevent lawmakers from making anti-Semitic
remarks.
	   ``The later they use force the more blood that will be shed,''
said Boris Berezovsky, who is Jewish.
	   His comments came a day after top Communist lawmaker Viktor
Ilyukhin accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the country.
	   At impeachment hearings Tuesday against President Boris Yeltsin,
Ilyukhin also said Russia's post-Soviet collapse would not have
happened if the government was not made up ``exclusively of one
group, the Jews.''
	   Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of Jews in
prominent positions, but they have always been outnumbered by
ethnic Russians.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, made similar
anti-Semitic remarks at a Moscow rally in October. Berezovsky
demanded the Communist Party be disbanded at that time as well.
	   ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock,
and not in the Duma,'' the Interfax new agency quoted Berezovsky as
saying.
	   Top Russian officials also criticized Ilyukhin.
	   The Duma ``must rigorously curb such statements or else it will
utterly discredit itself,'' Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin
said.
	   Members of the liberal Yabloko faction proposed a resolution
denouncing Ilyukhin's statement, but parliament did not immediately
act.
	   Unrepentant, Ilyukhin responded to the motion by accusing
liberals of inflaming anti-Semitism in Russia.
	   ``What kind of democracy is it when a Russian man can't speak
the truth?'' he said Wednesday.
	   Other Communists demanded that Russian television networks be
banned from covering the Duma's activities, saying coverage of
Ilyukhin's remarks was biased against him.
	   The business daily Kommersant speculated Wednesday that Ilyukhin
made the statements to provoke the Kremlin into trying to ban the
Communist Party.
	   ``That would strengthen the party's image as the main opposition
force,'' the newspaper said.
	   Yeltsin banned the Communist Party for one year in the early
1990s, but it quickly rebounded as the country's leading opposition
group and now has the largest faction in parliament's lower house,
the State Duma.
	   The Communists and Berezovsky have never been on good terms.
Many Communists believe Berezovsky, one of the country's richest
and most powerful businessmen, symbolizes the wild, unrestrained
capitalism that has emerged in post-Soviet Russia.
	   The Communists have also demanded that Berezovsky step down from
his post as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, a loose grouping of 12 ex-Soviet republics.

quote. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Prosecutors notified Antonio Matarrese, a UEFA vice
president and former head of the Italian soccer federation, on
Wednesday that he is being investigated in connection with a probe
into the use of performance-enhancing substances in Italian soccer.
	   The formal notice of investigation _ for allegedly playing a
role in hiding positive drug tests to help clubs or players _
arrived at Italian soccer federation headquarters just hours before
an exhibition match commemorating the federation's centennial, the
ANSA news agency reported.
	   ``I respect the magistrature but when I see things like this I
don't know what to think. I don't see where the crime is,''
Matarrese said. ``I don't understand what's happening, I feel like
I'm dreaming.''
	   Matarrese resigned as head of the federation following Italy's
poor showing at the 1996 European Championships.
	   He is the latest in a series of top sports officials to be drawn
into the the doping scandal that broke during the summer and has
led to the resignation of Italian Olympic Committee President Mario
Pescante and the closing of the country's drug-testing laboratory.
	   The Acqua Acetosa lab was shut down in October after it was hit
by allegations of improper handling of soccer doping tests and
hiding positive results.

Fate of hunger-striking kidnappers in hands of president says their

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Eight prisoners, convicted in the 1989
kidnapping of a supermarket magnate, plan to continue their
monthlong hunger strike, despite a court ruling Tuesday reducing
their sentences.
	   A Sao Paulo court on Tuesday reduced the kidnappers' sentences
to between 15 and 18 years from 26 to 28 years, meaning they could
be granted parole as early as February.
	   But after going 31 days without eating, the five Chileans, two
Argentines and one Brazilian are determined to continue fasting
until the government releases them, their attorney, Ibere Bandeira
de Mello said.
	   ``They consider themselves political prisoners, and as such are
demanding expulsion for the foreigners and a pardon for the
Brazilian,'' Mello said.
	   The government has said it would not give in to the prisoners'
demands.
	   The prisoners were convicted in the 1989 kidnapping of
supermarket magnate Abilio Diniz. Police freed him six days later,
unharmed.
	   Canadians David Lamont and Christine Spencer, who were also
convicted in connection with the kidnapping, were transferred to a
Vancouver prison on Nov. 20. The sentence reduction is expected to
speed their release, by making them eligible for parole earlier.
	   However, Sao Paulo Judge Otavio Augusto Machado do Barros said
that early release for those still held in Brazil would depend on a
number of factors including their behavior while in prison.
	   ``They are not automatically entitled to anything,'' he said.
	   The hunger-strikers are receiving sodium and potassium to ward
off heart failure and convulsions. They have each lost about 11
kilos (24 pounds) since their water-only fast began on Nov. 16.
	   The kidnappers backed off a threat to stop drinking water
Wednesday, after a plea by leftist leader Luis Inacio Lula da
Silva, who said he would try to negotiate a solution with the
government.
	   ``Everything depends on the president's political sensitivity,''
Lula said. ``I believe he is capable of a humanitarian act.''
	   The hunger strikers are: Ulisses Acervedo, Maria Marchi Badilla,
Pedro Lembach, Sergio Urtubia and Hector Ramon Tapia of Chile;
Humberto and Horacio Paz of Argentina; and Brazilian Raimundo
Freire.

	   SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) _ Sonoma County supervisors approved
plans designed to nearly double the amount of water taken from the
Russian River for urban use.
	   The 4-1 vote Tuesday came despite the possibility state and
federal officials will restrict water diversions.
	   The supervisors said the plan is needed to secure enough water
for expected population growth in Sonoma and northern Marin
counties.
	   State and federal officials want to restrict water diversions in
the 1,485-square-mile Russian River watershed to improve habitat
for steelhead trout and coho salmon, both on the threatened list.
	   ``We're just starting the environmental process here, not
finishing it,'' said Supervisor Mike Cale. ``But in order to begin
the process, we've got to have a project that can be evaluated.''

	   VALGARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Fritz Strobl led Austrian teammate
Roland Assinger by eight hundredths of a second Wednesday in the
opening practice for back-to-back World Cup downhill races in this
north Italian valley.
	   Swiss Ambrosi Hoffmann was a surprising third, 0.15 behind.
	   Strobl completed the 3,495-meter long, icy Saslong course in two
minutes, 9.15 seconds.
	   The Austrian was the first skier to come down following a
temporary suspension of the runs due to an accident which involved
Canadian Ed Podivinsky.
	   Podivinsky, an Olympic bronze medalist in 1994, tore his left
knee anterior cruciate ligament - a potentially season-ending
injury - when he landed on a bump following a long jump.
	   Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier of France came in
ninth, 0.93 behind.
	   Norway's Lasse Kjus, winner of the first downhill of the season
at Val D'Isere last Saturday, finished 14th in practice, 1.25
sconds slower than Strobl.
	   Defending World Cup champion Hermann Maier was a distant 36th,
with a gap of 3.04 seconds.
	   The second and last practice run is scheduled Thursday.
	   Friday's downhill makes up for the season opener cancelled in
Whistler Mountain, Canada, due to bad weather earlier this month.
	   Saturday's race is the original Val Gardena downhill, the third
of the season.
	   Top-10 finishers in practice:
	   1, Fritz Strobl, Austria, 2:09.15.
	   2, Roland Assinger, Austria, 2:09.23.
	   3, Ambrosi Hoffmann, Switzerland, 2:09.30.
	   4, Kjetil Andre Aamodt, Norway, 2:09.62.
	   5, Frederic Marin-Cudraz, France, 2:09.80.

	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Austria's Renate Goetschl
consolidated her standing as the leader on the Women's World Cup
downhill circuit Wednesday, posting the fastest time in a training
session for this weekend's pair of races.
	   Goetschl, winner of both downhills this season, completed the
course in 1 minute, 43.47 seconds, a commanding .68 seconds ahead
of of runner-up Ingeborg Helen Marken of Norway.
	   Italy's Isolde Kostner, second behind Goetschl in both downhills
in Lake Louise, Canada, posted the third-fastest time of 1:44.45.
	   Olympic silver medallist and 1997 overall World Cup champion
Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden was fourth in 1:44.57, ahead of France's
Regine Cavagnoud, fifth in 1:44.77.
	   World Cup overall leader Alexandra Meissnitzer of Austria, who
has won four of the 10 women's races since the start of the season,
finished seventh, 1.53 back.
	   The women will compete in downhills on Friday and Saturday,
before racing in Sunday's slalom, which also counts towards a
combined event.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors abruptly left
Baghdad Wednesday in a convoy of buses and cars, setting the stage
for U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting
to discuss the crisis that unfolded rapidly after chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler ordered his monitors out, accusing Iraq of
obstructing their search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   While there was no panic on the streets of Baghdad, it was clear
that President Saddam Hussein's government was readying for an
attack.
	   A special joint meeting of the decision-making Revolutionary
Command Council and the ruling Baath Party issued a statement,
saying Iraqis can ``depend on God to knock the dreams out of ...
(the) empty heads'' of Britain and the United States.
	   But Saddam also took steps to preserve his power in case the
strikes erode his authority and open the way for a civil uprising:
he divided the country into four military commands and gave their
control to trusted aides.
	   Any strike, if and when it comes, will be from the Gulf where
the United States has 24,100 military men and women.
	   There are also 22 warships, including eight with Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and 201 aircraft, including 72 on the aircraft carrier
USS Enterprise. Britain has 22 strike aircraft in the region.
	   A top U.S. military official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the strike will be either Wednesday or Thursday.
	   Another defense official said: ``We are in an execute mode.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the attack will come
quickly and without warning. And Prime Minister Tony Blair told
Parliament that any attack would have the ``necessary legal
force.'' Lawmakers murmured ``Hear! Hear!.''
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast and played
patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos training with
machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.
	   Earlier Wednesday, three trucks loaded with luggage left the
U.N. headquarters in Baghdad. About a half-hour later, three
busloads of weapons inspectors also left the U.N. compound,
followed by four white U.N. cars carrying spare tires on top.
	   Most of the 140 inspectors, who work for the United Nations
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, flew aboard a special U.N. plane
from an airbase outside Baghdad to the Gulf state of Bahrain.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain.
``There is nobody left behind.''
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is monitoring
Iraq's compliance on dismantling its nuclear program, also withdrew
its staff from Baghdad. UNSCOM is responsible for eliminating
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until these weapons are destroyed, the United Nations will lift
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Iraq says it has complied with every U.N. demand, and accuses
Butler of prolonging the inspections at the behest of the United
States.
	   On Tuesday, Butler gave a report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in which he said Iraq's claim to be free of banned weapons
``cannot be accepted without further verification.''
	   But verification is impossible as Iraq is obstructing, evading
and thwarting the inspectors, he said.
	   Butler cited the inspectors' inability to enter the headquarters
of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid evidence of the
presence of proscribed materials.''
	   At two other sites, one building had been emptied of relevant
materials, and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any
disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said.
	   Butler also disputed Iraq's claim that documents on its weapons
programs no longer exist or have been destroyed.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed Butler's report
as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to trigger an
American and British military strike on Iraq.''
	   At an emergency meeting, the U.N. Security Council discussed the
report for 90 minutes and agreed to resume consultations.
	   Russia, France and China _ traditional Iraq allies _ were angry
that Butler did not consult the council before ordering the
evacuation.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov earlier accused Butler of
overstepping his authority. Russia has consistently opposed
military action against Iraq.
	   The U.S. military build up in the Gulf began in August and
continued through October when Iraq suspended all cooperation with
UNSCOM.
	   To retaliate, the United States nearly attacked Iraq on Nov. 14
but President Bill Clinton ordered a stand down at the eleventh
hour to give Iraq another chance to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   While all weapons inspectors have left, no decision has been
made on on withdrawing the 400 U.N. humanitarian monitors from
Iraq, U.N. spokesman George Somerwill said in Baghdad.

	   PARIS (AP) _ When the Monica Lewinsky scandal first broke,
bemused Europeans saw the whole thing as a silly _ and somewhat
alarming _ show of American puritanism at its worst.
	   But nobody thought it would go as far as it has. Europeans now
find it hard to believe that impeachment of President Bill Clinton
is a distinct possibility.
	   ``People thought everything was OK once the Democrats did well
in November,'' said Philippe Labro, a novelist and head of France's
biggest radio network, RTL.
	   ``They didn't know this big machine _ the House Judiciary
Committee _ was rolling onwards. They haven't paid attention, and
that's too bad, because soon we're going to hear that Clinton has
been impeached.''
	   On Paris streets Wednesday, nobody questioned was aware of the
planned vote Thursday in the House of Representatives. But
Parisians were unanimous in their disgust at the idea of
impeachment.
	   ``Fortunately for politicians in France, we don't sue them every
time they have an affair,'' said secretary Chrystelle Gibaut, 26.
``We would have plenty of them in the same sad situation.''
	   Olivier Sarfati, a 34-year-old lawyer, said the whole affair was
a purely political attack on Clinton.
	   ``All of this is very sad not only for America, but for the
image of democracy in the world,'' he said.
	   Jean Louis Grimal, a 54-year-old newspaper vendor, agreed. ``It
is stupid,'' Grimal said. ``They are confusing family issues with
politics. Appalling.''
	   None of France's major newspapers had an editorial on the
subject Wednesday. They've all been focused on something closer to
home: the bitter feud diving the far-right National Front.
	   ``We don't really understand the U.S. legal procedures,'' said
Erik Izraelewicz, in charge of editorials at Le Monde. ``But if the
Senate won't remove the president from office, then what is the
significance of this House vote?''
	   In most European countries, a leader would be felled by a
parliamentary motion like a vote of no confidence, part of the
normal political system.
	   In France, a prime minister can be kicked out by parliament _ it
happened in 1962 to Georges Pompidou, for his policies, but he was
later reinstated. For a president, though, the procedure is much
more complicated, and it hasn't happened in modern France, where
the president is generally regarded as untouchable.
	   In Russia, the proceedings also got little attention. President
Boris Yeltsin's foes in parliament are trying to impeach him for
the Chechnya war and Russia's devastating economic decline, which
many Russians find more upsetting than Clinton's actions.
	   ``Americans have lost their minds,'' said Leila Pasenkova, a
31-year-old leather trader in Moscow. ``Of course he did something
wrong but this punishment is worse than the crime.
	   ``Besides, I like Clinton. He's charismatic. He hasn't done to
America what Yeltsin has done to Russia.''
	   In Rome, fabric store owner Romolo Ciabattomi said, ``We are all
sinners.
	   ``If we were punished for every little sin we commit, then the
whole world would be in big trouble.''

Russia opposes force against Iraq, foreign minister says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Russia opposes attacks against Iraq to try
to make it cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors, Russia's Foreign
Minister said Wednesday in Madrid.
	   Igor Ivanov said a military intervention would not force Iraq to
dismantle its banned weapons program.
	   ``We think that the fulfillment of these resolutions is only
possible through the action of the Security Council,'' Ivanov said.
He said a military strike would only further aggravate the
situation in the Middle East.
	   Ivanov, who is in Spain on an official visit after attending the
Bosnia Peace Implementation Council Tuesday and Wednesday, said he
already had informed U.S Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine, about Russia's position.
	   Chief inspector Richard Butler ordered all staff from the U.N.
Special Commission, and the International Atomic Energy Agency to
leave Baghdad overnight after reporting that Iraq failed to
cooperate fully with U.N. monitors.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's full compliance with the inspectors, who
are trying to verify Iraq's disarmament.
	   Ivanov accused Butler of overstepping his authority by not
consulting the Security Council before the pullout.
	   ``He cannot act on one side,'' Ivanov said.
	   He said Russia will do all what it can to avoid the use of the
force.
	   Ivanov was scheduled to meet his Spanish counterpart Abel
Matutes on Thursday.

Ukraine's parliament grants tax breaks for completion of nuclear

reactors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament voted Wednesday to
give tax breaks to companies financing the completion of two
nuclear reactors that are to compensate for the planned closure of
the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
	   Lawmakers approved the first reading of a bill that would grant
a three-year exemption from profit taxes to the funds allocated for
the reactors at the Khmelnytsky and Rivne nuclear power plants.
	   Ukraine wants the reactors to compensate for the loss of the
Chernobyl nuclear plant, the site of the world's worst nuclear
accident in 1986.
	   The government has pledged to shut down Chernobyl by 2000, but
also has warned repeatedly that it would postpone the closure until
the two reactors are finished.
	   The reactors at Rivne and Khmelnytsky are 80 percent completed
and the bill on tax breaks would allow them to be finished within
two years, said Oleh Panasovsky of parliament's nuclear safety
committee.
	   Construction on the reactors was halted after the 1991 Soviet
collapse, first because of a lack of funds and later because of a
parliamentary moratorium on the construction of new nuclear
facilities.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear plants account for nearly half the
country's electricity production.
	   The government's decision to complete the reactors has prompted
numerous protests from environmental groups in Ukraine and
neighboring countries, but they have yielded little result.

Netanyahu will call elections if he fails to get peace mandate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
promised Wednesday to take his peace policies to the electorate if
he fails in an improbable bid next week to garner enough support in
parliament.
	   Palestinians were furious with Netanyahu, describing the move as
``dangerous.'' An elections campaign would delay for months the
implementation of the accords brokered by U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Wye, Maryland, in October.
	   Describing the next stage of negotiations with the Palestinians
as ``crucial,'' Netanyahu outlined his conditions for lifting a
freeze he has imposed on further territorial withdrawals: swearing
off incitement to violence; rounding up illegally-held weapons;
reducing the Palestinian police force; and backing off declared
aspirations to statehood or to a presence in Jerusalem.
	   ``I intend to bring these decisions before members of the
Knesset on Monday,'' Netanyahu said in a speech broadcast live on
all media from his Likud party headquarters in Tel Aviv.
	   ``If the majority won't be found to do this I will initiate
early elections in order to receive from the nation the mandate
necessary to achieve a genuine peace,'' he said.
	   Saeb Erekat, the top Palestinian negotiator, described the move
as likely to ``have very dangerous effects on the peace process.''
	   ``What emerged in Netanyahu's speech is a freeze of the peace
process,'' said Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator. ``He
knows very well that the Palestinian side has fulfilled all its
commitments.
	   Netanyahu called for the support of the opposition Labor party.
although he stopped short of inviting them into a national unity
government _ instead, apparently hoping for the support from
outside government.
	   Labor leader Ehud Barak ridiculed Netanyahu's offer.
	   ``Netanyahu has decided to give in to extremism,'' Barak told
Channel Two news. ``We're going to elections.''
	   Netanyahu also lacked the necessary support on his right to
survive in parliament, where he faces a no-confidence vote on
Monday.
	   Hard-liners, who are loathe to cede further territory to the
Palestinians, say they no longer believe Netanyahu when he promises
not to make any further concessions.
	   Netanyahu was applauded by the Likud faithful as he swore not to
give up further territory unless the Palestinians met his
conditions.
	   ``These are the correct principles which are needed for the
state of Israel, to ensure its future,'' he said. ``It is necessary
to unite most of the (political) forces behind them.''
	   He accused hard-liners of wanting to ``rip up Oslo and Wye.''
The Oslo peace agreement was negotiated by Israel in 1993.
	   Barak was already preparing for elections _ he was dining with
top U.S. political consultants as Netanyahu spoke _ and it seemed
as if Netanyahu's Likud was also resigned to the likelihood of a
vote.
	   ``We've reached a situation in which we have no choice, and it's
better to do it of our own initiative,'' Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon told the Likud gathering.
	   Elections would occupy the country for months. If Netanyahu
resigns, or if he loses the no-confidence vote, the elections
deadline would be 60 days.
	   A Netanyahu aide, David Bar-Illan, said that it was more likely
Netanyahu would set an elections date sometime later than that,
after consulting with Barak.

Ukraine's parliament grants tax breaks for completion of nuclear
</HEADLINE>
reactors &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament voted Wednesday to
give tax breaks to companies financing the completion of two
nuclear reactors that are to compensate for the planned closure of
the Chernobyl nuclear plant.
	   Lawmakers approved the first reading of a bill that would grant
a three-year exemption from profit taxes to the funds allocated for
the reactors at the Khmelnytsky and Rivne nuclear power plants.
	   Ukraine wants the reactors to compensate for the loss of the
Chernobyl nuclear plant, the site of the world's worst nuclear
accident in 1986.
	   The government has pledged to shut down Chernobyl by 2000, but
also has warned repeatedly that it would postpone the closure until
the two reactors are finished.
	   The reactors at Rivne and Khmelnytsky are 80 percent completed

Argentina and Chile resolve their final border dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The presidents of Argentina and
Chile signed an accord on Wednesday ending the final border dispute
between the two Andean countries.
	   The agreement centers around carving up a glacier area known as
the Southern Glaciers Field along the Andes Mountains, which divide
the two countries.
	   The plan still needs congressional approval in Argentina and
Chile.
	   At the signing ceremony, both presidents talked of the improving
relations between the two neighboring South American countries.
	   Putting the final of a series of border conflicts behind them
was seen as helping the countries enter a new ``era of peace,'' the
presidents have said.
	   Long suspicious of one another, Chile and Argentina nearly went
to war in 1978 over the Beagle Channel at the tip of Tierra del
Fuego.
	   The signing came as Chilean President Eduardo Frei was wrapping
up a two-day state visit to Argentina.

Russia's Lebed says he may run for president if country needs him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Former national security chief and regional
governor Alexander Lebed said he would run for president of Russia
in 2000 if he feels the country needs him, according to an
interview published Wednesday.
	   Lebed, who came in third in Russia's 1996 election, has said he
would not run unless he solves the problems of the Siberian region
of Krasnoyarsk, where he was elected governor in May.
	   So far, Lebed has reported no breakthroughs, and Russia's
economic crisis has made Krasnoyarsk even worse off, together with
the rest of the country.
	   But in an interview with the Krasnoyarsky Rabochy newspaper,
Lebed said he might run for president if the country needs him.
	   That might happen ``when there is a general scuffle in the
country, when conflicts flare up,'' the retired general added. The
interview was cited by the Interfax news agency.
	   However, Lebed still said ``it would be ridiculous to go to the
election without having established at least an elementary order in
the (Krasnoyarsk) territory.''
	   Lebed has criticized both the Communists and President Boris
Yeltsin, whom he accused of bringing Russia to ruin.
	   It is unclear what Lebed would do to improve the situation if he
were elected president in the next elections, scheduled for 2000.
He has released no comprehensive program and claims no expertise in
the economy, promising only to ``bring order'' to Russia.

Iran releases 196 Iraqi POWs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iran on Wednesday released 196 Iraqi and 16
non-Iraqi soldiers captured during the 1980-88 war, the
International Committee of the Red Cross said.
	   The ICRC said in a statement that the remains of one Iraqi POW
was also handed over to Iraq during the prisoners' release at the
Khosrawi-Mundharieh checkpoint on the Iranian-Iraqi border.
	   It did not identity the 16 non-Iraqi POWs, but many Egyptians
and Palestinians living in Iraq had volunteered to fight for Iraq
in the war.
	   ICRC delegates ensured in private interviews with all the POWs,
that ``they were returning to Iraq at their own free will,'' the
statement said.
	   In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three
POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees. It was
the largest repatriation of Iranian and Iraqi prisoners since 1990.
	   The war, which killed or wounded at least 1 million people from
both sides, ended with a U.N. brokered cease-fire but animosity has
persisted over the issue of prisoners.

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Fritz Strobl led Austrian teammate
Roland Assinger by eight hundredths of a second Wednesday in the
opening practice for consecutive World Cup downhill races in this
north Italian valley.
	   Swiss Ambrosi Hoffmann was a surprising third, 0.15 of a second
behind.
	   Strobl completed the 3,495-meter, icy Saslong course in two
minutes, 9.15 seconds.
	   The Austrian was the first skier down the course after a
temporary suspension of training due to an accident involving
Canadian Ed Podivinsky.
	   Podivinsky, an Olympic bronze medalist in 1994, tore his left
knee anterior cruciate ligament _ a potentially season-ending
injury _ when he landed on a bump following a long jump.
	   All of the 10 lead times were within a second of each other.
	   Norway's Lasse Kjus, winner of the first downhill of the season
at Val D'Isere last Saturday, finished 14th, 1.25 sconds slower
than Strobl.
	   Defending World Cup champion Hermann Maier was a distant 36th,
3.04 seconds behind.
	   The second and last practice run is scheduled for Thursday.
	   Friday's downhill makes up for the season opener that was
cancelled in Whistler Mountain, Canada, due to bad weather earlier
this month.
	   Saturday's race is the original Val Gardena downhill, the third
of the season.

Schroeder tells skeptical eastern Germans he'll listen to their

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ With his September election victory,
Gerhard Schroeder inherited one of Germany's most sensitive
problems: the economic and emotional gap between the west and the
formerly communist east.
	   Yet westerner Schroeder was widely perceived as having shown
little interest in the east's economic collapse in the years that
followed its 1990 merger with the west.
	   Now that he's chancellor, Schroeder is courting skeptical
easterners, telling them he wants to listen. Swooping into this
eastern city Wednesday, he opened a dialogue with area political
leaders that is designed to provide a new forum for tackling the
east's woes.
	   To show he's serious, Schroeder brought along most of his
Cabinet for talks with Saxony governor Kurt Biedenkopf, whose area
leads the four other eastern states in closing the gap with richer
western Germany. Regular meetings with other eastern state leaders
are to follow.
	   Though both sides announced no new initiatives to fight
unemployment _ the No. 1 problem _ the two-hour get-together sent a
clear signal.
	   ``One extremely important result was that the meeting happened
at all,'' Biedenkopf said afterwards. ``This signals a change in
the priority for rebuilding the east.''
	   Schroeder said he wants to hear about ``the practical worries
and troubles'' of the east.
	   They are many: unemployment is nearly twice that in the rest of
the country, and those who have jobs make less on average than
their western counterparts.
	   Yet Schroeder's bid to reach out to eastern Germans, who make up
about a fifth of the population, is also part of a historic
eastward shift of the nation's center of gravity brought on by
unification.
	   Next fall, with the government's move from Bonn in the west,
Schroeder will be governing a united Germany from Berlin for the
first time since the Nazi defeat in World War II. He's already
holding Cabinet meetings once a month in Berlin.
	   In his inaugural address last month, Schroeder pledged to hold
special Cabinet sessions in the east every two months. He has also
appointed a minister for eastern German affairs.
	   Eastern Germans helped lift Schroeder and his Social Democrats
into power by turning against Helmut Kohl in the elections, their
gratitude for the chancellor who united Germany worn out.
	   But a poll published last week by the Leipziger Volkszeitung
newspaper showed barely half of all easterners think the 7-week-old
center-left government is doing a good job.
	   Schroeder still has to convince easterners he's not another
politician who promises jobs but doesn't deliver.
	   ``Usually they just visit and afterwards nothing happens,'' said
travel agency employee Astrid Brueckner, strolling through
Dresden's brightly lit Christmas market. ``Schroeder certainly
doesn't have much of a relationship with the east yet.''
	   Some of the government's early initiatives have drawn sharp
criticism in the east, such as a planned increase in energy taxes.
Eastern leaders are calling for a waiver, saying the hike would
threaten the region's fragile new industrial base.
	   And Biedenkopf failed to win a pledge from Schroeder to speed up
plans for an autobahn from Dresden to the Czech border that is seen
as a key infrastructure project.
	   Postal office employee Elise Oelschner, 49, said she doesn't
want to get her hopes up for Schroeder's four-year term.
	   ``I wonder whether he can keep his promises,'' she said. ``Let's
wait and see.''

Barilla cancels contract with U.S. company over anti-Italian spot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Deeming offensive a spot broadcast on Turkish
television showing a plate of spaghetti covered with blood, Italian
pasta maker Barilla has canceled a contract with the U.S.
advertising agency which it holds responsible for the commercial.
	   ``Not only was the spot tasteless, but it also damaged us as
pasta makers,'' Barilla spokesman Armando Marchi told The
Associated Press on Wednesday.
	   The spot was produced by a Turkish cellular phone company called
Telsim, which is a client of the Turkish affiliate of the American
company Grey International.
	   Grey International has produced Barilla's advertising in the
United States, as well as in Latin America and Asia.
	   ``It was a difficult and delicate decision, made to protect our
business and the made-in-Italy label in general,'' Marchi said.
	   The spot showed blood streaming down the screen, over a backdrop
of dead babies, over a Kurdish rebel leader inspecting his troops
and finally over a plate of spaghetti. Broadcast last month on a
Turkish station owned by Telsim's parent company, it was then
picked up by other Turkish and Italian TV stations.
	   The spot was aimed at protesting Italy's refusal to extradite
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. He has led a 14-year
insurgency in southeastern Turkey and the Ankara government
considers him a terrorist.
	   Grey's President for Europe, John Shannon, claimed that
Cenajans-Grey, the Turkish affiliate, had only a scant connection.
	   It only got a call by a Telsim official who was working on the
ad, Shannon said in a written statement, and gave the advise ``not
to overdo the horror.''
	   ``We believe that Grey is an unlucky victim, unwittingly drawn
into a highly emotional dispute between government and business
interests in Turkey and Italy,'' Shannon said.
	   In an interview with the Rome newspaper La Repubblica published
Wednesday, Barilla president Guido Barilla said the company
``cannot keep working with an agency which lends itself to this
game.''
	   Barilla, one of Italy's most popular brands, controls 8 percent
of the American market. It has recently opened a factory in Ames,
Iowa.

Finnish forensic experts leave Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Finnish forensic team that
intended to examine possible war crimes sites in Kosovo, started
leaving the province Wednesday after being blocked from carrying
out exhumations.
	   Juha Ottman, spokesman for the group, said some members of the
team left Wednesday while others would leave by next Monday.
	   The move came after Serbian police blocked the team from
reaching a site of an alleged massacre of ethnic Albanians. The
police insisted they accompany the Finns into an area held by
Albanian rebels, banning the experts from going without police
escort.
	   Ottman said negotiations with the Serbian authorities have not
been able to break the impasse. But he said the Finnish team had
not given up hope they would carry out digging at the sites where
suspected massacre victims are buried.
	   A Serb forensic expert, Slavisa Dobricanin, told Tanjug news
agency his Finnish collegues had examined bones found in an alleged
massacre site of Serb civilians.

Netanyahu will call elections if he fails to get peace mandate

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
promised Wednesday to take his peace policies to the electorate if
he fails in an improbable bid next week to garner enough support
for his proposals in parliament.
	   Palestinians were furious with Netanyahu, describing the move as
``dangerous.'' An elections campaign would delay for months the
implementation of the accords brokered by U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Wye, Maryland, in October.
	   Describing the next, final settlement stage of negotiations with
the Palestinians as ``crucial,'' Netanyahu outlined his conditions
for lifting a freeze he has imposed on further territorial
withdrawal.
	   He said he wanted a swearing off incitement to violence; a
round-up of illegally-held weapons; a reduction in the Palestinian
police force; and an end to declared aspirations to statehood or to
a presence in Jerusalem.
	   ``I intend to bring these decisions before members of the
Knesset on Monday,'' Netanyahu said in a speech broadcast live on
all media from his Likud party headquarters in Tel Aviv.
	   ``If the majority won't be found to do this I will initiate
early elections in order to receive from the nation the mandate
necessary to achieve a genuine peace,'' he said.
	   Saeb Erekat, the top Palestinian negotiator, described the move
as likely to ``have very dangerous effects on the peace process.''
	   ``What emerged in Netanyahu's speech is a freeze of the peace
process,'' said Erekat. ``He knows very well that the Palestinian
side has fulfilled all its commitments.''
	   Clinton was in the region for three days this week to try and
salvage Wye. His apparent failure frustrated the president and
increased U.S.-Israel tensions.
	   Netanyahu called for the support of the opposition Labor party.
although he stopped short of inviting them into a national unity
government _ instead, apparently hoping for the support from
outside government.
	   Labor leader Ehud Barak ridiculed Netanyahu's offer.
	   ``Netanyahu has decided to give in to extremism,'' Barak told
Channel Two news. ``We're going to elections.''
	   Netanyahu also lacked the necessary support on his right to
survive in parliament, where he faces a no-confidence vote on
Monday.
	   Hard-liners, who are loathe to cede further territory to the
Palestinians, say they no longer believe Netanyahu when he promises
not to make any further concessions.
	   Netanyahu was applauded by the Likud faithful as he swore not to
give up further territory unless the Palestinians met his
conditions.
	   ``These are the correct principles which are needed for the
state of Israel, to ensure its future,'' he said. ``It is necessary
to unite most of the (political) forces behind them.''
	   He accused hard-liners of wanting to ``rip up Oslo and Wye.''
The Oslo peace agreement was negotiated by Israel in 1993.
	   Barak was already preparing for elections _ he was dining with
top U.S. political consultants as Netanyahu spoke _ and it seemed
as if Netanyahu's Likud was also resigned to the likelihood of a
vote.
	   ``We've reached a situation in which we have no choice, and it's
better to do it of our own initiative,'' Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon told the Likud gathering.
	   Other issues loomed for Netanyahu: he has failed to pass a
budget this year, unemployment is relatively high, and his finance
minister _ seen as one of the most loyal members of his cabinet _
has just resigned.
	   In a scathing letter, Yaacov Neeman said he was leaving because
the paralysis occasioned by the crisis in the peace process.
	   ``These past few weeks have become a political race that have
distracted all our attention from the true issues and challenges
facing Israel,'' said Neeman, the second finance minister to go in
Netanyahu's 2 1/2 tenure.
	   Nonetheless, the public would likely vote on the peace process
in the elections, according to Joseph Alpher, a political analyst
with the American Jewish Committee.
	   ``It's the question of what will the different parties' approach
be to territorial questions, the broader question of final status
with the Palestinians, the fate of (Jewish) settlements and the
nature of the state,'' he said.
	   Another political scientist predicted that any ill will toward
Netanyahu _ for alienating the Americans, and for fumbling the
peace process _ could dissipate in the face of unease over the
Palestinians.
	   ``If we see (Palestinian) terrorism, if we see a lack of
Palestinian follow-through, continued incitement, it's not going to
help Barak,'' Gerald Steinberg of Bar-Ilan University said.
	   Elections would occupy the country for months. If Netanyahu
resigns, or if he loses the no-confidence vote, the elections would
be held in a minimum of 60 days.
	   A Netanyahu aide, David Bar-Illan, said that it was more likely
Netanyahu would set an elections date sometime later than that,
after consulting with Barak.

Russia replaces ambassador to United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin replaced Russia's
ambassador to the United States on Wednesday with a career diplomat
who has handled Russia's relations to the United Nations.
	   Yuli Vorontsov, the outgoing ambassador, is retiring, the
president's office said in a statement carried by Russian news
agencies.
	   Yeltsin signed a decree Wednesday replacing Vorontsov with Yuri
Ushakov, a deputy foreign minister.
	   Ushakov, 51, has worked for the Foreign Ministry since 1970, and
has worked on Russia's relations with the United Nations and other
international organs, the statement said.
	   No reason was given for the reshuffling, though Vorontsov, 68,
had been rumored to be on his way out. He had served in the post
since July 1994.
	   Earlier, he had served as Soviet ambassador to France, India and
Afghanistan, where he oversaw the withdrawal of Soviet troops in
1988-89. He also served as Soviet representative to the United
Nations.

U.N. Security Council calls emergency meeting on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Iraqi, Russian and Slovenian
ambassadors; Butler letter to the council president; updates with
new figures on inspectors leaving &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council held an
emergency meeting Wednesday to discuss chief inspector Richard
Butler's report that Iraq failed to cooperate fully with U.N.
monitors, which again raised the threat of U.S. and British
airstrikes.
	   ``It looks like the United States is determined to go for a
military strike regardless of what the Security Council membership
feel about it, and that's very bad,'' Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar
Hamdoon said.
	   ``We have done everything in our capacity,'' he said. ``I don't
think there is anything that Iraq could do to provide any new
options. It's up to the council now, up to the secretary-general to
do anything to prevent'' military strikes.
	   The council met for about 90 minutes and agreed to resume
consultations later Wednesday, clearly divided over the negative
tone of Butler's report and his unilateral decision to evacuate all
inspectors from Baghdad.
	   In his report Tuesday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Butler said Iraq's conduct over the past month ``ensured that no
progress was able to be made in either the fields of disarmament or
accounting for its prohibited weapons programs.''
	   Butler ordered all staff from the U.N. Special Commission, known
as UNSCOM which he heads, and the International Atomic Energy
Agency to leave Baghdad overnight. And Iraq's most vocal supporters
on the council _ Russia, France and China _ were angry that the
council wasn't consulted.
	   ``I was given to believe that I should act immediately,'' Butler
told reporters as he entered the council chamber. ``There was no
time. The secretary-general was consulted. I talked with him. He
agreed. I did what I had to do.''
	   But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused Butler of
overstepping his authority and Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey
Lavrov suggested that if the chief inspector couldn't do his work,
perhaps he should think about looking for a new job.
	   Butler also pulled the inspectors out of Baghdad during last
month's crisis with Iraq without consulting the Security Council.
``We are very much concerned about this issue,'' a Chinese diplomat
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Butler apparently made his decision late Tuesday night after
speaking to Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   Burleigh told him that the United States considered the report
``to be a very serious matter'' and had extended its program
allowing U.S. government personnel in the region to leave
voluntarily. Butler was told he ``might want to consider taking
whatever prudent measures he deemed appropriate,'' a U.S. diplomat
said.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's full compliance with the inspectors who
are trying to verify Iraq's disarmament _ a view reiterated by the
U.S. diplomat.
	   ``We believe we have the authority we need under previous
Security Council resolutions to act and all options are on the
table,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Russia and France, who called the council meeting, contend along
with China that the Security Council must sanction any military
action.
	   There was a sense at the council meeting that time was critical,
coupled with a frustration that the council would not be able to
influence what Washington and London decide to do.
	   ``Certainly there is a sense of urgency there,'' said Slovenia's
U.N. Ambassador Danilo Turk, who said the morning session was
devoted to preliminary discussions of Butler's decision to evacuate
the inspection team and his report.
	   The Chinese diplomat indicated that Beijing believes Butler's
report was too negative.
	   ``The report should be balanced because what we see is
sufficient cooperation has been extended to UNSCOM,'' the Chinese
diplomat said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Butler said Wednesday morning that he ordered all staff to leave
Baghdad because ``they are not able to do their work adequately.''
	   In a follow-up letter to the Security Council president, he said
his prime considerations in ordering the evacuation was ``to ensure
the safety and security of our personnel and, the need to act
immediately.''
	   ``Our personnel will remain in Bahrain for the immediate future,
pending further instructions,'' Butler said.
	   Ninety two staff members from UNSCOM and the IAEA flew to
Bahrain and 20 traveled by road to Amman, Jordan and arrived
safely, U.N. officials said.

Butler said Iraq's conduct over the past month ``ensured that no
progress was able to be made in either the fields of disarmament or
accounting for its prohibited weapons programs.''
	   Butler ordered all staff from the U.N. Special Commission, known
as UNSCOM which he heads, and the International Atomic Energy
Agency to leave Baghdad overnight. And Iraq's most vocal supporters
on the council _ Russia, France and China _ were angry that the
council wasn't consulted.
	   ``I was given to believe that I should act immediately,'' Butler
told reporters as he entered the council chamber. ``There was no
time. The secretary-general was consulted. I talked with him. He
agreed. I did what I had to do.''
	   But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov accused Butler of
overstepping his authority and Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey
Lavrov suggested that if the chief inspector couldn't do his work,
perhaps he should think about looking for a new job.
	   Butler also pulled the inspectors out of Baghdad during last
month's crisis with Iraq without consulting the Security Council.
``We are very much concerned about this issue,'' a Chinese diplomat
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Butler apparently made his decision late Tuesday night after
speaking to Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   Burleigh told him that the United States considered the report
``to be a very serious matter'' and had extended its program
allowing U.S. government personnel in the region to leave
voluntarily. Butler was told he ``might want to consider taking
whatever prudent measures he deemed appropriate,'' a U.S. diplomat
said.
	   Washington and London have said military strikes remain an
option to force Baghdad's full compliance with the inspectors who
are trying to verify Iraq's disarmament _ a view reiterated by the
U.S. diplomat.
	   ``We believe we have the authority we need under previous
Security Council resolutions to act and all options are on the
table,'' the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Russia and France, who called the council meeting, contend along
with China that the Security Council must sanction any military
action.
	   There was a sense at the council meeting that time was critical,
coupled with a frustration that the council would not be able to
influence what Washington and London decide to do.
	   ``Certainly there is a sense of urgency there,'' said Slovenia's
U.N. Ambassador Danilo Turk, who said the morning session was
devoted to preliminary discussions of Butler's decision to evacuate
the inspection team and his report.
	   The Chinese diplomat indicated that Beijing believes Butler's
report was too negative.
	   ``The report should be balanced because what we see is
sufficient cooperation has been extended to UNSCOM,'' the Chinese
diplomat said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Butler said Wednesday morning that he ordered all staff to leave
Baghdad because ``they are not able to do their work adequately.''
	   In a follow-up letter to the Security Council president, he said
his prime considerations in ordering the evacuation was ``to ensure
the safety and security of our personnel and, the need to act
immediately.''
	   ``Our personnel will remain in Bahrain for the immediate future,
pending further instructions,'' Butler said.
	   Ninety two staff members from UNSCOM and the IAEA flew to
Bahrain and 20 traveled by road to Amman, Jordan and arrived
safely, U.N. officials said.

U.S. senator talks Mideast peace with Assad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The chairman of the U.S. Senate's
intelligence committee held talks Wednesdays with Syrian President
Hafez Assad on the Mideast peace process.
	   Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, had accompanied
President Bill Clinton during his visit to Israel and Gaza earlier
this week.
	   Specter, who is Jewish, has shuttled between Israel and Syria
several times this year in an effort to broker peace in the region.
	   ``The talks ... tackled the situation in the (Middle East) area
in the light of the latest developments,'' presidential spokesman
Jubran Kourieh said without elaborating.
	   Syrian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since March 1996
and prospects for a renewal of negotiations deteriorated after
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June 1996.
	   Syria demands the return of the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau that Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. Netanyahu
says the heights are crucial to Israel's security.

Kabila arrives in Burkina Faso for OAU talks
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Congo's warring president,
Laurent Kabila, arrived Wednesday in Burkina Faso, where his
country's ongoing civil war and other African conflicts are to be
the primary focus of an Organization of African Unity summit.
	   Kabila's Congo is mired in a rebel war that began in August and
continues to rage in the country's east near the border with Rwanda
and Burundi.
	   A delegation from the rebel side also arrived in Ouagadougou on
Wednesday.
	   Kabila's participation in the two-day series of meetings
beginning Thursday comes on the heels of a report that his
government may be ready to sign a cease-fire agreement with the
rebels and their benefactors Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.
	   Congo's ambassador to Kenya earlier this week said a cease-fire
would be acceptable to the government if the terms included a clear
timeline for the withdrawal of hostile forces in Congo, Kenyan
radio reported.
	   Kabila maintains that the war is not a rebel uprising, but
rather foreign aggression by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, quickly became
a flashpoint for regional conflict with forces from Angola and
Zimbabwe lining up with Kabila. Rwanda and Uganda are supporting
the rebel movement.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Zimbabwe's President
Robert Mugabe are expected to arrive on Thursday for the OAU
meetings.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian military
government leader Abdulsalami Abubakar are also among top officials
expected to attend.
	   An earlier meeting to formalize the cease-fire was postponed,
placing greater emphasis on the OAU meeting, diplomats in Burkina
Faso said.
	   ``We're hoping to see some actual progress made during the
meetings,'' said a western diplomat who will be observing the
meetings. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Repeated efforts by South Africa, the United Nations and the OAU
have failed to curtail hostilities in Congo.
	   Heavy fighting was reported Wednesday in the southeastern
province of Katanga, although independent confirmation was not
immediately possible.
	   Rebel radio, meanwhile, claimed that a Zimbabwean helicopter and
MiG fighter jet had been shot down on Tuesday in Katanga province.
	   Despite talk of the growing role of the OAU as a forum for
conflict resolution, hostilities _ new and old _ have erupted in
recent months across the continent from Guinea-Bissau in the
northwest to Angola in the south and Congo in central Africa.
	   Heads of state attending the two-day summit will be discussing
these conflicts and the ongoing border dispute between Ethiopia and
Eritrea in the eastern Horn of Africa.

U.N. inspectors evacuate Baghdad, raising specter of U.S. attack

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors abruptly departed
Baghdad in a convoy of buses and cars Wednesday, accusing Iraq of
obstructing their search for the country's illegal weapons. Their
departure, without any notice, pointed at imminent U.S.-British air
strikes.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting
to discuss the crisis that unfolded rapidly after chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler ordered his monitors out.
	   While there was no panic on the streets of Baghdad, it was clear
that President Saddam Hussein's government was readying for an
attack.
	   A special joint meeting of the decision-making Revolutionary
Command Council and the ruling Baath Party issued a statement,
saying Iraqis can ``depend on God to knock the dreams out of ...
(the) empty heads'' of Britain and the United States.
	   But Saddam also took steps to preserve his power in case the
strikes erode his authority and open the way for a civil uprising:
he divided the country into four military commands and gave their
control to trusted aides.
	   Iraqi television interrupted its afternoon broadcast and played
patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos.
	   Any strike, if and when it comes, would be from the Gulf, where
the United States has 24,100 military men and women.
	   There are also 22 warships, including eight with Tomahawk cruise
missiles, and 201 aircraft, including 72 on the aircraft carrier
USS Enterprise. Britain has 22 strike aircraft in the region.
	   A top U.S. military official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the strike will be either Wednesday or Thursday.
	   Another defense official said: ``We are in an execute mode.''
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the attack will come
quickly and without warning. And Prime Minister Tony Blair told
Parliament that any attack would have the ``necessary legal
force.'' Lawmakers murmured ``Hear! Hear!''
	   Earlier Wednesday, three trucks loaded with luggage left the
U.N. headquarters in Baghdad. About a half-hour later, three
busloads of weapons inspectors also left the U.N. compound,
followed by four white U.N. cars carrying spare tires on top.
	   Most of the 140 inspectors, who work for the United Nations
Special Commission, or UNSCOM, flew aboard a special U.N. plane
from an airbase outside Baghdad to the Gulf state of Bahrain.
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is monitoring
Iraq's compliance on dismantling its nuclear program, also withdrew
its staff from Baghdad. UNSCOM is responsible for eliminating
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until these weapons are destroyed, the United Nations will lift
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Iraq says it has complied with every U.N. demand, and accuses
Butler of prolonging the inspections at the behest of the United
States.
	   On Tuesday, Butler gave a report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in which he said Iraq's claim to be free of banned weapons
``cannot be accepted without further verification.''
	   But verification is impossible because Iraq is obstructing,
evading and thwarting the inspectors, he said.
	   Butler cited the inspectors' inability to enter the headquarters
of the ruling Baath Party, where they had ``solid evidence of the
presence of proscribed materials.''
	   At two other sites, one building had been emptied of relevant
materials, and the other ``had been prepared to avoid any
disclosure of relevant materials,'' he said.
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz dismissed Butler's report
as ``full of lies'' and said it was ``intended to trigger an
American and British military strike on Iraq.''
	   At an emergency meeting, the U.N. Security Council discussed the
report for 90 minutes and agreed to resume consultations.
	   Russia, France and China _ traditional Iraq allies _ were angry
that Butler did not consult the council before ordering the
evacuation.
	   The U.S. military build up in the Gulf began in August and
continued through October when Iraq suspended all cooperation with
UNSCOM.
	   To retaliate, the United States nearly attacked Iraq on Nov. 14
but President Bill Clinton gave an order to stand down at the last
moment to give Iraq another chance to cooperate.
	   While all weapons inspectors have left, no decision has been
made on withdrawing the 400 U.N. humanitarian monitors from Iraq,
U.N. spokesman George Somerwill said in Baghdad.

Striking miners attack government building in eastern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ About 200 miners attacked a regional
government building in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday after months of
demonstrating in front of it to demand unpaid wages.
	   Police in the city of Luhansk managed to stop the miners after
they pushed down iron barriers in front of the building and
attempted to break inside.
	   Several cordons of policemen then blocked the entrance and were
still there Wednesday night, the independent UNIAN news agency
said.
	   The attack occurred two days after one of the protesting miners
set himself on fire and was rushed to a hospital with burns
covering half his body.
	   Another striking miner tried to set himself on fire Wednesday,
but was stopped before he ignited the gasoline he already had
poured over himself, the Independent Miners' Union said.
	   The miners have incessantly picketed the building since the
summer, living for months in tents in a city park. But they have
failed to get the 1.5 million hryvna (dlrs 437,000) owed them.
	   Luhansk authorities told the miners that the federal government
had already allocated the money to pay off the back wages, but
several hours of talks Wednesday with the miners' leaders failed to
persuade them to return to their home town of Krasnodon, UNIAN
said.
	   More than 20,000 coal workers were reported on strike at various
mines this week, part of a series of protests that have kept dozens
of Ukraine's 275 mines idled for months and followed similar
demonstrations in previous years.
	   Miners are owed more than 2 billion hryvna (dlrs 584 million) in
overdue salaries, and the debt has been increasing. Many of the
mines are unprofitable and the cash-strapped government lacks money
for wages and subsidies to support the industry.

Israel in a state of readiness in case of attack on Iraq

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to add that Israel is in a state of readiness, ADDS
comments by defense minister &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is closely watching growing tensions
between Iraq and the United States, Israel's defense minister said
Wednesday, and has readied its forces for a possible attack.
	   U.S. naval and air forces in the Gulf were ``in execute mode''
as President Bill Clinton met Wednesday with his top national
security advisers to consider military strikes in response to
Iraq's latest defiance of international arms inspectors.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said that five U.S.
patriot missile batteries dispatched to Israel last week stood
ready in case of an Iraqi attack, and that other U.S. defense
systems were ready to be dispatched to Israel very quickly if
needed.
	   ``We have readied our forces, and we will decide tonight on
steps (to take),'' Mordechai told reporters Wednesday night.
	   ``There is also our entire system of readiness that we would use
the moment there is information that an attack took place,''
Mordechai added, suggesting that Israel did not expect advance
warning of a U.S. attack on Iraq.
	   Iraq directed Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War,
although Israel was not a participant in the U.S.-led effort to
drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
	   Since that war, U.N. inspectors have sought to ensure that Iraq
had divested itself of a weapons-of-mass-destruction capability.
	   Failure to cooperate with the inspectors has precipitated
several near-attacks by U.S. and British forces on Iraq.
	   During such crises, Israelis have been placed on alert for a
possible chemical attack from Iraq.
	   Israel had not issued any special warnings to its citizens
Wednesday.

Regional lawmakers approve exemption for Belgian Grand Prix
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Wallonia's regional parliament on
Wednesday approved a controversial exemption to allow to tobacco
advertising at the Belgian Grand Prix Formula One race, despite
national legislation banning such ads starting Jan. 1.
	   The defiant move by the Walloon legislators is expected to set
off a legal battle over which legislature has authority in the
matter and is likely to further sour relations between Wallonia,
where the Spa-Francorchamps circuit is located, and Flanders, which
pushed hardest for the anti-tobacco legislation.
	   ``It is regrettable to take a decision like that when you don't
get your way at a national level,'' Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene said. ``Fortunately, it can be challenged by the court.''
	   The national anti-tobacco law will bar tobacco sponsors from
advertising at sports and cultural events, including the hugely
successful Belgian Grand Prix.
	   But Wallonia's Minister-President Robert Collignon has lobbied
hard to keep the race on the international Formula One calendar,
indicating a local exemption to the law could be obtained.
	   On Wednesday, the Walloon parliament approved such an exemption
by a 55-8 vote with one abstention. The environmentalist Ecolo
party was the only group to vote against.
	   ``It's a dangerous game,'' Dehaene said.
	   Tobacco sponsorship and advertising is one of Formula One's
biggest sponsors and a ban likely will force the International
Automobile Federation to drop the event from its schedule.
	   The Belgian anti-tobacco law goes beyond plans by the 15
European Union nations to phase out tobacco ads by October 2006.
	   Wallonia, Belgium's depressed southern region, has claimed that
the loss of the Belgian Grand Prix would have serious economic
consequences for the Spa region, which draws an estimated dlrs 30
million from the Formula One weekend alone.
	   The Belgian Grand Prix has long been a favorite among drivers,
who love the daring curves and natural scenery around the
6.9-kilometer (4.3-mile) track that cuts through the hills and
woods of the Ardennes.
	   Wednesday's move, however, is bound to worsen relations between
the Dutch-speaking Flemings and the francophone Walloons. Elections
are set for June 13 next year and the parties, all split along
linguistic lines, have increasingly stressed the political-language
divide.

Russian city torn between three mayors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Water, electricity or medical help may be in
erratic supply in Vladivostok, but one thing the Far Eastern city
has no shortage of is mayors.
	   By Wednesday, the city had three _ each insisting he was the
legitimate one.
	   Vladivostok has long been gripped by a bitter political feud
that has left the city in shambles. The city of 800,000 people,
located 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow, suffers from
periodic cuts of water, heat and electricity.
	   City services like public transport, emergency medical help and
trash removal are sometimes put on hold when feuding administrators
neglect to pay the bills.
	   The number of Vladivostok mayors has been multiplying since last
week, when President Boris Yeltsin ruled that Mayor Viktor
Cherepkov held his post illegally and dismissed him.
	   Yeltsin ordered regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko to appoint
an acting mayor. Nazdratenko brought in an ally, Yuri Kopylov.
	   The dismissed Cherepkov, meanwhile, argued that the decision to
sack him was illegal, and filed a suit against Yeltsin.
	   But to be on the safe side, Cherepkov also appointed his own
choice for acting mayor, Nikolai Beletsky.
	   Meanwhile, Cherepkov's supporters have holed up in the mayoral
building, and were physically blocking the competition from
entering.
	   A police battalion was called in Wednesday to surround the
building.
	   Police officials said the unit was summoned to prevent
disturbances and to make sure no documents were smuggled out of the
mayoral offices, Russia's RTR television reported. Police vowed not
to use force.
	   The political feud in Vladivostok goes back to 1994, when
Nazdratenko kicked Cherepkov from office on corruption charges.
Cherepkov fought back and camped out in his office, and Yeltsin
reinstated him as mayor in 1996 after courts found him innocent of
corruption.
	   Cherepkov's mayoral term ran out in July, and a court barred him
from seeking re-election. But voters rejected all candidates to
protest the decision, and the election was declared void.
	   The next mayoral election has been set for Jan. 17.

Russian city torn between three mayors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Water, electricity or medical help may be in
erratic supply in Vladivostok, but one thing the Far Eastern city
has no shortage of is mayors.
	   By Wednesday, the city had three _ each insisting he was the
legitimate one.
	   Vladivostok has long been gripped by a bitter political feud
that has left the city in shambles. The city of 800,000 people,
located 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) east of Moscow, suffers from
periodic cuts of water, heat and electricity.
	   City services like public transport, emergency medical help and
trash removal are sometimes put on hold when feuding administrators
neglect to pay the bills.
	   The number of Vladivostok mayors has been multiplying since last
week, when President Boris Yeltsin ruled that Mayor Viktor
Cherepkov held his post illegally and dismissed him.
	   Yeltsin ordered regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko to appoint
an acting mayor. Nazdratenko brought in an ally, Yuri Kopylov.
	   The dismissed Cherepkov, meanwhile, argued that the decision to
sack him was illegal, and filed a suit against Yeltsin.
	   But to be on the safe side, Cherepkov also appointed his own
choice for acting mayor, Nikolai Beletsky.
	   Meanwhile, Cherepkov's supporters have holed up in the mayoral
building, and were physically blocking the competition from
entering.
	   A police battalion was called in Wednesday to surround the
building.
	   Police officials said the unit was summoned to prevent
disturbances and to make sure no documents were smuggled out of the
mayoral offices, Russia's RTR television reported. Police vowed not
to use force.
	   The political feud in Vladivostok goes back to 1994, when
Nazdratenko kicked Cherepkov from office on corruption charges.
Cherepkov fought back and camped out in his office, and Yeltsin
reinstated him as mayor in 1996 after courts found him innocent of
corruption.
	   Cherepkov's mayoral term ran out in July, and a court barred him
from seeking re-election. But voters rejected all candidates to
protest the decision, and the election was declared void.
	   The next mayoral election has been set for Jan. 17.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A five-story apartment building crumbled like
sawdust Wednesday, killing at least 19 residents as they slept,
including a family dug out by hand by a relative who was among the
firemen who came to the rescue.
	   A dozen occupants were reported missing in the collapse, which
tentatively was blamed on structural problems.
	   Shouts of ``Alive! They're alive'' went up from rescuers and
onlookers some 12 hours after the collapse when a couple's cries of
help were heard. Apparently saved by a cross beam and pillows and
clothing which cushioned them, the man, Alberto Viola, 58, and his
wife, Luciana, 53, were found, bloodied and holding on to each
other, on a mattress.
	   Sleeping in their bedroom on the second floor, the survivors
were found at the level of what was the sub-basement of the
building in the middle-class Portuense neighborhood, a district in
southwest Rome, 6 kilometers (3 1/2 miles) from central Piazza
Venezia.
	   The discovery of the man, who suffered leg fractures, and the
woman, who was undergoing surgery for internal injuries, briefly
broke the gloom as search dogs sniffed for any sign of life in the
rubble.
	   A child's bicycle, a stuffed toy and an aluminum pasta cooking
pot stuck out of the debris, reduced to rubble so fine it looked
like it had been passed through a blender.
	   ``It was like I was buried alive,'' Viola was quoted as saying
by a member of the emergency surgical team at San Camillo. ``My
body was flattened by the weight and dust was coming into my
nostrils and mouth.''
	   Among the first rescuers at the site was fireman Maurizio
Fumaselli, 30, who was on duty in a firehouse not far from the
building, where his parents and two brothers lived.
	   Fumaselli, after pulling out one of his parents, collapsed on
the ground in desperation but insisted on keeping on digging,
witnesses said. Later he was seen walking away from the scene
demanding to know the cause.
	   Franco Barbieri, a top civil defense official, said the building
was erected in the early 1950s. That was a period of intense and
hurried post-war building in the capital. He noted that
construction was begun in 1952 but the license to construct only
granted in 1956.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA said that investigators were
looking into a complaint of a few years ago that unauthorized work
was done on two reinforced concrete pillars for an underpass which
lead to a printing plant on the ground and first floor of the
building.
	   Among those who escaped the disaster was a family who stayed out
of town because they didn't want to travel back with a child who
had the flu and a truck driver who works the night shift.

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Fritz Strobl led Austrian teammate
Roland Assinger by eight hundredths of a second Wednesday in the
opening practice for consecutive World Cup downhill races in this
north Italian valley.
	   Swiss Ambrosi Hoffmann was a surprising third, 0.15 of a second
behind.
	   Strobl completed the 3,495-meter, icy Saslong course in two
minutes, 9.15 seconds.
	   The Austrian was the first skier down the course after a
temporary suspension of training due to an accident involving
Canadian Ed Podivinsky.
	   Podivinsky, an Olympic bronze medalist in 1994, tore his left
knee anterior cruciate ligament _ a potentially season-ending
injury _ when he landed on a bump following a long jump.
	   All of the 10 lead times were within a second of each other.
	   Norway's Lasse Kjus, winner of the first downhill of the season
at Val D'Isere last Saturday, finished 14th, 1.25 sconds slower
than Strobl.
	   Defending World Cup champion Hermann Maier was a distant 36th,
3.04 seconds behind.
	   The second and last practice run is scheduled for Thursday.
	   Friday's downhill makes up for the season opener that was
cancelled in Whistler Mountain, Canada, due to bad weather earlier
this month.
	   Saturday's race is the original Val Gardena downhill, the third
of the season.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is closely watching growing tensions
between Iraq and the United States, Israel's defense minister said
Wednesday, and has readied its forces for a possible attack.
	   U.S. naval and air forces in the Gulf were ``in execute mode''
as President Bill Clinton met Wednesday with his top national
security advisers to consider military strikes in response to
Iraq's latest defiance of international arms inspectors.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said that three U.S.
patriot anti-missile batteries dispatched to Israel last week stood
ready in case of an Iraqi attack, and that other U.S. defense
systems were ready to be dispatched to Israel very quickly if
needed.

Serbs mourn six victims, protest killings in western Kosovo city

<TEXT>
	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Church bells pealed and tears and anger
mixed freely Wednesday as thousands mourned six young Kosovo Serbs
killed in a barroom slaughter blamed on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   The attack in Pec _ condemned as ``appalling beyond words'' by
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke _ prompted Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to renew his quest to wipe out ``terrorism'' by
separatists. It also raised fears that inflamed ethnic passions
would lead to a return to war in the southern province.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the 2 million populace in
Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia. Most
want independence. Over 1,000 people have been killed since
Milosevic launched a crackdown on separatists in February, and
300,000 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been forced from
their homes.
	   Monday's shootings in Pec came on the bloodiest day since an
October cease-fire agreement ended months of fighting between Serb
forces and rebels. In addition to the Pec slayings, the Yugoslav
army claimed to have killed 36 guerrillas in a border clash with
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Milosevic declared Wednesday that the ``terrorist bandits''
responsible for the Pec shooting would be found and a top
government body for Kosovo called the killings ``the most monstrous
crime in the series of assaults by Albanian terrorist gangs.''
	   Busloads of Serb police stood by in Kosovo's third-largest city
Wednesday to protect an emotional ceremony attended by 5,000 Serbs
in the central square. Many wept openly. Some speakers demanded
Serb authorities halt ``Albanian terrorism'' immediately. At least
one man in civilian clothing carried a submachine gun.
	   ``Pain and sorrow is in our hearts,'' said Mirko Simonovic,
principal of the high school where four of the victims were
students. ``They were slain while drinking in a cafe by shots in
their back. ... They were killed for the simple reason of being
Serbs.''
	   A tense silence permeated the city, punctured by the sound of
church bells and the weeping of relatives. Later, about 2,000
people walked in a procession to the cemetery where the six were
buried after their wailing mothers kissed them farewell.
	   ``Their only sin was that they came from another religion,
another faith, another people,'' Patriarch Pavle of the Serbian
Orthodox Church said in Pec.
	   The city, 45 miles west of the provincial capital of Pristina,
has 150,000 residents, including several thousand Serbs.
	   In Pristina, about 2,500 Serbs attended a rally Wednesday to
protest the slayings.
	   No incidents were reported at either gathering. But a policeman
going to the funeral shot and killed a man in a Kosovo Liberation
Army uniform after two suspected guerrillas attacked him, the
official Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Also, ethnic Albanians in at least three towns were the target
of harassment, according to the Albanians' Kosovo Information
Center. It said Albanian schoolchildren were beaten up by Serb
civilians in Kosovska Mitrovica and Obilic, and stone-throwers
smashed windows of Albanian-owned shops in Urosevac.
	   International peace monitors, whose presence is supposed to ease
tension and restore public confidence in Kosovo, were nowhere to be
seen in Pec on Wednesday. A day earlier, some Serbs took out their
anger at the killings by hurling stones or spitting at armored U.S.
observer vehicles.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the shootings, which
happened when masked gunmen sprayed a bar full of Serbs, including
some youths playing pool. Rebel spokesman Adem Demaci suggested the
Serbian regime may have been behind the attack, saying it did not
``fall within the concept of the KLA's liberation fight.''
	   But Serb politicians and others accused ethnic Albanian rebels
and warned of retribution.
	   Vuk Draskovic, a nationalist opposition leader in Serbia, said
in comments published Wednesday that if ``Albanian terrorism''
isn't defeated, ``the Serb people will take their defense into
their own hands.''
	   The attack in Pec was unusual because towns and cities in Kosovo
have mostly escaped the violence that has engulfed its villages
this year since Serb forces launched an offensive in February.
	   Mothers of the bar shooting victims joined other Pec women
Wednesday in sending an open letter to Milosevic.
	   ``Our trust in you obliges you to defend our children,'' they
wrote.

Russia refuses to register Limonov's National Bolshevik Party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Justice Ministry has refused to register
outspoken novelist Eduard Limonov's extreme nationalist party,
which had hoped to run in parliamentary elections, Limonov said
Wednesday.
	   Limonov issued a statement calling the decision against the
National Bolshevik Party ``a political crime'' and said, ``We will
not drop politics but will only change our methods of struggle.''
	   His party, which he says has 6,000 members, was trying to
register so it could run in parliamentary elections in December
1999.
	   Limonov, who lived abroad for many years, is known for his
sexually explicit, mostly autobiographic books, which also contain
statements in support of left-wing political extremism. He has
often defended such controversial figures as Bosnian Serb leader
and war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic.
	   Limonov also criticized a decision Tuesday by Moscow authorities
to ban a neo-Nazi group, Russian National Unity, from holding its
congress in the Russian capital.
	   The group is the most vocal and active among numerous neo-Nazi
groups that have mushroomed in Russia since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. It is also seeking registration for parliamentary
elections.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. weapons inspectors abruptly left
Baghdad Wednesday in a convoy of buses and cars, setting the stage
for imminent U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting
to discuss the crisis that unfolded rapidly after chief weapons
inspector Richard Butler ordered his monitors out, accusing Iraq of
obstructing their search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   While there was no panic on the streets of Baghdad, it was clear
that Iraqis were preparing for an attack. Long lines formed outside
gas stations, and customers cursed President Bill Clinton for
planning an attack before the holy Islamic month of Ramadan, which
is expected to begin Sunday.
	   ``It seems that Clinton ... wants to kill some people in a hurry
out of respect for Ramadan,'' Amin Jadir, 52, a government worker,
said.
	   President Saddam Hussein's government also readied for military
strikes.

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Authorities in the city of
Koudougou imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew Wednesday to curtail
violent protests over the death of a prominent journalist and vocal
government critic.
	   Newspaper owner and journalist Norbert Zongo, his driver and two
of his cousins were found dead on Sunday in their car, which had
been burned from the inside.
	   Thousands of demonstrators on Wednesday clashed with police in
Koudougou, near Zongo's home village of Sapouy about 120 kilometers
(75 miles) west of the capital of Ouagadougou.
	   Angry mobs set fire to the headquarters of the ruling party, the
Congress for Democracy and Progress in Koudougou, a local radio
report said.
	   At least 10 demonstrators were wounded by police gunfire, a
doctor from the Koudougou Health Hospital said by telephone.
	   Opponents of the government accuse President Blaise Compaore of
conspiring to have Zongo killed to silence his investigative
reporting on alleged links between Compaore's brother and the
murder of a chauffeur working for the family. The reports appeared
in Zongo's weekly newspaper, The Independent.
	   Justice Minister Yarga Larba denied any government involvement
in Zongo's death.
	   Speaking on state radio Wednesday, he said an independent
investigation would be conducted into the unexplained deaths.
	   Photos of Zongo's car indicate that the fire only burned inside
the vehicle and there was no sign of damage to the exterior.
	   Zongo and the other victims were buried Wednesday in Burkina
Faso's capital.

	   Limonov also criticized a decision Tuesday by Moscow authorities
to ban a neo-Nazi group, Russian National Unity, from holding its
congress in the Russian capital.
	   The group is the most vocal and active among numerous neo-Nazi
groups that have mushroomed in Russia since the 1991 Soviet
collapse. It is also seeking registration for parliamentary
elections.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Congo's warring president,
Laurent Kabila, arrived Wednesday in Burkina Faso, where his
country's ongoing civil war and other African conflicts are to be
the primary focus of an Organization of African Unity summit.
	   Kabila's Congo is mired in a rebel war that began in August and
continues to rage in the country's east near the border with Rwanda
and Burundi.
	   A delegation from the rebel side also arrived in Ouagadougou on
Wednesday.
	   Kabila's participation in the two-day series of meetings
beginning Thursday comes on the heels of a report that his
government may be ready to sign a cease-fire agreement with the
rebels and their benefactors Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi.
	   Congo's ambassador to Kenya earlier this week said a cease-fire
would be acceptable to the government if the terms included a clear
timeline for the withdrawal of hostile forces in Congo, Kenyan
radio reported.
	   Kabila maintains that the war is not a rebel uprising, but
rather foreign aggression by Rwanda and Uganda.
	   The Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire, quickly became
a flashpoint for regional conflict with forces from Angola and
Zimbabwe lining up with Kabila. Rwanda and Uganda are supporting
the rebel movement.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Zimbabwe's President
Robert Mugabe are expected to arrive on Thursday for the OAU
meetings.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Nigerian military
government leader Abdulsalami Abubakar are also among top officials
expected to attend.
	   An earlier meeting to formalize the cease-fire was postponed,
placing greater emphasis on the OAU meeting, diplomats in Burkina
Faso said.
	   ``We're hoping to see some actual progress made during the
meetings,'' said a western diplomat who will be observing the
meetings. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Repeated efforts by South Africa, the United Nations and the OAU
have failed to curtail hostilities in Congo.
	   Heavy fighting was reported Wednesday in the southeastern
province of Katanga, although independent confirmation was not
immediately possible.
	   Rebel radio, meanwhile, claimed that two Zimbabwean helicopter
and MiG fighter jet had been shot down on Sunday in Katanga
province.
	   Despite talk of the growing role of the OAU as a forum for
conflict resolution, hostilities _ new and old _ have erupted in
recent months across the continent from Guinea-Bissau in the
northwest to Angola in the south and Congo in central Africa.
	   Heads of state attending the two-day summit will be discussing
these conflicts and the ongoing border dispute between Ethiopia and
Eritrea in the eastern Horn of Africa.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's foreign minister accused the chief U.N.
arms inspector Wednesday of ``grossly exceeding'' his authority in
Iraq, and called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the
latest crisis in the Arab nation.
	   Later Wednesday, the Security Council held an emergency meeting
to discuss chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler's report.
	   Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who was in Madrid, Spain,
said Butler did not have the right to order U.N. weapons monitors
out of Iraq. The monitors left Baghdad on Wednesday.
	   The United States and Britain, the leading critics of Iraq, were
threatening airstrikes if Iraq does not fully cooperate with
inspectors.
	   But Russia, which has long-standing ties to Iraq, has
consistently opposed military action against it. Russia has one
several occasions acted as a mediator in confrontations between the
United Nations and Iraq.
	   Ivanov called for a Security Council meeting and accused Butler
of ``grossly exceeding his authority by unilaterally ordering the
evacuation of the special commission from Iraq.''
	   ``Unfortunately, the actions are leading to even more
complications and aggravating tensions around Iraq,'' said Ivanov,
who was in Spain to attend a peace conference on Bosnia. His
remarks were carried on Russian television.
	   ``Our point of view is that it is necessary to be patient now,
to assess the real situation and define what further steps are
necessary to continue the work of the special commission,'' Ivanov
said.
	   He spoke later with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
``to find a political solution to this situation.''
	   A liberal Russian lawmaker blamed the increased tensions around
Iraq on internal affairs in the United States, including the debate
about impeaching President Clinton.
	   ``Many connect the conflict with domestic affairs in America,
the looming impeachment and the need to mobilize public opinion
toward something very patriotic and combative,'' Vladimir Lukin,
head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, was quoted by the
ITAR-Tass news agency as saying.
	   That has made airstrikes on Iraq ``quite possible'' this time,
he said.
	   Iraq pledged to resume full cooperation with inspectors a month
ago under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes.
	   But in his report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Tuesday, Butler painted a picture of Iraqi obstruction, evasion and
subterfuge. He said he could not give assurances that Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed.
	   The arms programs must be dismantled before the U.N. Security
Council can lift economic sanctions against Iraq. The trade ban was
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

champion Kaiserslautern's seven-game Bundesliga winning streak by
rallying with three second-halftime goals for a 3-1 victory
Wednesday.
	   Kaiserslautern's Champions League quarterfinal opponent, Bayern
Munich, had less trouble with bottom-placed Borussia
Moenchengladbach, cruising to a 2-0 victory on two goals by Stefan
Effenberg, a former Borussia star.
	   The win gave Bayern a six-point lead in the standings over Bayer
Leverkusen.
	   Effenberg first guided a low pass from the left from Michael
Tarnat into the net in the eighth minute, and then converted a
disputed penalty in the 27th.
	   A sellout crowd of 34,500 saw Moenchengladbach suffer another
setback in its uphill battle to avoid relegation. Effenberg last
season helped Borussia stave off relegation in the last round, but
now could have buried his former club.
	   Duisburg broke its three-game losing streak with a spirited
performance after Uwe Roesler's deflected a shot in the 40th minute
had beaten Duisburg goalkeeper Gintaras Stauce for a 1-0
Kaiserslautern lead.
	   Kaiserslautern had come close to scoring already in the 25th
minute, but Marco Reich's shot after a solo run bounced off the
post.
	   Only three minutes into the second half, Markus Beierle tied the
score when he found the net from close range after a confusion in
the Kaiserslautern defense.
	   After earlier wasting a good opportunity, Duisburg's Danish
midfielder Stig Toefting broke through in the 64th minute to put
the home team ahead.
	   Another Dane, striker Erik Bo Andersen, sealed Duisburg's
victory in the last minute.
	   Duisburg vaulted five spots into 12th place.
	   Both games had been postponed because of bad weather earlier in
the season. The Bundesliga goes into a two-month winter break after
the weekend round.

Cyclist fails drug test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Steen Madsen has received a four-year suspension
from the Canadian Cycling Association for failing a random drug
test.
	   The banned anabolic substance, Nandrolone, was found in Madsen's
urine sample provided Nov. 11 in Edmonton. An International Olympic
Committee accredited lab in Montreal provided the A sample analysis
Dec. 2. A positive result was confirmed upon completion of the B
sample analysis Dec. 12.
	   Madsen became a member of the national team development program
Nov. 3.
	   ``The Canadian Cycling Association's position on doping is
clear,'' said Patrick Healy, executive director of the Canadian
Cycling Association. ``We have a no-tolerance policy.''
	   Madsen can appeal the decision.

Netanyahu will call elections if he fails to get peace mandate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous; UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes,
analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Facing a deadlock in parliament, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised Wednesday to call early
elections if lawmakers fail to endorse the Mideast peace deal in a
vote next week.
	   Palestinians were outraged by the move, as an election campaign
would delay the implementation of the accords brokered by U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Wye, Maryland, in October.
	   By holding elections more than a year ahead of schedule,
Netanyahu would be seeking public approval for his peacemaking
strategies that have paralyzed his fragile right-wing coalition and
infuriated an opposition that accuses him of repeated delays.
	   Netanyahu may be forced to call early elections because he lacks
the necessary support to survive a no confidence vote set for
Monday. His efforts to please hard-liners in his coalition have
paralyzed the peace process.
	   Describing the next, final settlement stage of negotiations with
the Palestinians as ``crucial,'' Netanyahu outlined his conditions
for lifting a freeze he has imposed on further territorial
withdrawal.
	   He said he wanted the Palestinians to swear off inciting
violence; a roundup of illegal weapons; a reduction in the
Palestinian police force; and an end to declared aspirations to
statehood or to a presence in Jerusalem.
	   ``I intend to bring these decisions before members of the
Knesset on Monday,'' Netanyahu said in a speech broadcast live on
all media from his Likud party headquarters in Tel Aviv.
	   ``If the majority won't be found to do this, I will initiate
early elections in order to receive from the nation the mandate
necessary to achieve a genuine peace,'' he said.
	   Saeb Erekat, the top Palestinian negotiator, described the move
as likely to ``have very dangerous effects on the peace process.''
	   ``What emerged in Netanyahu's speech is a freeze of the peace
process,'' said Erekat. ``He knows very well that the Palestinian
side has fulfilled all its commitments.''
	   Clinton was in the region for three days this week to try to
salvage the deal. His apparent failure frustrated the president and
increased U.S.-Israel tensions.
	   Netanyahu called for the support of the opposition Labor party,
although he stopped short of inviting them into a national unity
government.
	   Labor leader Ehud Barak ridiculed Netanyahu's offer.
	   ``Netanyahu has decided to give in to extremism,'' Barak told
Channel Two news. ``We're going to elections.''
	   Netanyahu also lacked the necessary support on his right to
survive in parliament, where he faces a no-confidence vote on
Monday.
	   Hard-liners, who are loathe to cede further territory to the
Palestinians, say they no longer believe Netanyahu when he promises
not to make any further concessions.
	   Netanyahu was applauded by the Likud faithful as he swore not to
give up further territory unless the Palestinians met his
conditions.
	   ``These are the correct principles which are needed for the
state of Israel, to ensure its future,'' he said. ``It is necessary
to unite most of the (political) forces behind them.''
	   He accused hard-liners of wanting to ``rip up Oslo and Wye.''
The Oslo peace agreement was negotiated by Israel in 1993.
	   Barak was already preparing for elections _ he was dining with
top U.S. political consultants as Netanyahu spoke _ and it seemed
as if Netanyahu's Likud was also resigned to the likelihood of a
vote.
	   Other issues loomed for Netanyahu: he has failed to pass a
budget this year, unemployment is relatively high, and his finance
minister _ seen as one of the most loyal members of his cabinet _
has just resigned.
	   In a scathing letter, Yaacov Neeman said he was leaving because
of the paralysis occasioned by the crisis in the peace process.
	   Elections would occupy the country for months. If Netanyahu
resigns, or if he loses the no-confidence vote, the elections would
be held in a minimum of 60 days.

Marseille strides three points clear with win at Montpellier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Florian Maurice struck his eleventh league goal of
the season on Wednesday to give leader Marseille a crucial 1-0 win
at Montpellier.
	   The win puts Rolland Courbis' team on 44 points, three clear of
Bordeaux, which lost 3-1 at Auxerre on Tuesday.
	   Marseille, which came back from 4-0 behind to beat Montpellier
5-4 in a classic match earlier this season, has now won six of its
nine away league games this season.
	   Before the match, Montpellier had only dropped two points at
home.
	   Third-placed Rennes, with just one win its last five games, had
another poor result, losing 2-0 at relegation-threatened Le Havre.
	   Yugoslav striker Miladin Becanovic put Le Havre on its way with
an eighth minute goal, before Lilian Nalis made the game safe in
the 52nd minute.
	   Rennes stays on 31 points, well off the pace.
	   Nantes leapt to fourth place with a comfortable 2-0 win over
Nancy.
	   Frederic Da Rocha scored twice for the canaries.
	   UEFA Cup quarterfinalist Lyon lost its chance to go third after
being held 2-2 by Lorient.
	   Stephane Pedron and Patrice Loko scored first half goals for the
Britanny minnow, before Lyon grabbed a point with a Yannick Fischer
own goal and a late David Linares equalizer.
	   In other games Wednesday: Lens 1, Sochaux 1; Monaco 1, Toulouse
1; Paris Saint-Germain 0, Strasbourg 0.
	   French clubs play one more round of league matches Saturday
before taking a month-long winter break.

Rwanda slams French report into 1994 genocide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Rwanda's government on Wednesday accused
France of helping bring about and even participating in a 1994
genocide of a half-million people, and dismissed a French
investigation into the killings as a whitewash.
	   President Pasteur Bizimungu's office said that France armed Hutu
soldiers and militiamen despite impending signs of genocide, and
then helped the perpetrators escape to neighboring Congo after
Tutsi-led rebels took power and stopped the killings.
	   ``Contrary to the alleged findings of the report, France is
guilty of crimes of genocide in Rwanda,'' the statement said.
	   A committee of French lawmakers concluded Tuesday after a
nine-month study that France was not implicated in the Hutu
government-organized slaughter from April to June 1994 that
targeted minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
	   Instead, the long-awaited French report blamed the passivity of
the United Nations and singled out the United States for blocking
U.N. intervention.
	   The Rwandan statement called the report ``a partisan
whitewash.''
	   ``The government of France played a vital role in the
preparation of genocide in Rwanda, actively took part in the
genocide itself, and has systematically undermined any efforts to
address the cause and the aftermath of the genocide in Rwanda,'' it
said.
	   France supported former Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana and
considered French-speaking Rwanda part of its area of interest in
Africa.
	   After Tutsi rebels, forced into exile by the ruling Hutu
extremists, invaded in October 1990, France dispatched 600 French
troops ostensibly to protect French citizens.
	   But according to survivors, human rights activists and the
Rwandan government, even after most of the French had been
evacuated in the early days of fighting, the troops stayed on,
training, helping organize logistics and in some cases manning
roadblocks with Hutu government forces.
	   Although France launched the unilateral operation to save
remaining Tutsis, it instead provided an escape route for the
defeated army and Hutu civilians.

Russia's human rights commissioner defends anti-Semitic remarks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES in last 3 grafs with U.S. State Department
comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's official defender of human rights said
Wednesday that ethnic Russians should have a special status in
their country, and warned against prosecuting a Communist lawmaker
who accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in Russia.
	   ``The (anti-Semitic) remarks that we are hearing are remarks by
rather educated and knowledgeable people,'' Russia's Human Rights
Commissioner Oleg Mironov said.
	   ``I condemn such statements, but I don't think that the majority
of Russia's population condemns them,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
quoted him as saying. ``The Russian idea is being voiced. And it
should be voiced in a country where the majority of the population
is Russian.''
	   Prominent Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin said Tuesday that
Russia's post-Soviet collapse would not have happened if Russia's
government was not made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.''
He also accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the country.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of
Jews and other minorities in prominent positions, but they have
always been outnumbered by ethnic Russians.
	   Officials in Yeltsin's staff and the Cabinet strongly condemned
Ilyukhin's statements.
	   Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky on Wednesday called for
banning the Communist party, and said the government should use
force to get rid of the party if necessary.
	   Berezovsky, who is Jewish, was reiterating calls that many
Russian liberals made last month, after the Communist Party refused
to censure another member, lawmaker Albert Makashov, for similar
anti-Semitic remarks.
	   ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock,
and not in the Duma,'' Berezovsky said.
	   But Mironov, the human rights commissioner, insisted that
anti-Semites should not be persecuted or prosecuted because their
statements have a broad appeal in Russia.
	   ``Maybe one should just have some kind of talks, discussions,
disputes with them.'' Any harsher action could ignite an ``ethnic
fire'' in Russia, Mironov was quoted as saying.
	   Mironov also insisted that there is no anti-Semitism in Russia,
because none of the ``representatives of that ethnic group'' have
ever complained to him about any discrimination against the Jews.
	   Ilyukhin was unrepentant about his statements. ``What kind of
democracy is it when a Russian man can't speak the truth?'' he
asked Wednesday.
	   Since Soviet-era tacit discrimination against Jews was
abolished, virulent grass-roots anti-Semitism has flared up in
Russia, with bombings of synagogues, desecration of Jewish
cemeteries, a growing neo-Nazi movement, and widespread
anti-Semitic remarks.
	   Regarding Ilyukhin's statements, presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin said: ``All of this is a system of carefully thought out
views, which tear to shreds the principle of internationalism that
the Communist Party is proclaiming.''
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said parliament ``must
rigorously curb such statements or else it will utterly discredit
itself.''
	   Russia's Ethnic Policy Ministry issued a statement saying it
``decisively condemns the hypocritical position of those political
parties and political activists who, while declaring their
adherence to internationalism and the friendship of peoples, fail
to rebuke ethnic separatism, national chauvinism, and
anti-Semitism.''
	   U.S. officials also criticized the anti-Semitic developments.
	   In Washington on Wednesday, State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said, ``We join with Russian leaders in condemning these
outrageous anti-Semitic statements.''
	   He said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott raised concerns
about these issues in all his meetings with Russian leaders during
his visit to Moscow last week.
	   ``We view anti-Semitic tendencies of Duma deputies with concern
and are dismayed that the Duma's reaction is not to condemn these
clearly inflammatory statements,'' Rubin said.

Russian parliament passes bill on printing rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: CLARIFIES in lede, 9th graf that 25 billion rubles is allowed
for the final quarter of 1998; UPDATES with possible oil company
mergers in last graf. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos MOSB116-7 &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government won some promises of cash
Wednesday to pay its huge bills: a go-ahead from parliament to
print billions of rubles, and bids for a stake in a giant natural
gas company.
	   Russia also claimed Wednesday that it had reached a deal with
foreign investors on restructuring defaulted treasury bonds _ but
the deal appeared to be news to the foreign investors.
	   Russia's default on the bonds in August helped send its
financial markets into a nosedive and prompted foreign lenders to
freeze aid to Russia. The country is now mired in its worst
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Wednesday that the
treasury bills, or GKOs, will be exchanged by March 15 for new
bonds with maturities of four to five years.
	   In London, however, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst said
Wednesday that Russia's proposal to restructure dlrs 10 billion
worth of GKOs is ``not an agreed solution between two sides.''
	   ``We did not agree to these terms,'' Kasper Bartholdy, CSFB's
Russian debt analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   CSFB and Deutsche Bank head the committee of six banks
negotiating with Russia over the repayment of the treasury bonds.
	   Deutsche Bank has also released a statement saying no final
agreement had been inked, and stressing creditors' displeasure with
comments from Russian officials about a deal. Deutsche Bank said
``a number of key issues'' remain outstanding.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's parliament unanimously approved a bill
Wednesday that allows the government to print 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.2 billion) in the last quarter of this year.
	   With only two weeks left before 1998 is over, the bill barely
has enough time to clear the upper chamber of parliament and be
authorized by President Boris Yeltsin.
	   However, the government has already said it printed 13.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 648 million) in October and November without waiting
for parliament approval.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
huge debts to foreign creditors and Russian workers and pensioners.
But printing money could provoke more inflation, which already is
running at about 70 percent this year.
	   With the value of the ruble declining, the government is trying
to get its hands on hard currency. The bill approved Wednesday also
requires Russian exporters to sell 75 percent of their
hard-currency earnings to the government, up from the current 50
percent.
	   In another good sign for Russia's struggling economy, the
government received at least two bids from foreign companies for a
2.5 percent stake in the state-controlled natural gas giant,
Gazprom, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The government was asking at least dlrs 651 million for the
stake _ significantly more than its market price.
	   Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants expressed hope Wednesday
that Russia still may get dlrs 3.4 billion next year in loans from
the World Bank. He spoke optimistically after the head of the World
Bank mission to Russia, Michael Carter, met with Russian officials
Wednesday.
	   Russia has factored in billions of dollars in international
loans in calculating next year's budget, despite no guarantee that
the money will materialize.
	   Russia's oil companies, meanwhile, are considering mergers
because of the country's economic crisis and the drop in world oil
prices, Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said Wednesday. He
said Russia's 13 oil companies had no alternative but to
consolidate, but did not say which ones would combine.

sawdust Wednesday, killing at least 20 residents as they slept,
including a family dug out by hand by a relative who was among the

	   Eleven occupants were reported missing in the collapse, which
tentatively was blamed on structural problems, and there appeared

Leading Turkish activist sentenced to prison term
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADANA, Turkey (AP) _ Rejecting an appeals court ruling, a state
security court on Wednesday confirmed a one-year prison sentence
for a leading human rights activist on charges of making separatist
propaganda.
	   Akin Birdal was on trial for a speech he made three years ago
calling for a peaceful solution to the 14-year old war waged in
southern Turkey between a Kurdish rebel group and the Turkish army.
	   Birdal, a campaigner against torture and the army's forced
evacuation of Kurdish villages in southeastern Turkey, heads the
Human Rights Association. In May, he was shot six times by
ultra-nationalist gunmen who considered him too sympathetic to
Kurds.
	   The appeals court had overturned his initial conviction and
one-year sentence, saying that the speech did not constitute a
crime. His lawyers immediately asked that appeals court to review
Wednesday's decision, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   Earlier in the year, an appeals court upheld another one-year
sentence for inciting racial hatred in a speech Birdal made two
years ago.
	   Birdal, still recovering from the assassination attempt, is
expected to request a deferment, on medical grounds, from starting
to serve the sentence.

Palestinian leaders say reviewing their own peace commitments

 &UR; With Israel-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Netanyahu announcing early elections
if no-confidence vote passes; James Rubin comment &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinians said Wednesday they will stick to
their Wye River accord commitments, despite an Israeli freeze on
the process _ an apparent effort to cultivate the U.S.-Palestinian
friendship that blossomed during this week's Clinton visit.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised Wednesday to
go to early elections if he is unable to get support in parliament
for his peace policies by early next week.
	   That raised the prospect of a further delay in implementing the
agreement brokered by Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October.
	   Netanyahu had earlier briefed his Cabinet on U.S. President Bill
Clinton's three-day visit and affirmed what he told the president a
day earlier _ that he would not withdraw troops on Friday, as
required by the Wye accord.
	   The prime minister says he wants solid evidence that the
Palestinians are fulfilling their commitment to contain anti-Israel
violence and to round up illegal weapons.
	   The Palestinians want quid-pro-quo for acceding on Monday to the
Israeli demand that the Palestine National Council convene and
renounce clauses in its charter calling for Israel's destruction.
Clinton attended that meeting.
	   Palestinian officials said Netanyahu's actions brought his
commitment to the peace process into question.
	   ``It shows that the Israeli government doesn't believe in peace,
and this is what we are seeing on the ground,'' said Mahmoud Abbas,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's deputy.
	   Still, Palestinians remained committed to the process, and would
continue to fulfill its requirements.
	   ``We shall continue to carry out our commitments and we shall
push ... for full implementation from Israel,'' said Nabil Shaath,
a top Palestinian negotiator returning with Arafat from Egypt,
where the Palestinian leader briefed President Hosni Mubarak on the
Clinton visit.
	   Shaath even indicated that the Palestinians were willing to
consider a post-Wye demand from Netanyahu that Arafat back off a
promise to declare statehood by May. The declaration would come
only if Israel delays agreements, he said.
	   Despite his denials, Israelis and Palestinians saw Clinton's
tour of Gaza as conferring tacit approval of Palestinian statehood.
	   Clinton also moved Palestinians in his speeches when he
expressed understanding at the pain that resulted from years of
dislocation and occupation.
	   ``The United States has taken long strives toward neutrality and
a lack of bias regarding Palestinians and Israelis,'' Mahmoud Abbas
told Voice of Palestine radio.
	   Arafat could not resist intimating his new-found closeness to
Clinton when he was asked to react to Netanyahu's freeze on troop
withdrawal.
	   ``I don't think that the American administration and President
Clinton will agree to this,'' he said _ a speculation unimaginable
just a month ago.
	   Netanyahu faces defections from doves who want him to press
ahead with Wye and hard-liners who balk at any further concessions
to the Palestinians.
	   A senior Netanyahu aide, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that if Netanyahu calls for elections, he will suspend
implementation of the Wye accord until after the elections, which
would be months away.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiatior Saeb Erekat said that such a
freeze would have ``very dangerous effects on the peace process.''
	   Palestinians said it was increasingly difficult to work with a
weakened government.
	   ``All the talk by Israeli officials about security is not the
security of the Israeli people, but the security of keeping their
seats in the government,'' said Gaza security chief Mohammmed
Dahlan.
	   The Clinton asministration also appeared frustrated with the
Israeli prime minister's apparent obsession with domestic worries.
	   ``It would be unfortunate if there were a delay in the
timetable,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said in
Washington. ``and we want the further redeployment to occur as soon
as possible.''

Fugitive Honduran soldier returns to face trial

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ One of 13 fugitive soldiers accused
of violating human rights in the 1980s has returned home to face
trial _ or a possible amnesty.
	   Capt. Billy Joya arrived Tuesday aboard a commercial flight from
Costa Rica and went immediately to the office of Judge Rita Nunez,
escorted by more than 20 police. Her questioning of him continued
on Wednesday.
	   ``I am happy to again be in Honduras, where I will face the
legal situation,'' he told reporters at the airport here. ``I am
tired... and I come voluntarily to face justice in my country,
where I am confident I will be tried in a fair way.''
	   He is accused of torture and attempted murder of six university
students in 1982, as well as of leading a 1982 army attack on the
Tegucigalpa residence of Oscar Reyes Baca, former director of the
journalism school at the National Autonomous University.
	   Reyes Baca was held prisoner for five months before fleeing to
the United States. His residence was looted and then destroyed by
tank fire.
	   An appeals court ruled on Tuesday that three amnesties granted
in 1987, 1990 and 1991 to participants in Honduras' guerrilla
conflicts of the 1980s should apply to Joya and other fugitive
soldiers.
	   The Supreme Court is due to accept or reject that ruling within
20 days.
	   Joya had been living with his wife and four children in a suburb
of Sevilla, Spain, for the past two years. He spent Tuesday night
in a room at the army's First Military Battalion on the outskirts
of Tegucigalpa.
	   A court ordered the arrest of Joya and nine other offices of the
counterinsurgency Battalion 316 in 1995. Another 16 officers were
later accused of crimes against humanity in June 1996. Three of
those are fugitives.
	   The armed forces have admitted protecting soldiers who have
evaded the courts and paying them salaries of up to dlrs 1,000 a
month, along with granting use of cars, drivers and bodyguards.
	   A 1993 government report accused Battalion 316 of functioning as
a death squad between 1979 and 1989 and of causing the
disappearance _ apparently by death _ of at least 184 suspected
leftists.

Netanyahu will call elections if he fails to get peace mandate

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
promised Wednesday to take his peace policies to the electorate if
he fails in an improbable bid next week to garner enough support
for his proposals in parliament.
	   Palestinians were furious with Netanyahu, describing the move as
``dangerous.'' An elections campaign would delay for months the
implementation of the accords brokered by U.S. President Bill
Clinton in Wye, Maryland, in October.
	   Describing the next, final settlement stage of negotiations with
the Palestinians as ``crucial,'' Netanyahu outlined his conditions
for lifting a freeze he has imposed on further territorial
withdrawal.
	   He said he wanted a swearing off of incitement to violence; a
round-up of illegally-held weapons; a reduction in the Palestinian
police force; and an end to declared aspirations to statehood or to
a presence in Jerusalem.
	   ``I intend to bring these decisions before members of the
Knesset on Monday,'' Netanyahu said in a speech from his Likud
party headquarters in Tel Aviv.
	   ``If the majority won't be found to do this, I will initiate
early elections in order to receive from the nation the mandate
necessary to achieve a genuine peace,'' he said.
	   A senior Netanyahu aide, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that if elections were called, Netanyahu would suspend
implementation of the Wye agreement until after the elections.
	   Saeb Erekat, the top Palestinian negotiator, described the move
as likely to ``have very dangerous effects on the peace process.''
	   ``He knows very well that the Palestinian side has fulfilled all
its commitments,'' Erekat said.
	   Clinton was in the region for three days this week to try and
salvage Wye. His apparent failure frustrated the president and
increased U.S.-Israel tensions.
	   ``It would be unfortunate if there were a delay in the
timetable,'' State Department spokesman James Rubin said in
Washington on Wednesday,. ``and we want the further redeployment to
occur as soon as possible.''
	   Netanyahu called for the support of the opposition Labor party,
although he stopped short of inviting them into a national unity
government.
	   Labor leader Ehud Barak ridiculed Netanyahu's offer.
	   ``Netanyahu has decided to give in to extremism,'' Barak told
Channel Two news. ``We're going to elections.''
	   Netanyahu also lacked the necessary support on his right to
survive in parliament, where he faces a no-confidence vote on
Monday.
	   Hard-liners, who are loathe to cede further territory to the
Palestinians, say they no longer believe Netanyahu when he promises
not to make any further concessions.
	   Netanyahu was applauded by the Likud faithful as he swore not to
give up further territory unless the Palestinians met his
conditions.
	   ``These are the correct principles which are needed for the
state of Israel, to ensure its future,'' he said. ``It is necessary
to unite most of the (political) forces behind them.''
	   He accused hard-liners of wanting to ``rip up Oslo and Wye.''
The Oslo peace agreement was negotiated by Israel in 1993.
	   Barak was already preparing for elections _ he was dining with
top U.S. political consultants as Netanyahu spoke _ and it seemed
as if Netanyahu's Likud was also resigned to the likelihood of a
vote.
	   ``We've reached a situation in which we have no choice, and it's
better to do it of our own initiative,'' Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon told the Likud gathering.
	   Other issues loomed for Netanyahu: he has failed to pass a
budget this year, unemployment is relatively high, and his finance
minister _ seen as one of the most loyal members of his cabinet _
has just resigned.
	   In a scathing letter, Yaacov Neeman said he was leaving because
the paralysis occasioned by the crisis in the peace process.
	   ``These past few weeks have become a political race that have
distracted all our attention from the true issues and challenges
facing Israel,'' said Neeman, the second finance minister to go in
Netanyahu's 2 1/2 year tenure.
	   Nonetheless, the public would likely vote on the peace process
in the elections, according to Joseph Alpher, a political analyst
with the American Jewish Committee.
	   ``It's the question of what will the different parties' approach
be to territorial questions, the broader question of final status
with the Palestinians, the fate of (Jewish) settlements and the
nature of the state,'' he said.
	   Another political scientist predicted that any ill will toward
Netanyahu _ for alienating the Americans, and for fumbling the
peace process _ could dissipate in the face of unease over the
Palestinians.
	   ``If we see (Palestinian) terrorism, if we see a lack of
Palestinian follow-through, continued incitement, it's not going to
help Barak,'' Gerald Steinberg of Bar-Ilan University said.
	   Elections would occupy the country for months. If Netanyahu
resigns, or if he loses the no-confidence vote, the elections would
be held in a minimum of 60 days.
	   Senior Netanyahu advisor David Bar-Illan said that it was more
likely Netanyahu would set an elections date sometime later than
that, after consulting with Barak.

Researchers find latent HIV traces in men despite appearing
</HEADLINE>
virus-free &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Traces of the virus that causes AIDS have been found in the
semen of men who responded well to aggressive drug therapy, causing
scientists to remind HIV-positive men to continue practicing safe
sex.
	   The discovery was first reported by The Associated Press last
month when it was presented in Denver at the annual meeting of the
Infectious Diseases Society of America. It is now being published
in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of medicine.
	   Researchers at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia said
they discovered the HIV provirus _ the genetic component of the
AIDS virus _ still in the semen cells of four of seven men whose
blood levels of HIV had been reduced to undetectable levels.
	   In test-tube experiments, the scientists were able to grow the
AIDS virus when they combined tiny provirus samples from the
patients with blood from individuals who had never been infected.
	   The study suggests that HIV-positive men whose health has
dramatically improved after taking the AIDS drug cocktail might
still be able to transmit the virus to others.
	   The researchers described these provirus reservoirs as the
``Trojan horse'' of AIDS, and said they may lurk in the brain and
retina cells, too. Determining how to eradicate these last traces
is the ``endgame'' in the two-decade battle against AIDS, they
said.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Facing a deadlock in parliament, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised Wednesday to call early
elections if lawmakers fail to endorse the Mideast peace deal in a
vote next week.
	   Palestinians were outraged by the move, as an election campaign
would delay the implementation of the accords brokered by U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Wye, Maryland, in October.
	   By holding elections more than a year ahead of schedule,
Netanyahu would be seeking public approval for his peacemaking
strategies that have paralyzed his fragile right-wing coalition and
infuriated an opposition that accuses him of repeated delays.
	   Netanyahu may be forced to call early elections because he lacks
the necessary support to survive a no confidence vote set for
Monday. His efforts to please hard-liners in his coalition have
paralyzed the peace process.
	   Describing the next, final settlement stage of negotiations with
the Palestinians as ``crucial,'' Netanyahu outlined his conditions
for lifting a freeze he has imposed on further territorial
withdrawal.
	   He said he wanted the Palestinians to swear off inciting

Russia's human rights commissioner defends anti-Semitic remarks
</HEADLINE>

comment. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's official defender of human rights said
Wednesday that ethnic Russians should have a special status in
their country, and warned against prosecuting a Communist lawmaker
who accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in Russia.
	   ``The (anti-Semitic) remarks that we are hearing are remarks by
rather educated and knowledgeable people,'' Russia's Human Rights
Commissioner Oleg Mironov said.
	   ``I condemn such statements, but I don't think that the majority
of Russia's population condemns them,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
quoted him as saying. ``The Russian idea is being voiced. And it
should be voiced in a country where the majority of the population
is Russian.''
	   Prominent Communist lawmaker Viktor Ilyukhin said Tuesday that
Russia's post-Soviet collapse would not have happened if Russia's
government was not made up ``exclusively of one group, the Jews.''
He also accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the country.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of
Jews and other minorities in prominent positions, but they have
always been outnumbered by ethnic Russians.
	   Officials in Yeltsin's staff and the Cabinet strongly condemned
Ilyukhin's statements.
	   Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky on Wednesday called for
banning the Communist party, and said the government should use
force to get rid of the party if necessary.
	   Berezovsky, who is Jewish, was reiterating calls that many
Russian liberals made last month, after the Communist Party refused
to censure another member, lawmaker Albert Makashov, for similar
anti-Semitic remarks.
	   ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock,
and not in the Duma,'' Berezovsky said.
	   But Mironov, the human rights commissioner, insisted that
anti-Semites should not be persecuted or prosecuted because their
statements have a broad appeal in Russia.
	   ``Maybe one should just have some kind of talks, discussions,
disputes with them.'' Any harsher action could ignite an ``ethnic
fire'' in Russia, Mironov was quoted as saying.
	   Mironov also insisted that there is no anti-Semitism in Russia,
because none of the ``representatives of that ethnic group'' have
ever complained to him about any discrimination against the Jews.
	   Ilyukhin was unrepentant about his statements. ``What kind of
democracy is it when a Russian man can't speak the truth?'' he
asked Wednesday.
	   Since Soviet-era tacit discrimination against Jews was
abolished, virulent grass-roots anti-Semitism has flared up in
Russia, with bombings of synagogues, desecration of Jewish
cemeteries, a growing neo-Nazi movement, and widespread
anti-Semitic remarks.
	   Regarding Ilyukhin's statements, presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin said: ``All of this is a system of carefully thought out
views, which tear to shreds the principle of internationalism that
the Communist Party is proclaiming.''
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said parliament ``must
rigorously curb such statements or else it will utterly discredit
itself.''
	   Russia's Ethnic Policy Ministry issued a statement saying it
``decisively condemns the hypocritical position of those political
parties and political activists who, while declaring their
adherence to internationalism and the friendship of peoples, fail
to rebuke ethnic separatism, national chauvinism, and
anti-Semitism.''
	   U.S. officials also criticized the anti-Semitic developments.
	   In Washington on Wednesday, State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin said, ``We join with Russian leaders in condemning these
outrageous anti-Semitic statements.''
	   He said Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott raised concerns
about these issues in all his meetings with Russian leaders during
his visit to Moscow last week.
	   ``We view anti-Semitic tendencies of Duma deputies with concern
and are dismayed that the Duma's reaction is not to condemn these
clearly inflammatory statements,'' Rubin said.

Polaroid announces additional job cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REWRITES thruout to include comments from company, more
details; No pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) _ Another 600 to 700 Polaroid Corp.
employees will lose their jobs over the next year and a half as the
company struggles to cope with declining sales in Russia, Latin
America and Asia.
	   The layoffs are expected to help stem red ink flowing from those
regions, which have been swept up in the world's growing economic
and currency problems.
	   Company officials said Wednesday the layoffs, which represent 7
percent of Polaroid's workforce, would come primarily in
manufacturing, sales, general and administrative operations.
Employees in North America, the Pacific Rim and on the Asian
continent will go, but details were not immediately available about
how many jobs would be eliminated in each location.
	   ``What this is really doing for us is it's kind of clearing the
decks,'' said spokeswoman Nancy Childs. ``You take the hurt now
rather than spreading it out over another year or so.''
	   The latest news was timed to warn analysts that fourth-quarter
earnings, to be announced in January, likely won't be as strong as
previously expected, Childs added.
	   The announcement came a year to the day after Polaroid's last
round of layoffs were made public _ 1,500 jobs cut, mostly in
Massachusetts manufacturing.
	   Gary T. DiCamillo, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the new round ``puts Polaroid on a more solid footing to enter 1999
poised for profitable growth.''
	   The further restructuring is expected to save Polaroid $20-$30
million over the next two years, greater savings than previously
anticipated.
	   With annual sales of more than $2.1 billion in 1997, the company
known for its instant imaging technology embarked on a major
cost-cutting initiative in 1995 when DiCamillo joined the firm.
	   On Wednesday, he revealed the firm has successfully renegotiated
terms of a $350 million revolving credit agreement with all 14 of
its bank lenders. The company needed the deal _ which extends until
2001 _ to ensure it has enough cash on hand to pursue strategic
plans, including the introduction of new products like PocketCam.
	   One of Polaroid's most recent inventions, the small instant
camera produces miniature photos and is designed to appeal to young
adults and children. For the even younger set, there's Barbie
Instant Camera, a pink and purple unit that piggybacks on the
popularity of Mattel's famous doll.
	   Also Wednesday, company officials reiterated their intention to
spend reserves of $90 million in the fourth quarter. About $50
million will be used to cover the cost of restructuring, and $40
million for anticipated losses in Russia.
	   Many Russian vendors have been unable to pay Polaroid for
products sent to them, Childs said, and film that has gone unsold
there has been thrown out or returned to the company.
	   Polaroid makes instant photographic cameras and films; digital
imaging hardware, software and media; and an array of other
products.

Russian parliament passes bill on printing rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: CLARIFIES in lede, 9th graf that 25 billion rubles is allowed
for the final quarter of 1998; UPDATES with possible oil company
mergers in last graf. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government won some promises of cash
Wednesday to pay its huge bills: a go-ahead from parliament to
print billions of rubles, and bids for a stake in a giant natural
gas company.
	   Russia also claimed Wednesday that it had reached a deal with
foreign investors on restructuring defaulted treasury bonds _ but
the deal appeared to be news to the foreign investors.
	   Russia's default on the bonds in August helped send its
financial markets into a nosedive and prompted foreign lenders to
freeze aid to Russia. The country is now mired in its worst
economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Wednesday that the
treasury bills, or GKOs, will be exchanged by March 15 for new
bonds with maturities of four to five years.
	   In London, however, a Credit Suisse First Boston analyst said
Wednesday that Russia's proposal to restructure dlrs 10 billion
worth of GKOs is ``not an agreed solution between two sides.''
	   ``We did not agree to these terms,'' Kasper Bartholdy, CSFB's
Russian debt analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   CSFB and Deutsche Bank head the committee of six banks
negotiating with Russia over the repayment of the treasury bonds.
	   Deutsche Bank has also released a statement saying no final
agreement had been inked, and stressing creditors' displeasure with
comments from Russian officials about a deal. Deutsche Bank said
``a number of key issues'' remain outstanding.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's parliament unanimously approved a bill
Wednesday that allows the government to print 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.2 billion) in the last quarter of this year.
	   With only two weeks left before 1998 is over, the bill barely
has enough time to clear the upper chamber of parliament and be
authorized by President Boris Yeltsin.
	   However, the government has already said it printed 13.5 billion
rubles (dlrs 648 million) in October and November without waiting
for parliament approval.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the money to pay off
huge debts to foreign creditors and Russian workers and pensioners.
But printing money could provoke more inflation, which already is
running at about 70 percent this year.
	   With the value of the ruble declining, the government is trying
to get its hands on hard currency. The bill approved Wednesday also
requires Russian exporters to sell 75 percent of their
hard-currency earnings to the government, up from the current 50
percent.
	   In another good sign for Russia's struggling economy, the
government received at least two bids from foreign companies for a
2.5 percent stake in the state-controlled natural gas giant,
Gazprom, the Interfax news agency reported Wednesday.
	   The government was asking at least dlrs 651 million for the
stake _ significantly more than its market price.
	   Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants expressed hope Wednesday
that Russia still may get dlrs 3.4 billion next year in loans from
the World Bank. He spoke optimistically after the head of the World
Bank mission to Russia, Michael Carter, met with Russian officials
Wednesday.
	   Russia has factored in billions of dollars in international
loans in calculating next year's budget, despite no guarantee that
the money will materialize.
	   Russia's oil companies, meanwhile, are considering mergers
because of the country's economic crisis and the drop in world oil
prices, Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Bulgak said Wednesday. He
said Russia's 13 oil companies had no alternative but to
consolidate, but did not say which ones would combine.

Controversial Russian tycoon calls for ban of Communists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with U.S. comment. Picks up 10th
graf pvs, `Members of...' &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A business tycoon appealed Wednesday for a ban on
the Communist Party, going so far as to say that force should be
used if need be to prevent lawmakers from making anti-Semitic
remarks.
	   ``The later they use force the more blood that will be shed,''
said Boris Berezovsky, who is Jewish.
	   His comments came a day after top Communist lawmaker Viktor
Ilyukhin accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the country.
	   At impeachment hearings Tuesday against President Boris Yeltsin,
Ilyukhin also said Russia's post-Soviet collapse would not have
happened if the government was not made up ``exclusively of one
group, the Jews.''
	   Yeltsin's governments have contained a number of Jews in
prominent positions, but they have always been outnumbered by
ethnic Russians.
	   Another Communist lawmaker, Albert Makashov, made similar
anti-Semitic remarks at a Moscow rally in October. Berezovsky
demanded the Communist Party be disbanded at that time as well.
	   ``Such people as Ilyukhin and Makashov should sit in the dock,
and not in the Duma,'' the Interfax new agency quoted Berezovsky as
saying.
	   Top Russian officials also criticized Ilyukhin.
	   The Duma ``must rigorously curb such statements or else it will
utterly discredit itself,'' Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin
said.
	   The United States also joined in condemnation of the remarks. In
Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said: ``We
join with Russian leaders in condemning these outrageous
anti-Semitic statements.''
	   He said the issue had been raised when Vice President Gore and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright recently spoke with Russian
officials at various meetings.
	   ``We view anti-Semitic tendencies of Duma deputies with concern
and are dismayed that the Duma's reaction is not to condemn these
clearly inflammatory statements,'' Rubin said.
	   Members of the liberal Yabloko faction proposed a resolution
denouncing Ilyukhin's statement, but parliament did not immediately
act.
	   Unrepentant, Ilyukhin responded to the motion by accusing
liberals of inflaming anti-Semitism in Russia.
	   ``What kind of democracy is it when a Russian man can't speak
the truth?'' he said Wednesday.
	   Other Communists demanded that Russian television networks be
banned from covering the Duma's activities, saying coverage of
Ilyukhin's remarks was biased against him.
	   The business daily Kommersant speculated Wednesday that Ilyukhin
made the statements to provoke the Kremlin into trying to ban the
Communist Party.
	   ``That would strengthen the party's image as the main opposition
force,'' the newspaper said.
	   Yeltsin banned the Communist Party for one year in the early
1990s, but it quickly rebounded as the country's leading opposition
group and now has the largest faction in parliament's lower house,
the State Duma.
	   The Communists and Berezovsky have never been on good terms.
Many Communists believe Berezovsky, one of the country's richest
and most powerful businessmen, symbolizes the wild, unrestrained
capitalism that has emerged in post-Soviet Russia.
	   The Communists have also demanded that Berezovsky step down from
his post as executive secretary of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, a loose grouping of 12 ex-Soviet republics.

Russian parliament passes bill to print rubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to CLARIFY that bill calls for rubles to be
printed in fourth quarter. Picks up 5th graf pvs, `The bill...' &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government won the go-ahead from
parliament Wednesday to begin printing billions of rubles in a bid
to help pay the state's crushing debt, but the move could stoke
already high inflation.
	   Russia's cash-strapped government needs the extra rubles to pay
off workers and pensioners, among others. But with inflation
running at around 70 percent this year, the cash injection could
push prices even higher.
	   In a bid to cover its huge budget deficit, the government has
already printed $648 million worth of rubles since October without
waiting for parliament approval.
	   Russia's parliament unanimously approved a bill Wednesday that
allows the government to print $1.2 billion worth of rubles in the
last quarter of this year.
	   The bill also requires Russian exporters to repatriate 75
percent of their hard-currency earnings, up from the current 50
percent in a bid to shore up foreign currency reserves.
	   The government meanwhile has drafted a budget for 1999 that
assumes foreign lenders will provide new loans which have not been
promised and restructure massive amounts of previous debt Russia
has failed to pay.
	   Russia defaulted on many of its treasury bonds in August,
sending financial markets into a nosedive and prompting foreign
lenders to freeze aid to Russia. The country is now mired in its
worst economic crisis since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants, after talks between the
World Bank representative in Moscow, expressed hope Russia could
receive $3.4 billion in loans from the World Bank next year.
	   But negotiations with foreign creditors over the defaulted
treasury bonds snagged when Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov
announced a deal had been reached _ a claim lenders quickly denied.
	   Zadornov claimed an agreement was reached to reissue $10 billion
dollars in bonds with maturities of four to five years.
	   Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse-First Boston, which are leading
negotiations with Russia, said they had not agreed to the Russian
terms.
	   In a rare good sign for the government's coffers, at least two
foreign companies have offered bids for a 2.5 percent stake in the
state-controlled natural gas giant, Gazprom, the Interfax news
agency reported Wednesday.
	   The government is asking at least $651 million for the stake _
significantly more than its market price.
	   Before debating the 1999 budget, parliament will first weigh
measures to streamline the nation's unwieldy tax system in a bid to
create incentives for ailing industries and persuade tax evaders to
pay what they owe.
	   Bills have been proposed to lower the value-added tax, currently
at 20 percent, and the profits tax, currently at 35 percent.

US warns Russia on technology transfers to Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE GEDDA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The State Department warned Russia on
Wednesday that expanded cooperation with U.S. companies in the
lucrative foreign commercial satellite field could be jeopardized
unless Russian entities cease collaboration with Iran's ballistic
missile program.
	   Using unusually blunt language, spokesman James P. Rubin also
said the United States is convinced that Iran is using its Bushehr
reactor project ``as a cover for acquiring sensitive Russian
nuclear technology.''
	   ``We have discussed our concerns at the highest levels,'' he
said. ``Russia has declined to halt all nuclear cooperation with
Iran.''
	   The rare public rebuke suggested that private efforts by the
administration to halt Russian-Iranian cooperation in the nuclear
and missile areas have not borne fruit.
	   Russia insists the Bushehr project is only for generating
electricity _ not for providing Iran with technology to build
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We are not interested in anybody acquiring biological, nuclear
or chemical weapons or missiles for their delivery, and this
naturally applies to all countries in the Middle East,'' Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said last week.
	   Rubin said Russia has given the United States commitments that
such cooperation will be offered only during the period of
construction at the Bushehr project, located in southern Iran.
	   ``Despite these commitments, we are aware that a number of
Russian entities are engaged in cooperation with Iran that goes
beyond the Bushehr reactor project,'' he said.
	   Eighteen of Russia's 48 satellite launches last year were for
U.S. firms. The launches were worth $60 million to $100 million
each for the Russian Space Agency, which has had trouble paying its
bills.
	   U.S. officials raised the possibility earlier this year of an
increase in such launches. But Rubin suggested that possibility may
now be in jeopardy.
	   ``The U.S. government will not be able to approve expansion of
the highly lucrative space launch market with Russia until Russian
entities cease cooperation with Iran's ballistic missile program,''
he said.
	   Iran denies U.S. charges that it is trying to develop weapons of
mass destruction.
	   However, the administration believes that individual Russians
may be acting without government authorization to assist the
Iranians, U.S. officials said.
	   Russia has thousands of underpaid scientists and the Americans
fear they may be tempted to sell their expertise to countries like
Iran. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars in
recent years to keep Russian scientists employed in peaceful
projects.
	   The Wall Street Journal, reporting in Tuesday's editions, said
intelligence reports say that officials from at least two key
Russian nuclear research institutes are quietly negotiating to sell
Iran a 40-megawatt heavy-water research reactor and a uranium
conversion facility.
	   While the talks are at an early stage, the reports suggest
Russian nuclear scientists are already secretly advising Iran on
how to produce heavy water and nuclear- grade graphite, the
newspaper said.
	   ``American officials believe the technology and information are
building blocks for a long range Iranian effort to manufacture
plutonium or highly enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb,'' it said.

 &UR; Rebel breaks silence, openly challenging party leader &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Megret openly challenging Le Pen; Party
fires 14 local leaders in rebel camp, other info &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ The rival of extreme-right National
Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen issued what amounted to a
declaration of war on Wednesday, openly contesting the leadership
of the party that appears irreparably divided.
	   ``The National Front is not family property,'' said Bruno
Megret, Le Pen's former top lieutenant.
	   ``If Jean-Marie Le Pen doesn't come to his senses, we'll have to
give him a push,'' Megret told a crowd of 400.
	   Earlier Wednesday, Le Pen fired 14 departmental secretaries --
all key allies of Megret, naming Le Pen backers to the posts.
	   Megret's party membership was suspended on Friday, along with
that of four Megret allies.
	   The National Front said Wednesday that Megret must appear
Tuesday before a disciplinary council along with his four cohorts.
Le Pen has accused them of disobedience.
	   The crisis within the National Front is centered on Megret's
call for a special party congress to heal divisions -- a move Le
Pen sees as a trap to unseat him.
	   On Tuesday, Megret's backers announced they will hold the party
congress Jan. 24. Megret reiterated Wednesday that the congress
would go forth, and added that he plans to become a candidate for
the Marseille mayor's post.
	   ``After serving as the guarantor of unity, Jean-Marie Le Pen
today is the divider of our movement,'' Megret said.
	   The understated Megret, 47, has until now allowed his backers to
speak so forthrightly, while he donned the role of peacemaker in
the face of the fiery 70-year-old Le Pen.
	   A poll published Wednesday showed that the National Front could
lose up to half its voting bloc over the feud.
	   The anti-immigration party, accused of racism and anti-Semitism,
traditionally takes up to 15 percent of the vote in elections.
	   The Sofres poll, conducted for the Nouvel Observateur magazine,
said 36 percent of National Front voters remain loyal to Le Pen,
while 33 percent back Megret.
	   If Le Pen and Megret present separate lists for next spring's
European elections, 41 percent of National Front supporters would
vote for another party and 12 percent would abstain, the survey
said. No margin of error was given.
	   Three hundred National Front supporters were questioned in the
survey.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Seven-year-old Ken Dryden looked under the tree
on Christmas Day 1954 and beheld a most beautiful sight: his first
hockey uniform.
	   To this day, he considers it the best Christmas present he's
ever received.
	   ``What I remember the most were the pants,'' Dryden said. ``They
were made of that material that's like satin and they were shiny.''
	   Now, the Hall of Fame goaltender and president-general manager
of the National Hockey League's Toronto Maple Leafs is preparing to
open a much bigger package: Air Canada Centre, the new home of the
Leafs and the National Basketball Association's Toronto Raptors.
	   Plans for the first NHL game Feb. 20 in the new arena and for
the last NHL game in Maple Leaf Gardens Feb. 13 were outlined
Wednesday by Dryden and Richard Peddie, president and CEO of Maple
Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the parent company of the NHL and
NBA teams.
	   A Feb. 6 open house with free tours and skating kicks things
off. After the final game in the Gardens, there will be a one-hour
postgame celebration broadcast live nationally by CBC and a street
party next door.
	   The Leafs have set aside 1,000 game tickets in the upper
sections, and fans can submit ballots to win the right to purchase
a pair at the regular price of dlrs 26.50 per ticket.
	   ``We knew that if we put them on public sale scalpers were going
to get them,'' Dryden said. ``Now we can't guarantee they're not
going to get them but we can make it harder.
	   ``We wanted to do as much as we could to see that the real fan
has a chance of getting into the building.''
	   The ballot winner who lives the furthest from Toronto will have
flights to the city and hotel reservations paid for by the Leafs,
Dryden said.
	   Scalpers are asking for as much as dlrs 3,500 a ticket for the
final game at Maple Leaf Gardens.
	   Leafs alumni _ anyone who played 50 or more games for the team _
will be a big part of the closing of the Gardens. About 155
qualify.
	   ``We've sent a note out to the alumni saying, `We want you to be
able to get into the game.,' '' Dryden said. `` `You get here,
you're in the building.' ''
	   Specific details about entertainment guests, anthem singers and
VIP alumni are being kept secret.
	   An Air Canada open house is Feb. 14, and a black tie gala Feb.
18 on the event floor is expected to raise dlrs 200,000 for
youth-related charities.
	   On Feb. 19, championship banners will be transferred from the
Gardens to the Air Canada Centre in a parade down Yonge Street. The
48th Highlanders pipe band will lead the way and former stars will
ride the route.
	   The Montreal Canadiens will play the Leafs in the first game in
the dlrs 265 million facility. There will be a special pregame
ceremony.

	   ASHLAND, Ky. (AP) _ Two Russian men were indicted by a grand
jury Wednesday on charges alleging they violated immigration laws,
according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
	   Ashot Kazaryan, 43, was indicted by the federal grand jury in
Ashland on two counts of transporting illegal aliens and two counts
of possessing false immigration documents. His hometown was listed
as Moscow and Brooklyn, N.Y.
	   Gocha Katsiashvili, 35, was charged with two counts of
possessing false immigration documents. His hometown was listed as
Tbilisis, Georgia, and Brooklyn, N.Y.
	   The men were arrested on Dec. 2 in Lexington while Katsiashvili
was allegedly attempting to obtain a Kentucky driver's license
using false identity documents.
	   An arraignment date was not set.

	   If they were U.S. attacks, they apparently did not target the
television, which continued to broadcast pictures of President
Saddam Hussein meeting with Baath Party officials earlier
Wednesday.
	   The state-run TV had no word on the attack.
	   There was also no word from the U.S. government.
	   But U.S. military officials had earlier said that an attack
against Iraq probably would begin with waves of up to 300
long-range cruise missiles in an operation designed to heavily
damage Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The attacks would come from the U.S. forces in the Gulf, mostly
aboard warships and aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
	   The 24,100 U.S. troops in the Gulf region are significantly
bolstered for such attacks with 15 B-52 heavy bombers and eight
Navy ships armed with long-range cruise missiles, the U.S.
officials said.
	   They said the tactical bombers and cruise missiles would lead
attacks that would most likely last several days and be geared to
cause ``major destruction'' of specific Iraqi targets.
	   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   They said the goal of the operation would be to cause as much
damage as possible to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
primarily chemical and biological weapons _ and the means the
country uses to produce and hide them.
	   Targets could also include those forces that keep Saddam Hussein
in power _ his Republican Guard units, the officials said. Other
targets would be Iraq's air defenses and mobile missiles and the
command-and-control units that operate Saddam's military forces,
the officials said.
	   One official said such an attack could last well into the
weekend.

Canadian downhill tears knee ligament in practice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VALGARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Canadian downhiller Ed Podivinsky
suffered a potentially season-ending knee injury Wednesday in the
opening practice for back-to-back World Cup races in this north
Italian valley.
	   Th 28-year-old Canadian skier fell after landing on a bump along
the icy Saslong course and Canada's head coach Max Gartner said he
possibly tore the anterior cruciate ligament of the left knee.
	   ``He will fly home tomorrow to undergo full medical
examinations,'' Gartner said. ``If the ligament is fully torn, it's
a season ending injury. It's an unfortunate accident.''
	   This season includes the World Alpine Skii Championships in
Vail, Colorado in February.
	   Podivinsky, a bronze medalist in the 1994 Olympic downhill who
already had his right knee reconstructed, did not crash but fell
after forcing on his left knee when he landed following a jump.
	   He stopped along the track, in pain, as the practice as
temporarily suspended.
	   The Canadian, whose only World Cup career victory dates back to
Saalbach in 1994, was considered the top Canadian entry in the two
downhills here.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns opened fire in Baghdad,
creating loud explosions over the Iraqi capital early Thursday.
	   Reporters in Baghdad heard explosions in the city begin about
12:49 a.m. Thursday (2149 GMT Wednesday.) A barrage of blasts
lighted the sky several hours after the United States warned that
it could make a military strike against Iraq at any time.
	   No aircraft were, however, immediately sighted or heard over the
night skies of the Iraqi capital.
	   It was not clear if the firing, which lasted about 10 minutes,
was an indication that U.S. air strikes had begun over Iraq.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton had ordered airstrikes on Iraq just
minutes before the blasts began, according to Congressional and
military sources in Washington.
	   Blasts resumed minutes later over Baghdad after a few minutes'
pause.
	   Baghdad residents heard distant explosions, but it was not clear
what caused them.
	   The initial anti-aircraft explosions were heard, following by a
second round of anti-aircraft burst a short while later that lasted
about 30 seconds.
	   The explosions shattered the glass windows of information
ministry near the center of Baghdad, where foreign reporters are
based.
	   There was no word from government officials also on the firing.
	   Few people were out at the time of the explosions and few cars

Rain forest fails to absorb excess carbon during El Nino
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Instead of inhaling extra carbon dioxide, Brazil's rain forest
does the opposite in an El Nino year, exhaling millions of tons of
the heat-trapping gas and potentially adding to global warming,
scientists say.
	   The rain forest, under normal conditions, acts as the ``lungs''
of the planet. Its dense canopy of trees stretches for thousands of
miles, releasing oxygen and absorbing as much as 635 million metric
tons (700 million tons) of carbon dioxide a year.
	   But when global climate conditions are scrambled by El Nino and
the rain forest becomes parched, scientists from the Woods Hole
Research Laboratory in Massachusetts determined the Amazon Basin
produces as much as 180 metric tons (200 million tons) of excess
carbon dioxide a year.
	   The calculations by Hanqin Tian and others are in Thursday's
journal Nature.
	   The study examined three El Nino episodes from 1980 to 1994. It
did not include measurements of the record-setting El Nino in
1997-98, but the trend is clear, researchers said.
	   ``In El Nino years, which bring hot and dry weather to much of
the Amazon, the ecosystems act as a source of carbon,'' Tian said.
	   Scientists say understanding the planet's fluctuating carbon
cycle is a key step in accurately predicting _ and managing _
global warming in the 21st century.
	   Some studies show global temperatures have been creeping up by
as much as one degree as industry, traffic, deforestation and other
human activities generate more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gases _ so called because they trap heat from the sun.
	   Many natural features on the planet act as ``carbon sinks'' to
absorb excess carbon and help to stabilize the planet's climate.
The oceans and the rain forests absorb the largest shares, along
with tundra and rangeland.
	   But not always.
	   During an El Nino, a vast pool of warm water expands in the
equatorial Pacific. It upsets weather patterns around the world. In
the Amazon, it triggers severe droughts.
	   Under such severe stress, the forest can't adequately
photosynthesize and store carbon dioxide, Tian said.
	   His results correspond with the results of carbon cycle
simulation developed at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, which
developed a computer model showing the Amazon acting as a carbon
source during three El Nino episodes between 1982-94.
	   Researchers at Max Planck said the Woods Hole study is based on
limited field measurements in a small sampling area, and failed to
answer the fundamental question of what is canceling the rain
forest's role as a carbon sink.
	   ``Such understanding is crucial for long-term predictions,''
said Colin Prentice, who with Planck colleague Jon Lloyd reviewed
the new study for Nature.
	   Several groups of scientists are trying to understand the
world's carbon cycle.
	   Last week, researchers launched a three-year study to find the
``missing sink'' to account for lower-than-expected carbon dioxide
levels in the Northern Hemisphere. A likely suspect: trees that
have re-grown in previously logged forests and farmland.
	   ``Something in the Northern Hemisphere is sucking up the
carbon,'' said climatologist Kevin Gurney of Colorado State
University. ``The missing sink isn't new, but where it is located
and how it works are still unresolved.''
	   Because of the hemisphere's large cities and industrialization,
carbon dioxide levels are expected to be higher. But measured
carbon emissions have been 1.8 billion metric tons (2 billion tons)
lower than expected in recent years.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Canada lost its second game of this week's Baltika
Cup when Sweden won 4-3 on Wednesday.
	   Sweden's Jan Huukko opened the scoring in the fifth minute but
was quickly equalized by a goal by Canada's Shayne Wright in the
ninth minute. Less than two minutes later, Sweden's Jan Larsson put
his team ahead.
	   Swedes Ove Molin and Stefan Hellqvist scored second period
goals. In the last five minutes of play, Canada's Deoff Peters and
Bob Maudie came through and scored.
	   Also Wednesday, the Czech Republic beat Finland 3-0 with strong
showings by goalkeepers Vesa Toskaladid and Jaroslav Kames and two
goals by Czech Tomas Vlasak.
	   Vlasak scored in the fourth and 37th minutes, and Miroslav
Hlinka scored in the 20th.
	   The tournament, which also features Russia, is the third of four
legs of the Euro Hockey Tour and features each country's best
players outside the North American National Hockey League.
	   The five teams are playing round robin format all week until
Sunday's final.
	   Also Wednesday, Russia and Belarus held an ``old-timers'''
hockey match in which visiting Belarusian President Alexander
Lukashenko played as a forward.

Ronaldo, Batistuta entertain; Italy beats All-Stars 5-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Dream Team collection of soccer stars did not
disappoint _ but they were upstaged.
	   Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Gabriel Batistuta and George Weah
provided plenty of fancy footwork, slick passes and both goals for
the FIFA World All-Stars Wednesday night but lost 6-2 to Italy's
national team in an exhibition game commemorating the centennial of
the hosts' soccer federation.
	   Stealing some of the more ballyhooed foreigners' thunder were
Enrico Chiesa, who tallied a 30-minute hat-trick after
intermission, and Demetrio Albertini, who assisted on all three of
Italy's first-half goals before about 20,000 spectators at Olympic
Stadium.
	   A damper on the festivities came hours before the match, when
former Italian federation president Antonio Matarrese was
officially notified that he is under investigation in connection
with Rome prosecutors' inquiries into the use of
performance-enhancing substances in soccer.
	   ``I understand that the prosecutors have a job to do, but what
they did today makes no sense,'' said Matarrese, now a UEFA vice
president, in the stands at Olympic Stadium.
	   On another somber note, the game began with a moment of silence
for the victims of a collapsed apartment building in the capital
early Wednesday morning. At least 20 people died.
	   ``Those are things that are upsetting. We were all a little
down,'' said Italy striker Francesco Totti, a Roman whose Serie A
club, AS Roma, plays its home games at the stadium. ``But with all
these stars on the field, I think the public must have enjoyed the
action.''
	   Judging by their smiles and mostly care-free play, so did the
players.
	   Liberian striker Weah, FIFA's 1995 Player of the Year, scored a
goal early _ and then played most of the second half as a defender.
Zidane, expected to win that award this year for leading France to
its first World Cup title, set up the Argentine Batistuta's goal
with a spectacular no-look pass.
	   And Ronaldo, the two-time FIFA honoree, played 31 minutes,
providing glimpses of the brilliance that has been rare lately as
he battles knee tendinitis.
	   ``The most important thing is to have fun and we certainly did
that,'' the Brazilian said.
	   It was clear immediately that defense was not a priority.
	   Totti was given enough time to measure two long-range shots in
the opening five minutes, but sent both barely wide.
	   The hosts went ahead in the ninth minute, when Albertini sent a
long cross that Juventus striker Filippo Inzaghi volleyed in off
the underside of the crossbar from 10 meters (yards) out.
	   That woke up the All-Stars, with Zidane soon sending a pass to a
streaking Ronaldo on the right flank. The Brazilian tried to lob
over a charging Angelo Peruzzi, but the Juventus 'keeper leapt to
block the shot. Ronaldo gathered the ball, but was unceremoniously
dumped by Italy captain Paolo Maldini.
	   Ronaldo also took a smack to the face from defender Christian
Panucci when they fought for the ball along the sideline.
	   In the 19th, Weah set up Ronaldo with a through-ball, but the
Internazionale star couldn't quite get off a shot. Two minutes
later, Zidane looked to his right _ drawing four Italian defenders
_ and sent the ball to his left, where Batistuta sent a blast under
the crossbar from 12 meters (yards).
	   Two minutes later, Ronaldo dribbled up the left side, completely
faked out AC Parma defender Fabio Cannavaro and rolled the ball
across the goalmouth, where Weah ran on to knock it home.
	   ``Either you play well or you get burned by these great
strikers,'' Italy captain Paolo Maldini said.
	   Albertini set up goals by Roma's Eusebio Di Francesco in the
37th minute and by Parma's Diego Fuser in the 44th, while Chiesa
came on for Totti in the second half _ marked by wholesale
substitutions _ and tallied in the 57th, 80th and 86th minutes.
	   The game also saw the return to the Azzurri of defender
Alessandro Nesta, who broke his leg during Italy's first-round win
over Austria at the World Cup.
	   The teams:
	   Italy _ Angelo Peruzzi (substitute: Gianluigi Buffon, 46th
minute); Christian Panucci, Alessandro Nesta (Paolo Negro, 40th),
Fabio Cannavaro (Moreno Torricelli, 46th), Paolo Maldini (Gianluca
Pessotto, 65th); Diego Fuser, Dino Baggio (Sandro Cois, 46th),
Demetrio Albertini (Damiano Tommasi, 46th), Eusebio Di Francesco
(Jonathan Bachini, 46th); Filippo Inzaghi (Marco Delvecchio, 46th),
Francesco Totti (Enrico Chiesa, 56th).
	   World _ Gianluca Pagliuca (Ike Shorunmu, 46th); Dunga (Joao
Pinto, 65th); Fernando Hierro (Hidetoshi Nakata, 56th), Ze Maria,
David Nyathi; Aron Winter (Julen Guerrero, 46th), Rui Costa (Luis
Hernandez, 46th), Zinedine Zidane (Marcelo Salas, 46th); George
Weah, Gabriel Batitusta (Oliver Bierhoff, 46th), Ronaldo (Davor
Suker, 31st).

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns opened fire in Baghdad
early Thursday, lighting up the night sky and creating loud
explosions over the Iraqi capital. In Washington, the United States
announced it has begun military strikes.
	   No aircraft or missiles were, however, sighted or heard over
Baghdad.
	   The first round of anti-aircraft explosions were heard at 0949
GMT (12:49 a.m. Thursday Baghdad time). A second round of
anti-aircraft burst was unleashed at 1 a.m.
	   Orange glows streaked toward the sky as the anti-aircraft guns
let loose volley after volley of shots.
	   The explosions shook the glass windows of the Information
Ministry building near the center of Baghdad, where foreign
reporters are required to work from.
	   There was no word from the government on the firing.
	   Few people were out at the time of the explosions and few cars
were on the streets of the capital.
	   The U.S. attacks apparently did not target the state-run
television station, which continued to broadcast pictures of
President Saddam Hussein meeting with the ruling Baath Party
officials on Wednesday. The TV had no word on the attack.
	   U.S. military officials had earlier said that an attack against
Iraq probably would begin with waves of up to 300 long-range cruise
missiles in an operation designed to heavily damage Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
	   Thursday's attack would have come from the U.S. forces in the
Gulf, mostly aboard warships and aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
	   The 24,100 U.S. troops in the Gulf region are significantly
bolstered for such attacks with 15 B-52 heavy bombers and eight
Navy ships armed with long-range cruise missiles, the U.S.
officials had said.
	   They said the tactical bombers and cruise missiles would lead
attacks that would most likely last several days and be geared to
cause ``major destruction'' of specific Iraqi targets.
	   The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   They said the goal of the operation would be to cause as much
damage as possible to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
primarily chemical and biological weapons _ and the means the
country uses to produce and hide them.
	   Targets could also include those forces that keep Saddam Hussein
in power _ his Republican Guard units, the officials said. Other
targets would be Iraq's air defenses and mobile missiles and the
command-and-control units that operate Saddam's military forces,
the officials said.
	   One official said such an attack could last well into the
weekend.

Israel in a state of readiness in case of attack on Iraq

 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is closely watching the U.S. air strike
on Iraq, officials said Thursday, and has readied its forces for a
possible attack.
	   President Bill Clinton ordered air strikes against Iraq in
response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of U.N. arms
inspectors.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai called a meeting of
his senior staff after reports anti-aircraft fire emerged from
Baghdad just before midnight Wednesday.
	   ``Preparations are being made,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier, Mordechai said that three U.S. Patriot anti-missile
batteries dispatched to Israel last week stood ready in case of an
Iraqi attack, and that other U.S. defense systems were ready to be
dispatched to Israel very quickly if needed.
	   ``We have readied our forces, and we will decide tonight on
steps (to take),'' Mordechai told reporters Wednesday night.
	   ``There is also our entire system of readiness that we would use
the moment there is information that an attack took place,''
Mordechai added, suggesting that Israel did not expect advance
warning of a U.S. attack on Iraq.
	   Iraq directed Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War,
although Israel was not a participant in the U.S.-led effort to
drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
	   Since that war, U.N. inspectors have sought to ensure that Iraq
had divested itself of a weapons-of-mass-destruction capability.
	   Failure to cooperate with the inspectors has precipitated
several near-attacks by U.S. and British forces on Iraq.
	   During such crises, Israelis have been placed on alert for a
possible chemical attack from Iraq.
	   Israel had not issued any special warnings to its citizens
Wednesday.
	   ``If we feel that there's any need to inform of any special
measures that citizens should take, we'll make the announcement,''
said David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.

Court rules that Kurdish leader free to leave country
</HEADLINE>

premier saying Ocalan will be under surveillance; Turkish vow to
bring Ocalan to justice; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Angering the Turkish government, a Rome court
Wednesday lifted restrictions on Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, leaving him free to leave the country.
	   The ruling followed a decision by Germany to withdraw the
international arrest warrant it had issued for Ocalan, who was
wanted on terrorism charges, news reports said.
	   Ocalan had been staying in a Rome villa and had been barred from
leaving the city.
	   The leader of the Kurdistan Workers party, or PKK, was detained
in Rome on Nov. 12 when he arrived on a flight from Moscow.
	   He is wanted in his home country of Turkey for trial on
terrorism charges. But Italy refuses to return him to Turkey, where
he faces a possible death sentence, sparking tensions between the
two countries and prompting an unofficial boycott of Italian
products by Turks.
	   Italy's constitution doesn't permit extradition to a country of
a person who could be executed.
	   It is not clear what will happen next.
	   Premier Massimo D'Alema said Ocalan will continue to be kept
under surveillance.
	   Ocalan has asked Italy for political asylum, but the country's
center-left government, led by former Communist D'Alema, is split
over what to do.
	   Italy has indicated it might try Ocalan or expel him to a third
country. Those mentioned include Pakistan, Libya and North Korea.
Italy on Wednesday denied reports that it planned to send Ocalan to
Albania.
	   Italy has also appealed to the European Union to help it set up
an international tribunal to try the Kurdish rebel, but D'Alema
said Wednesday that Turkey's rejection of that idea complicated
that possible option.
	   Following a special meeting of the Turkish foreign ministry, the
ministry said the Italian ruling was ``impossible to understand.''
	   ``It should be known that whatever the leader of the terrorist
organization does, we will not give up our aim of bringing him to
justice,'' the ministry said.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
the United States is disturbed by the reported German decison to
withdraw the warrant.
	   ``The United States believes that Ocalan should be brought to
justice for the terrorist crimes of which he is accused, in a
manner consistent with international standards,'' Rubin said,
adding U.S. officials have been in touch with senior levels of the
Italian government to urge that Ocalan not be allowed to go free.
	   Close to 37,000 people have been killed since Ocalan's rebel
group began fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey in 1984.

Late Zola leveller as Chelsea holds Reds 1-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Gianfranco Zola's equalizer seven
minutes from the end prevented Manchester United from going top of
the Premier League Wednesday as Chelsea fought back for a 1-1 tie
at Old Trafford.
	   Returning to his best form, the Italian dribbled through the
center of the United defense in the 84th minute, drew goalkeeper
Peter Schmeichel from his line and rolled the ball into an empty
net to cancel out Andy Cole's first half strike for the Reds.
	   Zola's goal came a minute after Roberto Di Matteo had wasted a
similar chance, dribbling past Schmeichel but failing to hit the
target. And Chelsea almost snatched the winner in the final minute,
a 30-meter shot from Nigerian star Celestine Babayaro hitting the
outside of the post with the Danish goalkeeper beaten.
	   The result meant that United remained second, two points behind
Aston Villa and Chelsea moved up to third ahead of Leeds and three
points behind Villa.
	   Cole's goal came towards the end of an untidy first half which
was littered with fouls and poor passing.
	   A leftwing cross from Jesper Blomqvist landed at his feet and he
fired low past Chelsea's Dutch 'keeper, Ed de Goey, with a shot
that went in off the inside of the post.
	   United should have gone further ahead midway through the second
half with a rightwing cross fell to Blomqvist with only De Goey to
beat but his poorly-struck shot floated well wide.
	   It proved costly for Alex Ferguson's team which has only beaten
Chelsea four times in their last 24 meetings.

Paramilitary leader indicted in 1990 slaying of presidential
</HEADLINE>
candidate &QL; 
 &UR; By VIVIAN SEQUERA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Prosecutors on Wednesday indicted the
fugitive leader of Colombia's right-wing paramilitary groups and
his brother in the 1990 machine-gun slaying of a leftist
presidential candidate.
	   Militia boss Carlos Castano and his brother Fidel were accused
of ordering the March 1990 assassination at Bogota's international
airport of Bernardo Jaramillo, candidate of the Patriotic Union
party, composed largely of former guerrillas.
	   The Castano brothers are founders of Colombia's feared
paramilitary groups, which arose in the early 1980s as a response
to kidnapping and extortion by leftist rebels. The groups are
responsible for widespread massacres of civilians accused of
guerrilla ties.
	   Jaramillo was one of about 3,000 Patriotic Union party members
killed over the past decade by right-wing death squads, many
believed linked to paramilitary groups, which have been bankrolled
by large landholders and drug traffickers.
	   Carlos and Fidel Castano already face multiple murder and
kidnapping charges in connection with their militia activities.
	   Carlos Castano heads the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia,
which groups an estimated 7,000 paramilitary fighters, and the
location of his hideout in the mountains is periodically visited by
journalists and lawmakers.
	   Police have not attempted to arrest Carlos Castano, however,
saying it would take a military attack to capture him. The armed
forces, whose members have often tacitly supported the right-wing
militias, have shown no interest in trying to capture him either.
	   Carlos Castano claims his brother, Fidel, is dead. But federal
investigators say they have no proof and suspect Fidel Castano has
changed his appearance through plastic surgery and may be living in
Medellin, the country's second-largest city.
	   Charges were also filed Wednesday against a jailed former top
lieutenant of late-Medellin drug lord Pablo Escobar said to have
been the middleman in the killing. Prosecutors said Gustavo Adolfo
Mesa, jailed in 1990 on unrelated charges, hired the 16-year-old
assassin who shot Jaramillo.

Israel in a state of readiness in case of attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Clinton ordering strikes; Defense
Ministry staff meeting; quote from Netanyahu aide &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is closely watching the U.S. air strike
on Iraq, officials said Thursday, and has readied its forces for a
possible attack.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered air strikes against Iraq in
response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of U.N. arms
inspectors.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai called a meeting of
his senior staff after reports anti-aircraft fire emerged from
Baghdad just before midnight Wednesday.
	   ``Preparations are being made,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman
said while speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Earlier, Mordechai said that three U.S. Patriot anti-missile
batteries dispatched to Israel last week stood ready in case of an
Iraqi attack, and that other U.S. defense systems were ready to be
dispatched to Israel very quickly if needed.
	   ``We have readied our forces, and we will decide tonight on
steps (to take),'' Mordechai told reporters Wednesday night.
	   ``There is also our entire system of readiness that we would use
the moment there is information that an attack took place,''
Mordechai added, suggesting that Israel did not expect advance
warning of a U.S. attack on Iraq.
	   Iraq directed Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War,
although Israel was not a participant in the U.S.-led effort to
drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
	   Since that war, U.N. inspectors have sought to ensure that Iraq
had divested itself of a weapons-of-mass-destruction capability.
	   Failure to cooperate with the inspectors has precipitated
several near-attacks by U.S. and British forces on Iraq.
	   During such crises, Israelis have been placed on alert for a
possible chemical attack from Iraq.
	   Israel had not issued any special warnings to its citizens
Wednesday.
	   ``If we feel that there's any need to inform of any special
measures that citizens should take, we'll make the announcement,''
said David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.

U.S. military launches military strike over Iraq

EDITS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns opened fire in Baghdad
early Thursday, lighting up the night sky and creating loud
explosions over the Iraqi capital.
	   In Washington, the United States announced it has begun military
strikes to punish Iraq for obstructing the work of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking to reporters outside
10 Downing Street in London, said he authorized the participation
of British forces in the attack, codenamed Operation Desert Fox.
	   In Baghdad, the first round of anti-aircraft explosions was
heard at 12:49 a.m. Thursday (2149 GMT Wednesday). A second round
of anti-aircraft burst was unleashed at 1 a.m.
	   Orange glows streaked toward the sky as the anti-aircraft guns
let loose volley after volley of shots.
	   No aircraft or missiles were, however, sighted or heard over
Baghdad.
	   The explosions shook the glass windows of the Information
Ministry building near the center of Baghdad, where foreign
reporters are required to work from.
	   There was no word from the government on the firing.
	   Few people were out at the time of the explosions and few cars
were on the streets.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the U.S. military
forces, ``have launched a substantial military strikes against
Iraq.'' Military officials said the attacks involved long-range
missiles.
	   The U.S. attacks apparently did not target the state-run
television station, which continued to broadcast pictures of
President Saddam Hussein meeting with the ruling Baath Party
officials on Wednesday. The TV had no word on the attack.
	   U.S. military officials had earlier said that an attack against
Iraq probably would begin with waves of up to 300 long-range cruise
missiles in an operation designed to heavily damage Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction.
	   Thursday's attack would have come from the U.S. forces in the
Gulf, including 22 warships and the aircraft carrier USS
Enterprise.
	   The 24,100 U.S. troops in the Gulf region are significantly
bolstered for such attacks with 15 B-52 heavy bombers and eight
Navy ships armed with long-range cruise missiles.
	   The U.S. officials had said that the goal of the operation would
be to cause as much damage as possible to Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction _ primarily chemical and biological weapons _ and the
means the country uses to produce and hide them.
	   U.N. inspectors have been trying since 1991 to dismantle these
weapons. Chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, who heads the
United Nations Special Commission, or UNSCOM, withdrew the
inspectors on Wednesday, saying Iraq was obstructing their work.
	   Iraq denies the charge and says it has no more illegal weapons.
But until UNSCOM endorses that, the U.N. Security Council cannot
lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with TV report Ocalan wants to remain in Italy &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Angering the Turkish government, a Rome court
Wednesday lifted restrictions on Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, leaving him free to leave the country.
	   The ruling followed a decision by Germany to withdraw the
international arrest warrant it had issued for Ocalan, who was
wanted on terrorism charges, news reports said.
	   Ocalan had been staying in a Rome villa and had been barred from
leaving the city.
	   The leader of the Kurdistan Workers party, or PKK, was detained
in Rome on Nov. 12 when he arrived on a flight from Moscow.
	   He is wanted in his home country of Turkey for trial on
terrorism charges. But Italy refuses to return him to Turkey, where
he faces a possible death sentence, sparking tensions between the
two countries and prompting an unofficial boycott of Italian
products by Turks.
	   Italy's constitution doesn't permit extradition to a country of
a person who could be executed.
	   It is not clear what will happen next.
	   Premier Massimo D'Alema said Ocalan will continue to be kept
under surveillance, and a report on a private Turkish TV station
NTV said that Ocalan wants to remain in Italy.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns opened fire in Baghdad
early Thursday, and U.S. and British officials announced they had
launched a series of airstrikes. No attacking planes or missiles
were immediately seen over the Iraqi capital.
	   The Iraqi blasts created loud explosions, violently shaking the
glass windows of the Information Ministry building near the center
of Baghdad where foreign reporters are based.
	   Orange glows streaked toward the sky as the anti-aircraft guns
let loose volley after volley of shots.
	   The explosions begin about 12:49 a.m. Thursday (2149 GMT
Wednesday). A barrage of blasts lighted the sky several hours after
the Clinton administration warned that it would make a military
strike against Iraq at any time.
	   President Clinton ordered airstrikes on Iraq over a protracted
impasse with Iraq over U.N. weapons inspections just minutes before
the blasts began.
	   Less than an hour later, Prime Minister Tony Blair announced the
British had participated in the airstrikes.
	   Earlier in the day, long lines formed outside Baghdad gas
stations and customers cursed Clinton for planning an attack before
the holy Islamic month of Ramadan, which is expected to begin
Sunday.
	   ``It seems that Clinton ... wants to kill some people in a hurry
out of respect for Ramadan,'' said Amin Jadir, 52, a government
worker.
	   The crisis unfolded quickly after chief inspector Richard Butler
ordered his monitors out of the country, accusing Iraq of
obstructing their search for weapons of mass destruction.
	   In Washington, Clinton met with his top national security
advisers before ordering the attack, and the U.N. Security Council
held an emergency meeting in New York on the crisis.
	   Blair blamed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for precipitating the
impasse: ``This action could have been avoided. ... Our quarrel is
with him alone and the evil regime which he represents.''
	   In Baghdad, a special joint meeting of the decision-making
Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath Party issued a
statement, saying Iraqis can ``depend on God to knock the dreams
out of ... (the) empty heads'' of the United States and Britain,
which has backed the U.S. line on Iraq.
	   Baghdad residents heard distant explosions, but it was not clear
what caused them. The initial anti-aircraft explosions were heard,
following by a second round of anti-aircraft bursts a short while
later that lasted about 30 seconds.
	   There was no word from government officials also on the firing.
	   Few people were out at the time of the explosions and few cars
were on the streets of the capital.
	   Air raid sirens sounded briefly in Baghdad shortly before
midnight local time. Earlier, Iraqi television interrupted regular
programming to play patriotic music and footage of Iraqi commandos
training with machine guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled
grenade launchers.
	   Any strike would come from the Gulf, where the United States has
24,100 military men and women. There also are 22 warships,
including eight with Tomahawk cruise missiles, and 201 aircraft,
including 72 on the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. Britain has 22
strike aircraft in the region.
	   Earlier Wednesday, three trucks loaded with luggage left the
U.N. headquarters in Baghdad. About a half-hour later, three
busloads of weapons inspectors also left the U.N. compound,
followed by four white U.N. cars carrying spare tires on top.
	   Most of the 140 inspectors, who work for the U.N. Special
Commission, or UNSCOM, flew aboard a special U.N. plane from an
airbase outside Baghdad to the gulf state of Bahrain.
	   ``All international staff ... have been pulled out from
Baghdad,'' UNSCOM spokeswoman Caroline Cross said in Bahrain.
``There is nobody left behind.''
	   The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is monitoring
Iraq's compliance on dismantling its nuclear program, also withdrew
its staff from Baghdad. UNSCOM is responsible for eliminating
Iraq's chemical and biological weapons.
	   Until these weapons are destroyed, the United Nations will lift
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which led to the Persian Gulf war.
	   Iraq says it has complied with every U.N. demand, and accuses
Butler of prolonging the inspections at the behest of the United
States.
	   On Tuesday, Butler gave a report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in which he said Iraq's claim to be free of banned weapons
``cannot be accepted without further verification.'' But
verification is impossible as Iraq is obstructing the inspectors,
he said.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton ordered a ``substantial
military strike'' against Iraq Wednesday because of its continued
failure to allow U.N. weapons inspections.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president ordered
the strikes Wednesday morning after reading the latest U.N. reports
about noncompliance by the Iraqis and consulting with his national
security staff.
	   ``At the direction of the president, the United States military
forces have launched a substantial military strike against Iraq,''
Lockhart said.
	   Clinton planned to address the nation on television later
Wednesday.
	   The attack involved long-range cruise missiles, military
officials said.
	   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott criticized the action even
before it was formally announced.
	   ``While I have been assured by administration officials that
there is no connection with the impeachment process in the House of
Representatives, I cannot support this military action in the
Persian Gulf at this time,'' his statement said.
	   ``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question,'' he
said in a statement issued shortly before the sound of
anti-aircraft guns erupted over Baghdad.
	   The House was scheduled to begin debate on four articles of
impeachment against Clinton on Thursday, with votes likely on
Friday. House leaders were discussing plans to postpone impeachment
votes in the event of airstrikes.
	   Republican sources, who asked not to be identified by name, said
that Defense Secretary William Cohen, CIA director George Tenet,
and Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would
brief lawmakers in a closed session on the House floor at
mid-evening.
	   At the Pentagon, top military officials put into action attack
plans that had been put on hold a month ago. The military planners
envisioned an attack lasting up to four days led by the cruise
missiles.
	   At the State Department, spokesman James Rubin read a long list
of U.S. grievances with Iraq that included barring inspection of
the office of the ruling Baath party, stripping suspect sites of
files and furniture and buzzing a U.N. helicopter.
	   ``This is a grave matter,'' Rubin said.
	   The array of U.S. air power poised to strike Iraq is even more
extensive than was assembled in November, when Iraq narrowly
averted a U.S. attack with a last-minute promise to cooperate with
U.N. inspectors. If Clinton ordered an attack time, the goal would
be to significantly degrade Iraqi President Saddam's ability to
reconstitute an arsenal of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
and perhaps to cripple the Republican Guard forces that are crucial
to Saddam's hold on power.
	   State Department spokesman Rubin said the administration has
lost hope that Iraq would reverse course and offer serious
cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors. He noted that Clinton
had given Saddam a reprieve in mid-November on the basis of a
pledge of noninterference.
	   In the Gulf region already are 24,100 U.S. military men and
women; 22 ships, eight armed with Tomahawk cruise missiles; and 201
military aircraft, among them 15 Air Force B-52 bombers also
equipped with cruise missiles. The bombers are based on the Indian
Ocean island of Diego Garcia.
	   One aircraft carrier battle group is in the Gulf; another is on
its way.
	   The U.N. Security Council met in emergency session Wednesday to
discuss chief inspector Butler's report that Iraq failed to
cooperate fully with U.N. monitors. The council met for about 90
minutes and agreed to resume consultations later.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair said Wednesday night he
had authorized British participation in an attack on Iraq minutes
before, coordinated with the United States.
	   ``Operation Desert Fox was launched at 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) London
Time,'' Blair said to reporters outside Downing Street.
	   ``British involvement will be significant,'' he said.
	   On Tuesday, a report by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler accused Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein of not meeting promises
made last month to fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors and of
imposing new restrictions on their work.
	   ``Despite constant lies, prevarication and breaching of the
agreed conditions, the weapons inspectors carried out their task,
uncovering in the process vast evidence of weapons of mass
destruction,'' Blair said.
	   ``Saddam has no intention whatever of keeping to his word,'' he
added. ``He is a serial breaker of promises.''
	   Britain has stood alongside the United States in threatening to
attack Iraq, and its forces were to have joined with American units
in a strike that was called off in mid-November.
	   ``The threat is now, and it is a threat to his neighbors, to his
people and to the security of the world,'' Blair said Wednesday
night.
	   After more than a year of broken promises, he said, ``we have no
option but to act.''
	   ``Our quarrel is with him alone, and the evil regime which he
represents,'' he said of Saddam ``There is no realistic alternative
to military force. We take this military action with real regret
and also with real determination. We have exhausted all other
avenues. We act because we must.''
	   Blair said Hussein had had every opportunity to sell sufficient
oil to buy medicines and feed his people.
	   ``Our quarrel is not with the Iraqi people. It never has been,''
he said. ``The whole world should know that we have allowed Saddam
to sell oil to buy as much food and medicine for the Iraqi people
as is necessary.''

China condemns use of force against Iraq as bombs fall

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ China condemned the use of force against
Iraq Wednesday as an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council
broke up after reports that the United States had launched a
bombing campaign against Iraq.
	   A badly divided council had been discussing a report by chief
U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler which concluded that Iraq had
not kept its promise to cooperate with inspectors during the past
month.
	   The council was expected to meet again late Wednesday after
diplomats consult their capitals.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who was instrumental in defusing
crises with Iraq in February and November, emerged from the
emergency council meeting looking grim.
	   Asked whether he had any comment on reports that Baghdad was
being bombed, he replied: ``No comment.''
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon met Annan before the
attacks began and asked him ``to try to do whatever in his capacity
to dissuade certain members of the Security Council not to do
anything that has not been adopted by the Security Council.''
	   But it was too late and the Iraqi envoy appeared resigned to a
U.S. attack.
	   ``It looks like the United States is determined to go for a
military strike regardless of what the Security Council membership
feel about it, and that's very bad,'' Hamdoon said.
	   The United States and Britain called off airstrikes after Iraq
promised on Nov. 14 to cooperate fully with the weapons inspectors
and allow unfettered access to all sites and documents. But after
Butler reported Tuesday that ``Iraq did not provide the full
cooperation it promised'' the prospect of military action
intensified.
	   The United States and Britain insist they have authority under
previous Security Council resolutions to attack Iraq in an effort
to force Baghdad's full compliance with the inspectors.
	   But Iraq's most vocal supporters on the council _ Russia, France
and China _ insist the Security Council must sanction any military
action.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from the meeting.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said. ``The use of force not only has serious
consequences for the implementation of Security Council resolutions
but also poses a threat to international as well as regional
stability.''
	   The council is also divided over the negative tone of Butler's
report and his decision to evacuate all inspectors from Baghdad
without consulting council members.
	   In his report Tuesday to Annan, Butler said Iraq had imposed new
restrictions on the work of the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which he heads. And he said Iraq's conduct over the past
month ``ensured that no progress was able to be made in either the
fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited weapons
programs.''
	   Qin said Butler's report ``is apparently one-sided and does not
reflect the situation on the ground.''
	   He said UNSCOM should have consulted the council before
evacuating the inspection team, a view echoed by Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov. He accused Butler of overstepping his
authority and Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov suggested that
if the chief inspector couldn't do his work, perhaps he should
think about looking for a new job.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is closely watching the U.S. air strikes
on Iraq, officials said Thursday, and has readied its forces for a
possible attack.
	   President Bill Clinton ordered air strikes against Iraq in
response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of U.N. arms
inspectors.
	   Aviv Bushinsky, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's media
advisor, said in a statement that Netanyahu was told of U.S.
intentions to attack Iraq Wednesday afternoon and that he was
updated by the White House minutes after the attack.
	   Bushinsky added that Netanyahu and Clinton discussed the attack
Tuesday on the tarmac in Ben Gurion Airport minutes before Clinton
departed for Washington.
	   ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take care
of defending itself if the need arises,'' Netanyahu was quoted as
saying in the statement released by Bushisky.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai called a meeting of
his senior staff at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv after reports
of anti-aircraft fire emerged from Baghdad just before midnight
Wednesday.
	   ``Preparations are being made,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Israel TV said that
Mordechai was updated by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
after the attack.
	   Earlier, Mordechai said that three U.S. Patriot anti-missile
batteries dispatched to Israel last week stood ready in case of an
Iraqi attack, and that other U.S. defense systems were ready to be
dispatched to Israel very quickly if needed.
	   ``We have readied our forces, and we will decide tonight on
steps (to take),'' Mordechai told reporters Wednesday night.
	   ``There is also our entire system of readiness that we would use
the moment there is information that an attack took place,''
	   Iraq directed Scud missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War,
although Israel was not a participant in the U.S.-led effort to
drive Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
	   Since that war, U.N. inspectors have sought to ensure that Iraq
had divested itself of a weapons-of-mass-destruction capability.
	   Failure to cooperate with the inspectors has precipitated
several near-attacks by U.S. and British forces on Iraq.
	   During such crises, Israelis have been placed on alert for a
possible chemical attack from Iraq.
	   Israel had not issued any special warnings to its citizens
Wednesday.
	   ``If we feel that there's any need to inform of any special
measures that citizens should take, we'll make the announcement,''
said David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is closely watching the U.S. air strikes
on Iraq, officials said Thursday, and has readied its forces for a
possible attack.
	   President Bill Clinton ordered air strikes against Iraq in
response to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of U.N. arms
inspectors.
	   Aviv Bushinsky, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's media
advisor, said in a statement that Netanyahu was told of U.S.
intentions to attack Iraq Wednesday afternoon and that he was
updated by the White House minutes after the attack.
	   Bushinsky added that Netanyahu and Clinton discussed the attack
Tuesday on the tarmac in Ben Gurion Airport minutes before Clinton
departed for Washington.
	   ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take care
of defending itself if the need arises,'' Netanyahu was quoted as
saying in the statement released by Bushisky.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai called a meeting of
his senior staff at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv after reports
of anti-aircraft fire emerged from Baghdad just before midnight
Wednesday.
	   ``Preparations are being made,'' a Defense Ministry spokesman
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Israel TV said that
Mordechai was updated by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
after the attack.
	   Earlier, Mordechai said that three U.S. Patriot anti-missile
batteries dispatched to Israel last week stood ready in case of an
Iraqi attack, and that other U.S. defense systems were ready to be

US warns Russia on technology transfers to Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS one graf after 11th graf pvs `The U.S. government'
with background on satellite launches.
 &UR; By GEORGE GEDDA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The State Department warned Russia on
Wednesday that expanded cooperation with U.S. companies in the
lucrative foreign commercial satellite field could be jeopardized
unless Russian entities cease collaboration with Iran's ballistic
missile program.
	   Using unusually blunt language, spokesman James P. Rubin also
said the United States is convinced that Iran is using its Bushehr
reactor project ``as a cover for acquiring sensitive Russian
nuclear technology.''
	   ``We have discussed our concerns at the highest levels,'' he
said. ``Russia has declined to halt all nuclear cooperation with
Iran.''
	   The rare public rebuke suggested that private efforts by the
administration to halt Russian-Iranian cooperation in the nuclear
and missile areas have not borne fruit.
	   Russia insists the Bushehr project is only for generating
electricity _ not for providing Iran with technology to build
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We are not interested in anybody acquiring biological, nuclear
or chemical weapons or missiles for their delivery, and this
naturally applies to all countries in the Middle East,'' Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said last week.
	   Rubin said Russia has given the United States commitments that
such cooperation will be offered only during the period of
construction at the Bushehr project, located in southern Iran.
	   ``Despite these commitments, we are aware that a number of
Russian entities are engaged in cooperation with Iran that goes
beyond the Bushehr reactor project,'' he said.
	   Eighteen of Russia's 48 satellite launches last year were for
U.S. firms. The launches were worth $60 million to $100 million
each for the Russian Space Agency, which has had trouble paying its
bills.
	   U.S. officials raised the possibility earlier this year of an
increase in such launches. But Rubin suggested that possibility may
now be in jeopardy.
	   ``The U.S. government will not be able to approve expansion of
the highly lucrative space launch market with Russia until Russian
entities cease cooperation with Iran's ballistic missile program,''
he said.
	   U.S. firms find Russian satellite launches efficient and
relatively low cost and are eager to do more business with the
Russians. But the administration has put a cap on such launches
based on criteria linked to Russian non-proliferation performance,
U.S. officials said. They said U.S. companies have contracted for
seven more launches left between now and the end of the year 2000.
	   Iran denies U.S. charges that it is trying to develop weapons of
mass destruction.
	   However, the administration believes that individual Russians
may be acting without government authorization to assist the
Iranians, U.S. officials said.
	   Russia has thousands of underpaid scientists and the Americans
fear they may be tempted to sell their expertise to countries like
Iran. The U.S. government has spent tens of millions of dollars in
recent years to keep Russian scientists employed in peaceful
projects.
	   The Wall Street Journal, reporting in Tuesday's editions, said
intelligence reports say that officials from at least two key
Russian nuclear research institutes are quietly negotiating to sell
Iran a 40-megawatt heavy-water research reactor and a uranium
conversion facility.
	   While the talks are at an early stage, the reports suggest
Russian nuclear scientists are already secretly advising Iran on
how to produce heavy water and nuclear- grade graphite, the
newspaper said.
	   ``American officials believe the technology and information are
building blocks for a long range Iranian effort to manufacture
plutonium or highly enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb,'' it said.

Polaroid to lay off up to 700 more people
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHARON L. LYNCH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) _ Polaroid Corp. will lay off up to 700
people over the next 18 months because of declining global sales.
	   Company officials said Wednesday the layoffs, which represent 7
percent of Polaroid's work force, would come primarily in
manufacturing, sales, general and administrative operations.
Employees in North America and Asia and Russia will be affected,
but Polaroid did not say how many jobs would be eliminated in each
location.
	   Shares of Polaroid fell 62{ cents to $18.25 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
	   The layoffs are expected to help stem red ink flowing from
Russia, Latin America and Asia, which have been swept up in the
world's growing economic and currency problems.
	   Poloraid will pay $50 million for the restructuring. It will
also pull $40 million from its reserves to pay for anticipated
losses in Russia due to a decline in sales. Many Russian vendors
have been unable to pay Polaroid for products sent to them,
spokeswoman Nancy Childs said. Film that has gone unsold there has
been thrown out or returned to the company.
	   The announcement came a year to the day after Polaroid said it
would lay off 1,500 people, mostly in Massachusetts manufacturing.
	   Gary T. DiCamillo, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the new round of layoffs ``puts Polaroid on a more solid footing to
enter 1999 poised for profitable growth.''
	   The further restructuring is expected to save Polaroid an
additional $20 million to $30 million over the next two years. Last
year's layoffs were expected to save $110 million annually.
	   Polaroid also said it renegotiated terms of a $350 million
revolving credit agreement with all 14 of its bank lenders. The
company needed the deal _ which extends until 2001 _ to ensure it
has enough cash on hand to pursue strategic plans.
	   This includes the introduction of new products like PocketCam, a
small instant camera that produces miniature photos.
	   Polaroid makes instant photographic cameras and films; digital
imaging hardware, software and media; and an array of other
products.

U.S. military launches military strike over Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede to reflect confirmation of attack; UPDATES with
more Blair quotes; China's condemnation; EDITS throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns opened fire in Baghdad
early Thursday as the United States launched ``substantial military
strikes'' against Iraq. There was no word on casualties.
	   The firing lit up the night sky, created loud explosions and
violently shook windows of the Information Ministry building near
the center of Baghdad, where foreign reporters are required to work
from.
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the U.S. military forces
``have launched a substantial military strikes against Iraq.''
Military officials said the attacks involved long-range missiles.
	   It was not immediately clear which sites were targeted and if
the attack accomplished its mission.
	   But President Bill Clinton, in a nationally televised address,
said he ordered airstrikes on military and security targets.
	   He ordered the strikes on Wednesday after reading the latest
U.N. reports about Iraq's alleged obstruction of the United Nations
Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking to reporters outside
Downing Street in London, said he authorized the participation of
British forces in the attack, codenamed Operation Desert Fox.
	   ``There is no realistic alternative to military force. We take
this military action with real regret and also with real
determination,'' he said.
	   He said ``British involvement will be significant.''
	   In Baghdad, the first round of anti-aircraft explosions was
heard at 12:49 a.m. Thursday (2149 GMT Wednesday). A second round
was unleashed at 1 a.m.
	   Orange glows streaked toward the sky as the anti-aircraft guns
let loose volley after volley of shots.
	   No aircraft or missiles were, however, sighted or heard over
Baghdad. An air raid siren sounded briefly in Baghdad shortly
before midnight local time. Few people were out at the time of the
explosions and few cars were on the streets.
	   There was no government word on the attack. China condemned it.
	   Emerging from an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council,
China's ambassador, Qin Husaen, said: ``There is absolutely no
excuse of pretext to use force against Iraq.''
	   ``The use of force ... poses a threat to international as well
as regional stability,'' he said.
	   The U.S. attack apparently did not target the state-run
television station, which continued to broadcast pictures of
President Saddam Hussein meeting with the ruling Baath Party
officials on Wednesday.
	   Blair blamed Saddam for triggering the crisis.
	   ``Saddam has no intention whatever of keeping to his word,'' he
said. ``He is a serial breaker of promises.''
	   Thursday's attack would have come from the U.S. forces in the
Gulf. There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the
aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
	   The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   U.S. military officials had earlier said that attacks on Iraq
would aim to cause as much damage as possible to Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction _ primarily chemical and biological weapons _ and
the means the country uses to produce and hide them.
	   UNSCOM inspectors have been trying since 1991 to dismantle these
weapons. On Wednesday, UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler withdrew all
of them from Iraq, setting the stage for the attack.
	   An attack became obvious when Butler submitted a report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday, accusing Iraq of
obstructing UNSCOM's work.
	   Qin, the Chinese ambassador, said Butler's report ``is
apparently one-sided and does not reflect the situation on
ground.''
	   Iraq also has rejected the report, saying Butler is a U.S.
puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions. But until
Butler's UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has no more illegal weapons,
the U.N. Security Council cannot lift economic sanctions imposed on
Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ AIDS is the seventh
largest killer of 25- to 44-year-olds in the U.S. Virgin Islands
behind homocide, a new study says.
	   A report by the Community Planning Group, a government-organized
advisory body, said since 1983 there have been 373 cases of AIDS in
the Caribbean territory and 190 people have died from the disease.
	   In 1997, 29 people were diagnosed with AIDS, said Yvonne Greene,
an AIDS specialist for the territory's health department who helped
with the study. Health officials recorded 99 active cases of the
disease.
	   She noted the number of fatalities may be higher if patients who
leave the territory before dying are counted.

Missing San Antonio Express-News reporter found dead

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The body of a missing reporter for the San
Antonio Express-News was found Wednesday in a ravine in the western
part of the country, a U.S. consular official said.
	   Philip True apparently slipped and fell to his death into a deep
ravine in a remote mountain range on the border between Jalisco and
Nayarit states, a spokesperson at the Guadalajara consulate said,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   ``We all mourn the loss of a colleague and an outstanding
journalist,'' W. Lawrence Walker Jr., publisher and chief executive
officer of the San Antonio Express-News, told staff members
gathered in the paper's newsroom Wednesday.
	   True's body was spotted in the morning from a small plane, one
of several army aircraft sweeping the area, military officials
said. It took hours to reach the isolated Chapangana Canyon in the
Sierra Madre Occidental range, and several more to identify the
body.
	   True, a 50-year-old reporter based in Mexico City, headed into
the mountains on Nov. 29 to photograph and write about the region's
Huichol Indians. He had planned to return to Mexico City last
Thursday.
	   The Mexican army and authorities from both states have been
searching the region, about 370 miles (590 kilometers) northwest of
Mexico City, since them.
	   The U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara expressed thanks to
authorities for their help in the search.
	   ``We appreciate all the support and efforts made by the army
that the state governments of Nayarit and Jalisco states. They
really went all out of their way to assist,'' the consular
spokesperson said.
	   Military officials said a medical examiner was viewing the body,
but details on where it would be taken and other arrangements were
not immediately known.
	   True, 50, worked for the Brownsville Herald before joining the
Express-News staff in 1992 as the newspaper's border correspondent
based in Laredo. True became the Express-News correspondent in
Mexico City in January 1996.
	   Among the high-profile stories he covered for the San Antonio
paper were the Zapatista rebel conflict in the southern state of
Chiapas and Pope John Paul II's trip to Cuba.
	   Before his newspaper career, True worked as a wallpaper hanger
until his late 30s, recalled friend and colleague John MacCormack,
a state reporter for the Express-News.
	   ``But by the time he was 50, he was the correspondent in Mexico
for a major Texas newspaper,'' MacCormack said. ``His dream came
true.''
	   Among his survivors is his wife, Marta, of Mexico City.

Guinean party leaders arrested as police break up protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CONAKRY, Guinea (AP) _ Police used teargas to disperse a street
protest in the capital Wednesday following state radio reports of
the arrests of two opposition leaders, including President Lansa
Conte's archrival.
	   The development came two days after presidential elections were
held in this impoverished West African country for just the second
time since independence from France in 1958.
	   Alpha Conde, leader of the opposition Rally of the Guinean
People, was seized by police while trying to illegally cross the
border into neighboring Ivory Coast with several unnamed
associates, state radio reported.
	   Conde, one of two prominent opposition candidates, challenged
Conte in the 1993 elections and recently returned from a
self-imposed exile in Senegal.
	   Police also arrested another presidential candidate Marcel Cros,
leader of the smaller African Democratic Party of Guinea, in a
separate incident on Saturday for alleged illegal possession of
military weapons in his home, state radio said.
	   Several hundred people began marching through the streets of the
capital towards Conde's home before police cut short the protest by
firing teargas into the crowds, witnesses said. There were no
reports of injuries and the streets were quiet on Wednesday
evening.
	   Both detained men were believed to be in paramilitary quarters
in Conakry and opposition officials said on condition of anonymity
that as many as 15 other government opponents had also been seized.
	   Interior Ministry officials told state radio that Conde had
disguised himself as a maribout or African traditional healer while
trying to cross the border, which has been closed for the past two
weeks.
	   Although election day was calm on Monday, six people were
believed killed in Conakry street clashes on Saturday after a
ruling party rally.
	   Preliminary election results were expected later this week and
possibly as early as Wednesday evening. Even government opponents
said President Lansana Conte would probably win.
	   Unofficial U.S. election monitors spotted some electoral
problems, but said voting went much better than the 1993 election,
widely criticized by the opposition as being rigged in Conte's
favor.
	   Conte's campaign has received government funding, and he has the
support of the military, control of the broadcast media and heads a
political party tightly allied with the government.
	   Conte seized power in 1984 after the death of Guinea's former
dictator, Sekou Toure.
	   Guinea, which has an average per capita income of just a few
hundred dollars a year and an illiteracy rate of up to 80 percent,
is still recovering from Toure's 26-year regime. Thousands of
people died in prison camps, and 2 million people fled the country.
	   While Conte has allowed greater political freedom, his critics
say he has become more autocratic since a military revolt in 1996
by soldiers angry over unpaid wages.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns opened fire in Baghdad
early Thursday, and U.S. and British officials announced they had
launched a series of airstrikes. No attacking planes or missiles
were immediately seen over the Iraqi capital.
	   The Iraqi blasts created loud explosions, violently shaking the
glass windows of the Information Ministry building near the center
of Baghdad where foreign reporters are based.
	   Orange glows streaked toward the sky as the anti-aircraft guns
let loose volley after volley of shots.
	   The explosions begin about 12:49 a.m. Thursday (2149 GMT
Wednesday). A barrage of blasts lighted the sky several hours after
the Clinton administration warned that it would make a military
strike against Iraq at any time.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered airstrikes on Iraq over a
protracted impasse with Iraq over U.N. weapons inspections just
minutes before the blasts began.
	   Less than an hour later, Prime Minister Tony Blair announced the
British had participated in the airstrikes.
	   There was no government word on the attack. China condemned it.
	   Emerging from an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council,
China's ambassador, Qin Husaen, said: ``There is absolutely no
excuse of pretext to use force against Iraq.''
	   ``The use of force ... poses a threat to international as well
as regional stability,'' he said.
	   The U.S. attack apparently did not target the state-run
television station, which continued to broadcast pictures of
President Saddam Hussein meeting with the ruling Baath Party
officials on Wednesday.

Text of Blair's remarks on Iraq attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP)_ The text of Prime Minister Tony Blair's statement
Wednesday night at Downing Street on the U.S-British attack on
Iraq:
	   Earlier today, I gave authority for U.K. forces to be deployed
against Iraq.
	   Operation Desert Fox was launched at 10 p.m. London time.
	   There can be no greater responsibility upon a prime minister
than to ask British servicemen to risk their lives for the sake of
peace and stability in another part of the world and I feel that
responsibility, tonight, profoundly.
	   I spoke earlier today to Group Capt. Rich Jones, commander of
British Forces in the Gulf.
	   British involvement will be significant and I thanked them for
their bravery and their professionalism and I wished them well in
what we would be asking of them.
	   This action could have been avoided. Since the Gulf War, the
entire international community has worked to stop Saddam Hussein
from keeping and developing nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons and from continuing to threaten his neighbors.
	   For the safety and stability of the region and the wider world,
he cannot be allowed to do so. If he will not, through reason and
diplomacy, abandon his weapons of mass destruction program, it must
be degraded and diminished by military force.
	   Over the past few years, we have engaged in endless diplomacy at
every level and of every kind.
	   But we must face facts. Saddam Hussein has no intention of
abiding by the agreements he has made.
	   U.N. resolution 687 bringing to an end the Gulf War made it a
condition of the cease-fire both that Iraq destroy its weapons of
mass destruction and agree to the monitoring of its obligation to
destroy such weapons.
	   Despite constant lies, prevarication and breaching of the agreed
conditions, the weapons inspectors carried out their task,
uncovering in the process vast evidence of weapons of mass
destruction capability.
	   In October last year, Saddam Hussein started to impede their
work even more seriously than before. Months of negotiation
followed. Finally faced with the threat of force, Saddam Hussein
averted military action by entering into a binding memorandum of
understanding with Kofi Annan, the U.N. Secretary General.
	   He continued to obstruct. In August, he suspended cooperation
with the U.N. inspectors. On Oct. 30, he ended cooperation totally.
	   He resisted all appeals to come back into compliance with the
agreements he made. Quite the contrary. He used the time for both
further prevarication and for the dispersal of his military
capability.
	   As you know, on Nov. 14, I issued the authority to strike
against Iraq as part of a joint U.S.-U.K. operation.
	   At the last moment, aware that he was about to be attacked,
Saddam offered full, unconditional unrestricted cooperation with
UNSCOM.
	   We called off the attack. We made that last extra effort to
avert force.
	   The inspectors went back to work. We said at the time that we
would hold Saddam to his word and that should he break his word
once more there would be no warnings, no wranglings, no last-minute
negotiations.
	   Richard Butler, the head of the U.N. Special Commission,
promised his report on Iraqi cooperation within a month. It came
out last night, on time, as scheduled. It is damning.
	   It is a catalog of obstruction. It shows quite clearly, one more
time, that Saddam has no intention whatsoever of keeping his word.
He is a serial breaker of promises.
	   And the reason for his obstruction is also clear: It is his
desire to develop these weapons of mass destruction.
	   He has not for one instant yielded up to that malign intent. The
threat is now, and it is threat to his neighbors, to his people and
to the security of the world.
	   If he is not stopped now, the consequences to our future peace
are real and fundamental. We cannot responsibly allow that to
happen.
	   Let me remind you: Since 1991, the inspectors destroyed or
rendered harmless 48 Scud missiles, 40,000 chemical munitions, 690
tons of chemical weapons agents, 3,000 tons of precursor chemicals
and the Al Hakam biological weapons factory destroyed in 1996.
	   However, over 30,000 chemical weapons warheads and 4,000 ton of
precursor chemicals remain unaccounted for.
	   The U.N. and the world community has shown by the resolution
which has passed calling for unconditional cooperation with the
weapons inspectors that it fully knows the seriousness of the
threat he poses.
	   Following the Butler Report, after more than a year of
obstruction and a catalog of obstruction, we have no option but to
act.
	   Our objectives in this military action are clear: To degrade his
capability to build and use weapons of mass destruction. To
diminish the military threat he poses to his neighbors.
	   The targets chosen, therefore, are targets connected with his
military capability, his weapons of mass destruction capacity and
his ability to threaten his neighbors.
	   We are taking every possible care to avoid civilian casualties.
	   I cannot, for obvious reasons, go into operational details, but
I do want to say one further thing.
	   Our quarrel is not with the Iraqi people. It never has been. The
whole world should know we have allowed Saddam to sell oil to buy
as much food and medicine for the Iraqi people as necessary.
	   It is a lie for him to say otherwise. He could have fed and
cared for his people, but he has chosen not to. Our quarrel is with
him alone and the evil regime he represents.
	   There is no realistic alternative to military force. We are
taking military action with real regret, but also with real
determination. We have exhausted all other avenues. We act because
we must.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns opened fire repeatedly
in Baghdad Thursday as the United States launched ``substantial
military strikes'' against Iraq. There was no word on casualties.
	   The firing lit up the night sky, created loud explosions and
violently shook windows of the Information Ministry building near
the center of Baghdad, where foreign reporters are required to work
from.
	   After the first round of anti-aircraft firing at 12:49 a.m.
(2149 GMT Wednesday), the capital was shaken by a second round of
explosions at 1:00 a.m. Thursday (2200 GMT Wednesday), lasted about
30 seconds. A third round of blasts hit Baghdad for less than a
minute at 2:29 a.m (2329 GMT Wednesday).
	   At least one incoming blast was heard and a huge fiery glow lit
the horizon, Cable News Network said. Orange glows streaked toward
the sky as the anti-aircraft guns let loose volley after volley of
shots.
	   Shortly after the second round of firing, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said the U.S. military forces ``have launched a
substantial military strikes against Iraq.''
	   Military officials said the attacks involved long-range
missiles.
	   It was not immediately clear which sites were targeted and if
the attack accomplished its mission.
	   But President Bill Clinton, in a nationally televised address,
said he ordered airstrikes on military and security targets.
	   He ordered the strikes on Wednesday after reading the latest
U.N. reports about Iraq's alleged obstruction of the United Nations
Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking to reporters outside
Downing Street in London, said he authorized the participation of
British forces in the attack, codenamed Operation Desert Fox.
	   ``There is no realistic alternative to military force. We take
this military action with real regret and also with real
determination,'' he said.
	   He said ``British involvement will be significant.''

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns opened fire in Baghdad
early Thursday, and U.S. and British officials announced they had
launched a series of airstrikes. No attacking planes or missiles
were immediately seen over the Iraqi capital. The Iraqi blasts
created loud explosions, violently shaking the glass windows of the
Information Ministry building near the center of Baghdad where
foreign reporters are based. Orange glows streaked toward the sky
as the anti-aircraft guns let loose volley after volley of shots.
President Bill Clinton ordered airstrikes on Iraq over a protracted
impasse with Iraq over U.N. weapons inspections just minutes before
the blasts began. Less than an hour later, Prime Minister Tony
Blair announced the British had participated in the airstrikes.
(IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton said Wednesday he
ordered airstrikes on military and security targets in Iraq for
continued defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors ``to protect the
national interest of the United States'' and Iraq's neighbors in
the Middle East. ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten
his neighbors with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological
weapons,'' Clinton said in a televised address from the Oval
Office. Clinton said he had given Saddam ``one last chance'' to
cooperate and he failed once again to live up to his commitments.
He said the purpose of the attacks was to go after ``Iraq's
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and its military capacity
to threaten its neighbors.'' (US-IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton's hopes for
avoiding impeachment in the House flickered ominously on Wednesday
in a constitutional showdown suddenly complicated by U.S.
airstrikes against Iraq. The tally of Republicans advocating
impeachment mounted steadily, even as the two top congressional
leaders met to discuss plans for a possible delay in House
proceedings because of military action against Saddam Hussein. Rep.
Bob Livingston, the House speaker-in-waiting, notified the
Republicans that no decision had been made. But aides to top
lawmakers in both parties said a postponement was likely if the
commander in chief ordered military forces into action.
(CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Facing crumbling support in parliament,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised Wednesday to
call early elections if lawmakers fail to endorse his peace
policies in a vote next week. Palestinians were outraged by the
move because an election campaign would delay implementation of the
Wye accords brokered by U.S. President Bill Clinton in October that
call for the further handover of West Bank lands. But early
elections _ more than a year ahead of schedule _ seemed inevitable
because Netanyahu lacks the necessary support to survive a
no-confidence vote on Monday amid anger at his peace policies from
both far-right coalition members and the leftist opposition.
(ISRAEL POLITICS)
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ At 70, former Nova Scotia Premier
Gerald Regan remains one of the province's best-known politicians.
His public life, however, is not at issue these days. As a Halifax
prosecutor has noted, the rape and sexual assault trial that may go
to the jury Thursday is about allegations of ``a very dark side of
his private life.'' Two of the three cases at issue in the trial
date to events in 1956, when Regan was a small-town lawyer and
sportscaster. His accusers say they were 14 when they were
assaulted in separate incidents after accepting rides home with a
neighbor they trusted. Regan, Nova Scotia's premier from 1970-78,
emphatically denied each charge. (CANADA SEX TRIAL)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks dropped Wednesday as investors worried
about the latest U.S.-Iraq standoff and 3M joining the list of blue
chip companies warning of lower fourth quarter earnings. The Dow
Jones industrial average dropped 32.70 points _ or by 0.4 percent _
at 8790.60. Falling Microsoft and Intel shares dragged down the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Production at the U.S. factories, mines and
utilities declined in November for the fourth time in six months,
reflecting last month's unseasonable warmth and the economic slump
that began in Asia last year. However, a byproduct of the Asian
crisis _ low mortgage rates _ helped keep housing construction
strong. Industrial production declined 0.3 percent in November,
following a 0.2 percent increase the month before, the Federal
Reserve said Wednesday. That, in part, was due to a 3.4 percent
plunge in utility output. Warm weather reduced the demand for
electricity and natural gas. (US-ECONOMY)
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ BMW's British unit Rover Group Ltd.,
which saw 2,500 job cuts this year, may face the same amount of
layoffs in 1999, BMW chairman Bernd Pischetsrieder said. ``In 1999
there could again be 2,500 fewer positions at Rover,'' he said at a
journalists club meeting late Tuesday. At the beginning of 1998,
Rover had a work force of 40,000, he noted. Juerg Dinner, a BMW
spokesman on Wednesday clarified that Pischetsrieder was referring
to 2,500 job cuts through normal attrition such as retirement that
had been agreed to with union representatives last month. Total job
reductions of the Rover group this year were also 2,500, with 1,500
of them since July, the spokesman said. (GERMANY-BMW-ROVER)
	   PARIS (AP) _ The European Commission said Wednesday it has
approved 340 million francs (dlrs 61.8 million) in French public
aid for Japanese car manufacturer Toyota Motor Corporation to build
a plant in the northern French town of Valenciennes. Toyota's total
investment is 4.5 billion francs (dlrs 818 million), the French
government said in a separate statement. The Japanese project will
create 2,000 jobs in a region where unemployment is among the
highest in the country. The aid represents 7.9 percent of Toyota's
eligible investment, which is below the 10.2 percent additional
cost of setting the plant up in France rather than around Toyota's
existing British plant, the statement said. (FRANCE-TOYOTA)
	   STRASBOURG, France (AP) _ The European Parliament set the stage
Wednesday for a de facto confidence vote in the European Commission
over perceived flaws in its anti-fraud policies. Ahead of
Thursday's vote, the 626-member parliament was split over whether
to endorse the 1996 accounts as finalized by the EU executive amid
questions of whether it spent that budget wisely. EU Budget
Commissioner Erkki Liikanen argues he has met all demands for
tighter financial controls. Yet many in the parliament deny he has
gone far enough to guarantee regular fraud reports, to keep
national justice officials informed of investigations or to create
an independent anti-fraud office. (EU-FRAUD)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government won some promises of cash
Wednesday to pay its huge bills: a go-ahead from parliament to
print billions of rubles, and bids for a stake in a giant natural
gas company. Russia also claimed Wednesday that it had reached a
deal with foreign investors on restructuring defaulted treasury
bonds _ but the deal appeared to be news to the foreign investors.
Russia's default on the bonds in August helped send its financial
markets into a nosedive and prompted foreign lenders to freeze aid
to Russia. Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said Wednesday that
the treasury bills, or GKOs, will be exchanged by March 15 for new
bonds with maturities of four to five years. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ President Mohammad Khatami said Wednesday
that Iran is likely to emerge as the main route for Central Asian
oil and gas, despite U.S. efforts to seek alternative routes. The
official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted him as saying that
European countries were seeking the best route for Central Asian
oil and gas, and were unlikely to be swayed by the United States.
The United States has discouraged foreign investments in Iran's
energy industry, and encouraged investments in Central Asia that
seek to channel crude fuel through routes other than through Iran.
Energy experts say Iran is the most economical and viable outlet
for oil and gas from Central Asia. (IRAN-OIL)

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Paul McCartney, Monica Lewinsky,
ex-Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss and Warren Buffett &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GOSHEN, New York (AP) _ Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney says the
original handwritten lyrics to ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band'' that a collector offered to sell him in August were stolen
from his London home 30 years ago.
	   McCartney wants the lyrics returned and filed a ``show-cause''
order in New York Supreme Court last month demanding that one
collector reveal the name of another who now has the lyric sheet in
his possession.
	   A photocopy of what appeared to be the lyric sheet was sent to
him by collector Gary J. Zimet with a dlrs 550,000 offer to sell
the original on behalf of an unidentified friend, McCartney said.
	   Zimet said on Tuesday that he had revealed the collector's name
to McCartney, but would not reveal it publicly.
	   McCartney claims the lyric sheet was stolen from his home in
late 1967 or early 1968, according to court documents. Zimet denies
the lyrics were stolen.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princes William and Harry joined in a Christmas
lunch Wednesday for the private secretaries, personal assistants,
valets, grooms and gardeners who work for their father, Prince
Charles.
	   The young princes spent the first day of their school holiday at
the traditional turkey lunch at the Ritz Hotel. A private room was
lit by candlelight and decorated with balloons and streamers on
behalf of about 100 staff members.
	   This is the boys' second Christmas without their mother,
Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in August 1997.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Monica Lewinsky, dressed all in black, surprised
about 200 guests at a benefit Christmas party in New York's Chelsea
neighborhood.
	   Ms. Lewinsky had been invited to the Tuesday night party given
by The Shooting Gallery, an independent film studio, one partygoer
said on condition of anonymity.
	   Wearing a black lace blouse, black jacket and long black skirt,
the 26-year-old former White House intern arrived at around 9 p.m.
at the eighth-floor Milk Studios, a party space on 15th Street, the
source said Wednesday.
	   There, she was joined by Jonathan Marshall, a lawyer for The
Shooting Gallery. The source said Ms. Lewinsky and Marshal are just
friends.
	   Ms. Lewinsky's brother and two girlfriends also attended.
	   Aubrey Reuben, a free-lance photographer who attended the party,
said Ms. Lewinsky looked startled and ``ran away'' when he and
another photographer tried to take her picture. After speaking to
the event's publicity people, she later walked past the
photographers but refused to pose for them, he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Heidi Fleiss, the Hollywood Madam convicted
of running a sex-for-hire service for the rich and famous, is back
in prison at her own request after an unhappy stint at a halfway
house.
	   ``She felt she would be in a better place. She said, `I really
need to go back.' She was very unhappy at the halfway house,'' her
publicist Richard Pullman said Tuesday. He said she didn't give a
reason.
	   Ms. Fleiss was released to the halfway house after her Nov. 19
release from the federal prison in Dublin, California, where she
served 20 months for conspiracy, tax evasion and laundering
call-girl profits. Three days later, she asked to return to prison.
She went back Dec. 9.
	   ``She's extremely happy,'' Pullman said.
	   Ms. Fleiss will be released from prison in May.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OMAHA, Nebraska (AP) _ Billionaire Warren Buffett's debut as
Daddy Warbucks in the musical ``Annie'' brought some laughs and a
few winces.
	   The chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., donned a bald cap and
makeup for a rousing, slightly off-key rendition of ``Tomorrow''
during a fund-raising performance for the Omaha Theater Company for
Young People.
	   Buffett drew generous applause and a few hearty chuckles as he
sang in Monday's show.
	   The biggest laughs, though, came as Sen. Bob Kerrey, a Nebraska
Democrat, stepped in as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. When he was
addressed as ``Mr. President,'' Kerrey _ who announced Sunday that
he wouldn't run for president in 2000 _ said: ``Boy, that sounds
good. Maybe I made the wrong decision.''

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ The Puerto Rican Architects'
Association says it will appeal the demolition of a San Juan hotel
to the island's supreme court.
	   The group wants La Concha Hotel in the Condado tourist district
declared an historic landmark, but its case has been rejected by
both a trial judge and an appeals court.
	   On Wednesday, El Nuevo Dia newspaper quoted the association's
executive director, Cristina Cardalda, as saying the group would
appeal the case to the high court. ``This was what we had
anticipated since the beginning,'' Cardalda said.
	   The state-owned hotel, named ``The Shell'' for a shell-shaped
wing on the beach, is due to be destroyed along with the San Juan
Convention Center as part of Gov. Pedro Rossello's plans to shed
money-losing government enterprises.

SLOC president can't be involved in bribery probe, member says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The governor's representative on Salt Lake
City's Olympic committee wants its top two officials to have no
role in an investigation of alleged bribery to win the 2002 Winter
Games.
	   Nolan Karras, who represents Gov. Mike Leavitt on the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee, said Wednesday that SLOC president Frank
Joklik and senior vice president Dave Johnson must have nothing to
do with the ethics inquiry into charges of buying votes during the
bidding process.
	   Joklik was a member of the bid committee that landed the games
and Johnson was a central figure in the process.
	   ``If we're going to recover from this, there can't even be the
appearance that Frank or Dave are controlling this,'' Karras said.
	   Karras spoke as the SLOC board of trustees prepared to meet in
an emergency, closed-door session Friday to address the bribery
allegations.
	   Revelations that the now-disbanded bid committee paid nearly
dlrs 400,000 to fund 13 scholarships, six to relatives of members
of the International Olympic Committee, have rocked the Olympic
movement to its foundation.
	   The prospect that Salt Lake may have bought the bid has deeply
bruised the state's pride in winning the games 3 1/2 years ago.
Initial disbelief has given way to shame and anger.
	   In an acid editorial Wednesday, the state's largest newspaper,
The Salt Lake Tribune, suggested the 2002 Games mascots _ to be
unveiled in February _ might be a ``couple of bagmen, perhaps?''
	   Both Joklik and Johnson were senior members of the bid committee
that oversaw the scholarship fund. Joklik has maintained the fund
was used for humanitarian purposes and claimed little knowledge of
its operation, even as he apologized to the IOC last weekend for
the embarrassment it has caused.
	   Johnson has refused to talk to reporters. Along with former bid
president Thomas Welch, he had control of the fund and headed the
bid's IOC lobbying.
	   Johnson's name was on the letter that notified the daughter of
an IOC member from Cameroon that her Salt Lake-sponsored
scholarship had ended shortly after the city was awarded the games
by the International Olympic Committee.
	   IOC senior member Marc Hodler, the Swiss attorney who is using
the Salt Lake bid scandal as a vehicle to clean up alleged
corruption within the IOC, said Johnson had ``come clean.''
	   Welch, widely considered the man most responsible for luring the
games to Utah, resigned under pressure two years ago amid
allegations of spouse abuse. He remains on SLOC retainer as a dlrs
10,000-a-month consultant and refuses to return reporters' phone
calls.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press two weeks ago,
however, Welch said such scholarship funds were common.
	   At Friday's meeting, the SLOC board of trustees will set the
parameters of an independent investigation by a five-member ethics
committee made up of two university professors, a former Olympic
athlete, a former U.S. attorney and a retired chief justice of the
Utah Supreme Court.
	   One of the first orders of business, said board member Randy
Dryer, will be to establish what role Joklik should play in
establishing the committee's responsibilities. Johnson does not sit
on the board.
	   Karras believes Joklik should simply remove himself from the
process and let SLOC chairman Robert Garff run the show.
	   ``Painful as it may be, Bob is going to have to step up on this
one,'' Karras said.
	   Garff, a wealthy car dealer, was out of town until Thursday and
unavailable for comment.
	   Johnson has been intimately involved for more than a decade in
Utah's pursuit of the Olympics.
	   In 1988, Johnson's role in the now-defunct Utah Sports
Foundation triggered an investigation by the Utah Legislature and
the state attorney general into allegations of double-billing. He
was exonerated.
	   Karras hopes Joklik and Johnson will survive in their posts. But
he added it's clear someone on the bid committee ``crossed the
line. Just how far is yet to be seen,'' he said. ``But I'm
indignant about it.
	   ``Do I worry about losing Frank or Dave? Yes,'' he said. ``It
would be a travesty to lose either of them. But if it ends up that
peoples' hands are so dirty they can't stay, then we'll have to
deal with it.''
	   So far, there has been no public accounting for the dlrs 13
million that funded the bid because the funds were raised
privately. Karras and ethics committee member David Jordan, a
former U.S. attorney, said they expect a final report to be made
public.

Lawmakers want U.S. to permit Iranian purchase of U.S. crops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP BRASHER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Farm-state lawmakers are urging the Clinton
administration to let Iran buy dlrs 500 million worth of American
wheat, corn, sugar and other agricultural products.
	   The sale, which would require a waiver of trade sanctions that
date back to the 1979 hostage crisis, would provide a ``significant
economic boost'' for farmers, the 32 lawmakers said in a letter to
President Bill Clinton on Wednesday.
	   It is the first time in 20 years that a U.S. trader has secured
a food order from the government of Iran, said aides to Sen. Larry
Craig of Idaho.
	   ``Food and agricultural trade should not be used as weapons in
battles of foreign policy,'' Craig said.
	   The lawmakers said Iran's proposed purchase should lead to a
re-examination of U.S. trade policy.
	   The Senate approved legislation this year that would have
exempted food and medicine from sanctions now in place against
Cuba, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and Sudan as well as Iran, but the
measure died in congressional budget negotiations.
	   ``It is absurd for us to prohibit any shipment of food anywhere
in the world,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, of North Dakota. ``Food and
medicine ought not be used as a weapon or part of a trade
sanction.''
	   As much as 11 percent of the world's wheat market is off limits
to U.S. producers, he said.
	   Iran wants to buy 2 million metric tons of wheat, 400,000 tons
of sugar, 400,000 tons of corn, 300,000 tons of rice and additional
quantities of soybean oil and meal.
	   Fifteen senators and 17 House members signed the letter to
Clinton.
	   Several commodity groups, including the National Association of
Wheat Growers, also have asked the administration to permit the
Iran deal.

IOC may never be the same after corruption scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Olympic movement has survived world wars,
political boycotts, terrorism and drug scandals. But the IOC, as we
know it, may never be quite the same after this latest crisis.
	   What started out as a local controversy in Salt Lake City three
weeks ago has set off a chain of events that could change the face
of the International Olympic Committee.
	   ``No revolution has been possible without scandal,'' said Marc
Hodler, the 80-year-old Swiss IOC official who blew the whistle on
alleged corruption in the bidding and selection process for Olympic
host cities.
	   Hodler's allegations of bribery, blackmail and other misconduct
marked a defining moment that could herald radical reform in an
organization which has remained largely unchanged in its 104-year
history.
	   The fallout could cause long-term damage to the image and
credibility of the Olympic movement, which professes to uphold the
ideals of ``solidarity and fair play.''
	   The scandal could also taint the legacy of IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch, scare away the corporate sponsors who help
finance the games and compromise the chances of another U.S. city
getting the Olympics any time soon.
	   On the positive side, the controversy might provide just the
catalyst the IOC needs to clean up its act.
	   Samaranch has promised to kick out any IOC members found guilty
of misconduct and consider possible changes in the host city
selection process.
	   ``Maybe the IOC will be even stronger than before,'' he said.
	   What was planned as a relatively routine IOC executive board
meeting last weekend turned into one of the most tumultous three
days in the organization's history.
	   ``I thought I might have been in a parallel universe,'' said
Anita DeFrantz, an American IOC vice president.
	   But the crisis is all too real, and the IOC will have to act
quickly and decisively to show that it's serious about rooting out
corruption from within its ranks.
	   What got it all started was the discovery by a Salt Lake
television station of a document detailing a scholarship fund run
by the group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
	   Among those benefiting from nearly dlrs 400,000 in tuition
assistance and athletic training were six relatives of IOC members.
	   Hodler, the executive board member who formulates the rules for
bidding cities, called the scholarship program a ``bribe.'' He
later said Salt Lake was a victim of ``blackmail'' by unscrupulous
agents who promise to secure blocs of IOC votes.
	   Hodler raised the scandal to global proportions when he alleged
irregularities in the election campaigns awarding the summer games
to Atlanta (1996) and Sydney (2000) and winter games to Nagano
(1998).
	   The IOC has opened a high-level investigation into the Salt Lake
case and promised to deliver its findings by the end of January.
	   But the IOC will also now come under pressure to widen the scope
of the inquiry to take into account alleged corruption in other
Olympic bid campaigns.
	   With billions of dollars in revenues and national prestige at
stake, the election of host cities has turned into a volatile
high-pressure mix of politics and money.
	   The role of agents, middlemen and lobbyists has increased in the
past decade since the IOC ditched the four-year cycle and staggered
the winter and summer games every two years.
	   Today, at any given time, various cities are involved in bids
for different games, some more than 10 years away.
	   Reforming the Olympic selection process could be Samaranch's
most urgent _ and difficult _ challenge.
	   With more than 100 members from various parts of the world
voting in a secret ballot, the dangers of corruption and dirty
tricks are obvious.
	   The most radical solution, suggested by Hodler, is to take the
decision away from the general IOC membership and assign the
executive board and a few experts to select host cities.
	   But selling that idea to the general assembly won't be easy. IOC
members exist for virtually one reason: to decide where the
Olympics are staged. Giving that up would be like voting themselves
out of a job.
	   In addition, the IOC must be aware of the dangers of putting the
decision in the hands of a few.
	   ``I'm not sure kneejerk reactions are the way to do it,''
British IOC member Craig Reedie said.
	   Samaranch, who has been in power since 1980, will have his work
cut out in pushing through changes before his final term expires in
2001. Corruption could become a major issue in the campaign to
determine his successor.
	   The crisis comes at a bad time for the IOC, just when the
organization is trying to seize the initiative in the fight against
that other Olympic scourge _ drugs.
	   The last thing Samaranch wants is for the IOC's world
anti-doping summit meeting in February to be overshadowed by
bribery scandals.
	   ``Speed is of the essence in the IOC inquiry,'' Reedie said.
``Unless this is put to bed quickly, all the good work of the
doping conference is in jeopardy.''
	   So, too, could be the hopes of the United States staging the
2012 summer games. Eight cities are seeking the U.S. nomination to
bid for those games.
	   Even before the Salt Lake scandal, the U.S. Olympic movement had
suffered sigificant embarrassments in the 1990s.
	   Robert Helmick was forced to resign in 1991 as an IOC member and
president of the U.S. Olympic Committee as a result of
conflict-of-interest allegations. And the 1996 Atlanta Games were

Minor injuries touch off debilitating pain syndrome

	   TRENTON, New Jersey (AP) _ Mary Anne Nelson went through dozens
of doctors, surgeries and other painful procedures trying to
discover _ and stop _ whatever began ravaging her legs after a
skateboard ride left her with a sore foot when she was 14.
	   Most were baffled, some of their treatments made things worse
and many tried to convince her parents she was imagining the whole
thing.
	   Today, at 37, Nelson is mostly paralyzed from the waist down by
a debilitating affliction called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.
	   Often triggered by a minor nerve injury, and sometimes with no
obvious source, the syndrome causes horrible pain, swelling, skin
sensitivity, sweating, and discoloration and skin breakdown as
circulation deteriorates.
	   Nelson, who lives in Montville, recalls one awful day in 1984
when, with her left leg a swollen purple blob, she said to her
doctor: ``Why can't you just amputate it?''
	   The doctor wouldn't do it, but William Swanson's did 3 1-2 years
ago after he sprained his right ankle in a fall at work and his
ordeal with the syndrome began.
	   At Swanson's insistence, a surgeon cut off the leg just below
the knee after it turned purple. Pain in the amputated leg
gradually faded, but after an 18-month respite during which Swanson
was finally able to walk with a prosthetic, severe pain returned in
the stump and it turned purple again.
	   ``So I'm right back where I was five years ago, still in a
wheelchair,'' said Swanson, who lives in Barnegat.
	   He has endured repeated medical complications caused by heavy
medications for pain and for depression brought on when his wife
left him because of his health problems.
	   While Nelson and Swanson are praying for minor improvement,
doctors and therapists who treat patients with CRPS _ previously
called Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy _ say 95 percent of those
diagnosed quickly are promptly cured or made better.
	   ``Up to three to four years ago, it was grossly, grossly
underdiagnosed,'' said Dr. Wen-Hsien Wu, director of the Pain
Management Center at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of
New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School in Newark.
	   Physicians have written about patients with such symptoms dating
at least as far back as the Civil War, said Dr. James N. Campbell,
professor of neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine in Baltimore.
	   Wu's clinic, one of the nation's first to specialize in the
syndrome, sees patients with advanced and complicated cases. The
center focuses on ``reducing enough of the pain so they can go on
living.''
	   Treatments include pain killers and muscle relaxers, physical
therapy, injections of nerve blockers, morphine pumps implanted in
or near the spinal column and electrodes threaded near the spine to
block the pain.
	   Wu describes the syndrome as ``a vicious cycle'' that begins
with a perhaps-unnoticed ``tiny nerve injury'' amplified when the
spinal cord, as if on autopilot, rekindles the pain signal in the
limb's sympathetic nerves so that nearby areas are oversensitized.
	   The sympathetic nervous system controls involuntary activities
of the glands and organs, including sweating, blood flow, heart
rate, bowel and bladder functions, and skin reactions such as
goosebumps.
	   Over time, hypersensitivity at the injury site can spread via
the spinal cord to other body parts. Hands and feet are most often
affected, with patients often unable to wear long pants or shirts,
socks or gloves.
	   Many build ``tents'' with their bedding to keep sheets off
affected limbs so sensitive to the touch that even a gentle breeze
can cause excruciating pain, according to Nancy Just, director of
psychological services at Wu's center.
	   Just is directing a study in which some patients will be
injected with a drug to stop muscle spasms by blocking nerve
signals. That should allow enough pain relief for patients to
participate in physical therapy, she said.
	   Campbell isn't convinced.
	   ``It may be that it helps some people in ways that are useful,
(but) I don't see this as a big breakthrough,'' he said.
	   Despite the unencouraging prognosis facing them, Nelson and
Swanson are hoping for brighter days.
	   Swanson, happy with a new girlfriend, said his medications allow
him to do chores around the house and some volunteer work.
	   ``I want to get my health back so I can be a father to my
kids,'' now 6 and 4, he said.
	   Nelson regained some use of her legs through rehabilitation.
She's waiting for new leg braces that may enable her to walk with
crutches.
	   She married eight years ago and her pain gradually decreased
after she became paralyzed so she's able to go to physical therapy
regularly.
	   ``I'm going to get better,'' Nelson said. ``This is just a long,
temporary thing.''

Volcanic ash poses hazards to aircraft despite monitoring network
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Scientists warn that commercial jets face
an increasing hazard from clouds of gritty ash spewed by volcanoes,
even as efforts to detect eruptions improve.
	   Researchers at the American Geophysical Union meeting said
fast-growing flight paths crisscross the Ring of Fire region
rimming the Pacific Ocean that coincidentally contains most of the
world's active volcanoes.
	   In the past year, U.S. Geological Survey officials said Dec. 9,
at least three jets have been damaged by ash, including an incident
on May 20 when a commercial airliner tried to land in Guatemala
City just when the nearby Pacaya volcano was erupting.
	   Since 1980, more than 100 commercial jets have suffered
significant damage after flying unknowingly into volcanic ash
clouds, the USGS researchers said.
	   In at least 10 of those incidents, the aircraft lost power for
minutes after their jet engines sucked in the ash and it melted in
the turbines. Although no crashes or fatalities have been blamed on
ash damage, the incidents are harrowing.
	   Pilots and passengers have reported their aircraft suddenly
being enveloped in a sulfurous darkness, then plummeting helplessly
over rugged terrain and vast, frigid oceans.
	   ``Pilots are unlikely to see ash clouds and radar is not tuned
to see them in front of the aircraft,'' said Thomas Casadevall,
deputy director of the USGS. ``When they got their engines
restarted, they thought the engines would shake themselves off the
wings.''
	   An international network of nine volcano hazard offices analyzes
eruption and ash cloud information collected automatically by
satellites and ground-based sensors as well as pilot reports.
	   The information is shared on a daily basis by major commercial
carriers and the military, and pilots are beginning to receive ash
cloud updates in their preflight briefings, officials said.
	   ``People who are flying are better off this holiday season as
compared with the last holiday season,'' Casadevall said.
	   But most volcanoes are not regularly monitored, researchers
said. And, ash clouds are difficult to assess because they travel
thousands of miles (kilometers), resemble harmless weather clouds
and can be difficult to see, even in daylight.
	   ``These clouds can drift for thousands of miles (kilometers) for
several days, and we have big holes in our coverage,'' said
vulcanologist William Rose of Michigan Technological University.
``We need a bulletproof method of detecting these clouds.''
	   None of the scientific satellites orbiting Earth are now
designed to specifically monitor volcanoes.
	   For the first time, researchers are training the sensors on a
variety of satellites to take snapshots of volcanoes and look for
clues of impending eruptions. Right now, their coverage is limited
to the Americas and the Caribbean basin.
	   At least seven satellites would be needed to adequately watch
volcanoes worldwide, including along busy aviation routes, they
said.
	   Vulcanologists from the University of Hawaii at the conference
used a desktop computer to view an eruption of Popocatapetyl, a
volcano 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City, within a
few minutes of the event Dec. 9.
	   Luke Flynn clicked the computer mouse through snapshots of the
eruption recorded by a pair of Geosynchronous Environmental
Satellites operated by the federal government.
	   The GOES use infrared sensors to spot heat rising from a
volcano. The result appears as a red pin dot on the planet's
surface. But in this case, Popocatapetyl appeared as a larger red
blob.
	   ``Something pretty hot is going on there right now,'' Flynn
said. ``That's about four times as large as we usually see.''
	   Under most circumstances, it takes about 10 minutes for the
Hawaii team to post eruption information on the Internet. That's
because the researchers have forged a close relationship with the
federal agencies that operate GOES.
	   But that's not the same as issuing an alert to pilots and
airports, Flynn acknowledged.
	   ``This eruption might have generated an ash plume,'' Flynn said.
``The hard part is getting the data across.''
	   In cases such as the Pacaya eruption in Guatemala, satellite
information might have generated a precaution.
	   The Hawaii team say they spotted indications that Pacaya might
erupt on May 13, a week in advance. The researchers say they used
the same method on Sept. 15 to predict an eruption in the Galapagos
Islands and alerted the Darwin Research Station there of the
impending danger.
	   ``We saw the eruption three hours before the scientists on the
ground,'' said Peter Mouginis-Mark.
	   The system is not foolproof, however. The GOES satellites orbit
22,000 miles (35,400 kilometers) overhead and can provide only
hints of impending eruptions, since they cannot always distinguish
between volcanoes, forest fires and other heat sources. It might
take several days for lower-flying satellites to view the same
volcano using other sensors besides heat thermometers.

Christmas tree growers seek `genetically superior' tannenbaums
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) _ Most families swarming over Christmas
tree lots in the United States have a vision of the kind of tree
they want to take home: lush, fragrant, dense.
	   What consumers won't see is the science that goes into producing
some of the 35 million live trees they're expected to buy this
holiday season.
	   Growers are experimenting with genetic improvements in hopes of
producing a faster-growing, more disease-resistant tree.
	   ``It means a better product for the consumer. If you end up with
a better product, it's obviously easier to sell,'' said Duane
LaCasce, who has 120,000 trees growing in Dover-Foxcroft.
	   The Maine Christmas Tree Association has two seed farms with
parent trees _ or phenotypes _ deemed by growers to be genetically
superior based on color, shape and other characteristics.
	   Seedlings from those balsam firs are already growing at farms
across the state. Growers say they can see a difference.
	   ``We're on our way,'' said Maxwell McCormack, a retired
University of Maine forestry professor who contributed to the
effort by seeking out trees so special he had to look at thousands
before he found candidates for the program.
	   It works like this:
	   Using a special rating system, Maine growers have selected the
best trees based on shapeliness, rich color, fast growth, needle
retention, and resistance to disease and insects.
	   Growers transplanted cuttings from those balsam firs onto root
stock. The resulting trees were grouped together on seed farms so
the pollination process is not contaminated by ``inferior stock.''
	   Perfectionists may even bag the flowers and use a syringe to
shoot pollen inside to assure there is no contamination, McCormack
said.
	   ``Even now, we can see that the seedlings that are for sale to
members of the association are larger than the run-of-the-mill
seedlings produced in a good nursery,'' McCormack said.
	   Such research is done on all crops, but it's more tedious
because trees take longer to grow, said Craig McKinley, a Christmas
tree expert at North Carolina State University.
	   McKinley began his research at Texas A and M University, where
researchers sought out trees that could grow in the hot, dry West
Texas climate.
	   Any doubts about the research's value were put to rest in the
real world, where consumers bought the genetically improved trees
instead of the regular trees next to them, McKinley said.
	   In addition to having better-looking trees, farmers can save
money if the tree reaches a marketable height in fewer years and if
the tree needs less labor-intensive pruning.
	   ``Time is money. Time is risk. If you can grow a tree in six
years, it's not exposed to the insects for eight or nine years,''
McCormack said.
	   Also, growers can seek to propagate other desirable qualities:
growth that begins late in spring to avoid frost; needles that do
not shed as often; or the ability to thrive in less-than-ideal soil
conditions.
	   In Maine, LaCasce is ahead of the curve. He estimates 95 percent
of his trees are descendants of genetically improved stock.
	   The improvements have boosted performance over the days when
some trees turned out mediocre no matter how much effort went into
growing them, LaCasce said.
	   ``I don't think there are any serious growers who are planting
balsam fir they know nothing about,'' he said. ``They want to know
where it came from and what at least one of the parents looked
like.''
	   While producing ``super trees'' is a laudable goal, growers
should avoid the temptation to create cookie-cutter trees that are
so uniform they are akin to artificial trees, said David Stenger,
president of the National Christmas Tree Association, who operates
a farm in Oregon, Illinois.
	   ``That's one of the things we've learned from our focus groups.
One of the reasons people like real trees is because no two trees
are alike. They like the individuality,'' he said.

Biographical sketches of Saddam Hussein's inner circle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's inner circle is populated by
people chosen for their unswerving loyalty. Some are chosen for
family ties. The most visible to the outside world are
intellectuals chosen for their skill in communicating Saddam's
message to the rest of the world.
	   Except for Saddam's sons, the Iraqi leader's advisers are his
contemporaries, roughly in their 50s or early 60s, although their
birth dates are not generally known. They have proven their loyalty
to Saddam over the long haul.
	   Some key players:
 &UR; TARIQ AZIZ:
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz has been steadfast in siding
with Saddam since the Iraqi leader engineered a 1968 coup that put
the Baath party in power. Though a Christian in a mainly Muslim
nation, Aziz was rewarded with the deputy prime minister's slot
when Saddam seized power in 1979, and has survived Saddam's
periodic purges of top political and military officials.
	   Saddam used a 1980 assassination attempt on Aziz as a pretext
for launching the Iran-Iraq war.
	   More than others in Saddam's inner circle, Aziz is believed to
have free rein to shape Iraq's image overseas.
 &UR; NIZAR HAMDOON:
	   The Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations retains key
Washington connections developed while he was Iraq's ambassador to
the United States, the first after the restoration of diplomatic
ties in 1984.
	   While he was ambassador, the United States became one of Iraq's
major donors and key trading partners. It is also believed he
picked up key intelligence on Iranian troop movements during the
Iran-Iraq war.
	   As deputy foreign minister during the Gulf War, the
U.S.-educated Hamdoon was an important mouthpiece for Saddam's
views. He went to the United Nations in 1992, and is scheduled to
return to Iraq next year.
 &UR; MOHAMMED SAEED AL-SAHHAF:
	   The foreign minister was studying to be an English teacher in
1963 when he joined a violent gang led by Saddam to terrorize and
kill opponents of the Baath Party.
	   During the 1968 coup, he was charged with securing radio and
television stations and was later put in charge of both outlets. He
chafed at working under Aziz at the Information Ministry and was
sent out of the country to serve as ambassador to India, Italy and
the United Nations.
	   Asked how Iraq would react if the United States invades, he once
told an Egyptian newspaper: ``They are most welcome. We will
butcher them.''
 &UR; QUSAI HUSSEIN:
	   Saddam's younger and most trusted son, 32-year-old Qusai, is
considered the most valued person in his father's inner circle.
	   Qusai's demeanor is more serious than that of his grinning
playboy of a brother, Odai. A law graduate, Qusai has supervised
the Republican Guard, the Special Security Guard dedicated to the
protection of his father and the Fedayeen, a 40,000-strong special
force available to control popular uprising.
	   At the beginning of the current standoff, Saddam put Qusai in
charge of the entire Iraqi armed forces, including the high command
_ a move apparently to ensure that power would pass to him in the
event of his father's demise.
 &UR; ODAI HUSSEIN:
	   Saddam's elder son Odai has a reputation for brutality, and has
wounded and killed several men _ one of them his father's trusted
food taster, apparently in a rage because the servant supposedly
was setting up romantic trysts for his father. Odai is flamboyant
and a womanizer, with a taste for expensive Western clothes.
	   He was of age to serve in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war but he never
saw combat _ although state television broadcast tape of him firing
missiles from a helicopter.
	   Odai, 34, has not been given the same responsibilities as his
younger brother. He heads Iraq's Olympic Committee and has thrived
as a businessman despite U.N.-imposed sanctions.
	   Since surviving an assassination attempt on Dec. 12, 1996, Odai
has kept a lower profile.

EU braced for talks on agricultural subsidies at summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ European Union delegates are braced for
discussions on the issue of agricultural subsidies when they meet
Thursday with Prime Minister Jean Chretien and several of his
cabinet ministers.
	   While farm subsidies aren't on the official agenda, the head of
the European Commission delegation says it's prepared for the topic
to be raised.
	   ``I understood from the Canadians they would like to bring this
subject to our attention and we would be prepared to engage in this
discussion,'' Ambassador Daniele Smadja said earlier this week.
	   Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, president of the European
Council, and Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission,
will meet with Chretien, International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi
and Lloyd Axworthy, Canada's foreign affairs minister.
	   Friday, the European delegates have meetings scheduled with U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   Agricultural subsidies ``are something that we definitely want
to raise,'' said a Canadian trade department official.
	   The federal government recently announced a new dlrs 900 million
farm aid package, aimed particularly at troubled grain and hog
producers.
	   Farm income across the country is expected to plunge 20 per cent
this year from 1997 levels.
	   Many blame large American and European farm subsidies for
shaking an industry already devastated by economic collapses in
Asia and Russia.
	   But Canada also wants to challenge France on its ban on
asbestos, European barriers to wine and irritants regarding auto
imports. As well, Canada will probe the EU's agenda for the next
round of talks at the World Trade Organization, the official added.
	   Smadja said the commission will make it clear to Canada that
it's preparing for more negotiations on the issue of agricultural
subsidies, heading into a new round of world trade talks.
	   ``One message we will send after having heard the Canadians is
that we are doing our homework and we hope that other partners are
doing the same,'' she said.
	   Bitter debates over agricultural subsidies dragged out the
seven-year Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, which was only brought to a close in 1993. Under it, the WTO
replaced the GATT as the global trade ombudsman.
	   Thursday's meeting marks the second anniversary of the signing
of a Canada-European political declaration and action plan.
	   The official agenda includes discussions on human rights, trade
and co-operation in scientific research.
	   Three agreements will also be signed including an agreement on
nuclear research co-operation, a science and technology agreement
and a veterinary pact.

British joins with United States on attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs with new details, fresh quotes; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By MARA D. BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair announced that Britain
joined the United States in launching air attacks against Iraq on
Wednesday night, a move immediately supported by the opposition
Conservative Party.
	   ``We act because we must,'' Blair said to reporters outside
Downing Street, announcing that Operation Desert Fox began at 10
p.m. (2000 GMT) local time.
	   ``British involvement will be significant,'' he said.
	   The government canceled regularly scheduled Parliamentary action
Thursday for Blair to address lawmakers and hold a special debate
on the Iraqi situation.
	   His Downing Street office said no details of the country's
involvement would be immediately released.
	   Earlier, however, the government had confirmed that 12 Tornado
GR1 bombers were stationed in Kuwait, 35 miles (55 kms) from the
Iraqi border. Another six Tornados were based in Saudi Arabia.
Additionally, two VC-10 tankers were based in Bahrain to provide
in-flight refueling.
	   The Royal Navy also had a Type 22 frigate, the HMS Boxer, in the
area.
	   Announcement of the attacks came too late for most British
newspapers. But Britain's largest-selling tabloid, The Sun, led the
front page with the huge headline ``BLITZED.''
	   ``Saddam must be crushed. Blitz about time too,'' the tabloid
declared in a Thursday editorial. ``Last month, when he last
manufactured a crisis over U.N. inspections, he was warned: next
time we strike without warning. Next time has arrived _ with a
vengeance.''
	   Said Conservative Party leader William Hague, ``The behavior of
Saddam Hussein is a serious danger to the peace of the Middle East
and beyond and the interests of this country. Across political
parties, we unite behind this action and the brave men and women of
our armed services who have carried it out.''
	   On Tuesday, a report by chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler accused Hussein of not meeting promises made last month to
fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors.
	   ``Despite constant lies, prevarication and breaching of the
agreed conditions, the weapons inspectors carried out their task,
uncovering in the process vast evidence of weapons of mass
destruction,'' Blair said.
	   ``Saddam has no intention whatever of keeping to his word,'' he
added. ``He is a serial breaker of promises.''
	   Britain has stood alongside the United States in threatening to
attack Iraq, and its forces were to have joined with American units
in a strike that was called off in mid-November.
	   ``The threat is now, and it is a threat to his neighbors, to his
people and to the security of the world,'' Blair said.
	   His Downing Street spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity,
later predicted the attacks would continue for some time.
	   ``I think it will go on for a while yet,'' the spokesman said.

	   Shortly after the second round of firing, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said the U.S. military forces ``have launched a
substantial military strikes against Iraq.''
	   Military officials said the attacks involved long-range
missiles.
	   President Bill Clinton, in a nationally televised address, said
he ordered airstrikes on military and security targets.
	   He ordered the strikes on Wednesday after reading the latest
U.N. reports about Iraq's alleged obstruction of the United Nations
Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking to reporters outside
Downing Street in London, said he authorized the participation of
British forces in the attack, codenamed Operation Desert Fox.
	   ``There is no realistic alternative to military force. We take
this military action with real regret and also with real
determination,'' he said.
	   He said ``British involvement will be significant.''

Despite wars, misery, Saddam keeps tenacious hold on power
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Saddam Hussein's Iraq has endured two devastating wars, eight
years of misery under U.N. economic sanctions and a history of
political turbulence. Yet, Saddam has retained control in a country
once the Arab world's most powerful and now among its most pitiful.
	   His relentless repression has kept his 22 million people fearful
but his hold on power complete. He also benefits from a strong
sense of patriotism among Iraqis, who easily express anger against
sanctions against their country dictated by other nations.
	   Saddam, a peasant boy who clawed and killed his way from poverty
to power, became effective ruler in 1968, when the Arab Baath
Socialist Party took over in a coup he helped organize.
	   He quickly became the power behind the country's new leader,
Gen. Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr, and eventually pushed him aside to
become the undisputed leader in July 1979.
	   Using Iraq's oil wealth _ it has the world's largest known
reserves after Saudi Arabia _ Saddam initiated ambitious social,
educational and economic programs in the 1970s.
	   The rapid development brought a broad distribution of wealth,
making Iraq a leader in the Arab world in health and education.
	   His absolute intolerance of dissent, though, was always evident.
	   After he pushed aside al-Bakr in 1979, Saddam rose at a meeting
of the Baath Party in Baghdad and read off the names of 66
officials he said were involved in an anti-government plot.
	   They were led, ashen-faced, from the hall. A total of 55 were
convicted and 22 sentenced to death. The executions were carried
out by firing squads that included Saddam himself.
	   That same ruthlessness is evident in the treatment of his own
relatives. He has trusted few other than his sons _ Odai and Qusai,
both of whom hold key positions in his vast security service. Those
who have crossed him or posed a potential threat through their
power and popularity were executed or disappeared in mysterious
accidents.
	   In August 1995, two of his sons-in-law, both his cousins,
defected to Jordan with their wives. In February 1996, they
returned home after receiving what they believed was a pardon.
Within 72 hours, they were dead.
	   To the rest of the world, Saddam, 61, may be most remembered for
foreign adventures that wrecked his country.
	   In 1980, Saddam invaded neighboring Iran, then still in the
throes of revolutionary chaos. He expected a swift victory.
Instead, Iraq became locked in an inconclusive war despite his
repeated attempts to secure a cease-fire.
	   In 1990, two years after that war finally ended, he invaded
neighboring Kuwait. The United States responded by amassing a
military coalition that included much of the Arab world. Saddam's
forces were no match. In a ground war that lasted 100 hours, his
soldiers fled in a helter-skelter retreat with tens of thousands
surrendering.
	   Since then, Saddam has sought to end economic sanctions that are
to remain in place until the United Nations is convinced that
Iraq's long-range missiles and chemical, nuclear and biological
weapons have been dismantled or destroyed.
	   To up the ante, he has created almost annual confrontations
that, at times, have ended with him backing down. Often, they have
led to further American attacks, such as the latest one launched by
the United States _ and more hardship in Iraq.

	   No aircraft or missiles were, however, sighted or heard over
Baghdad. An air raid siren sounded briefly in Baghdad shortly
before midnight local time. Few people were out at the time of the
explosions and few cars were on the streets.
	   There was no government word on the attack. China condemned it.
	   Emerging from an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council,
China's ambassador, Qin Husaen, said: ``There is absolutely no
excuse of pretext to use force against Iraq.''
	   ``The use of force ... poses a threat to international as well
as regional stability,'' he said.
	   The U.S. attack apparently did not target the state-run
television station, which continued to broadcast pictures of
President Saddam Hussein meeting with the ruling Baath Party
officials on Wednesday.
	   Blair blamed Saddam for triggering the crisis.
	   ``Saddam has no intention whatever of keeping to his word,'' he
said. ``He is a serial breaker of promises.''
	   Thursday's attack would have come from the U.S. forces in the
Gulf. There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the
aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
	   The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   U.S. military officials had earlier said that attacks on Iraq
would aim to cause as much damage as possible to Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction _ primarily chemical and biological weapons _ and
the means the country uses to produce and hide them.
	   UNSCOM inspectors have been trying since 1991 to dismantle these
weapons. On Wednesday, UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler withdrew all
of them from Iraq, setting the stage for the attack.
	   An attack became obvious when Butler submitted a report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday, accusing Iraq of
obstructing UNSCOM's work.
	   Qin, the Chinese ambassador, said Butler's report ``is
apparently one-sided and does not reflect the situation on
ground.''
	   Iraq also has rejected the report, saying Butler is a U.S.
puppet who is deliberately prolonging the sanctions. But until
Butler's UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has no more illegal weapons,
the U.N. Security Council cannot lift economic sanctions imposed on
Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

Clinton's balancing act offers peril, opportunity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By RON FOURNIER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Bill Clinton struggled Wednesday with two of
the most profound issues a president can ever face: war and
impeachment.
	   In a blur of high-stakes meetings, Clinton ordered military
strikes against Iraq while making last-resort plans in his effort
to avoid impeachment in the House. The two tracks of crises
converged in dramatic fashion for an Oval Office address Wednesday
evening, as the president explained his decision and addressed
skepticism about his motives.
	   ``Saddam Hussein and the other enemies of peace may have thought
that the serious debate currently before the House of
Representatives would distract Americans or weaken our resolve to
face them down.'' They were wrong, he said.
	   Several Republicans didn't wait for the bombs to drop to accuse
Clinton of manufacturing the showdown to boost his political
standing at the brink of Thursday's House vote on impeachment. They
risked a backlash by breaking with tradition to criticize an
American military strike so quickly.
	   And Clinton risked emboldening Republicans if there is a
widespread view that the strikes were politically motivated.
	   ``It's certainly rather suspicious timing,'' said Rep. Tillie
Fowler. ``I think the president is shameless in what he would do to
stay in office.''
	   ``He's playing politics with national security,'' said
Republican consultant Alex Castellanos.
	   ``What he's doing here,'' said leading conservative activist
Paul Weyrich, ``is more of an impeachable offense than anything he
is being charged with in Congress.''
	   Without mentioning the critics, Clinton said the timing was
driven by the need to catch Saddam by surprise and avoid military
action during a Muslim holiday. He said twice that his entire
national security team signed off on the decision. U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, a former Republican senator, said he was
``prepared to put 30 years of public service on the line'' to
defend the attack.
	   Democrats were outraged that Clinton's motives were being
questioned.
	   Sen. Robert Torricelli called the Republican reaction to strikes
against Iraq ``as close to a betrayal of the interests of the
United States as I've ever witnessed in the United States Congress.
It's unforgivable and reprehensible.''
	   It was unclear how the public would react.
	   Americans showed some skepticism when the United States attacked
alleged terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan days after
Clinton's August grand jury testimony in the Monica Lewinsky case.
Polls showed about one-third of Americans suspected those attacks
were diversionary tactics.
	   Yet independent pollster Andrew Kohut chalks those figure up to
anti-Clinton voters who never trust him. Kohut said the public's
view of the Lewinsky case did not change after the August attacks,
a sign that a strike against Iraq wouldn't affect impeachment
proceedings.
	   ``I think people can keep the (impeachment) predicament and Iraq
in separate sides of their brain,'' he said.
	   Still, the president could be helped by the timing of the
attack.
	   Republican pollster Neil Newhouse said Republican leaders could
lose impeachment momentum during any delay in the House vote. Party
moderates, falling one-by-one in line behind the pro-impeachment
leadership this week, could get skittish about public opinion polls
that already show little support for ousting Clinton.
	   ``These guys are ready to vote but, truthfully, I don't know how
much more pressure they can stand up to,'' Newhouse said.
	   The public will be skeptical about action against Iraq, but
``that cynicism takes a long time to kick in,'' maybe long enough
to buy Clinton critical time, Newhouse said.
	   The White House has argued for days that impeachment and a
Senate trial would be damaging to the nation. Castellanos, the
Republican strategist, says the showdown with Iraq is part of that
strategy: Clinton wants to showcase the need for a strong
president.
	   ``He's magnifying the risk to us if we don't protect him,''
Castellanos said. ``He's the blackmailer-in-chief now.''
	   In all of this, Clinton suffers from a lack of credibility. Did
he lie under oath? Did he lie about the need for going toe-to-toe
with Saddam right now?
	   ``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question,'' U.S.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said, objecting to the military
strike even after talking to Clinton and being promised that there
was no connection between the day's twin troubles _ impeachment and
Iraq.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Staunch allies such as Germany and Canada offered
quick support for the joint U.S.-British attack on Iraq, while
China angrily condemned the airstrikes and France said it deplored
``the grave human consequences that they could have for the Iraqi
population.''
	   The French Foreign Ministry added, however, that it also
``regrets that Iraqi leaders were unable to show proof of the
spirit of complete cooperation'' demanded by the Feb. 23 memorandum
of understanding signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
Iraq's Tariq Aziz.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from an emergency meeting of the Security Council after
being informed of the attack Wednesday evening.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said.
	   Sweden's foreign minister, Anna Lindh, told the national Swedish
news agency TT that her country deplored the attack and that the
Security Council had been presented with a fait accompli.
	   ``It would have been important if the Security Council had been
able to act unanimously,'' she said.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``The federal government regrets that, in the face of the
attitude of the Iraqi leadership, it had to come now to the use of
military measures,'' its statement said. ``It hopes that the
military actions can be ended as quickly as possible.''
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said his government
supported the airstrikes, adding that Canada had not been asked to
contribute militarily.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.

Palestinians charge political crisis aimed at ending peace process

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Palestinian officials are accusing
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of using a domestic
political crisis to get out of his obligations to the Middle East
peace process.
	   Netanyahu, who is fighting for his political survival, said
Wednesday that he would call early elections if lawmakers failed to
endorse his peace policies in a parliament vote next week.
	   If that happens, according to a senior Israeli official speaking
on condition of anonymity, Netanyahu would suspend implementation
of the U.S.-brokered Wye River peace agreement until after the
elections.
	   In a tough speech at his Likud party headquarters, Netanyahu
repeatedly accused the Palestinians of violating commitments in the
latest accord. Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said
Netanyahu ultimately wanted the ``destruction of the peace
process.''
	   ``Netanyahu's speech ... will have very dangerous effects on the
peace process and on the region as a whole, and Netanyahu alone
will bear the responsibility for such dangerous effects,'' Erekat
said.
	   Late winter or spring elections, rather than in 2000 as
scheduled, appear almost inevitable because Netanyahu lacks enough
support to survive a no-confidence vote Monday. Hard-line coalition
members and the dovish opposition are angry with Netanyahu _ the
former will only support him while the process is stalled and the
latter if he pushes ahead.
	   Netanyahu said Wednesday he would put his peace policies before
parliament on Monday for approval.
	   ``If the majority won't be found (to approve), I will initiate
early elections in order to receive from the nation the mandate
necessary to achieve a genuine peace,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu made a call to the opposition Labor party to support
his policies, though he stopped short of inviting them to join his
government _ an idea supported by many in his own party.
	   But Labor leader Ehud Barak, who plans to challenge Netanyahu in
any election, said he would work to bring Netanyahu's government
down.
	   ``This government is finished,'' Barak told Israel TV. ``It
can't continue, not with what's going on in the policy field and
with the economy, unemployment and the educational system.'' Barak
said Netanyahu had given into the extreme right wing of his party.
	   Netanyahu said Wednesday that he wants the Palestinians to swear
off inciting violence, round up illegal weapons, reduce the
Palestinian police force and end declared aspirations to statehood
or to a presence in Jerusalem.
	   Erekat dismissed Netanyahu's demands and said ``He knows very
well that the Palestinian side has fulfilled all its commitments''
under Wye.
	   Efforts by President Clinton during a three-day visit to the
region this week failed to put the crisis-plagued accord he helped
to broker back on track. He could not get Israel to agree to carry
out the next phase of troop redeployment scheduled for Friday.
	   Other issues loomed for Netanyahu: He has failed to pass a
budget this year, unemployment is relatively high and his finance
minister _ seen as one of the most loyal members of his Cabinet _
has resigned.
	   In a scathing letter, Yaacov Neeman said he was leaving because
of the paralysis caused by the crisis in the peace process.
	   Elections would occupy the country for months. If Netanyahu
resigns, or if he loses the no-confidence vote, the elections would
be held in a minimum of 60 days.

Seattle Olympic Bid Committee expected to disband; no city support

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ The Seattle Olympic Bid Committee, formed to seek
the 2012 Summer Olympics, is expected to disband at an executive
board meeting set for Thursday.
	   That action would end Seattle's attempt to play host to those
games.
	   On Monday, the Seattle City Council voted 8-1 against supporting
an official Olympic bid.
	   ``It makes it very difficult to continue,'' Steve Penny, a bid
committee member and a vice president of Bob Walsh Enterprises,
said Wednesday. ``We all feel the City Council has made a very
shortsighted decision.''
	   The Puget Sound Regional Council last week decided not to vote
on the bid proposal.
	   Backers of the games needed an official vote to complete a bid
application in time. They had looked to the regional council after
the City Council earlier made it clear it wasn't interested.
	   Kathy Scanlan, director of the Seattle Olympic Bid Committee,
wasn't available for comment Wednesday.
	   Seattle was one of nine United States cities seeking to be the
American choice to bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics.
	   Last year, the bid committee made a dlrs 100,000 deposit to the
U.S. Olympic Committee, money that won't be refunded.
	   ``We knew the odds were stacked against us going into Monday's
meeting,'' Penny said. ``So you sort of prepare yourself for what's
to come.''

U.S. launches airstrikes on Iraq; missiles fall on Baghdad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; UPDATES with officials confirming
missile attack; fourth attack on Baghdad &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States launched ``substantial
military strikes'' on Iraq Thursday, and at least one missile fell
on a neighborhood near President Saddam Hussein's biggest palace in
the capital, witnesses and officials said. There was no word on
casualties.
	   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said another
missile hit a second neighborhood. This could not be independently
confirmed.
	   The first indication of the attack came when a barrage of
anti-aircraft fire lit up the night sky at 12:49 a.m. (2149 GMT
Wednesday), unleashing thunderous explosions and shaking windows of
buildings.
	   The capital was shaken again by a second round of explosions
from the anti-aircraft guns at 1:00 a.m. (2200 GMT Wednesday).
	   Baghdad was hit again at 2:29 a.m (2329 GMT Wednesday) and the
fourth time at 4 a.m. (0100 GMT). All attacks lasted less than a
minute.
	   Television pictures showed explosions on the ground in the
distance. A fiery glow spread over the horizon. Anti-aircraft guns
firing from roof tops let loose volley after volley of shots,
creating orange traces.
	   The Information Ministry said it planned to take reporters to
see the damage caused by one missile in the Karada neighborhood.
	   Karada is across the Tigris river from the Old Presidential
Complex in central Baghdad. It was not clear if the palace was
damaged. No other details were immediately available.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered airstrikes on
military and security targets after reading the latest U.N. reports
about Iraq's alleged obstruction of the United Nations Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' Clinton
said in a nationally televised address from the Oval Office.
	   Shortly after the second round of firing, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said in Washington that the U.S. military forces
``have launched substantial military strikes against Iraq.''
	   Military officials said the attacks involved long-range
missiles.
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized
the participation of British forces in the attack, codenamed
Operation Desert Fox.
	   ``There is no realistic alternative to military force. We take
this military action with real regret and also with real
determination,'' he said, adding that ``British involvement will be
significant.''
	   China and Russia were angered by the attack.
	   Emerging from an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council,
China's ambassador, Qin Husaen, said: ``There is absolutely no
excuse of pretext to use force against Iraq.''
	   ``The use of force ... poses a threat to international as well
as regional stability,'' he said.
	   The attack capped a day of swift developments that began with
more than 100 U.N. weapons inspectors leaving Baghdad for Bahrain
on the orders of their boss, UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler.
	   A few hours earlier, Butler had submitted a report to U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, accusing Iraq of obstructing the
inspectors despite a Nov. 14 pledge to provide full cooperation.
That pledge had averted a U.S. attack on Iraq at the last moment.
	   Qin, the Chinese ambassador, said Butler's report ``is
apparently one-sided and does not reflect the situation on
ground.''
	   Thursday's attack would have come from the U.S. forces in the
Gulf. There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the
aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
	   The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   U.S. military officials had earlier said that attacks on Iraq
would aim to cause as much damage as possible to Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction _ primarily chemical and biological weapons _ and
the means the country uses to produce and hide them.
	   UNSCOM inspectors have been trying since 1991 to dismantle these
weapons.
	   Iraq accuses Butler of being a U.S. puppet who is deliberately
prolonging the sanctions. But until Butler's UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq has no more illegal weapons, the U.N. Security Council cannot
lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

that vote delayed &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Bill Clinton struggled Wednesday with two of
the most profound issues a president can ever face: war and
impeachment.
	   In a blur of high-stakes meetings, Clinton ordered military
strikes against Iraq while making last-resort plans in his effort
to avoid impeachment in the House. The two tracks of crises
converged in dramatic fashion for an Oval Office address Wednesday
evening, as the president explained his decision and addressed
skepticism about his motives.
	   ``Saddam Hussein and the other enemies of peace may have thought
that the serious debate currently before the House of
Representatives would distract Americans or weaken our resolve to
face them down.'' They were wrong, he said.
	   Several Republicans didn't wait for the bombs to drop to accuse
Clinton of manufacturing the showdown to boost his political
standing at the brink of a House vote on impeachment. They risked a
backlash by breaking with tradition to criticize an American
military strike so quickly.
	   And Clinton risked emboldening Republicans if there is a
widespread view that the strikes were politically motivated.
	   ``It's certainly rather suspicious timing,'' said Rep. Tillie
Fowler. ``I think the president is shameless in what he would do to
stay in office.''
	   ``He's playing politics with national security,'' said
Republican consultant Alex Castellanos.
	   ``What he's doing here,'' said leading conservative activist
Paul Weyrich, ``is more of an impeachable offense than anything he
is being charged with in Congress.''
	   Without mentioning the critics, Clinton said the timing was
driven by the need to catch Saddam by surprise and avoid military
action during a Muslim holiday. He said twice that his entire
national security team signed off on the decision. U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, a former Republican senator, said he was
``prepared to put 30 years of public service on the line'' to
defend the attack.
	   Democrats were outraged that Clinton's motives were being
questioned.
	   Sen. Robert Torricelli called the Republican reaction to strikes
against Iraq ``as close to a betrayal of the interests of the
United States as I've ever witnessed in the United States Congress.
It's unforgivable and reprehensible.''
	   It was unclear how the public would react.
	   Americans showed some skepticism when the United States attacked
alleged terrorist facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan days after
Clinton's August grand jury testimony in the Monica Lewinsky case.
Polls showed about one-third of Americans suspected those attacks
were diversionary tactics.
	   Yet independent pollster Andrew Kohut chalks those figure up to
anti-Clinton voters who never trust him. Kohut said the public's
view of the Lewinsky case did not change after the August attacks,
a sign that a strike against Iraq wouldn't affect impeachment
proceedings.
	   ``I think people can keep the (impeachment) predicament and Iraq
in separate sides of their brain,'' he said.
	   Still, the president could be helped by the timing of the
attack.
	   Republican pollster Neil Newhouse said GOP leaders could lose
momentum now that Thursday's vote has been postponed because of the
airstrikes. Party moderates, falling one-by-one in line behind the
pro-impeachment leadership this week, could get skittish about
public opinion polls that already show little support for ousting
Clinton.
	   ``These guys are ready to vote but, truthfully, I don't know how
much more pressure they can stand up to,'' Newhouse said.
	   The public will be skeptical about action against Iraq, but
``that cynicism takes a long time to kick in,'' maybe long enough
to buy Clinton critical time, Newhouse said.
	   The White House has argued for days that impeachment and a
Senate trial would be damaging to the nation. Castellanos, the
Republican strategist, says the showdown with Iraq is part of that
strategy: Clinton wants to showcase the need for a strong
president.
	   ``He's magnifying the risk to us if we don't protect him,''
Castellanos said. ``He's the blackmailer-in-chief now.''
	   In all of this, Clinton suffers from a lack of credibility. Did
he lie under oath? Did he lie about the need for going toe-to-toe
with Saddam right now?
	   ``Both the timing and the policy are subject to question,'' U.S.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said, objecting to the military
strike even after talking to Clinton and being promised that there
was no connection between the day's twin troubles _ impeachment and
Iraq.

Secretary-general calls bombing ``a sad day for the world''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Calling the bombing of Iraq ``a sad day
for the world,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday
he did everything in his power to seek peace and deeply regrets not
being able to avert the use of force.
	   As a divided U.N. Security Council met for a third time to
discuss a U.N. report critical of Baghdad which triggered the
airstrikes, China and Russia condemned the U.S. and British attacks
on Iraq.
	   The council scheduled a formal meeting late Wednesday night at
Russia's request where all 15 council members are expected to
publicly react to the military strikes and the report by chief U.N.
weapons inspector Richard Butler. It was not known whether Russia
would present a resolution.
	   ``This is a situation of dire relevance to the Security Council
mandate and members consequently want to discuss their positions,''
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said. ``I'm sure there will
be some condemnation.''
	   The secretary-general, who helped avert military action twice
this year by flying to Baghdad in February and sending a
last-minute appeal to the Iraqis in November, was at the council
meeting Wednesday afternoon when reports of bombing started
circulating. He emerged looking grim and made no comment.
	   Several hours later, Annan made a brief hearfelt statement
saying his thoughts were with ``the people of Iraq, with the 307
United Nations humanitarian workers who remain in the country, and
with all others whose lives are in danger.''
	   ``This is a sad day for the United Nations, and for the world,''
he said. ``It is also a very sad day for me personally. Throughout
this year I have done everything in my power to ensure peaceful
compliance with Security Council resolutions, and so to avert the
use of force.''
	   ``This has not been an easy or a painless process. It has
required patience, determination and the will to seek peace even
when all signs pointed to war. However daunting the task, the
United Nations had to try as long as any hope of peace remained. I
deeply regret that today these efforts have proved insufficient,''
Annan said.
	   He didn't say whether the U.S. and British attacks were
justified _ only that ``what has happened cannot be reversed.'' He
also pledged that the United Nations will respond ``to the acute
need in Iraq and in the wider region for humanitarian relief and
healing diplomacy,'' as it has in the past.
	   Under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, Iraq promised on
Nov. 14 to cooperate fully with weapons inspectors and allow
unfettered access to sites and documents. Annan warned Iraq at the
time that if it did not fully cooperate there might not be another
chance for diplomacy.
	   Over the past month, inspectors tested Iraq's pledge _ and
Butler's report delivered to Annan late Tuesday set the stage for
Wednesday's attacks.
	   Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Yuriy Fedotov said Butler's
report ``paved the way for the bombing.'' And ambassador Lavrov had
a one word reaction to the airstrikes: ``negative.''
	   The Security Council met for 90 minutes Wednesday morning to
disucss the report and Butler's overnight decision to evacuate all
inspectors and staff _ which angered China, Russia and France
because the permanent council was not consulted.
	   The council met for about an hour Wednesday afternoon before
reports of an attack began circulating. The meeting broke up so
diplomats could consult their capitals.
	   After the U.S. launched the airstrikes, U.S. Deputy Ambassador
Peter Burleigh met privately with Iraq's U.N. envoy Nizar Hamdoon
for about 15 minutes. U.S. and Iraqi officials would not comment on
the substance of the talks.
	   Before the attacks began, Hamdoon said he met Annan and asked
him ``to try to do whatever in his capacity to dissuade certain
members of the Security Council not to do anything that has not
been adopted by the Security Council.''
	   But it was too late and the Iraqi envoy appeared resigned to a
U.S. attack.
	   ``It looks like the United States is determined to go for a
military strike regardless of what the Security Council membership
feel about it, and that's very bad,'' Hamdoon said.
	   The United States and Britain called off airstrikes after Iraq
promised on Nov. 14 to cooperate fully with the weapons inspectors
and allow unfettered access to all sites and documents. But after
Butler reported Tuesday that ``Iraq did not provide the full
cooperation it promised'' the prospect of military action
intensified.
	   The United States and Britain insist they have authority under
previous Security Council resolutions to attack Iraq to force
Baghdad's full compliance with the inspectors.
	   But Iraq's most vocal supporters on the council _ Russia, France
and China _ insist the Security Council must sanction any military
action.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from the meeting.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said. ``The use of force not only has serious
consequences for the implementation of Security Council resolutions
but also poses a threat to international as well as regional
stability.''
	   The council is also divided over the negative tone of Butler's
report and his decision to evacuate all inspectors from Baghdad
without consulting council members.
	   In his report Tuesday to Annan, Butler said Iraq had imposed new
restrictions on the work of the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which he heads. And he said Iraq's conduct over the past
month ``ensured that no progress was able to be made in either the
fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited weapons
programs.''

also pledged that the United Nations will respond ``to the acute
need in Iraq and in the wider region for humanitarian relief and
healing diplomacy,'' as it has in the past.
	   Under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, Iraq promised on
Nov. 14 to cooperate fully with weapons inspectors and allow
unfettered access to sites and documents. Annan warned Iraq at the
time that if it did not fully cooperate there might not be another
chance for diplomacy.
	   Over the past month, inspectors tested Iraq's pledge _ and
Butler's report delivered to Annan late Tuesday set the stage for
Wednesday's attacks.
	   Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador Yuriy Fedotov said Butler's
report ``paved the way for the bombing.'' And ambassador Lavrov had
a one word reaction to the airstrikes: ``negative.''
	   The Security Council met for 90 minutes Wednesday morning to
disucss the report and Butler's overnight decision to evacuate all
inspectors and staff _ which angered China, Russia and France
because the permanent council was not consulted.
	   The council met for about an hour Wednesday afternoon before
reports of an attack began circulating. The meeting broke up so
diplomats could consult their capitals.
	   After the U.S. launched the airstrikes, U.S. Deputy Ambassador
Peter Burleigh met privately with Iraq's U.N. envoy Nizar Hamdoon
for about 15 minutes. U.S. and Iraqi officials would not comment on
the substance of the talks.
	   Before the attacks began, Hamdoon said he met Annan and asked
him ``to try to do whatever in his capacity to dissuade certain
members of the Security Council not to do anything that has not
been adopted by the Security Council.''
	   But it was too late and the Iraqi envoy appeared resigned to a
U.S. attack.
	   ``It looks like the United States is determined to go for a
military strike regardless of what the Security Council membership
feel about it, and that's very bad,'' Hamdoon said.
	   The United States and Britain called off airstrikes after Iraq
promised on Nov. 14 to cooperate fully with the weapons inspectors
and allow unfettered access to all sites and documents. But after
Butler reported Tuesday that ``Iraq did not provide the full
cooperation it promised'' the prospect of military action
intensified.
	   The United States and Britain insist they have authority under
previous Security Council resolutions to attack Iraq to force
Baghdad's full compliance with the inspectors.
	   But Iraq's most vocal supporters on the council _ Russia, France
and China _ insist the Security Council must sanction any military
action.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from the meeting.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said. ``The use of force not only has serious
consequences for the implementation of Security Council resolutions
but also poses a threat to international as well as regional
stability.''
	   The council is also divided over the negative tone of Butler's
report and his decision to evacuate all inspectors from Baghdad
without consulting council members.
	   In his report Tuesday to Annan, Butler said Iraq had imposed new
restrictions on the work of the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which he heads. And he said Iraq's conduct over the past
month ``ensured that no progress was able to be made in either the
fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited weapons
programs.''

Dollar up against yen after attack on Iraq, Tokyo stocks lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Thursday
after U.S. and British forces attacked Iraq for defying U.N. arms
inspectors. Japanese stock prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 116.12 yen in early trading, up 0.50 yen from
Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 116.53
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 178.97 points,
or 1.27 percent, to 13,917.33 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Wednesday, the average closed up 85.11 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar moved as high as 117.17 yen at
one point following the military action. But traders said the
dollar then retreated slightly.
	   The dollar is often regarded as a safe haven in times of
international unrest.
	   President Bill Clinton said later Wednesday that he ordered a
``strong, sustained series of airstrikes'' against Iraq in response
to Saddam Hussein's continued defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Military officials said the punishing attack began with a volley
of long-range cruise missiles and would last up to four days.
	   Clinton, speaking to the nation from the Oval Office, said he
acted ``to protect the national interest of the United States'' and
Iraq's neighbors in the Middle East.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened lower following an
overnight decline on Wall Street and news of the air strikes.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 32.70 points
to close at 8,790.60 Wednesday.
	   Traders said the air strikes against Iraq have raised fears that
recession-stricken Japan will be faced with higher oil costs.
	   Kenji Karikomi, general manager at Daiwa Securities, said
currency trading was thin as many players have retreated to the
sidelines to watch for further developments in Iraq and the
dollar's reaction.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 8.17 points, or 0.75 percent, to 1,085.22. The
TOPIX closed up 4.12 points, or 0.38 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond was unquoted in early trading. It settled at 1.330
percent on Wednesday and its price stood at 103.96 yen.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States launched a series of
military strikes on Iraq on Thursday, and at least one missile fell
near President Saddam Hussein's biggest palace in the capital,
witnesses and officials said. There was no word on casualties.
	   The first indication of the attack came when a barrage of
anti-aircraft fire lit up the night sky at 12:49 a.m. (2149 GMT
Wednesday), unleashing thunderous explosions and shaking windows of
buildings.
	   The capital was shaken again by a second round of explosions
from the anti-aircraft guns at 1:00 a.m. (2200 GMT Wednesday).
Baghdad was hit again at 2:29 a.m (2329 GMT Wednesday) and the
fourth time at 4 a.m. (0100 GMT). All attacks lasted less than a
minute.
	   Television pictures monitored outside the country showed
explosions on the ground in the distance. A fiery glow spread over
the horizon. Anti-aircraft guns firing from roof tops let loose
volley after volley of shots, creating orange traces.
	   The Information Ministry said it planned to take reporters to
see the damage caused by one missile in the Karada neighborhood.
	   Karada is across the Tigris river from the Old Presidential
Complex in central Baghdad. It was not clear if the palace was
damaged. No other details were immediately available.
	   A second missile hit another neighborhood in Baghdad, but its
exact location could not immediately be confirmed, witnesses said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered airstrikes on
military and security targets after reading the latest U.N. reports
about Iraq's alleged obstruction of the United Nations Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' Clinton
said in a nationally televised address from the Oval Office.
	   Shortly after the second round of firing, White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said in Washington that the U.S. military forces
``have launched substantial military strikes against Iraq.''
	   Military officials said the attacks involved long-range
missiles.
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized
the participation of British forces in the attack, codenamed
Operation Desert Fox.
	   ``There is no realistic alternative to military force. We take
this military action with real regret and also with real
determination,'' he said, adding that ``British involvement will be
significant.''
	   China and Russia were angered by the attack.
	   Emerging from an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council,
China's ambassador, Qin Husaen, said: ``There is absolutely no
excuse of pretext to use force against Iraq.''
	   ``The use of force ... poses a threat to international as well
as regional stability,'' he said.
	   The attack capped a day of swift developments that began with
more than 100 U.N. weapons inspectors leaving Baghdad for Bahrain
on the orders of their boss, UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler.
	   A few hours earlier, Butler had submitted a report to U.N.
Secretary- General Kofi Annan, accusing Iraq of obstructing the
inspectors despite a Nov. 14 pledge to provide full cooperation.
That pledge had averted a U.S. attack on Iraq at the last moment.
	   Qin, the Chinese ambassador, said Butler's report ``is
apparently one-sided and does not reflect the situation on
ground.''
	   Thursday's attack would have come from the U.S. forces in the
Gulf. There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the
aircraft carrier USS Enterprise.
	   The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   U.S. military officials had earlier said that attacks on Iraq
would aim to cause as much damage as possible to Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction _ primarily chemical and biological weapons _ and
the means the country uses to produce and hide them.
	   UNSCOM inspectors have been trying since 1991 to dismantle these
weapons.
	   Iraq accuses Butler of being a U.S. puppet who is deliberately
prolonging the sanctions. But until Butler's UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq has no more illegal weapons, the U.N. Security Council cannot
lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

Shipley: New Zealand supports Gulf action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand supports the air
strikes against Iraq by the United States and Britain, Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley said Thursday.
	   In a special statement to Parliament, Shipley said the actions
of Iraq in defying the United Nations and its weapons inspection
teams had led to the strikes.
	   ``The government does support the action which has been taken
today,'' Shipley said.
	   ``We cannot continually stand by and see U.N. resolutions
continually flouted by a person like Saddam Hussein.
	   ``Action, at the end of the day, is required.
	   ``There will be some (innocent) people who will suffer from the
consequences (but) to not act could lead to much more serious
consequences.''
	   Australians and New Zealanders awoke to the sounds of air raid
sirens in Baghdad on Thursday as radio and television stations
broadcast live coverage of U.S. military strikes against Iraq.
	   Television and radio also carried live broadcasts of British
Prime Minister Tony Blair's announcement he had authorized British
participation in Operation Desert Fox, and a short time later, U.S.
President Bill Clinton's address to the nation.
	   Shipley said the government had not received any request so far
for military support from the United States and Britain.
	   New Zealand sent cargo planes, medical personnel and commandos
to the Gulf during the 1991 Gulf war which drove Iraq from Kuwait.
	   Earlier this year a group of SAS special force commandos was
dispatched to the Gulf when further hostilities loomed. They
returned home when the threat of military action declined.
	   Labor opposition leader Helen Clark said the use of force by two
members of the U.N. Security Council was not the way to resolve the
problem.
	   ``The United Nations Security Council itself should resolve to
uphold its own resolutions, and it is not a matter for two members
of that council to take that power into their own hands,'' she
said.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard said through a spokesman
he had canceled appointments to monitor developments in the Gulf.
	   Howard was expected to make a statement later Thursday.

U.S. strikes begin; expected to last for days
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps pvs; updates with Pentagon briefing &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Military Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. Navy ships unleashed hundreds of
long-range cruise missiles against Iraq late Wednesday in the
opening wave of a four-day operation designed to strike key Iraqi
military units and Saddam Hussein's ability to produce weapons of
mass destruction.
	   ``We have acted. We do not use force lightly,'' said Defense
Secretary William Cohen, speaking at the Pentagon.
	   ``The time for watching has ended,'' intoned Joint Chiefs
Chairman Gen. Henry H. Shelton, standing at Cohen's side.
	   The two men offered few details about ``Operation Desert Fox,''
but signaled the campaign was designed as a pulverizing one that
would last several days and require an infusion of up to 60
additional warplanes _ including 10 F-117 Stealth fighters_ several
thousand more support troops into the region, and two U.S. Navy
aircraft carriers.
	   A senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the attack began around 2200 GMT with sea-launched Tomahawk
cruise missiles and strikes by Navy EA-6Bs attack planes against
Iraqi air defense radars. He said it would continue in ``waves of
attacks.''
	   Another senior official said the Navy could fire up to 300
cruise missiles in the initial phases of the action, which could
last up to four days. He said no reports had yet been received of
the effect of the hits on specific targets.
	   The strikes began in the south of the Iraq, in order to deter
any strikes by Iraqi forces against Kuwait, the second official
said.
	   The first official predicted the effort would wrap up by the
weekend opening of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and end up
being the most extensive use of force of the Clinton presidency.
	   Chief among the targets are Saddam Hussein's many presidential
palaces, which are regarded as key storage points for chemical and
biological weaponry and the elements to make them, the first
official said.
	   At his briefing, Cohen said the goal of the operation was to
``degrade (Saddam Hussein's) capacity to threaten his neighbors and
his capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction as well as
manufacture them.''
	   In addition to the 24,100 troops and 200 aircraft currently in
the Gulf region, Shelton and Cohen ordered about sixty additional
warplanes, Patriot units from Fort Bliss, Texas, and about 1,500
Army troops from Fort Stewart, Georgia, to the region.
	   Two aircraft carriers, the USS Enterprise and the USS Carl
Vinson, would remain inthe area for the time being, Shelton added.
	   Shelton said the operation was aimed at ``degrading the very
capabilities that Saddam has tried to preserve'' in his shell game
of attempting to deflect U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The four-star Army general said the overall operation would
employ Navy aircraft flying from the decks of the USS Enterprise,
U.S. Air Force and Royal Air Force aircraft operating from land
bases in the region, Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from U.S.
Navy ships at sea and U.S. Air Force B-52s, some 15 of which are
stationed on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.
	   Cohen said he had not yet had any indication of loss of American
life in the operation up to that time, and that he had no way of
knowing if any Iraqi casualties had occurred.
	   Neither he nor Shelton would put a strict end limit on the
operation.
	   Since the 1991 Gulf War, the Pentagon has kept a sizable force
of some 5,000 military men and women and scores of combat aircraft
in the desert kingdom to keep watch over southern Iraq. Saudis have
balked in the past at approving the use of their bases to launch
offensive strikes against Iraq, but senior military officials have
said the Saudis promised to allow support aircraft such as tankers
to be used.

SLOC president can't be involved in bribery probe, member says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from city hiring IOC member's son as
intern &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ The governor's representative on Salt Lake
City's Olympic committee wants its top two officials to have no
role in an investigation of alleged bribery to win the 2002 Winter
Games.
	   Nolan Karras, who represents Gov. Mike Leavitt on the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee, said Wednesday that SLOC president Frank
Joklik and senior vice president Dave Johnson must have nothing to
do with the ethics inquiry into charges of buying votes during the
bidding process.
	   Joklik was a member of the bid committee that landed the games
and Johnson was a central figure in the process.
	   ``If we're going to recover from this, there can't even be the
appearance that Frank or Dave are controlling this,'' Karras said.
	   Karras spoke as the SLOC board of trustees prepared to meet in
an emergency, closed-door session Friday to address the bribery
allegations.
	   Revelations that the now-disbanded bid committee paid nearly
dlrs 400,000 to fund 13 scholarships, six to relatives of members
of the International Olympic Committee, have rocked the Olympic
movement to its foundation.
	   A spokesman for Salt Lake Mayor Deedee Corradini, who sits on
the executive committee, said Wednesday that the mayor had a vague
recollection of an assistance program and she recalled the city had
hired the son of an IOC member as an intern.
	   Spokesman Ken Connaughton did have the name of the intern or who
was behind the hiring. The intern was hired sometime between 1992
and 1996, Corradini's first term.
	   ``He worked here for six months,'' he said. ``It was not (the
mayor's) initiative.''
	   The prospect that Salt Lake may have bought the bid has deeply
bruised the state's pride in winning the games 3 1/2 years ago.
Initial disbelief has given way to shame and anger.
	   In an acid editorial Wednesday, the state's largest newspaper,
The Salt Lake Tribune, suggested the 2002 Games mascots _ to be
unveiled in February _ might be a ``couple of bagmen, perhaps?''
	   Both Joklik and Johnson were senior members of the bid committee
that oversaw the scholarship fund. Joklik has maintained the fund
was used for humanitarian purposes and claimed little knowledge of
its operation, even as he apologized to the IOC last weekend for
the embarrassment it has caused.
	   Johnson has refused to talk to reporters. Along with former bid
president Thomas Welch, he had control of the fund and headed the
bid's IOC lobbying.
	   Johnson's name was on the letter that notified the daughter of
an IOC member from Cameroon that her Salt Lake-sponsored
scholarship had ended shortly after the city was awarded the games
by the International Olympic Committee.
	   IOC senior member Marc Hodler, the Swiss attorney who is using
the Salt Lake bid scandal as a vehicle to clean up alleged
corruption within the IOC, said Johnson had ``come clean.''
	   Welch, widely considered the man most responsible for luring the
games to Utah, resigned under pressure two years ago amid
allegations of spouse abuse. He remains on SLOC retainer as a dlrs
10,000-a-month consultant and refuses to return reporters' phone
calls.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press two weeks ago,
however, Welch said such scholarship funds were common.
	   At Friday's meeting, the SLOC board of trustees will set the
parameters of an independent investigation by a five-member ethics
committee made up of two university professors, a former Olympic
athlete, a former U.S. attorney and a retired chief justice of the
Utah Supreme Court.
	   One of the first orders of business, said board member Randy
Dryer, will be to establish what role Joklik should play in
establishing the committee's responsibilities. Johnson does not sit
on the board.
	   Karras believes Joklik should simply remove himself from the
process and let SLOC chairman Robert Garff run the show.
	   ``Painful as it may be, Bob is going to have to step up on this
one,'' Karras said.
	   Garff, a wealthy car dealer, was out of town until Thursday and
unavailable for comment.
	   Johnson has been intimately involved for more than a decade in
Utah's pursuit of the Olympics.
	   In 1988, Johnson's role in the now-defunct Utah Sports
Foundation triggered an investigation by the Utah Legislature and
the state attorney general into allegations of double-billing. He
was exonerated.
	   So far, there has been no public accounting for the dlrs 13
million that funded the bid because the funds were raised
privately. Karras and ethics committee member David Jordan, a
former U.S. attorney, said they expect a final report to be made
public.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States and Britain bombarded
several targets in Iraq on Thursday, President Saddam Hussein said,
and accused them of cowardice for using long-range missiles instead
of fighting face-to-face.
	   In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, Saddam
urged Iraqis to ``Fight the enemies of God, enemies of the nation,
enemies of humanity.''
	   ``God will be on your side and disgrace will be theirs, now and
on the day of the judgment,'' said the statement.

Chinese dissidents put on trial, without defense lawyers

	   HANGZHOU, China _ After conducting a last-minute roundup of
their supporters and scaring away defense lawyers, China put its
two most high-profile dissidents on trial Thursday for trying to
start an opposition party.
	   About 20 uniformed police flanked the court building in Hangzhou
where Wang Youcai, a former student leader of 1989 prodemocracy
protests, was being tried. Wang's wife and two family friends were
the only supporters of his side allowed to attend the session.
	   About one dozen people gathered outside the courthouse, many of
whom appeared to know Wang. Police ordered foreign reporters away
from the building and prevented local residents from speaking with
them.
	   Meanwhile, 500 kilometers (300 miles) to the west in Wuhan,
veteran activist Qin Yongmin was put on trial, a court official
said without providing details.
	   The prosecution of Wang and Qin, who could be sentenced to life
in prison if convicted, is part of the Communist Party's most
aggressive crackdown in two years on challengers to its monopoly on
power.
	   Qin and Wang were charged with trying to subvert state power,
apparently for their roles in trying to set up the China Democracy
Party.
	   More than 30 people associated with the party have been detained
or questioned in a 17-day-old campaign.
	   The defense lawyer hired for Wang was ordered off the case after
being held temporarily, and family members say others have been
pressured not to defend either man.
	   Wang's wife expects her husband to be convicted.
	   ``Whether he has a lawyer or not, whatever he says, the
government has already decided,'' Hu Jiangxia said Wednesday.
	   The trials began a day before a major Communist Party gathering
in Beijing to celebrate the achievements of 20 years of economic
reform. The timing of the events highlights the widening gap
between growing social and economic freedom in China and a closed
political system that deals harshly with dissent.
	   Qin, 44, and Wang, 32, are among the most prominent dissidents
still active in China. A third leading figure, Xu Wenli, also has
been detained, but not charged.
	   The families of Qin and Wang have not been allowed to speak to
them since they were detained _ Wang in early November and Qin at
the end of the month.
	   At least 10 dissidents have been taken in by Hangzhou police to
prevent demonstrations outside court, said a Hong Kong-based human
rights group. The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement said many more were missing and believed to be in custody.
	   Police prevented Wang's older brother and younger sister from
attending the trial by detaining them Wednesday and telling them to
return Thursday for questioning just as Wang goes on trial.
	   ``They told us they did not want us to attend the trial,'' said
his brother, Wang Youhua. The 36-year-old truck driver said he has
no connection to his brother's activism.
	   Four law firms turned down Qin's case, according to his brother,
Qin Xiaoguang. The Information Center said a lawyer who initially
agreed to take the case withdrew Monday after disappearing for four
hours.
	   Qin Xiaoguang said he and his father would boycott the trial to
protest its unfairness, but another brother plans to go.
	   Since Wang publicly announced in June that he and others in
Hangzhou were setting up the party, dissidents in at least 14
provinces and cities have set up party branches. Authorities have
refused their applications to register the party as required by
law.
	   Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has put on
trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. He
was convicted of subversion and served less than two years of an
11-year sentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into
exile.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Staunch allies such as Germany and Canada offered
quick support for Wednesday's U.S.-British attack on Iraq, while
Russia and China angrily condemned the airstrikes and France said
it deplored ``the grave human consequences that they could have for
the Iraqi population.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, speaking in Madrid, Spain,
blasted the use of force as ``a violation of the United Nations
charter.''
	   ``Nobody has the right to act on their own in the name of the
United Nations and even less to pretend to be the judge of the
entire world,'' Ivanov said.
	   ``As a result of this military action, the lives of ordinary
people are in danger,'' he said, calling for an emergency meeting
of the U.N. Security Council.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from a Security Council session Wednesday evening, learning
of the attack only after the fact.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said.
	   Sweden's foreign minister, Anna Lindh, told the national Swedish
news agency TT that her country deplored the airstrikes and that
the Security Council had been presented with a fait accompli.
	   ``It would have been important if the Security Council had been
able to act unanimously,'' she said.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``The federal government regrets that, in the face of the
attitude of the Iraqi leadership, it had to come now to the use of
military measures,'' its statement said.
	   And France added that it also ``regrets that Iraqi leaders were
unable to show proof of the spirit of complete cooperation''
demanded by the Feb. 23 memorandum of understanding signed by
Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraq's Tariq Aziz.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said his government
supported the airstrikes, adding that Canada had not been asked to
contribute militarily.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''
	   People in Japan, Australia and New Zealand woke up Thursday to
the news, carried live on both television and radio, and Japanese
newspapers issued extras.
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United
States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq
immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security
Council's resolutions.''
	   He was seconded by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old Tokyo restaurant
owner who called the bombing justified ``because Iraq has continued
developing nuclear weapons in a way that goes against the common
sense of the rest of the world.''
	   But Yukari Ohi, 38, an office worker in Tokyo, said she opposed
the use of force.
	   ``I think the U.S. decision to attack Iraq was apparently
intended to shift attention from the impeachment issue to war,''
Ohi said, noting that the airstrikes came as U.S. President Bill
Clinton faced an impeachment vote.
	   The news broke too late for the first editions of most British
papers, but the country's largest-selling tabloid, The Sun, led its
front page with the headline ``BLITZED.''
	   ``Saddam must be crushed. Blitz about time too,'' the paper
declared in a Thursday editorial. But about 30 demonstrators
disagreed, yelling ``Kill Tony Blair!'' outside the prime
minister's Downing Street residence.
	   In the United States, members of Congress generally endorsed the
bombing, while noting that it conveniently took the spotlight off
the Clinton impeachment proceedings.
	   In New York City's Times Square, however, demonstrators shouted
``No blood for oil'' and ``Let Iraq live'' in front of an armed
forces recruiting center.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican Treasury Secretary Jose Angel Gurria
announced Wednesday a wide-ranging debt-relief program for
homeowners, small businessmen and farmers.
	   The program is intended to be the last in a series of plans by
the government and banks following the December 1994 peso crisis
that threw hundreds of thousands of debtors into default.
	   Gurria said the government, banks and legislators from the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and the National Action
Party agreed to launch the program to help more than 1.5 million
debtors who make up one-third of the total loan portfolio held by
Mexican banks.
	   Mortgage-holders will be granted discounts of up to 50 percent
of their loans, small and medium-size businesses up to 45 percent
and farmers and fisheries up to 60 percent.
	   The program is expected to cost the banking system more than
dlrs 1 billion, about 25 percent of the total cost, said Carlos
Gomez y Gomez, president of the Mexican Bankers Association.
Taxpayers will assume the remaining cost.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ President Arnoldo Aleman said
Wednesday he would ask the United States to extend the stay of more
than 1,600 troops sent to help rebuild roads and bridges destroyed
by Hurricane Mitch in late October and early November.
	   But he said the extension ``would not be for a long time''
because of the efficiency of the U.S. Army engineers.
	   The U.S. troops are part of a 5,600-member task force sent to
help Central American countries affected by Mitch.
	   The hurricane killed more than 9,000 people across the region
and caused an estimated dlrs 6 billion in damage, much of it along
thousands of miles of roads and bridges.
	   Clinton was expected to visit Central America in the coming
months, though no date has been set.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ A light plane registered in El
Salvador crashed into the Cerro de Hule south of this capital on
Wednesday, killing the two people on board.
	   Civil Aviation Director Rolando Leiva identified the victims as
Jorge Colorado, 45, and Napoleon Garcia, 25, both apparently of El
Salvador. Leiva said the bodies would be returned to that country.
	   They had flown out of Guatemala City on Wednesday morning en
route to the Honduran capital in an aircraft owned by Transporte
Aereos de El Salvador.
	   The cause of the accident was not immediately clear.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said
Wednesday he will create a Development Ministry at the start of his
second term in January.
	   The new ministry will oversee the country's national development
bank and will also assume the functions of the Ministry of Trade,
Industry and Tourism, which will be eliminated.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein accused Britain
and the United States of cowardice on Thursday for using long-range
missiles instead of fighting face-to-face.
	   In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, Saddam
said several targets were hit and urged Iraqis to ``fight the
enemies of God, enemies of the nation, enemies of humanity.''
	   ``God will be on your side and disgrace will be theirs, now and
on the day of the judgment,'' the statement said.
	   The news agency said Saddam's message was directed to the Iraqi
people and the Iraqi armed forces. It was headlined: ``President
Saddam addresses Iraqi people during a new U.S. and British
aggression on Iraq.''
	   Saddam said the ``wicked people bombarded several targets on the
soil of your great Iraq, thinking that they will twist your great
will and your determination.''
	   He did not say how many targets were hit. Nor did the brief
statement dwell on any other issue concerning the attack.
	   Saddam said he was sure that what hurt Iraqis more was not the
attacks but the fact that the aggressor did not ``come to meet you
face to face'' and depended ``on a long technological arm, which is
not a measure of bravery.''

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Calling the bombing of Iraq ``a sad day
for the world,'' U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday
he did everything in his power to seek peace and deeply regrets not
being able to avert the use of force.
	   As a divided Security Council met for a third time to discuss a
U.N. report critical of Baghdad that triggered the airstrikes,
China and Russia condemned the U.S. and British attacks.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called the military action
a violation of the United Nations charter.
	   ``We are going to call for the immediate cessation of this
military action to create the conditions to proceed along the
political path,'' he said.
	   The council scheduled a formal meeting late Wednesday night at
Russia's request, where all 15 council members are expected to
publicly react to the strikes and the report by chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler.
	   ``This is a situation of dire relevance to the Security Council
mandate and members consequently want to discuss their positions,''
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said. ``I'm sure there will
be some condemnation.''
	   Annan, who helped avert military action twice this year by
flying to Baghdad in February and sending a last-minute appeal to
the Iraqis in November, was at the council meeting Wednesday
afternoon when reports of bombing began circulating. He emerged
looking grim and made no comment.
	   Several hours later, Annan made a brief statement saying his
thoughts were with ``the people of Iraq, with the 307 United
Nations humanitarian workers who remain in the country, and with
all others whose lives are in danger.''
	   ``This is a sad day for the United Nations, and for the world,''
he said. ``It is also a very sad day for me personally. Throughout
this year I have done everything in my power to ensure peaceful
compliance with Security Council resolutions, and so to avert the
use of force.''
	   ``I deeply regret that today these efforts have proved
insufficient,'' Annan said.
	   He didn't say whether the U.S. and British attacks were
justified _ only that ``what has happened cannot be reversed.''
	   Under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, Iraq promised on
Nov. 14 to cooperate fully with weapons inspectors and allow
unfettered access to sites and documents. Annan warned Iraq at the
time that if it did not fully cooperate there might not be another
chance for diplomacy.
	   Over the past month, inspectors tested Iraq's pledge _ and
Butler's report delivered to Annan late Tuesday set the stage for
Wednesday's attacks.
	   Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador, Yuriy Fedotov, said Butler's
report ``paved the way for the bombing.'' Lavrov had a one-word
reaction to the airstrikes: ``negative.''
	   The Security Council met for 90 minutes Wednesday morning to
discuss the report and Butler's decision to evacuate all inspectors
and staff _ which angered China, Russia and France because the
permanent council was not consulted.
	   The council met for about an hour Wednesday afternoon before
reports of an attack began circulating and the meeting broke up.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from the meeting.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said. ``The use of force not only has serious
consequences for the implementation of Security Council resolutions
but also poses a threat to international as well as regional
stability.''
	   After the U.S. launched the airstrikes, U.S. Deputy Ambassador
Peter Burleigh met privately with Iraq's U.N. envoy, Nizar Hamdoon,
for about 15 minutes. U.S. and Iraqi officials would not comment on
the talks.
	   Before the attacks began, Hamdoon said he met Annan and asked
him ``to try to do whatever in his capacity to dissuade certain
members of the Security Council not to do anything that has not
been adopted by the Security Council.''
	   But it was too late, and the Iraqi envoy appeared resigned to an
attack. ``It looks like the United States is determined to go for a
military strike regardless of what the Security Council membership
feel about it, and that's very bad,'' Hamdoon said.
	   The United States and Britain had called off airstrikes after
Iraq promised on Nov. 14 to cooperate fully with the weapons
inspectors and allow unfettered access to all sites and documents.
But the prospect of military action intensified after Butler
reported Tuesday that ``Iraq did not provide the full cooperation
it promised.''

	   From politicians and movie stars to scientists and Nobel prize
winners, death claimed a host of well-known people in 1998.
	   Pol Pot, the toppled leader of Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrilla
group, died in a jungle hideout, evading prosecution in the deaths

statesman who led the country out of postwar ruin and military
dictatorship, also died.
	   In the world of science, three members of the dwindling ranks of
Wernher von Braun's World War II German rocket team, which after

parents around the world, and astronaut Alan Shepard, the first
American to fly in space, also passed away.
	   The entertainment and arts field lost Frank Sinatra, the premier
romantic balladeer of American popular music; Maureen O'Sullivan,
who starred as Jane in Tarzan films; Gene Autry, Hollywood's first
``singing cowboy''; and actor Roddy McDowall of `Lassie Come Home''
fame. Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa, choreographer Jerome
Robbins, thriller writer Eric Ambler and French actor Jean Marais

	   Nobel laureates who passed away include Vladimir Prelog,
co-winner of the 1975 Nobel Prize for chemistry; Halldor Laxness,
winner of the 1955 Nobel Prize for literature; Octavio Paz, winner
of 1990 Nobel Prize for literature; and Kenichi Fukui, a co-winner

Japan's economic minister pushing novel ideas to fight recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY193 &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Secretly, Tetsuji Kuroki despises co-worker Akio
Mochizuki.
	   Kuroki, a graduate of the prestigious Tokyo University, has
always been on the fast track in Japan's status-obsessed corporate
culture. Mochizuki, who had no qualms about settling for a lesser
college, loves to fly kites.
	   But when the two ``salarymen'' are assigned to plan a housing
project for the elderly, it is Mochizuki who saves the day.
	   The message of this pop novellete, ``The Sloping Lawn,'' is
simple: Japan must jettison its antiquated ideas of rigid,
government-led growth and prepare for a more innovative,
consumer-oriented era.
	   But the subplot here is a bit more complex _ Taichi Sakaiya, its
author, was picked four months ago to join the Cabinet of Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and help lead Japan out of its chronic
recession.
	   ``If the Japanese economy weren't in such a serious crisis,
someone like me would never have been tapped for this job,''
Sakaiya said at a recent luncheon with reporters. ``And I probably
would never have accepted.''
	   Sakaiya's pet themes have long been echoed in prodding by
Washington to open up Japanese markets, streamline regulations and
modernize the world's second-largest economy.
	   For too long, Japan has relied on mass-production manufacturing
and the iron-handed leadership of the bureaucrats, he says. But
these days no one wants another car or another electronic gadget.
What people want is a true choice.
	   ``People all became the 'company-man,''' said Sakaiya, who at 63
now heads the Economic Planning Agency. ``The times call for great
change _ a major cultural change.''
	   Sakaiya knows the power elite from the inside. Like his alter
ego Kuroki, he entered the national bureaucracy after graduating
from Tokyo University, Japan's top school.
	   But he quit 20 years ago to pursue writing. His latest book,
``Dawn of a New Japan,'' about his economic policies, has sold
200,000 copies since hitting the stands shortly after he assumed
office.
	   There is little doubt Sakaiya was chosen by Obuchi to win over
an increasingly disenchanted nation. Most Japanese have had just
about enough of the credit crunch, record unemployment and soaring
bankruptcies.
	   But Sakaiya is an unusual mouthpiece.
	   Last month, when Tokyo unveiled a record stimulus package of
dlrs 200 billion in public spending and tax cuts, he made it clear
he thinks all the money in the world is meaningless unless it can
encourage a freer, more democratic market.
	   Earlier in his tenure, he announced that the economy will not
grow at the government's initial target of 1.9 percent for the
fiscal year ending next March. Then he acknowledged the revised
target of a 1.8 percent contraction was probably impossible as
well.
	   And although Sakaiya has so far fared better at stating the
problems than offering solutions, his plain talk appeals to the
public.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Staunch allies such as Germany and Canada offered
quick support for Wednesday's U.S.-British attack on Iraq, while
Russia and China angrily condemned the airstrikes and France said
it deplored ``the grave human consequences that they could have for
the Iraqi population.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, speaking in Madrid, Spain,
blasted the use of force as ``a violation of the United Nations
charter.''
	   ``We are going to call for the immediate cessation of this
military action to create the conditions to proceed along the
political path,'' he said.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from an emergency meeting of the Security Council after
being informed of the attack.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said.
	   Sweden's foreign minister, Anna Lindh, told the national Swedish
news agency TT that her country deplored the attack and that the
Security Council had been presented with a fait accompli.
	   ``It would have been important if the Security Council had been
able to act unanimously,'' she said.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``The federal government regrets that, in the face of the
attitude of the Iraqi leadership, it had to come now to the use of
military measures,'' its statement said.
	   And France added that it also ``regrets that Iraqi leaders were
unable to show proof of the spirit of complete cooperation''
demanded by the Feb. 23 memorandum of understanding signed by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraq's Tariq Aziz.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said his government
supported the airstrikes, adding that Canada had not been asked to
contribute militarily.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''
	   People in Japan, Australia and New Zealand woke up Thursday to
the news of the strikes, carried live on television and radio, and
Japanese newspapers issued extras.
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United
States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq
immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security
Council's resolutions.''
	   The news broke too late for the first editions of most British
papers, but the country's largest-selling tabloid, The Sun, led its
front page with the headline ``BLITZED.''
	   ``Saddam must be crushed,'' the paper declared in a Thursday
editorial. But about 30 demonstrators disagreed, yelling ``Kill
Tony Blair!'' outside the prime minister's residence.

Cruzeiro beats Palmeiras 2-1 in first-leg Mercosur final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (AP) _ Palmeiras' dreams of revenge were
dashed Wednesday night when a penalty kick by Fabio Junior gave
Cruzeiro the 2-1 win in the first-leg of the Mercosur Cup final.
	   Palmeiras had been aching from a loss several weeks earlier to
Cruzeiro in the quarter finals of the Brazilian national
championships.
	   And even though Cruzeiro started off the scoring, with a goal by
Marcelo Ramos in the 20th minute, for a while it looked like
Palmeiras could pull off the pay back.
	   Palmeiras' kept its offense full-on and it paid off in the 45th
minute with a bicycle goal from Roque Junior off a dazzling assist
from Junior Baiano.
	   Palmeiras held the edge well into the second half. But as the
game drew to a close, Cruzeiro rallied back and after a few
impressive attempts on the goal they sealed the game with a penalty
kick from Fabio Junior in the 91st minute.
	   Palmeiras now needs to beat the Minas team by at least two goals
in their next meeting, while Cruzeiro only needs a tie.
	   Lineups:
	   Cruzeiro: Dida, Gustavo, Marcelo Djian, Gottardo, Gilberto,
Marcos Paulo, Ricardinho, Valdo (Djair), Marcelo Ramos (Fabio
Junior), Caio (Alex Alves) and Muller.
	   Palmeiras: Velloso, Almir (Arce), Junior Baiano (Agnaldo),
Cleber, Junior, Roque Junior, Rogerio, Alex, Zinho, Paulo Nunes and
Oseas.

<TEXT>
	   Q: There's no visible sign of support from anybody but the
British. And a month ago, you had a lot of people lined up. Where
is everybody else?
	   Berger: Well, I think there is _ based on the phone calls that
all of us have made today _ the secretary of state, myself, the
secretary of defense, the president _ I think there is a good deal
of support in the world.
	   Q: (off microphone)
	   Berger: Well, if I could finish.
	   We made a conscious decision. And back in February, we put
together a coalition of several _ three, four dozen countries that
all had participated in _ in the arsenal that was prepared. That is
a time-consuming process.
	   You have to fit in the extra plane so that it interfaces with
the rest of the operation. It takes weeks to do that. You lose the
element of surprise.
	   We decided that we would act with the British, ourselves, with
the support of many other countries, but not necessarily with their
participation because the process of securing that participation in
and of itself would have taken us days, if not weeks.
	   QUESTION: (off microphone) just an endorsement?
	   Berger: Well, I _ well, I suspect we will see that in the days
ahead.
	   Q: Sandy, do you care if (off microphone)?
	   Berger: Let me just say _ excuse me, Bill, that yesterday the
Gulf Cooperation Council, which consists of all of the gulf
countries, issued a statement saying, in terms very similar to the
statement that they issued back in the second week of November,
that if Saddam Hussein did not comply and did not cooperate, the
consequences of his actions would be his responsibility alone.
	   I take that to be quite a forthcoming statement.
	   Q: Did you specifically seek the support of the Congressional
leadership? Did you get their support? And are you surprised or
dismayed by Lott's reaction?
	   Berger: We talked through this period with the Congressional
leadership, both in the House and in the Senate. Obviously, we
would like the support of all members of Congress. It's a judgment
they have to make. I noticed that Senator Helms just issued a
statement in support of what we did. I believe there are other
Republicans and Democrats in the Congress that are supportive.
	   Q: Sandy, do you know where Saddam Hussein is? And dose the
administration care if he's alive or dead?
	   Berger: I just got out _ a quick factual correction. The GCC
Statement was last week, not yesterday.
	   Q: OK, now answer my question.
	   Berger: OK. Excuse me?
	   Q: Do you know where Saddam Hussein is at this moment? And does
the administration care if he is alive or dead?
	   Berger: Well, I think I've set forward the objectives of the
mission. That is, to degrade his military capability and to degrade
his WMD and missile delivery capability. And I'm not going to go
any further in terms of ...
	   Q: The Russian Duma is schedule to vote within the next 10 days
or so on START II. Given Russia's obvious attitude toward this
military action, do you expect that what's going on right now to
delay START II even further, or even kill it?
	   Berger: Well, I would hope not. START II is very much not only
in the interests of the United States, it's very much in the
interests of Russia. And I would hope the members of the Duma would
act in the interests, the best interests of the Russian Federation.
	   Q: What is your expectation?
	   Berger: I have no expectation of that. I think the _ it was hard
to predict before this. We certainly would hope that they would do
that.
	   Q: Sandy, half-a-dozen senators have sent a letter to the
president, saying it's time to get serious about implementing the
Iraq Liberation Act, and urging that Saddam Hussein be indicted for
war crimes. Is indicting Saddam Hussein something the
administration is considering?
	   Berger: Well, first of all, let me say, as the president said on
November 15, we _ and he said again today _ in the interim, we have
to contain Saddam Hussein _ all the elements that I mentioned to
Claire _ in terms of sanctions, in terms of use of military force
where necessary.
	   But over the long term, we agree with the Congress that the
solution here is a government in Iraq that respects its own people.
	   We intend to _ to proceed on the Iraqi Liberation Act. We have
already done a number of things, most importantly is to change
what's called our declarative policy with respect to Iraq. That is
what our stated goals are.
	   We'll work very actively with the opposition. We have already
had met with them in London.
	   One of the things that's important is to try to bring the
opposition groups together in a more coherent, cohesive operation.
There's not a lot of _ right now, they're quite divided.
	   We will do _ I think Secretary Albright has said that we would
support an indict _ the indict Iraq campaign, Radio Free Iraq.
	   This is something that has to be seen as a long-term goal. We
have to proceed in a practical, prudent, effective way. But we have
to keep our eye on the goal and be steady about it _ steady about
it. And I think we are moving toward that objective.
	   Q: Sandy, on many occasions in the past, when Saddam Hussein
broke his promises, the United States refrained from taking
military action. This time Clinton takes action the very eve of his
impeachment vote, which is expected to go against him, and
effectively delays that vote.
	   How can you say that this doesn't at least have the perception
of ``Wag the Dog''?
	   Berger: Well, you know _ I can't, you know, deal with
perceptions. I can only deal with realities.
	   The fact is in those previous instances what happened was the
United States built up our military capability. We threatened
force, and we backed down.
	   Now, in this situation, having backed down on November 15th and
our setting criteria, he violated those commitments that he made on
November 14th. And the president was very clear on November 14th
and 15th of what would happen if he did not fully cooperate.
	   And the _ what the United States says matters in the world. And
the credibility of our word and the fact that we will carry out
what we say we will do is important.
	   So all I can tell you is that that this was, you know, we have
_we have _ we've spent countless hours on this over the last two
weeks and _ and certainly over the last several days. And the
president has been extremely firm and steadfast in making it clear
that the criteria here that he was going to make a decision on was
what is in the national security interests and that the fact of the
congressional debate would not alter what he saw was his
responsibility as president.

Kosovo and Bosnia will highlight NATO defense ministers' meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Meeting starts at 0800GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Rising violence in Kosovo and the slow
pace of implementing peace in Bosnia are the major issues NATO
defense ministers face when they review the European security
situation.
	   Though not really a NATO matter, U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen and his British counterpart, George Robertson, undoubtedly
will find their 14 counterparts interested in the U.S. series of
airstrikes against Iraq.
	   The attacks began in Iraq early Thursday in response to Saddam
Hussein's continued defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   American-mediated negotiations in Kosovo, the poor southern
province of Serbia _ the dominant republic of Yugoslavia _ have
failed to bring Serbs and ethnic Albanians anywhere near an
agreement. More than three dozen deaths in the province this week
has taken ethnic tensions to new heights.
	   Those tensions were compounded by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's assertion that use of a special NATO extraction force
to pull civilian peace monitors out of Kosovo in emergency
conditions would be an act of aggression.
	   NATO has a 1,700-man rapid reaction force in place just across
the Kosovo border in Macedonia. It was created in the wake of U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke's Oct. 12 deal with Milosevic to end the
fighting between the government and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking
independence in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people were killed and up to 300,000 forced from
their homes during fighting this year in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians make up about 90 percent of a population of 2 million.
	   A senior NATO military officer said Milosevic agreed during
talks to both the creation of the extraction force and to its
planned activities.
	   ``The situation in Kosovo is indeed becoming increasingly
worrying,'' said a senior NATO diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Other senior NATO officials insisted that Milosevic himself
bears the primary responsibility for protecting the civilian peace
verifiers, who eventually may number 2,000.
	   In Bosnia, they other area where NATO is playing a direct
intervention role, implementation of the 1995 Dayton peace
agreement is going very slowly. That means ministers will not be
able to plan for any significant reduction in the 32,000-member
NATO-led force any time soon.
	   While there has been some success, the top civilian coordinator
in Bosnia, Carlos Westendorp, says the lingering ultranationalist
mentality that led to the 1992-1995 war is still there.
	   The Dayton accord chopped Bosnia up into a Serb Republic and a
Muslim-Croat Federation, each with their own government, and a
nominal central government linking them.
	   Sixty thousand troops entered the country in December 1995 on a
one-year mandate to enforce the peace agreement. That was later
extended by 18 months and the force reduced. Finally, the force was
given an open-ended mandate with reviews every six months.
	   Cohen also will be pushing Washington's proposal to create a
special center at NATO headquarters on weapons of mass destruction,
which the United States feels is one of the biggest threats of the
post-Cold War era.
	   Not all of the allies are enthusiastic. As one senior diplomat
put it, there is a certain skepticism about ``the degree of the
risk.''
	   The defense ministers also will be taking a close look at the
preparations of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for entry
into the alliance, expected sometime early next year as well as a
number of other issues that are expected to come up at the NATO
summit in Washington in April.

Prime Ministers: New Zealand and Australia support Gulf action
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with comment from Australian prime minister; Trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Australian and New Zealand
leaders gave their full support Thursday to U.S. and British air
strikes against Iraq, calling them inevitable and unavoidable.
	   Australian Prime Minister John Howard said that having seen the
report of U.N. weapons inspection chief Richard Butler on Iraq's
failure to comply with United Nations demands, he believed the
United States and Britain had no choice but to launch the attacks.
	   ``Any use of force is always to be regretted . . . (but) the
Australian government does not believe that the United States and
the United Kingdom have been left with any alternative,'' Howard
said.
	   ``This has been very much a case of it being unavoidable and
inevitable that if Iraq failed to comply with the earlier
undertakings then action to degrade Iraq's military capacity . . .
would eventuate.''
	   In a special statement to Parliament, New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley said the world could not stand by as Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein continually flouted U.N. resolutions.
	   ``Action, at the end of the day, is required,'' Shipley said.
	   ``There will be some (innocent) people who will suffer from the
consequences (but) to not act could lead to much more serious
consequences.''
	   Both leaders said they would consider any request for
assistance, but that none had so far been received.
	   They said they were not given prior warning of the strikes.
	   Australians and New Zealanders awoke on Thursday to the sounds
of air raid sirens in Baghdad as radio and television stations
broadcast live coverage of the strikes.
	   Television and radio also carried live broadcasts of British
Prime Minister Tony Blair's announcement he had authorized British
participation in Operation Desert Fox, and a short time later, U.S.
President Bill Clinton's address to the nation.
	   During the 1991 Gulf war which drove Iraq from Kuwait, New
Zealand sent cargo planes, medical personnel and commandos to the
Gulf.
	   Australia sent two guided missile frigates and a supply ship.
	   In February, Special Air Service commandos were dispatched
separately from Australia and New Zealand to the Gulf when further
hostilities loomed. They returned home when the threat of military
action declined.

U.S. fires hundreds of missiles on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fifth attack; details of attack; Saddam's
statement &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday, and at least one fell on an area near
President Saddam Hussein's biggest palace in Baghdad, witnesses and
officials said. There was no word on casualties.
	   The first indication of the attack came when a barrage of
anti-aircraft fire lit up the night sky at 12:49 a.m. (2149 GMT
Wednesday), unleashing thunderous explosions as if at a giant
fireworks show and shaking windows of buildings.
	   Operation Desert Fox had begun.
	   Four more rounds of explosions shook the capital _ at 1:00 a.m.
(2200 GMT Wednesday), 2:29 a.m (2329 GMT Wednesday), 4 a.m. (0100
GMT) and 5.18 a.m. (0218 GMT).
	   It appeared that much of the deafening noise was made by
anti-aircraft guns firing volley after volley at invisible
missiles, doing little damage other than burning the sky with
orange lines.
	   At least one explosion on the ground was heard in Baghdad. A
fiery glow spread over the horizon.
	   The roar of the last round of explosions was just fading away
when the muezzin's call to prayers wafted through the cold winter
air from a mosque's loudspeaker in Baghdad.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   Saddam, however, didn't mince his words.
	   In a message to Iraqis, Saddam said: ``The most thing that hurt
you was not their aggression ... but because they didn't come to
meet you face to face, depending on a long technological arm, which
is not a measure of bravery.''
	   The Information Ministry said it planned to take reporters to
see the damage caused by one missile in the Karada neighborhood.
	   Karada is across the Tigris river from the Old Presidential
Complex in central Baghdad. It was not clear if the palace was
damaged. Saddam's whereabouts also were not known.
	   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a second
missile hit another Baghdad neighborhood. This could not be
independently confirmed.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered airstrikes on
military and security targets after reading the latest U.N. reports
about Iraq's alleged obstruction of the United Nations Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to threaten his neighbors
with nuclear weapons, poison gas or biological weapons,'' Clinton
said in a nationally televised address from the Oval Office.
	   Noting that the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins this
weekend, Clinton said the airstrikes were necessary now because
``for us to initiate military action during Ramadan would be
profoundly offensive to the Arab world.''
	   A senior Pentagon official said in Washington that warships
stationed in the Gulf fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise missiles
and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air defense
radars. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the
aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. The forces are bolstered with 15
B-52 heavy bombers.
	   The attack was the opening wave of what will be a four-day
operation designed to damage key Iraqi military units and Iraq's
ability to produce weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``We have acted. We do not use force lightly,'' Defense
Secretary William Cohen said.
	   In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he authorized
the participation of British forces.
	   China and Russia were angered by the attack.
	   Emerging from an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council,
China's ambassador, Qin Husaen, said: ``There is absolutely no
excuse of pretext to use force against Iraq.''
	   ``The use of force ... poses a threat to international as well
as regional stability,'' he said.
	   The attack capped a day of swift developments that began with
more than 100 U.N. weapons inspectors leaving Baghdad for Bahrain
on the orders of their boss, UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler.
	   A few hours earlier, Butler had submitted a report to Annan,
accusing Iraq of obstructing the inspectors despite a Nov. 14
pledge to provide full cooperation. That pledge had averted a U.S.
attack on Iraq at the last moment.
	   Qin, the Chinese ambassador, said Butler's report ``is
apparently one-sided and does not reflect the situation on
ground.''
	   U.S. military officials had earlier said that attacks on Iraq
would aim to cause as much damage as possible to Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction _ primarily chemical and biological weapons _ and
the means the country uses to produce and hide them.
	   UNSCOM inspectors have been trying since 1991 to dismantle these
weapons.
	   Iraq accuses Butler of being a U.S. puppet who is deliberately
prolonging the sanctions. But until Butler's UNSCOM certifies that
Iraq has no more illegal weapons, the U.N. Security Council cannot
lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

Polaroid announces additional job cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHARON L. LYNCH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) _ Declining sales of film and camera
equipment, blamed on overseas economic problems, will cost another
600 to 700 employees at Polaroid Corp. their jobs over the next
year and a half.
	   Company officials said Wednesday the continued restructuring is
meant to stem the tide of red ink flowing from business in Russia,
Latin America and the Pacific Rim.
	   Representing about 7 percent of Polaroid's workforce, the
layoffs will be primarily in manufacturing, sales, general and
administrative operations. Employees in the United States along
with those in the countries causing Polaroid's economic troubles
will bare the brunt of the layoffs.
	   ``What this is really doing for us is it's kind of clearing the
decks,'' said spokeswoman Nancy Childs. ``You take the hurt now
rather than spreading it out over another year or so.''
	   The announcement was made to warn analysts that fourth-quarter
earnings due out in January are likely to be lower, Childs added.
	   Shares of Polaroid fell 62{ cents to $18.25 in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.
	   The company's news came a year to the day after Polaroid's last
round of layoffs were made public _ 1,500 jobs cut, mostly in
Massachusetts manufacturing.
	   Gary T. DiCamillo, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the new round ``puts Polaroid on a more solid footing to enter 1999
poised for profitable growth.''
	   The further restructuring is expected to save Polaroid $20
million to $30 million over the next two years, greater savings
than previously anticipated.
	   With annual sales of more than $2.1 billion in 1997, the company
known for its instant imaging technology embarked on a major
cost-cutting initiative in 1995 when DiCamillo joined the firm.
	   On Wednesday, he revealed the firm has successfully renegotiated
terms of a $350 million revolving credit agreement with all 14 of
its bank lenders. The company needed the deal _ which extends until
2001 _ to ensure it has enough cash on hand to pursue strategic
plans, including the introduction of new products like PocketCam.
	   One of Polaroid's most recent inventions, the small instant
camera produces miniature photos and is designed to appeal to young
adults and children. For the even younger set, there's Barbie
Instant Camera, a pink and purple unit that piggybacks on the
popularity of Mattel's famous doll.
	   Also Wednesday, company officials reiterated their intention to
spend reserves of $90 million in the fourth quarter. About $50
million will be used to cover the cost of restructuring, and $40
million for anticipated losses in Russia.
	   Many Russian vendors have been unable to pay Polaroid for
products sent to them, Childs said, and film that has gone unsold
there has been thrown out or returned to the company.
	   Polaroid makes instant photographic cameras and films; digital
imaging hardware, software and media; and an array of other
products.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The text of a statement issued by President Saddam Hussein after
the U.S. airstrikes Thursday.
	   ___
	   ``President Saddam addresses Iraqi people during a new U.S. and
British aggression on Iraq.''
	   The great people of Iraq, sons of the brave armed forces, in
this day and this night of December 16/17 _ as they did eight years
ago on a similar night _ the wicked people bombarded several
targets on the soil of your great Iraq, thinking they will twist
your great will and your determination, your virtue and dignity,
your will of faith, righteousness and jihad (holy war)
	   We know, you beloved men and women, that the most thing that
hurt you was not their aggression or their aggressive nature, but
because they didn't come to meet you face to face, depending on a
long technological arm, which is not a measure of bravery.
	   Courage is your steadfastness, your valor and your jihad. So
resist and fight them as we trusted you and in the same way you are
known for.
	   Fight the enemies of God, enemies of the nation and enemies of
humanity. God will be on your side and disgrace will be theirs, now
and on the day of the judgment.

Blasts light the night over Baghdad after U.S. airstrikes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to ADD background, detail &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-US-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns opened fire over Baghdad
shortly after midnight Thursday, and explosions were heard in the
Iraqi capital. Orange tracers lit the sky as the guns let loose
volley after volley of shots from rooftops.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said U.S. and British airstrikes
hit several targets, and accused the two nations of cowardice for
using long-range missiles instead of fighting face-to-face.
	   In a statement carried by the official Iraqi News Agency, Saddam
urged Iraqis to ``Fight the enemies of God, enemies of the nation,
enemies of humanity.'' He did not say how many targets were hit.
	   He said the attackers did not ``come to meet you face to face''
and depended ``on a long technological arm, which is not a measure
of bravery.''
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft guns opened fire after air raid sirens broke
the night's silence _ and just before Washington and London
announced airstrikes on military and security installations. The
explosions continued into the pre-dawn hours, stopping briefly
before the morning chants calling Muslims to prayer wailed from the
city's mosques.
	   The Information Ministry said it planned to take reporters to
see the damage caused by one missile in the Karada neighborhood.
	   Karada is across the Tigris river from the Old Presidential
Complex in central Baghdad. It was not clear if the palace was
damaged. Saddam's whereabouts also were not known.
	   Unlike during previous Western alliance attacks on Baghdad,
there was no blackout. There were no immediate reports of
casualties, and the streets of Baghdad were nearly empty.
	   State-run television did not mention the attack and instead
continued to broadcast pictures of Saddam meeting Wednesday with
ruling Baath Party officials.
	   Along with the anti-aircraft fire, at least two large blasts
were heard, and foreign television transmissions showed a huge
fiery glow on the horizon. Smoke could be seen trailing into the
dark sky in the distance.
	   The Iraqi blasts violently shook the glass windows of the
Information Ministry building near the center of Baghdad where
foreign reporters are based.
	   The anti-aircraft fire began at 12:49 a.m. Thursday (2149 GMT
Wednesday). A barrage of blasts lighted the sky several hours after
the Clinton administration warned that it would make a military
strike against Iraq at any time.
	   President Clinton ordered airstrikes on Iraq over a protracted
impasse with Saddam over U.N. weapons inspections just minutes
before the blasts began. Less than an hour later, Prime Minister
Tony Blair announced that British had participated in the
airstrikes.
	   An Iraqi official seemed resigned even before the attack began.
	   ``We have done everything in our capacity,'' Iraq's U.N.
Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said at the United Nations.
	   Earlier in the day, long lines formed outside Baghdad gas
stations and customers cursed Clinton for planning an attack before
the holy Islamic month of Ramadan, which is expected to begin
Sunday.
	   ``It seems that Clinton ... wants to kill some people in a hurry
out of respect for Ramadan,'' said Amin Jadir, a government worker.
	   The crisis unfolded quickly after chief inspector Richard Butler
submitted a report Tuesday, accusing Iraq of obstructing their
search for weapons of mass destruction. The monitors were pulled
out of the country Wednesday.
	   In Washington, Clinton met with his top national security
advisers before ordering the attack, and the U.N. Security Council
held an emergency meeting in New York on the crisis.
	   China and Russia were angered by the attack.
	   Emerging from an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council,
China's ambassador, Qin Husaen, said: ``There is absolutely no
excuse of pretext to use force against Iraq.''
	   ``The use of force ... poses a threat to international as well
as regional stability,'' he said.
	   Blair blamed Saddam for precipitating the impasse: ``This action
could have been avoided. ... Our quarrel is with him alone and the
evil regime which he represents.''
	   In Baghdad, a special joint meeting of the decision-making
Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath Party issued a
statement, saying Iraqis can ``depend on God to knock the dreams
out of ... (the) empty heads'' of the United States and Britain.
	   The airstrikes are the first large-scale military action against
Iraq since September 1996. Over two days, U.S. ships and jets fired
scores of cruise missiles at Iraqi anti-missile sites to punish the
Iraqi military for venturing into the Kurdish ``safe haven'' in
northern Iraq.
	   Until the chemical and biological weapons are destroyed, the
United Nations will lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to the Persian Gulf War.
	   Iraq says it has complied with every U.N. demand, and accuses
Butler of prolonging the inspections at the behest of the United
States.
	   On Tuesday, Butler gave a report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in which he said Iraq's claim to be free of banned weapons
``cannot be accepted without further verification.'' But
verification is impossible as Iraq is obstructing the inspectors,
he said.

Stern hitting the slopes; Hunter thinks no deal til January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Stern is going to Aspen, Colorado for a
week, and Billy Hunter is going home for the holidays, too.
	   It doesn't look like there will be a season until February _ if
at all.
	   The National Basketball Association lockout was back on the slow
track Wednesday with the two men actually bickering over who should
call whom, and who made the first call last time.
	   ``If we are going to meet, in all probability it won't be until
the week between Christmas and New Year's,'' Hunter said in a
conference call with reporters. ``We're going to find ourselves
locked into a 12th-hour scenario.
	   ``At this stage it's kind of like poker, and what they're trying
to do is see who blinks first.''
	   The sides have not met since Saturday, and no meetings are
scheduled prior to this weekend, when Stern will leave for his
residence in the Colorado ski resort town.
	   An NBA spokesman said Stern could be back in New York within a
few hours if developments warranted.
	   Hunter said he will fly home to San Francisco for the holidays
if Stern leaves town.
	   The union director, in one of his most detailed conversations of
the 5 1/2-month-old lockout, said the ``drop dead'' date for saving
the season must be after the holidays.
	   ``Things can't be too critical or extreme in view of the fact
that commissioner Stern is planning a vacation in Aspen. If that's
the case, I would assume that Jan. 1 is not the drop dead date.
	   ``We have looked at the proposed schedules, and we are aware if
the season would start by Feb. 1, there would be at least 40-42
games left. If you eliminate the All-Star game and maybe added a
week or so, you could get up to 50-55 games.''
	   In order to play 55 games, however, teams would have to play
five games per week.
	   A more likely scenario, if the season indeed started Feb. 1,
would be a 48- or 50-game schedule with teams playing nine games
every two weeks.
	   The sides are fighting over how to split dlrs 2 billion in
annual revenue.
	   The main points of contention remain how large a percentage of
revenues will be devoted to salaries and whether there will be an
absolute maximum salary for players with more than seven years'
experience.
	   The union made what Hunter called a ``substantial concession''
Saturday by offering a dlrs 10 million limit on the salary in the
first year of any new contract signed by a player with less than
seven years' experience.
	   Although the situation looks bleak, both Hunter and deputy
commissioner Russ Granik have said that a deal could be closed in
less than 24 hours once the sides get back inside the bargaining
room.

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Picabo Street, who won a gold medal in the
women's super G in the 1998 Winter Olympics, was named SportsWoman
of the Year on Wednesday by the United States Olympic Committee.
	   During the inaugural USOC Sports Awards banquet, fellow gold
medal winners Jonny Moseley, the freestyle mogul skier, and the
women's ice hockey team also were honored.
	   The 23-year-old Moseley took the USOC SportsMan of the Year
award, beating cyclist Lance Armstrong and swimmer Lenny
Krayzelburg.
	   The U.S. Olympic women's ice hockey team earned the USOC Team of
the Year award, edging out the women's basketball World
Championship Team and the women's national softball team.
	   Street, who returned from reconstructive knee surgery in
December 1997 to win the gold by .01 second, beat track and field
standout Marion Jones and tennis champion Lindsay Davenport in the
final balloting.
	   ``The Olympic gold medal is the best moment in my life,'' said
the 27-year-old Street, who suffered a season-ending leg injury at
the Alpine World Cup finals in Switzerland in March. ``It's the
most satisfaction I've ever felt and probably ever will.''
	   Moseley was pleased his sport is gaining recognition.
	   ``It's definitely not your classic Olympic sport,'' said Moseley
of the ski event that requires weaving over bumps followed by an
acrobatic jump.
	   ``Just to be nominated feels great, and it's great for my
sport.''
	   The women's ice hockey team captured the hearts of Americans
with their gold-medal victory over Canada. A.J. Mleczko, a center
on the team, said the Nagano experience helped popularize hockey
among women.
	   ``Women now are seeing it's okay to play hockey,'' Mleczko said.
``Just like it's okay for girls to play tennis, soccer and figure
skating.''
	   ``When I go to the rink, people recognize us,'' said Sarah
Tueting, who played goalie. ``Little girls want our autograph.''

Chinese dissidents put on trial, without defense lawyers

<TEXT>
	   HANGZHOU, China _ After conducting a last-minute roundup of
their supporters and scaring away defense lawyers, China put its
two most high-profile dissidents on trial Thursday for trying to
start an opposition party.
	   About 20 uniformed police flanked the court building in Hangzhou
where Wang Youcai, a former student leader of 1989 prodemocracy
protests, was being tried. Wang's wife and two family friends were
the only supporters of his side allowed to attend the session.
	   At the entrance to the narrow alley leading to the courthouse,
some 200 people gathered in a show of support for Wang. One woman
displayed a small banner carrying the characters ``kang yi,'' or
protest, successfully resisting efforts by plainclothes police to
grab it.
	   Some in the group said they had travelled from distant cities in
an attempt to attend the trial. Police appeared to be taking a
conciliatory stance toward the protesters, although local officials
prevented foreign reporters from conducting interviews.
	   Meanwhile, 500 kilometers (300 miles) to the west in Wuhan,
veteran activist Qin Yongmin was put on trial, a court official
said without providing details.
	   A group of Qin's relatives was allowed into the court building
during the trial. There was no sign of unusual activity outside.
	   The prosecution of Wang and Qin, who could be sentenced to life
in prison if convicted, is part of the Communist Party's most
aggressive crackdown in two years on challengers to its monopoly on
power.
	   Qin and Wang are charged with trying to subvert state power,
apparently for their roles in trying to set up the China Democracy
Party.
	   More than 30 people associated with the party have been detained
or questioned in a 17-day-old campaign.
	   The defense lawyer hired for Wang was ordered off the case after
being held temporarily, and family members say others have been
pressured not to defend either man.
	   An official for the Hangzhou foreign affairs office, Bao
Zhicheng, said Wang's trial would last only one day and the verdict
would be announced later by China's state-run media.
	   Wang's wife expects her husband to be convicted.
	   ``Whether he has a lawyer or not, whatever he says, the
government has already decided,'' Hu Jiangxia said Wednesday.
	   The trials began a day before a major Communist Party gathering
in Beijing to celebrate the achievements of 20 years of economic
reform. The timing of the events highlights the widening gap
between growing social and economic freedom in China and a closed
political system that deals harshly with dissent.
	   Human rights groups protested the crackdown. ``The government's
sole concern is to maintain its unchallenged grip on power at the
cost of smothering the Chinese people's fundamental rights and
freedoms,'' said Xiao Qiang, executive director of the New
York-based group Human Rights in China.
	   Chinese government official contend that the trials are for
criminal acts and have nothing to do with human rights.
	   Qin, 44, and Wang, 32, are among the most prominent dissidents
still active in China. A third leading figure, Xu Wenli, also has
been detained, but not charged.
	   The families of Qin and Wang have not been allowed to speak to
them since they were detained _ Wang in early November and Qin at
the end of the month.
	   Since Wang publicly announced in June that he and others in
Hangzhou were setting up the party, dissidents in at least 14
provinces and cities have set up party branches. Authorities have
refused their applications to register the party as required by
law.
	   Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has put on
trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. He
was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-year
sentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile.

	   We know, you beloved men and women, that the thing that hurt you
most was not their aggression or their aggressive nature, but
because they didn't come to meet you face to face, depending on a
long technological arm, which is not a measure of bravery.
	   Courage is your steadfastness, your valor and your jihad. So
resist and fight them as we trusted you and in the same way you are
known for.
	   Fight the enemies of God, enemies of the nation and enemies of
humanity. God will be on your side and disgrace will be theirs, now
and on the day of the judgment.

Dollar higher against yen after attack on Iraq, Tokyo stocks lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar remained higher against the yen at
midday Thursday after U.S. and British forces attacked Iraq for
defying U.N. arms inspectors. Japanese stocks fell.
	   At midday, the dollar bought 115.83 yen, up 0.21 yen from
Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 116.53 yen
overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 89.19 points,
or 0.63 percent, ending the morning session at 14,007.11. On
Wednesday, the average closed up 85.11 points, or 0.61 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar, considered a safe haven in
times of international unrest, briefly surged to as high as 117.17
yen following the military action.
	   Clinton said late Wednesday that he ordered a ``strong,
sustained series of airstrikes'' against Iraq in response to Saddam
Hussein's continued defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   By midday Thursday, however, the dollar lost most of its gains
on notions that the conflict would likely be of limited duration,
dealers said. Market attention shifted back to Clinton's political
travails and concerns over the gaping U.S. trade deficit, they
said.
	   Kenji Karikomi, general manager at Daiwa Securities, said
currency trading was thin as many players have retreated to the
sidelines to watch for further developments in Iraq and the
dollar's reaction.
	   On the stock market, share prices were lower in cautious trading
following an overnight fall on Wall Street and news of the
airstrikes, traders said.
	   In New York Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
32.70 points, closing at 8,790.60.
	   The air strikes against Iraq initially raised fears among stock
investors that recession-stricken Japan would face higher oil
costs. But most investors are now eying the currency movements as
an indicator of developments in Iraq, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 2.53 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,090.86.
The TOPIX closed up 4.12 points, or 0.38 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond was quoted at 1.330 percent, unchanged from
Wednesday's finish. Its price also was unchanged at 103.96 yen.

Britain's top court debates whether Pinochet judge was biased
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Court action possible Thursday &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For the second time in a month, Britain's highest
court is debating the fate of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
	   His return to the court comes because one of the judges who
denied the former Chilean dictator immunity from arrest is the
director of the fundraising arm of Amnesty International.
	   A five-judge tribunal in the House of Lords may announce a
decision Thursday.
	   If Pinochet wins this round, the judges would order a new
hearing Jan. 10 on the key question of whether as a former head of
state he has immunity from arrest. This would mark a setback in
Spain's efforts to extradite the 83-year-old general to face
charges of murder and torture.
	   If the Lords reject the latest move by Pinochet's lawyers, the
extradition process would be back on a track _ but it is a slow one
anyway.
	   A final decision could take months, or longer. Pinochet, who was
arrested Oct. 16 while recovering from back surgery, remains under
police guard at a rented mansion in Wentworth, 20 miles (30
kilometers) west of London.
	   Next month, the 83-year-old general is due to start fighting the
Spanish extradition warrant at a London magistrate's court.
	   Citing the maxim that justice must not only be done but seen to
be done, Pinochet's lawyers complained during a hearing Tuesday and
Wednesday about the Amnesty links of Lord Justice Leonard Hoffmann,
one of the majority judges in the Lords' 3-2 ruling Nov. 25 against
Pinochet.
	   In addition, Hoffmann's wife, Gillian, has worked since 1977 at
the group's London headquarters.
	   Amnesty has been a prime mover in a campaign to have Pinochet
brought to trial for murder, torture and other gross human rights
abuses during his 1973-90 rule after he overthrew an elected
Marxist.
	   An official Chilean report says some 3,000 people were murdered
or disappeared at the hands of his secret police.
	   The Spanish government's lawyers said the complaint about
Hoffmann was a desperate attempt to free Pinochet after his lawyers
failed to persuade Home Secretary Jack Straw, the British Cabinet
member with the final say in extradition proceedings, that Hoffmann
was biased.
	   Straw gave the go-ahead Dec. 9 for proceedings to start.
	   On Wednesday, lawyers for Amnesty told the judges _ none of whom
took part in the first hearing _ that neither Hoffmann nor his wife
played any role in the campaign to have Pinochet brought to trial.
	   Alun Jones, the British lawyer representing the Spanish
government, charged that the Pinochet team's real objection is that
Hoffmann is a liberal.
	   ``Some of your Lordships tend to take a more conservative
approach and some a more liberal approach to matters concerning
human rights,'' said Jones. ``It's the way the dice fall as to
which judges you draw.''
	   Hoffmann and his wife left their native South Africa in the
1960s and settled in Britain. They were opponents of apartheid.

U.S. fires hundreds of missiles on Iraq; 2 killed, 30 injured

CLARIFIES that attack could last several days; UPDATES with Saddam

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States fired hundreds of
missiles on Iraq Thursday, and at least one fell on an area near
President Saddam Hussein's biggest palace in Baghdad, witnesses and
officials said. At least two people were killed and 30 were
injured, a doctor said.
	   The first indication of the attack came when a barrage of
anti-aircraft fire lit up the night sky at 12:49 a.m. (2149 GMT
Wednesday), unleashing thunderous explosions as if at a giant
fireworks show and shaking windows of buildings.
	   Operation Desert Fox had begun.
	   Four more rounds of explosions shook the capital _ at 1:00 a.m.
(2200 GMT Wednesday), 2:29 a.m (2329 GMT Wednesday), 4 a.m. (0100
GMT) and 5.18 a.m. (0218 GMT).
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered airstrikes on
military and security targets after reading the latest U.N. reports
about Iraq's alleged obstruction of the United Nations Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   But apparently some missiles hit civilian areas.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the Aliyarmouk Hospital, said two
people were killed and more than 30 were injured, suffering mostly
burns in the face, hands and legs.
	   It appeared that much of the deafening noise during the attack
was made by anti-aircraft guns firing volley after volley at
invisible missiles, doing little damage other than burning the sky
with orange lines.
	   At least one explosion on the ground was heard in Baghdad. A
fiery glow spread over the horizon.
	   The roar of the last round of explosions was just fading away
when the muezzin's call to prayers wafted through the cold winter
air from a mosque's loudspeaker in Baghdad.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the events a ``sad day
for the world,'' saying he did everything in his power to seek
peace. But he didn't say whether the attacks were justified.
	   Saddam, however, didn't mince his words.
	   In a national broadcast on Iraq radio, Saddam said: ``The most
thing that hurt you was not their aggression ... but because they
didn't come to meet you face to face, depending on a long
technological arm, which is not a measure of bravery.''
	   In Karada, a mixed commercial and residential neighborhood, a
missile strike had burst water mains in a street, flooding a 2
kilometer (1 1/2 mile) stretch. Workers were seen trying to plug
the bubbling pipe.
	   Karada is across the Tigris river from the Old Presidential
Complex in central Baghdad. It was not clear if the palace was
damaged. Saddam's whereabouts also were not known.
	   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a second
missile hit another Baghdad neighborhood. This could not be
independently confirmed.
	   Clinton said in a nationally televised address from the Oval
Office that he ordered the attack because ``Saddam Hussein must not
be allowed to threaten his neighbors with nuclear weapons, poison
gas or biological weapons.''
	   Noting that the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins this
weekend, Clinton said the airstrikes were necessary now because
``for us to initiate military action during Ramadan would be
profoundly offensive to the Arab world.''
	   A senior Pentagon official said in Washington that warships
stationed in the Gulf fired hundreds of Tomahawk cruise missiles
and Navy EA-6B attack planes struck against Iraqi air defense
radars. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the
aircraft carrier USS Enterprise. The forces are bolstered with 15
B-52 heavy bombers.
	   The attack was the opening wave of an operation what will last
several days in a bid to damage key Iraqi military units and Iraq's
ability to produce weapons of mass destruction.

Winter bonuses cut for first time in five years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ 'Tis the season to be jolly, but not in Japan,
where companies slashed winter bonuses for the first time in five
years, according to an employer's association.
	   The average bonus was cut 1.6 percent from last winter, the
Japan Federation of Employer's Associations said in a survey
released Wednesday. It was the first time the winter bonus has
fallen since 1993, the group reported.
	   The association surveyed 271 large companies from 22 different
industries and found the average winter bonus to be 834,420 yen
(dlrs 7,183).
	   Last winter, the average bonus was 848,063 yen (dlrs 7,303).
	   Employees in the hotel industry suffered the greatest loss with
a 15.6 percent drop in their bonus, followed by auto workers, whose
bonus fell 12.8 percent, the association said.
	   In Japan, bonuses are considered part of workers' salaries and a
similar summer bonus is paid around July or early August. The
amount loosely reflects the company's profitability and is
considered a barometer of the health of the nation's overall
economy.
	   Hit by the country's worse recession in decades, many Japanese
companies have undertaken drastic restructuring and cost cutting
measures, including worker layoffs.

	   PEC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic passions have soared dangerously
high in Kosovo, following the burials of six young Serbs whose
deaths have prompted harassment and new threats against ethnic
Albanians in the province.
	   Serbian state-run media fueled the tensions late Wednesday,
calling the United States ``the biggest accomplice of the most
monstrous crimes of the Albanian terrorists,'' referring to the
bar-room shootings of the six youths in Pec on Monday.
	   At their burial, anger mixed with tears as mothers of the
victims joined other Pec women appealing to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to ``defend our children.''
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Serb military and police have increased their presence on
roads and in the cities of Kosovo. Serb police deny there has been
an increase.
	   A policeman heading to the funeral in Pec on Wednesday
reportedly shot and killed a suspected rebel in the latest in a
wave of violence that has taken dozens of lives since an October
truce. Some ethnic Albanians elsewhere complained of harassment
connected to the killings.
	   More than 1,000 people have been killed and 300,000 forced from
their homes since Milosevic began a crackdown on separatists in
February.
	   The shootings in Pec came on the bloodiest day since the
cease-fire agreement, which was meant to end months of fighting
between Serbian forces and rebels seeking independence in the
predominantly Albanian province. In addition to the Pec shootings,
the Yugoslav army claimed to have killed 36 guerrillas in a border
clash.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the Pec shootings, which
were carried out by masked gunmen who sprayed a bar full of Serbs.
The rebels' political representative, Adem Demaci, suggested the
Serbian regime may have been behind the attack, saying it did not
``fall within the concept of the KLA's liberation fight.''
	   But Serb politicians and others accuse ethnic Albanian rebels
and warn of retribution.
	   Vuk Draskovic, a nationalist opposition leader in Serbia, said
in comments published Wednesday that if ``Albanian terrorism''
isn't defeated, ``the Serb people will take their defense into
their own hands.''
	   Busloads of Serb police stood by in Kosovo's third-largest city
in case of unrest or attack at an emotional ceremony attended by
5,000 in the central square.
	   An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 Serbs also attended a rally in the
provincial capital Pristina, protesting the slayings.
	   Both events took place without incident.
	   International verifiers, whose presence is supposed to ease
tension and restore public confidence, were nowhere to be seen in
Pec, a day after some Serbs reacted to the killings by hurling
stones or spitting at armored U.S. observer vehicles.
	   Pec, located 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina, has
about 150,000 residents, including several thousand Serbs.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Justi Baumgardt's goal in the 69th minute
gave the United States a 2-1 victory over the Ukraine in an
exhibition women's soccer match Wednesday, tying its mark for
victories in a year at 21.
	   The victory increased the U.S. winning streak to eight matches,
its unbeaten streak to 18 and unbeaten streak in the United States
to 43.
	   The Americans improved to 21-1-2 this year _ the lone loss being
to Norway in an Algarve Cup match in Portugal _ and matched the
record for victories set in 1991 and also achieved in 1996.
	   Ukrainian forward Natalia Zinchenko opened the scoring on a free
kick in the 18th minute. Natalie Neaton tied the score in the 40th
minute, heading in a cross from Samantha Bagget.
	   Baumgardt scored the winner in the second half, taking a pass
from Ann Cook and putting a 40-yard shot just under the crossbar.

Seoul's Hyundai to build industrial park in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The owner of South Korea's largest
conglomerate returned from North Korea Thursday, saying he has
struck a deal to build an industrial park in the communist country.
	   ``A broad agreement was reached on the construction of an
industrial park on North Korea's west coast,'' Chung Ju-yung told
reporters after crossing the border at the neutral village of
Panmunjom.
	   Chung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai group, said
he plans to visit North Korea again in February to follow up the
agreement, reached with Kim Yong Sun, a close confidant of leader
Kim Jong Il.
	   Kim Yong Sun heads a communist party organization instrumental
in helping Hyundai set up unprecedented tours of a scenic North
Korean mountain that began last month.
	   Chung, who was in the North for three days, said the 6 sq.
kilometer (16,000 acre) industrial park will be built close to the
border with South Korea and accommodate footwear and other
labor-intensive facilities to be moved from the South.
	   Experts say the cost of labor in North Korea is about one-tenth
of that in the South.

Traditional allies offer firm backing for Iraq attack, but others
</HEADLINE>
angry &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with call for restraint from Indonesia, support from
Norway, Australia, New Zealand and Spain; EDITS thruout &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Staunch allies such as Germany and Canada offered
quick support for Wednesday's U.S.-British attack on Iraq, while
Russia and China angrily condemned the airstrikes and France said
it deplored ``the grave human consequences that they could have for
the Iraqi population.''
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, speaking in Madrid, Spain,
blasted the use of force as ``a violation of the United Nations
charter.''
	   ``Nobody has the right to act on their own in the name of the
United Nations and even less to pretend to be the judge of the
entire world,'' Ivanov said.
	   ``As a result of this military action, the lives of ordinary
people are in danger,'' he said, calling for an emergency meeting
of the U.N. Security Council.
	   China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasen was visibly angry when he
emerged from a Security Council session Wednesday evening, learning
of the attack only after the fact.
	   ``There is absolutely no excuse or pretext to use force against
Iraq,'' he said.
	   The German government noted, however, that the Iraqi leadership
``had been warned'' the international community would have to act
if it failed to cooperate fully with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``The federal government regrets that, in the face of the
attitude of the Iraqi leadership, it had to come now to the use of
military measures,'' its statement said.
	   And France added that it also ``regrets that Iraqi leaders were
unable to show proof of the spirit of complete cooperation''
demanded by the Feb. 23 memorandum of understanding signed by
Secretary General Kofi Annan and Iraq's Tariq Aziz.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said his government
supported the airstrikes, adding that Canada had not been asked to
contribute militarily.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has brought this crisis on himself,'' Canadian
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was noncommittal,
saying, ``Israel is outside the dispute, and in any case will take
care of defending itself if the need arises.''
	   While Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic nation,
called on the United States and Iraq to demonstrate restraint.
	   ``We call on the conflicting parties to settle their problem
peacefully and through diplomatic ways,'' said acting Foreign
Ministry spokesman Imron Kotan.
	   People in Japan, Australia and New Zealand woke up Thursday to
the news, carried live on both television and radio, and Japanese
newspapers issued extras.
	   Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka backed the United
States and Britain, saying, ``We strongly demand that Iraq
immediately and unconditionally implement the U.N. Security
Council's resolutions.''
	   He was seconded by Misao Nozaki, a 47-year-old Tokyo restaurant
owner who called the bombing justified ``because Iraq has continued
developing nuclear weapons in a way that goes against the common
sense of the rest of the world.''
	   But Yukari Ohi, 38, an office worker in Tokyo, said she opposed
the use of force.
	   ``I think the U.S. decision to attack Iraq was apparently
intended to shift attention from the impeachment issue to war,''
Ohi said, noting that the airstrikes came as U.S. President Bill
Clinton faced an impeachment vote.
	   Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Norway gave their support to
the air attacks, putting the blame squarely on Iraq.
	   The news broke too late for the first editions of most British
papers, but the country's largest-selling tabloid, The Sun, led its
front page with the headline ``BLITZED.''
	   ``Saddam must be crushed. Blitz about time too,'' the paper
declared in a Thursday editorial. But about 30 demonstrators
disagreed, yelling ``Kill Tony Blair!'' outside the prime
minister's Downing Street residence.
	   In the United States, members of Congress generally endorsed the
bombing, while noting that it conveniently took the spotlight off
the Clinton impeachment proceedings.
	   In New York City's Times Square, however, demonstrators shouted
``No blood for oil'' and ``Let Iraq live'' in front of an armed
forces recruiting center.

Blasts light the night over Baghdad after U.S. airstrikes

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ American and British forces bombarded Iraq
in Thursday's early darkness and explosions sounded in Baghdad.
Iraqi gunners fired volleys of anti-aircraft flak over the capital,
and Saddam Hussein accused the West of cowardice for attacking with
long-range missiles.
	   At least two people were killed and 30 were injured, a doctor
said.
	   The Iraqi president urged Iraqis to ``Fight the enemies of God,
enemies of the nation, enemies of humanity.'' He said ``several
targets'' were hit, in the statement carried by the official Iraqi
News Agency.
	   In a radio broadcast, Saddam said the attackers did not ``come
to meet you face to face'' and depended ``on a long technological
arm, which is not a measure of bravery.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered airstrikes on
military and security targets after reading the latest U.N. reports
about Iraq's alleged obstruction of the United Nations Special
Commission, which is responsible for eliminating the country's
weapons of mass destruction. But apparently some missiles hit
civilian areas.
	   Dr. Hazim el-Nasri, head of the Aliyarmouk Hospital, said two
people were killed and more than 30 were injured, suffering mostly
burns in the face, hands and legs.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft guns opened fire after air raid sirens broke
the night's silence _ and just before Washington and London
announced airstrikes on military and security installations. The
explosions continued into the pre-dawn hours, stopping briefly
before morning chants calling Muslims to prayer wailed from the
city's mosques.
	   Unlike during previous Western alliance attacks on Baghdad,
there was no blackout. There were no immediate reports of
casualties, and the streets of Baghdad were nearly empty.
	   State-run television did not mention the attack and instead
continued to broadcast pictures of Saddam meeting Wednesday with
ruling Baath Party officials.
	   Along with the anti-aircraft fire, at least two large blasts
were heard, and foreign television transmissions showed a huge
fiery glow on the horizon. Smoke could be seen trailing into the
dark sky in the distance.
	   The Iraqi blasts violently shook the glass windows of the
Information Ministry building near the center of Baghdad where
foreign reporters are based.
	   The anti-aircraft fire began at 12:49 a.m. Thursday (2149 GMT).
A barrage of blasts lighted the sky several hours after the Clinton
administration warned that it would make a military strike against
Iraq at any time.
	   Clinton ordered airstrikes on Iraq over a protracted impasse
with Saddam over U.N. weapons inspections just minutes before the
blasts began. Less than an hour later, Prime Minister Tony Blair
announced that British had participated in the airstrikes.
	   An Iraqi official seemed resigned even before the attack began.
	   ``We have done everything in our capacity,'' Iraq's U.N.
Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said at the United Nations.
	   Earlier in the day, long lines formed outside Baghdad gas
stations and customers cursed Clinton for planning an attack before
the holy Islamic month of Ramadan, which is expected to begin
Sunday.
	   ``It seems that Clinton ... wants to kill some people in a hurry
out of respect for Ramadan,'' said Amin Jadir, a government worker.
	   The crisis unfolded quickly after chief inspector Richard Butler
submitted a report Tuesday, accusing Iraq of obstructing their
search for weapons of mass destruction. The monitors were pulled
out of the country Wednesday.
	   In Washington, Clinton met with his top national security
advisers before ordering the attack, and the U.N. Security Council
held an emergency meeting in New York on the crisis.
	   Blair blamed Saddam for precipitating the impasse: ``This action
could have been avoided. ... Our quarrel is with him alone and the
evil regime which he represents.''
	   In Baghdad, a special joint meeting of the decision-making
Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath Party issued a
statement, saying Iraqis can ``depend on God to knock the dreams
out of ... (the) empty heads'' of the United States and Britain.
	   The airstrikes are the first large-scale military action against
Iraq since September 1996. Over two days, U.S. ships and jets fired
scores of cruise missiles at Iraqi anti-missile sites to punish the
Iraqi military for venturing into the Kurdish ``safe haven'' in
northern Iraq.
	   Until the chemical and biological weapons are destroyed, the
United Nations will not lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led to the Persian Gulf
War.
	   Iraq says it has complied with every U.N. demand, and accuses
Butler of prolonging the inspections at the behest of the United
States.
	   On Tuesday, Butler gave a report to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in which he said Iraq's claim to be free of banned weapons
``cannot be accepted without further verification.'' But
verification is impossible as Iraq is obstructing the inspectors,
he said.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Athletes and officials at the Asian
Games are big drinkers.
	   They're expected to down 1.7 million cans and bottles of soft
drinks and drinking water during the 15-day event.
	   Daily, the Athletes Village is also supplied with 1,200
kilograms (2,640 pounds) of ice cubes to keep drinks cool when
athletes go out to train.
	   ``The athletes can also use the ice for first aid in case they
suffer any sporting injuries,'' says Choopong Kiangsiri, a manager
of the village where the games' 6,000 athletes reside.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NOW, THE SNOW: With the Asian Games in the home stretch, the
continent is turning to the snow for its next sporting
extravaganza.
	   Forty days after the closing ceremony of the 13th Asian Games,
the stage will be set for the 4th Asian Winter Games in South
Korea's Kangwon province.
	   Scheduled for the Jan. 30-Feb. 6 event is competition in alpine
skiing, regulation and short-track speed skating, figure skating,
cross-country skiing, biathlon and ice hockey.
	   The games are being held at five venues with three complexes in
the mountainous backbone of the Korean Peninsula.
	   The mascot: a smiling Manchurian black bear with its arms out in
welcome.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HONING IN ON MEDALS: Specialization is the key to success among
a number of nations grappling for medals at the Asian Games.
	   The Kuwaitis focused on shooting, where they picked up seven of
their eight medals, while seven of Indonesia's 13 medals came from
the martial arts as of Wednesday.
	   Over 45 percent of Singapore's medals have been earned in
yachting, and the sport is also the most successful one for another
seaside competitor _ Hong Kong. It won a gold, a silver and a
bronze on the water.
	   All of Qatar's five medals come from athletics and a third of
Uzbekistan's 25 medals were won in canoeing.
	   Weightlifters from Myanmar, also called Burma, gave their nation
five of its seven medals.
	   A half of Iran's medals come from martial arts and 60 percent of
Mongolia's were won in judo.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WEATHER WATCH: Soccer fans in Bangkok are hoping for foul
weather. It may be the only way they'll be able to see the Thai
team play China for an Asian Games bronze medal Saturday.
	   The event has been scheduled for Songkhla in southern Thailand
and organizers say it would be unfair to switch the venue after all
the preparations and tickets sales.
	   But the chairman of the games' executive committee, Jurin
Laksanawisit, said that if storms or other weather problems
surfaced it would be ``reasonable for the technical committee to
look for a new competition place.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ONLY THE BEST, PLEASE: Track performances may be better than
ever, but fewer athletes are competing because countries want only
their finest to take part in the Asian Games, says one of Asia's
top sports officials.
	   Maurice R. Nicholas, secretary-treasurer of the Asian Amateur
Athletic Association, says the choice is left to national Olympic
committees, which have generally opted to just bring potential
winners rather than giving more athletes a chance to participate in
the games.
	   For the first time in the 47-year history of the games,
Singapore didn't send a single track and field athlete to the
Bangkok games because none was deemed good enough.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NO AGE LIMIT TO STAY: The Asian Games are likely to stay with no
age limit for soccer rather than conform to the Olympic Games,
where only players under 23 compete. The age limit was first
imposed at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, when the International
Olympic Committee and the world soccer body decided it should give
young players an opportunity to shine in world-class competition.
	   But Voravi Magudee, secretary-general of the Football
Association of Thailand, says allowing players of all ages,
including older World Cup participants, to compete enlivened
matches at the Asian Games.
	   He said many teams had in fact sent younger players to the
Bangkok Games. More than half of Japan's players are under 23, as
are many on the Chinese and South Korean teams.

<TEXT>
	   HANGZHOU, China _ After conducting a last-minute roundup of
their supporters and scaring away defense lawyers, China put its
two most high-profile dissidents on trial Thursday for trying to
start an opposition party.
	   About 20 uniformed police flanked the court building in Hangzhou
where Wang Youcai, a former student leader of 1989 prodemocracy
protests, was being tried. Wang's wife and two family friends were
the only supporters of his side allowed to attend the 2 1/2 hour
session.
	   At the entrance to the narrow alley leading to the courthouse,
some 200 people gathered in a show of support for Wang. One woman
displayed a small banner carrying the characters ``kang yi,'' or
``protest,'' successfully resisting efforts by plainclothes police
to grab it.
	   Some in the group said they had travelled from distant cities in
an attempt to attend the trial. Police appeared to be taking a
conciliatory stance toward the protesters, although local officials
prevented foreign reporters from conducting interviews.
	   Meanwhile, 500 kilometers (300 miles) to the west in Wuhan,
veteran activist Qin Yongmin's also went on trial. Police detained
a man who shouted to Qin as he was taken away in a police van
following the 2 1/2 hour session. Another man who attempted to make
a speech outside the courthouse also was seized by police.
	   Wang and Qin were charged with trying to subvert state power,
apparently for their involvement in trying to set up the China
Democracy Party. They could be sentenced to life in prison if
convicted.
	   The trials are part of the Communist Party's most aggressive
crackdown in two years on challengers to its monopoly on power.
More than 30 people associated with the China Democracy Party have
been detained or questioned in a 17-day-old campaign.
	   The defense lawyer hired for Wang was ordered off the case after
being held temporarily, and family members say others have been
pressured not to defend either man.
	   It was unclear if the trials had ended or if they would
continue. Local officials said verdicts would be announced later by
China's state-run media.
	   Wang's wife expected her husband to be convicted.
	   ``Whether he has a lawyer or not, whatever he says, the
government has already decided,'' Hu Jiangxia said Wednesday.
	   The trials began a day before a major Communist Party gathering
in Beijing to celebrate the achievements of 20 years of economic
reform. The timing of the events highlights the widening gap
between growing social and economic freedom in China and a closed
political system that deals harshly with dissent.
	   Human rights groups protested the crackdown. ``The government's
sole concern is to maintain its unchallenged grip on power at the
cost of smothering the Chinese people's fundamental rights and
freedoms,'' said Xiao Qiang, executive director of the New
York-based group Human Rights in China.
	   Chinese government official contend that the trials are for
criminal acts and have nothing to do with human rights.
	   Qin, 44, and Wang, 32, are among the most prominent dissidents
still active in China. A third leading figure, Xu Wenli, also has
been detained, but not charged.
	   The families of Qin and Wang have not been allowed to speak to
them since they were detained _ Wang in early November and Qin at
the end of the month.
	   Since Wang publicly announced in June that he and others in
Hangzhou were setting up the party, dissidents in at least 14
provinces and cities have set up party branches. Authorities have
refused their applications to register the party as required by
law.
	   Wang and Qin are the most well-known dissidents China has put on
trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in 1996. He
was convicted of subversion and served less than two of an 11-year
sentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go into exile.

Anwar's former official residence raided
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police searched jailed
politician Anwar Ibrahim's former official residence and took away
mattresses and pillows, the trial court was told Thursday.
	   The chief defense lawyer said police went to the former deputy
prime minister's official residence on Wednesday, one day after
prosecutors produced a semen-stained mattress in court as evidence
of his alleged illegal sex acts.
	   ``I understand from my client that his former residence was
raided by police yesterday afternoon,'' Raja Aziz Adrusse told the
court. No details were available.
	   Musa Hassan, the assistant commissioner of police who
investigated the accusations of sodomy, adultery and abuse of power
against Anwar, confirmed that the search occurred, but said it was
not related to the 10 charges that Anwar faces.
	   Musa was giving his testimony as the prosecution's 13th witness.
	   Anwar has denied all the accusations against him, saying they
were cooked up to eliminate his challenge to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule.
	   On Tuesday, prosecutors dragged a mattress into the courtroom.
They said it was seized from a Kuala Lumpur apartment which they
alleged had been used by Anwar for his secret sexual escapades,
including sleeping with his former secretary's wife.
	   But the defense said there was no proof that it was a mattress
that was used by Anwar. Police said they had conducted a DNA test
on the semen stains on the mattress, but the results were not
disclosed.
	   On Thursday, Musa also testified that Anwar's adopted brother,
Sukma Dermawan, had told him about a ``homosexual relationship''
between the two.
	   ``Sukma told me that he and Anwar had been enmeshed in a
homosexual affair,'' Musa told the court.
	   Musa's latest testimony was meant to rebut defense claims that
police had coerced Sukma into confessing that he was sodomized by
Anwar.
	   Sukma has said in a statement from jail that police broke down
his resolve by conducting a painful examination of his genitalia,
Anwar's lawyer told the court on Wednesday.
	   Sukma, 38, is serving a six-month sentence, along with Anwar's
speech writer, Munawar Ahmad Anees, who also pleaded guilty to
having sex with Anwar.
	   Both men are now appealing their convictions.
	   The government's case was prompted by accusations by Ummi
Hafilda Ali, the sister of Anwar's former secretary, and Azizan Abu
Bakar, a former driver for the politician's family.
	   Ummi wrote a letter in 1997 alleging sexual misconduct that was
submitted to Mahathir. Police investigations concluded the charges
were spurious and exonerated Anwar. Mahathir halted the
investigations last August.
	   But Musa began investigating the case afresh this year after a
book containing all the accusations was published.

Ministers from three oil exporters gather for meeting

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Ministers from three top oil producers
gathered in the Spanish capital on Thursday for a meeting to
examine ways to improve sagging oil prices.
	   Oil prices, buffeted by overproduction amid a global economic
crisis especially in the Asian financial markets, have hovered this
year around 12-year lows, causing pain among oil-dependent
economies of a number of countries.
	   The slide continued despite repeated attempts earlier this year
at production cuts to boost the price.
	   Thursday's meeting brings together ministers from Saudi Arabia,
the leading producer among the 11-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, No. 3 OPEC exporter Venezuela and non-OPEC
member Mexico.
	   Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi, the energy ministers of Venezuela
and Mexico, Erwin Arrieta and Luis Tellez respectively, arrived in
Madrid Wednesday. The meeting was planned for Thursday at a yet
unannounced location in the Spanish capital.
	   A Gulf source close to the Saudis said the meeting is part of an
ongoing process of consultations and attempts to bring stability to
the market and to improve oil prices in different ways, ``including
adherence'' to production levels.
	   ``All options are under discussion,'' he said, with one aim:
achieving a higher price,'' he said. ``This year is definitely an
exceptional year. The oil market has gone through difficult
times.''
	   But he cautioned that there should not be high or low
expectations from the tripartite meeting. He spoke on condition he
is not identified further.
	   But markets did not wait even for the meeting to start. Earlier
this week, crude oil prices rose slightly on hopes that the three
will find a way to curb output and boost prices.
	   The price of Brent crude stood this week at around dlrs 10 a
barrel.
	   A Gulf source said Thursday that the Saudis would like to see a
price target for Brent at between dlrs 15 and dlrs 20.
	   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico have been responsible for two
rounds of output cuts this year, totaling about 3.2 million barrels
from world oil producers. Analysts say another 1.5 million barrels
must be taken off the market to begin having an effect on prices.

Iraqi envoy calls for immediate cessation of U.S. attacks

cessation of U.S. attacks. PICKS UP 5th graf pvs: The

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq's U.N. envoy urged the Security
Council on Wednesday to call for an immediate halt to U.S. and
British attacks which he said were wrecking the lives of innocent
Iraqis.
	   Speaking at the start of a formal council meeting, Nizar Hamdoon
accused chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler of producing a
biased report Tuesday which concluded that Baghdad had not fully
cooperated with the U.N. monitors and triggered the airstrikes.
	   Russia and China backed Iraq's claim that the report was not
objective, but the United States and Britain accused Iraq of
failing to give the U.N. Special Commission, which Butler heads,
the cooperation it needs to complete its verification of Iraq's
disarmament.
	   Hamdoon said Butler cited only five incidents in 300 inspection
operations and this was used as justification by the United States
and Britain to attack Iraq.
	   ``The exaggerated uproar over the Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction is nothing more than a big lie,'' he said. ``The other
lie is that Iraq poses a threat to its neighbors.''
	   The Iraqi envoy challenged the Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, to produce physical evidence that Iraq still has prohibited
weapons.
	   He also called on the council ``to fulfill its responsibilities
as set forth in the United Nations charter and request immediate,
unconditional cessation of the aggression that is under way against
Iraq.''
	   Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the bombing of
Iraq ``a sad day for the world.''
	   He said he did everything in his power to seek peace and deeply
regrets not being able to avert the use of force.
	   The divided council discussed Butler's report and the Iraqi
attack in private three times Wednesday before holding an open
session Wednesday night.
	   ``This is a situation of dire relevance to the Security Council
mandate and members consequently want to discuss their positions,''
said Russia's U.N. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov, who called for the
formal meeting. ``I'm sure there will be some condemnation.''

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Igor Korolev scored twice during a four-goal
outburst in the second period as the Toronto Maple Leafs handed the
Phoenix Coyotes only their fourth loss of the season, 5-2 Wednesday
night.
	   Mats Sundin, Darby Hendrickson and Fredrik Modin also scored for
the Leafs, who are 12-1-1 against Western Conference clubs this
season.
	   Toronto became the first team this season to score five goals
against Phoenix, which has the NHL's top defense.
	   Jeremy Roenick and Oleg Tverdovsky scored for the Coyotes
(17-4-4), who played with injured star Keith Tkachuk.
 &UR; Devils 6, Rangers 3 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Jason Arnott scored two goals
and linemates Petr Sykora and Patrik Elias added three assists
apiece as the New Jersey Devils beat the New York Rangers.
	   Jay Pandolfo also had two goals and Sheldon Souray and Bobby
Holik each scored once as the Devils used a three-goal second
period to extend their season-high unbeaten streak to 6-0-2.
	   New Jersey, more offensive since Robbie Ftorek replaced Jacques
Lemaire as coach, has now scored at least five goals in each of its
last five games _ the first time that's happened in team history.
 &UR; Panthers 4, Penguins 1 &QC; 
	   In Sunrise, Florida, Ray Whitney and Bill Lindsay scored goals
47 seconds apart in the third period to help the Florida Panthers
beat the Pittsburgh Penguins.
	   Lindsay added an open-net goal with six seconds left, his fourth
of the season.
	   Scott Mellanby had a goal and two assists, including his 300th
career assist on the open-net goal, and Rob Niedermayer added two
assists for Florida.
 &UR; Red Wings 5, Bruins 3 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Defensemen Nick Lidstrom and Larry Murphy each
scored a goal as the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Boston Bruins.
	   Murphy (23 points) and Lidstrom (19) are two of the top scoring
defensemen in the league.
	   The Red Wings, who have won six straight at home, ended Boston's
three-game road winning streak. Chris Osgood made 23 saves,
improving his career record against Boston to 6-1.

EU braced for talks on agricultural subsidies at summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ European Union delegates are braced for
discussions on the thorny issue of agricultural subsidies when they
meet Thursday with Prime Minister Jean Chretien and several of his
cabinet ministers.
	   While farm subsidies aren't on the official agenda, the head of
the European Commission delegation says it's prepared for the topic
to be raised.
	   ``I understood from the Canadians they would like to bring this
subject to our attention and we would be prepared to engage in this
discussion,'' Ambassador Daniele Smadja said earlier this week.
	   Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima, president of the European
Council, and Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission,
will meet with Chretien, International Trade Minister Sergio Marchi
and Lloyd Axworthy, Canada's foreign affairs minister.
	   Friday, the European delegates have meetings scheduled with U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
	   Agricultural subsidies ``are something that we definitely want
to raise,'' said a Canadian trade department official.
	   The Canadian government recently announced a new dlrs 900
million farm aid package, aimed particularly at troubled grain and
hog producers.
	   Farm income across the country is expected to plunge 20 percent
this year from 1997 levels.
	   Many blame large American and European farm subsidies for
shaking an industry already devastated by economic collapses in
Asia and Russia.
	   But Canada also wants to challenge France on its ban on
asbestos, European barriers to wine and irritants regarding auto
imports. As well, Canada will probe the EU's agenda for the next
round of talks at the World Trade Organization, the official added.

Suspicion, support from Americans reacting to bombing

	   While some Americans were skeptical about the timing of the
attack on Iraq, many others interviewed across the country said the
action was appropriate and doubted suggestions President Bill
Clinton ordered the bombing to divert attention from his
impeachment woes.
	   ``That's ridiculous,'' said Marcia Shockey, a worker at the
Oklahoma Capitol in Oklahoma City. ``Why would anyone go to war to
divert attention?''
	   But Dave Peterson, manager of a Hooters Restaurant in Phoenix,
said he would not put it past the president.
	   ``This looks like a good way to stop his impeachment,''
Peterson, 24, said as he waited for the dinner crowd to arrive.
``We have been talking about this forever. Why would they start
bombing now?''
	   In downtown Richmond, Virginia, Linda Messer and Janet Jenness
stared at the TV at the end of the bar in the Penny Lane Pub for
long moments Wednesday evening, then agreed the attack on Iraq was
way overdue.
	   ``He should have done this a long time ago,'' said Ms. Messer,
35, sipping a beer. ``With all the confusion going on, he's doing a
remarkable job by just continuing to do his job.''
	   Ms. Jenness, 29, said she was disturbed that some Republicans
were challenging Clinton's decision to bomb Iraq just hours before
the full House of Representatives had been scheduled to debate
articles to impeach him. House Republicans reluctantly agreed to
delay the impeachment debate until at least Friday.
	   ``He's still the commander in chief and he's still the
president,'' she said. ``To suggest that he's orchestrated this to
divert attention from the House vote is just cynical.''
	   Clinton ordered a ``strong, sustained series of airstrikes''
against Iraq on Wednesday in response to Saddam Hussein's continued
defiance of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Speaking to the nation from the White HOuse, Clinton said he
acted ``to protect the national interest of the United States'' and
Iraq's neighbors in the Middle East.
	   Matt Mallec, a 26-year-old bartender in downtown Phoenix, was
suspicious of the president's motives.
	   ``It's ironic how once again, here he is in hot water and that
gets pushed aside and he comes out looking like a hero again,''
Mallec said as he sat in a booth on a break, watching Clinton on
CNN.
	   Others agreed.
	   ``I'm extremely distrubed by the suddenness of the events
considering all that's going on right now in this country,'' Nancy
Lambert, 44, said in Los Angeles.
	   ``I just think it's a political thing,'' said Winifred Smith of
Vienna, West Virginia. ``I'm just sick of this whole mess anyway.''
	   Greg Reid of Tustin, California, however, said it was Saddam's
motives that needed to be questioned.
	   ``I really think Saddam is taking advantage of the political
situation here _ and misreading it,'' said Reid, a 48-year-old real
estate broker. ``He doesn't know the United States is in full
support of the office of the president. Even though I don't like
Clinton or what he did, I think his response is proper, and the
reason it's proper is because Saddam has been ignoring the
inspectors.''
	   In Los Angeles, Christhion Coie, 48, said Saddam should be
turned ``into dust.''
	   ``This is a very dangerous, psychotic man. If he can do what he
does to his own people, imagine what he would do to us,'' she said.
	   The bombing provoked an immediate reaction in New York City's
Times Square, where some 100 protesters shouted, ``No blood for
oil!'' and ``Let Iraq live!'' in front of a military recruiting
center.
	   Several blocks away, in Rockefeller Plaza, Joan Flanagan, 26,
expressed wariness of the president's motives.
	   ``It could be a stall tactic,'' she said, ``but I think he was
just reacting to what needed to be done.''
	   In Memphis, Tennessee, Scott Hughes, a welder, said Congress
should lay off Clinton for the time being. The president, he said,
should be free to concentrate on Saddam.
	   ``It's hard to fight two guys at once,'' Hughes, 41, said.
``I've done it, and it's harder.''
	   Investment banker Dan Rie of Scituate, Massachusetts, listened
to reports of the bombing in his car on the way to his office
Christmas party in Boston.
	   Rie said Republican criticism that Clinton ordered the attack to
divert attention from the impeachment process ``strikes me as
nuts.''
	   ``It seems to me that Republicans have gotten themselves in a
deep rut where everything is interpreted as related to the venal
Bill Clinton.''

Baseball gold lifts weight from Park's mind
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ After pitching South Korea's baseball
team to an Asian Games gold medal, the Los Angeles Dodgers' Park
Chan-ho had a multimillion-dollar weight lifted from his mind.
	   The victory exempted him from military service back home, and
serious disruption of his U.S. Major League career.
	   ``It's a really big thing for me because I will feel really
comfortable playing in the big leagues,'' Park said after South
Korea's 13-1 victory over Japan in the Asian Games final.
	   He allowed four hits in the seven innings he pitched before the
same was stopped under baseball's ``mercy rule,'' which limits
games to that length when one team has a lead of 10 or more runs.
	   South Korean regulations exempt certain sports standouts from
the mandatory 28 months of military service for all men aged 20 or
over.
	   The regulations, which apply to all international sports, grant
exemption to gold medalists in the Olympics, world championships
and the Asian Games.
	   ``All my teammates played well,'' Park said. ``I feel
appreciation to the hitters, that they made a lot of runs, so I
could relax.''
	   Commenting on the military deferment, he added: ``I'm really
happy about that, that we got the gold medal, because everybody
that chose to play, they don't have to go (serve).''
	   The South Koreans rapped out 14 hits against four Japanese
pitchers in the six innings they batted, while Japan's only run was
a first-inning homer by Kokichi Akune.
	   When the game was halted after the top of the seventh, ecstatic
Korean players tossed several of their teammates into the air,
starting with Park. Then they ran a victory lap around the field
carrying two large Korean flags.

Reports: Ministry may sue insurer over Thai Airways plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's ministry of transportation
may sue a local insurance company if it fails to pay equal
compensation to all families of the 101 people who died in the
crash of a Thai Airways plane, local papers reported Thursday.
	   ``The ministry will study legal terms as to whether it can act
as a damaged party to sue the insurer on behalf of the relatives
for equal compensation,'' Transport Minister Suthep Thaugsuban was
quoted as saying in the Bangkok Post.
	   Suthep's sister was among those who died in the crash of Flight
TG261 as it attempted its third landing during heavy rain last
Friday night in Surat Thani, 530 kilometers (330 miles) southwest
of Bangkok.
	   An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the crash
of the Airbus A310-200 jet.
	   Thai Airways President Thamnoon Wanglee promised shortly after
the accident that the airline would pay dlrs 100,000 to the
families of each person who died.
	   But Dhipaya Insurance, which had insured the plane, has been
inconsistent on the issue since Thamnoon's announcement.
	   The insurer now says it will decide how much should be paid to
the families on a case-by-case basis.
	   Suthep said that was wrong.
	   ``We see all the victims as being equal. It does not matter
whether they were locals or foreigners, or whether they were rich
or not. They were passengers of Thai International,'' Suthep said,
according to the Post.
	   There were 25 foreigners on board the flight, 12 of whom were
among the 45 survivors.
	   Several prominent Thais died in the crash, including a member of
Parliament, an award-winning physician and a celebrated women's
activist.
	   Eighteen badly-burned bodies still have yet to be identified by
forensic experts, the Post reported.
