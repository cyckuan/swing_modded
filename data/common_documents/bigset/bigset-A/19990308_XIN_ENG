<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Raid Radio Station Broadcasting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) - Israeli police in Jerusalem
raided a pirate radio station and questioned its owner Sunday
for broadcasting a death threat against the left-wing Meretz
party leader Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Bundak, the owner of the Voice of the East, went to the
police station along with a lawyer and said he was only joking
when he threatened to kill Sarid in a broadcast last Friday.
</P>
<P>
But Sarid said the threat has crossed "a line as red as
blood," demanding that the radio station be closed immediately.
</P>
<P>
Bundak said in the broadcast that he wanted to kill Sarid
becaused "he (Sarid) loves the Supreme Court more than religion."
</P>
<P>
Meretz is a left-wing secular party which is famous for its
opposition to what it calls the religious coercion by
ultra-Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
The party supported the Supreme Court in its recent rulings
which favor civil rights than religious laws, such as allowing
some shops to remain open on Saturday, the Jewish Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
The death threat came a week after the parliament passed
a legislation legalizing pirate radio stations which had been
broadcasting for five years without a license.
</P>
<P>
Sarid said if pirate radios such as the Voice of the
East remains open, then there will be "total chaos" in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the Supreme Court will Monday review
petitions including those from the Meretz against the legalization
of pirate radios.
</P>
<P>
After the death of the late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin,
killed by an ultra-nationalist in 1995, Israelis have urged the
government to take tough measures to curb incitement of violence
against politicians.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Politicians Offer Arms Compromises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Protestant First Minister of
Northern Ireland and his Catholic deputy on Sunday both proposed
possible ways round a row over IRA (Irish Republican Army) arms
which constitute a roadblock to the implementation of the peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
First Minister David Trimble was speaking a day after issuing
an invitation to the Irish Republican Army's political wing, Sinn
Fein, to talks on the issue.
</P>
<P>
In a newspaper interview, Trimble said he was ready to offer
the party a guarantee of immediate places on a Northern Ireland
governing executive following a positive move on weapons.
</P>
<P>
Trimble told the Sunday Business newspaper he was ready to
offer Sinn Fein guarantees that "a credible beginning of the
process" of handing over arms would lead automatically to a place
in power.
</P>
<P>
"There could be an element of what you might call choreography,
so that moves are arranged one to follow the other. But there has
to be that beginning," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Later, Trimble said in a BBC television interview that he
believed Sinn Fein would eventually agree to decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
"We may have to wait in order to get it, but I believe that we
will get it because I think that the Republican leaders know in
their hearts that it is necessary," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trimble' deputy, Seamus Mallon, voiced the belief that no
weapons need actually be handed over in advance, but a timetable
for them being "decommissioned" was necessary, according to a BBC
report.
</P>
<P>
An agreement reached on Good Friday last year by the Northern
Irish parties set the coming Wednesday as the deadline for setting
up the new all-party executive, which will take over many of the
powers at present exercised by the British government. But the
agreement also said that within two years, the province's
guerrilla groups must hand in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
Trimble has so far refused to set up the executive until the
IRA has handed over at least part of its massive arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Mallon said there had to be a shift in positions by both
Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party and by the IRA, influenced by Sinn
Fein.
</P>
<P>
From the IRA was needed "a form of words...that would soften
their position, which would point to the fact that decommissioning
will take place during the time appointed in the agreement which
everyone signed," he said.
</P>
<P>
But if such a form of words was offered, along with a timetable
for the handover of weapons, the Unionists should be ready to
accept that no arms would immediately be surrendered.
</P>
<P>
"I have suggested to both the Ulster Unionist Party and to Sinn
Fein that there is space between the absolute positions that both
have adopted, that they should move into that space and move into
it quickly," Mallon, of the moderate Social Democratic and Labour
Party, was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said although it was clear the March 10 deadline would be
allowed to slip, there was only a matter of days to save the Good
Friday agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz met with visiting
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen Sunday on the ongoing Iraqi
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the situation in the region in light of
the Iraqi-Western confrontations inside the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq, U.S. diplomatic sources told Kuwait
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
They said the talks have explored means of alleviating tension
, securing lasting peace and stability in the region and
confronting any threat of mass destruction posed by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen asserted Washington's keenness on preserving the Gulf
security from any possible Iraqi threats, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. attempt to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
the sources said Saudi Arabia reiterated its objection to any
foreign interference in bringing about a change to the Iraqi
regime, adding the matter is purely the affair of the Iraqi
people.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed U.S. arms sale to Saudi Arabia and bilateral
defense cooperation, the sources said Cohen informed Saudi
officials of Washington's approval to sell AMRAAM air-to-air
missiles to the Gulf kingdom, and to step up joint military
exercises with the Saudi army.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived in Riyadh from Bahrain Saturday, is expected
to leave for Oman, the third leg of his nine-nation Middle East
tour.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls on U.S. to Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Sunday called on the United States to lift its
sanctions on his country after Washington warned to review an oil
deal between Iran and two European companies.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. administration should lift sanctions against Iran
which have brought nothing but financial losses to the American
firms," Kharrazi said at a joint press conference with his
visiting Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama.
</P>
<P>
He said the interests of foreign firms, including the American
companies willing to be involved in development of oil and gas
industry in Iran mandate the U.S. administration to come to logic
and wisdom, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made his call after the U.S. State Department on
Tuesday criticized two French and Italian companies for signing a
deal with the National Iranian Oil Company to develop an oil and
gas field.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said
Washington is "disappointed and concerned" and will review the
deal under the Iran-Libya Sanction Act, which bans investment of
more than 20 million U.S. dollars in Iran's energy sectors.
</P>
<P>
Elf Aquitaine of France and an Italian company signed a deal on
Monday to boost Iran's oil production in the Dorood oil and gas
field in southwestern Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, two American oil companies on Wednesday urged the
U.S. government to put an end to its sanctions against Iran
because "they were bad for U.S. business."
</P>
<P>
Encouraging the move of the companies, Kharrazi said that all
the foreign oil firms have welcomed investment opportunities in
Iran and there is no impediment on the way of American firms in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
"Today's realities and failure of the U.S. extra-territorial
law in Europe, partnership of the European firms in the Iranian
projects and the pressure put on the U.S. administration by the
American companies prove that there is no room left for the
American sanctions on Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the French oil company Total signed a 2
billion-dollar deal with Iran to develop natural gas fields. The
U.S. announced in 1998 that it would waive sanctions after
European countries put strong pressures on Washington.
</P>
<P>
Gama, who arrived here on Friday, said at the press conference
that Portugal has no objection to the investment of the European
firms in Iran and the Portuguese companies are willing to carry
out investment projects in Iran.
</P>
<P>
A business delegation led by Portuguses Finance Minister Antonio
Franco is scheduled to visit Iran soon, Gama said.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine said here Sunday that security in the
Gulf region topped his talks with his Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Kuwait's security and the situation in Iraq
topped the agenda of the talks," Vedrine told a press conference
after meeting with Sheikh Sabah, who is also Kuwaiti first deputy
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"Talks tackled the security situation in the Gulf, and Kuwait
in particular," Vedrine added.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine also extended support to Kuwait on the issue of Kuwaiti
prisoners of war allegedly held in Iraqi jails since the 1991 Gulf
War triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi crisis, the French official said he discussed
with Sabah the French initiative regarding the crisis which was
presented to the United Nations last January.
</P>
<P>
France had proposed to establish a new mechanism to monitor
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and ease the sufferings of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
On possible Iraqi reaction to French proposals, Vedrine said
"we are not negotiating with Iraq. What we are trying to create is
a mechanism by the U.N. that suits the situation."
</P>
<P>
Vedrine arrived here earlier Sunday for a one-day visit as part
of his Gulf tour, which had already taken him to the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Gulf States Protest Against Maneuvers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Sunday rejected the Gulf states' protest against
Iran's war games in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Kharrazi said it is the right
of every country to carry out military exercise in its territorial
and international waters.
</P>
<P>
Iranian navy began nine-day exercises last week near Abu Musa
island, over which the United Arab Emirates (UAE) also claimed
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) held an
emergency meeting in Abu Dhabi, the UAE on Thursday, condemning
the maneuvers in the region as "provocative" and a threat to the
Gulf's stability.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, formed by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain,
Qatar and Oman, urged Tehran to stop military exercises and voiced
support for the UAE in its dispute with Iran over the sovereignty
of three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi expressed regret over the GCC statement, saying the
statement will not help solve the problems, but will only spoil
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the territorial dispute between Tehran and Abu
Dhabi, Kharrazi said the "misunderstanding" between Iran and the
UAE should be settled through direct and mutual talks.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the islands of Abu Musa, the Greater and Lesser
Tunbs in the Gulf in 1971. But both Tehran and Abu Dhabi claimed
sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, Iran called for bilateral talks over
the issue while the UAE demanded an international arbitration.

<HEADLINE> Russian Federal Representatives Withdraw from Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Sunday ordered its
government representatives to pull out of the breakaway republic
of Chechnya because of dangerous conditions, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The move came two days after a group of masked men kidnaped a
top Kremlin official, dragging him from an airplane as it was
about to leave the Chechen capital, Grozny, for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"Under the present conditions, the staff officials are unable
to perform their duties and are being recalled," a federal
security official said.
</P>
<P>
Despite an intensive search launched by both the federal and
Chechen security services, Gen. Gennady Shpigun, envoy of Russian
Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, remained missing.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials based in the northern Caucasus region Sunday
accused Chechen security forces of staging the abduction, an
accusation denied by the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
The kidnaping "had been thoroughly planned and carried out
with participation of Chechen secret services," Tass quoted an
unidentified Russian law enforcement officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Danilbek Tamkayev, an advisor to Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov, told Chechen television Saturday that he believed
that the kidnaping was carried out by the forces of renegade
warlord Salman Raduyev.
</P>
<P>
Raisa Zhafarova, a spokeswoman for Raduyev's forces, said
Sunday the accusation was groundless.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya,
Valentin Vlasov, who was also held as a hostage there for over six
months last year, said Moscow has given the Chechens a three-day
ultimatum to free Shpigun.
</P>
<P>
He said Shpigun must be released unconditionally before the
Monday deadline, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Vlasov said his attempts to contact Chechen President Maskhadov
by telephone over the last few days have been unsuccessful.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A week-long program of activities
has been worked out for the May 29 hand-over of power to a
civilian president in Nigeria, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the committee on the hand-over of power to a
civilian government is to organize "home return reception" for
Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar and Chief of General
Staff Vice Admiral Okhai Akhigbe.
</P>
<P>
NAN quoted a reliable source in capital Abuja as saying that
the reception which would be held in Minna, central Nigeria, for
Abubakar and Fugar for Akhigbe were expected to take place after
the hand-over ceremony on May 29.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to organize refitting home return receptions for
them with the service chiefs and other dignitaries escorting them
to their respective homes," the source said.
</P>
<P>
It further said the receptions would form part of the week-long
 activities lined up for the hand-over ceremonies scheduled to
begin on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Other activities include a farewell dinner for members of the
Provisional Ruling Council and the Federal Executive Council, and
a lecture on "consolidating national unity for political and
social development".
</P>
<P>
"Also a state banquet will be held on the eve of the hand-over
in honor of visiting heads of state and presidents, while the Head
of State will deliver a nationwide valedictory broadcast on the
same day," the source added.
</P>
<P>
A cultural display and fireworks will be held on the eve of the
hand- over, according to the source.

KUWAIT CITY, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Defense and Aviation
Minister Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz called on Iraq Sunday to
abide by United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the Iraqi people and hope to hear lasting
assurances" from the Iraqi regime, Prince Sultan said after
meeting with visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
On the U.S. strikes against military targets in the no-fly
zones in northern and southern Iraq, the Saudi official said the
strikes "are their business", stressing the Saudi policy is

</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes patrolling the no-fly zones have
carried out repeated strikes against Iraqi targets since last
December, when Washington and London launched four days of massive
air raids against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq vowed to challenge the zones established by U.S.-led
allies following the 1991 Gulf war to protect the Kurds and
Shiites in southern and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Both Baghdad and world powers have slammed the no-fly zones
which have not been authorized by the U.N. Security Council and
therefore are illegal.

<HEADLINE> 70 PC of S. African Voters Registered for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- At least 70 percent of South
Africa's 22.8 million potential voters were registered by the end
of the final round of voter registration on Sunday, the
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Electoral Officer Mandla Mchunu said 15.96 million people
had registered according to a count taken several hours before
registration points were due to close at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"We might even get closer to 80 percent because the commission
has not yet finished downloading the figures of people who
registered this weekend," he said in Pretoria Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mchunu said registration stations would remain open after 7
p.m. if there were still people waiting to register.
</P>
<P>
People who did not register this weekend would still be able to
do so at local electoral offices before the cut-off date for
registration.
</P>
<P>
The cut-off date is expected to be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
This weekend's registration drive followed two previous rounds
in November last year and at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
The revised figure of 22.8 million potential voters emerged
last week after discussions between the IEC, the Department of
Home Affairs and Statistics South Africa.
</P>
<P>
This is more than four million down on the 26.9 million which
the IEC began working with when registration started.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's election date was presumably June 2.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Joint Work for Peace in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Sunday said Iran and Pakistan should work together for the
establishment of peace and stability in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Speaker of
Pakistani National Assembly Elahi Bakhsh Soomro, just days before
the Afghan peace talks to be held in Turkmenistan's capital
Ashkhabad.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all regional countries to work for peace and
stability in Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban, who control about 90 percent of
Afghanistan, and the opposition have reached an agreement to hold
a new round of peace talks this week.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was seen as a reward for the shuttle visits of
the United Nation's special envoy on Afghan affairs Lakhdar
Brahimi in the region.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived here on Friday to discuss the situation in
Afghanistan with Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Pakistan, two important neighbors of Afghanistan, have
differences over the war-torn Afghanistan, as Islamabad supports
the Taliban and Tehran supports the ousted Afghan government of
president Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Khatami underlined that peace cannot be restored in Afghanistan
unless all the Afghans could have a say in the destiny of their
country.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly called for establishment of a broad-based
government in Afghanistan with the participation of all ethnic and
political groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker Nateq Nouri also
noted that the only way to end the conflict in Afghanistan is
through cooperation among all the warring groups.
</P>
<P>
"As we have stated before, just one of the groups is not
capable of governing, bringing about peace to and administering
the country," Nouri told his Pakistani counterpart.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Pakistan can help the people of
Afghanistan achieve understanding, peace and stability through
mutual cooperation and by adopting "a transparent and clear-cut
policy."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soomro also underlined the cooperation between Iran
and Pakistan to bring an end to the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Peace will not be established in Afghanistan without the
serious cooperation of Iran and Pakistan and all our efforts
should be directed to achieve this objective," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Curb Overloading on Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will launch a national
campaign to curb overloading on roads in a bid to reduce
accidents, Shahid Butt, an official with the Kenya Transport
Association said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Butt said his association had extended its monitoring of weigh
bridges to up-country check points as a preliminary action to the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Butt, who is in charge of inspection, added that the
association had established a good working relationship with many
stake-holders in the transport industry.
</P>
<P>
In the campaign his organization would cooperate with the
Ministry of Public Works and Housing and the police to eliminate
overloading soon, he added.
</P>
<P>
Trucks overloading while driving on the road from Mombasa to
Nairobi and further west destroyed the road and often caused
accidents resulting in casualties.
</P>
<P>
The official urged transporters and fleet owners to join the
operation, saying a meeting for stake-holders in the transport
industry will be soon convened in Nairobi to discuss how to make
the operation a success.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government issued a directive on axle load
limitation at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Treaties Signed in N.Ireland Add Impetus to Arms Push </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Pressure on the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) to start decommissioning its weapons and explosives has
been increased by the signing of four new treaties agreeing to
cross-border bodies.
</P>
<P>
The UK and Irish governments signed the treaties Monday
morning, but the new bodies cannot take up their powers until the
power-sharing executive is set up, according to local media
reports.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionists are currently refusing to serve in the
assembly executive alongside Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
IRA, until the IRA starts to get rid of its arms.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the treaties came as Sinn Fein President Gerry
Adams warned that the peace process will be in "crisis, big time"
if devolution is not triggered by the target date of 10 March.
</P>
<P>
Adams' remarks come ahead of a meeting later this week with
Northern Ireland First Minister and Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble where the two men will attempt to overcome the current
impasse.
</P>
<P>
All sides acknowledge that the target date in two days' time is
unlikely to be met.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the treaties were signed Adams said he was
"almost certain" that the executive would not be formed by 10
March.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the British government put up yet another
deadline and would appear to be moving off that deadline means we
are into crisis, big time," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The context and the seriousness of the situation should not be
under-estimated," he was quoted saying. "If we reduce this to a
game, the only ones who can win are the rejectionists and those
who don't want the agreement to work. "
</P>
<P>
"It's also about trying to force Sinn Fein out of the political
process. These people visualize the IRA being forced back to war,"
he said
</P>
<P>
But Adams said he would do "all in his power" to ensure there
was no return to violence.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam and Irish Foreign Minister
David Andrews signed the treaties agreeing to the cross-border
bodies at a ceremony in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam was quoted as saying, "The building blocks are now in
place and I believe that gives everybody the chance to walk down
that road of peace which is leading to a non-violent future which
has not been possible in the past."
</P>
<P>
Andrews said, "One piece of the jigsaw remains. We are all
aware that there remain great difficulties surrounding the
formation of the Northern Ireland executive. But these
difficulties can and must be surmounted."
</P>
<P>
Once the Northern Ireland executive is running, the treaties
will enable six cross-border bodies to be set up. They also allow
for the introduction of a North-South ministerial council, a
British-Irish council and a British-Irish inter-governmental
conference.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary legislation enabling the treaties to go ahead
will be introduced in the House of Commons Monday and in the Irish
Parliament later this week, according to earlier reports.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Withdraw Clears Way For South Africa's Bidding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's decision to withdraw
from the bidding race for the 2006 World Cup left more room for
South Africa to be the main African candidate for the
championships, a senior South African bid official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Danny Jordaan, South Africa's 2006 bid chief executive, said, "
I think the others (African candidate countries) will not pursue a
bid. Ghana told me that. Nigeria said they are not firm on their
position."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Egypt and Morocco are the other African bidding
countries for the tournament, with Germany and England the main
competitive countries from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Seeking for the first time to bring the world primary soccer
tournament to the continent, the African Football Conferdation (
CAF) has called upon for uniting the five candidates behind one
bidder as the best chance to win the bid.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan said he was confident that South Africa would be the
sole African bidder by April 30, the deadline for settling the
issue fixed by the CAF.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Xinhua Reports on NPC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The second session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) entered the fourth day today.
Highlights of Xinhua reports on the annual session are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jiang Zemin said that doing a good job of
reforming state-owned enterprises is extremely important for the
country's reform program, development and stability.
</P>
<P>
"Reform of state-owned enterprises, especially large and medium-
sized ones, is a major economic and political issue that has a
direct bearing on the fate of the socialist system as well as the
healthy operation and long-term development of the national
economy," he said at a group discussions attended by deputies from
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
State enterprise reform is the centerpiece of China's entire
economic reform program, he said, calling for making greater
efforts and taking effective measures to do a good job in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese top legislator Li Peng called for expanding
grassroots democracy and promoting democratic election in vast
rural areas when joining NPC deputies from Hebei.
</P>
<P>
"But the leading role of the Party branches in rural areas
should be highlighted and strengthened while developing extensive
democracy," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in urban areas should introduce and improve the
system of workers congress through which representatives of
workers can participate in and exercise supervision over the
management of enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All reform measures should be discussed by workers before
they are adopted so as to win workers' understanding and support,"
Li said, adding that "the Party's leadership and democratic
supervision should be strengthened as enterprise reform is carried
out."
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji urged the country's central and
western regions to seize opportunities and tap potentials in order
to speed up their economic development and catch up with the
better-developed eastern coastal regions at a group discussion
with NPC deputies from Xinjiang and Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
While affirming the achievements Xinjiang and Qinghai scored
last year, the premier said that in recent years, the central
authorities have granted preferential policies to the central and
western regions in finance and in approving the construction of
infrastructure projects, which are designed to promote the
economic development there.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the premier stressed that the economic prosperity
for the central and western regions depends fundamentally on the
hard work and painstaking efforts of the local people.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that these regions seize the current opportunities
brought by the central government's decision to boost domestic
demand by expanding infrastructure construction, and concentrate
on developing a number of good quality and highly efficient
infrastructure projects.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Creation of French Digital Pay-TV Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Monday that it has approved the creation of a digital platform
Television Par Satellite (TPS) that is intended for the French pay-
TV market in an effort to compete against the current main players,
Canal+, and CanalSatellite, and AB-Sat.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the European Union's executive body, noted the
primarily pro-competitive effects of having this new operation,
which was created by several French broadcasters and
telecommunications operators.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the TPS, the new company to operate a digital pay-TV
platform by satellite, will hold certain exclusive rights during
its three-year launch phase.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner responsible for competition, Karel van
Miert, said in a statement that the emergence of this new
broadcaster on the French market shows that competition in digital
pay-TV is possible.
</P>
<P>
Also, it is quite favorable to consumers, who will benefit from
a wider choice and more advantageous conditions to subscribe.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Canal+ and CanalSatellite have 4.3 million and one
million subscribers respectively and are the two leading operators
on the French pay-TV market.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Pessimistic View on China's Environment Groundless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government advisors said
here today that overseas pessimistic views about China's
environment are groundless.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference National Committee (CPPCC) are here attending the
current CPPCC National Committee session.
</P>
<P>
Hou Jie, a CPPCC member and Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Human Resources and Environment of the CPPCC National Committee,
said at a news conference that overseas reports said that China's
environment will further deteriorate until the year 2030 and "this
is not correct."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government is very much determined to
control the environment and it will not take such a long time to
improve the environment.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jirong, deputy director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration, said that by the end of next year, the
deterioration of the environment pollution will be curbed, with
the general amount of pollutant discharge staying at about the
level of 1995, and by then, the ecological environment will be
obviously improved.
</P>
<P>
In the next century, a large number of "cozy" cities will have
a well-coordinated social, economic and environmental development,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Environment protection is a basic state policy of China, she
said, adding that beginning from the 1970s, China has paid great
attention to the protection of environment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's investment in environment protection was 80
billion yuan, which was more than one percent of the gross
domestic product for the first time, she said, adding that the
policy of expanding domestic demand will result in more investment
in this regard. .

WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- When U.S. Texas Governor George W. Bush announced the

<P>
-- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan Sunday issued the

miniaturize its nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Defense Minister William Cohen Sunday offered Saudi
Arabia new weapons and military training to help shore up its
defenses against any threat from Iraq which accused the United
States of using "pressure and blackmail" in the region.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has begun a major
revision of its guidelines for approving new antibiotics for
animals and for monitoring the effects of old ones, faced with

may diminish the drugs' power to cure infections in people.

The Wall Street Journal:

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's High Court Starts Hearing on Hartal Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The High Court Division of the
Bangladesh Supreme Court Monday began hearing on a rule for the
ruling and opposition parties and the government regarding
activities in favor of and against hartals (strikes).
</P>
<P>
The division bench heard the submissions of Attorney General
Mahmudul Islam representing the government, and Barrister Moudud
Ahmed on behalf of Bangladesh Nationalist Party Secretary General
Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan.
</P>
<P>
The High Court issued the rule last month, asking the ruling
and opposition parties and the government to "show the cause why
pro- and anti-hartal activities shall not be declared cognizable
offense."
</P>
<P>
It was for the first time in the history of the country that a
Suo Moto rule has been issued by the highest court on the hartal
issue. Suo Moto, a legal term, means "acting on its own."
</P>
<P>
The attorney general said that every citizen of Bangladesh
enjoys the freedom of expression as guaranteed under Article 39 of
the Constitution but this fundamental right is limited to
reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest and
security of the state and the members of the public.
</P>
<P>
The enforcement of hartals using force or threat is a criminal
act punishable under the law, as it infringes upon the fundamental
rights of the citizens guaranteed under the constitution, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the High Court division has no jurisdiction to
issue a rule on this issue as no such proceedings are pending
before the High Court, and that the government has a legal and
constitutional obligation to maintain law and order in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with the attorney general on the point of the High
Court's jurisdiction on the issue, Barrister Maudud Ahmed said
that hartal is a democratic right. "It is still the most peaceful
instrument of protest when the people abstain themselves from
their routine work to demonstrate their disapproval of certain
actions or failure of the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed said that hartals become violent not because of those who
call them. Violence during a hartal is triggered by the
authorities' anti-hartal activities to resist the hartal, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The hearing was adjourned for two weeks to resume on March 22.
</P>
<P>
Hartal is a special political phenomenon in this South Asian
country, where opposition parties frequently call hartals to
oppose the ruling party while the latter adopts anti-hartal
activities, resulting in clashes and bringing almost all economic
activities across the country to a standstill during the shutdown.

<HEADLINE> WTO Summons Full Membership to Discuss US-EU Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
summoned its 134 member states to the meeting of the General
Council, its decision-making body, Monday to discuss the
escalating banana dispute between Washington and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called at the European Union's request last
Thursday when the United States ordered importers to post deposits
against selected EU goods in anticipation of the possible
imposition of 100 percent duties.
</P>
<P>
WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero, however, said that no one
should expect any decisions from the meeting. Other reports claim
many trade diplomats have complained that the dispute is
preventing the WTO from doing anything else.
</P>
<P>
The world is "mesmerized" by the dispute even though EU-US
trade amounts to only 5 percent of the global market, Canadian
Ambassador John Weekes was reported as saying. The WTO should be
focusing on the other 95 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States is accusing the European Union of failing to
carry out WTO rulings against its selective banana import policy,
which the United States claims infringes on U.S.-owned producers
with huge plantations in Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, however, claims to have broad support
against U.S. actions. "There is a very wide feeling that they have
done the wrong thing," said Roderick Abbott, head of the EU trade
delegation in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Abbott added that the U.S. requirement means that Washington is
in effect implementing the sanctions without first having WTO
approval.
</P>
<P>
In a statement last Thursday, the WTO chief Ruggiero urged the
U.S. and the EU to show "a positive spirit" in resolving their
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero believed that the WTO's own dispute settlement system
"can provide a legal answer to all the legal issues involved in
this dispute."
</P>
<P>
Before Monday's meeting, U.S. Ambassador Rita Hayes stressed
that it was up to the 15-nation trading bloc to bring an end to
the banana dispute.

MOSCOW, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia plans to equip its older
strategic bombers with radar-evasive precision cruise missiles,
while testing an air defense system with the ability to hit
ballistic missiles at altitudes from three meters to the
stratosphere, the Interfax news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Air Force is striving to modernize its Tupolev Tu-

missiles that can carry both nuclear and conventional warheads and
not be detected by radar, Interfax said, quoting experts with the
air force general staff.
</P>
<P>
Such missiles have a range between 3,000 and 5,000 kilometers
and can penetrate present-day and future air defenses "with
minimal losses," the experts said.
</P>
<P>
They also said the missile air defense system currently being
tested will remain effective for 50 years.

</P>
<P>
Chairwoman of the Shandong Provincial Women's Federation Zao

KATHMANDU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Shailaja Acharya, central member
of the ruling Nepali Congress and former deputy prime minister and
minister for water resources, Monday reversed her earlier decision
to withdraw from the May election to the House of Representatives,
Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, she said that as a disciplined cadre of the
party, she decided to contest the election at the request of party
President and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
</P>
<P>
On February 27, Shailaja was nominated by her party to contest
the election as the candidate of No. 7 constituency of Morang
district, eastern Nepal.

her candidacy as decided by the parliamentary committee of the
party and involve herself actively in the election fray to make
the party victorious with a majority.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Renews Call for Punishing Killers of Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi here
Monday urged for identification and punishment of those
responsible for the murders of Iranian diplomats and a reporter in
Afghanistan last year.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi renewed this call in a meeting with visiting United
Nations special envoy on Afghan affairs Lakhdar Brahimi.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolutions explicitly call for the identification and
punishment of those responsible for massacre of diplomats and
journalist, Kharrazi said, quoted by the official Islamic Republic
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces killed eight Iranian diplomats and a
reporter in Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan after they took
control of the opposition alliance' stronghold last August,
heightening tension with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Tehran massed more than 200,000 troops along its border with
Afghanistan and staged exercises to press the Taliban to return
the bodies of the killed and the other Iranians still in captivity.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban promised to identify and punish the killers, but
there seemed no action in this regard so far.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that cessation of hostilities, formation of a
broad-based government and implementation of international
resolutions are essential to the restoration of calm in the
war-torn Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Brahimi briefed Kharrazi of the outcome of his
talks with Pakistani officials and Afghan warring factions in the
course of his recent visits to Pakistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi arrived here on Friday to seek supports from regional
countries to put an end to the domestic war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
As the result of Brahimi's shuttle visits, the Taliban and the
opposition Northern Alliance agreed to hold a new round of peace
talks in Ashkhabad, Turkmenistan this week.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Sets Up Team to Work For E. Timor Autonomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
has set up a team that will further improve the wide-ranging
autonomy proposed for East Timor, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Since October last year, the minister said, ranking government
officials have been conducting technical negotiations with
Portugal, under the auspices of the United Nations secretary
general, to give substance to the proposal of special autonomous
status for East Timor in an effort to find a lasting solution to
the long-standing issue.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these negotiations, he said, the officials on
political and security affairs have also been discussing the
proposal for East Timor's autonomy on their own.
</P>
<P>
"It turned out that there are problems which have not been
(addressed) in the draft of the proposal. For this reason, the
president and all members of the cabinet deem it necessary to make
more revisions in the draft," said Alatas who is set to leave for
New York Monday night for more meetings with Portuguese and U.N.
officials.
</P>
<P>
He said he is optimistic that the final draft of the proposal
for autonomy will be completed by April.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the concept of the autonomy proposal is complicated
as it covers the constitution, the law, relationship with foreign
countries, defense and security, finance, and the customs office.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, Alatas announced that Indonesia is ready to
release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider autonomy is
refused by people in the region and the international community.
</P>
<P>
However, he reminded that the release of East Timor is only the
second option, and that the offer of granting wide-ranging
autonomy status is still the primary option that the government
concentrates on.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was a Portuguese colony before 1975. Indonesia
announced the integration of East Timor into the country in 1976
and declared it as its 27th province, but the United Nations has
never recognized the move.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Official Says TMD Excludes Defense of Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A proposed Theater Missile Defense (
TMD) umbrella that is being studied jointly by Japan and the U.S.,
is purely defensive and not meant to defend Taiwan, said Japan's
Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Nonaka claimed the TMD system
is "a defensive system and will not pose a military threat to
other countries."
</P>
<P>
Nonaka's remarks came after Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan warned Sunday against the inclusion of Taiwan under the
TMD system.
</P>
<P>
The TMD system is intended to protect the U.S. and its allies
within a 3,000-kilometer radius from incoming ballistic missiles
by detecting them with satellites and shooting them down with
missiles or other means.
</P>
<P>
"If some people intend to include Taiwan under the theater
missile defense, that would amount to an encroachment on China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity and also be an obstruction
to the great cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland,"
Tang told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The research and development of the TMD system does not go with
the trend of the times, nor is it conducive to international
disarmament efforts, Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
Japan decided last December to commence joint research with the
U.S. on the system commencing in April.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator on Developing Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Li Peng
today called for expanding grass-roots democracy and promoting
democratic election in vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, China's highest lawmaking body, made the remark when
joining NPC deputies from Hebei Province in north China in
examining the government work report delivered by Premier Zhu
Rongji last Friday at the opening session of the current NPC
session.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental way of developing democracy in rural areas is
letting farmers elect good village committees through secret
ballot, which is now guaranteed by an organic law on the villagers'
committee which was adopted last year, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"But the leading role of the Party branches in rural areas
should be highlighted and strengthened while developing extensive
democracy," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Village committees should be farmers' autonomous
organizations which should work on the issues of concern to
farmers such as making public the management of financial affairs,
birth control policies, land allocated for housing so as to put
themselves under the supervision of farmers, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in urban areas should introduce and improve the
system of workers congress through which representatives of
workers can participate in and exercise supervision over the
management of enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
"All reform measures should be discussed by workers before they
are adopted so as to win workers' understanding and support," Li
said, adding that "the Party's leadership and democratic
supervision should be strengthened as enterprise reform is carried
out."
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood committees in the cities should have a bigger role
to play in community management and developing community services
to create a good work and living environment for residents.
</P>
<P>
The chairman asked Hebei Province to step up efforts to tap its
potential in agricultural production and grain processing, to
harness the Haihe River, the major river running through the
province, and renovate outdated water conservation projects.
</P>
<P>
On state-owned enterprise reform, Li said, focuses should be on
improving managerial mechanism, updating technology and, most
important of all, having a good management, and forming a good
leadership.
</P>
<P>
"Reforms will inevitably cost us something but it is the only
way out," said Li.

<HEADLINE> International Women's Day Marked In India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- International Women's Day was
marked here on Monday with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
favoring special facilities and reservation for women in various
activities.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee admitted at a function today that provision for equal
treatment has not been able to empower women in a society plagued
by discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional provision for equality was yet to be fully
translated into practice as the required social changes to elevate
the status of women failed to take place at an accelerated pace,
said the Indian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Indian women often become victims of discrimination despite
their contributions to the society and efficient functioning in
various spheres including agriculture, industries and offices.
</P>
<P>
Though Indian women in certain areas are often described as
embodiment of laximi, saraswati and shakti (goddesses of wealth,
learning and power), many of them have been deprived of education
and proper property rights and continue to be neglected.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee also presented awards to an non-governmental
organization for its contribution towards women's empowerment and
to winners of anti-dowry competition organized by the National
Commission for women among school children in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Upper House of Indian Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, passed a
10-point resolution Monday demanding adequate representation of
women in both houses of parliament and their greater involvement
at all decision-making levels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Shiela Dikshit announced Monday
that Delhi government would soon set up a women's development
finance corporation for extending financial support to women
seeking self-employment.

second session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
Gan Yuping, vice mayor of Chongqing and an NPC deputy, said
that the municipality will relocate a total of 1.07 million people
from the project area, 85 percent of the total number of people to
be resettled thanks to the construction of the project.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has already relocated 120,000 people and is going to
relocate an additional 400,000 people in five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most relocation will occur in the Wanzhou area of the centrally-
administered municipality. Before 2003, a total of 300,000 people
there will be relocated with about 8.4 billion yuan to be spent
for the purpose, according to Zhang Yuanzhu, head of the Wanzhou
District and another NPC deputy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last November, five new towns, 33 villages and
more than 2,500 hectares of land had been developed in the area,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Says Indian Wargames to Undermine Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Monday that the
recent military exercises by the Indian Air Force near the
Pakistani border will "vitiate the atmosphere and undermine the
efforts" being made for establishing peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz made the remarks while
commenting on the Indian Air Force's largest ever exercises on
Sunday in Pokhran in the state of Rajastan, 200 kilometers off
from Pakistan's border.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Air Force wargames would affect the endeavors being
made for peace in South Asia on the basis of the resolution on
disputes between Pakistan and India, said Foreign Office sources.
</P>
<P>
Around 100 Indian jets and bombers, including Russian-supplied
Mig-29s and Sukhoi-30s as well as French-made Mirage-2000s, took

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Cross-Straits Cooperation, Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen
today called for intensified efforts to promote cooperation and
exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, so as to
pave the way for early cross-Straits political negotiations and
the ultimate realization of China's reunification under the "one
China" principle.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has returned and Macao will also return to the
embrace of its motherland at the end of this year. The resolution
of the Taiwan problem can't be delayed indefinitely," Qian, also a
Political Bureau member of the Communist Party of China Central
Committee, told Taiwan deputies to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) during a panel discussion this morning.
</P>
<P>
The NPC, China's legislature, is convening its second session
in Beijing starting last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the
publication of "A Letter to Taiwan Compatriots by the NPC Standing
Committee" and the fourth anniversary of the release of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's Eight-Point Proposal on the resolution of
the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
"Great changes have taken place in cross-Straits relations over
the past two decades," he said. "In 1979 the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits basically had no contacts with each other, but now
the cumulative trade volume across the Straits has reached 136.9
billion US dollars."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, a total of more than 13 million Taiwan
compatriots have visited the mainland, while the number of
mainlanders having paid visits to Taiwan also totals 240,000.
</P>
<P>
Even during the Asian financial crisis, cross-Straits trade and
personnel exchanges have maintained the momentum of a steady
growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
"At present, the biggest obstruction between the two sides
across the Straits is political obstruction," said the vice
premier. "If we can remove political differences between the two
sides through political negotiations, cross-Straits relations will
surely achieve greater progress."
</P>
<P>
Qian went on to say that it is the common aspiration and eager
demand of the entire Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots,
to realize China's peaceful reunification according to the
principle of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
"Under the 'one China' principle, the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits can discuss any issues, including political issues," he
said. "Both sides should develop mutual respect and make no
attempt to change each other's social system and way of life."
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also pledged that the mainland side would
provide fine and friendly treatment for all Taiwan compatriots
coming for investment, trade, travel and study, and take effective
measures to protect their legitimate rights and interests.

<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed "surprise"
at the recent remarks made by Hosei Norota, director-general of
the Japanese Defense Agency, who said that Japan might take
preemptive measures against the military bases of any enemy
country intending to attack Japan with missiles, Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are quite surprised at the comments of Hosei Norota, which
obviously runs counter to the current trend of maintaining peace
and stability", Zhu said when asked to comment on Hosei Norota's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
Such remarks would only lead to new confrontations and tensions
in the region and be quite disturbing for Japan's neighbors, he
added.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that Japan will abide by its defense policy,
implement earnestly its commitment of not seeking to be a military
power and engage itself more in the affairs that serve peace and
stability in the region, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Old Oilfield Has Huge Potential to Tap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Backed up by its competitive
expertise, Daqing oilfield, the country's largest and also the
oldest oil production base in northeast China's province of
Heilongjiang, may pump out at least 1.7 billion tons of crude in
the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The figure is larger than the combined output of crude the
oilfield has produced since it began production in 1960, said
Zhang Shuping, secretary of the Party Committee of Daqing
Petroleum Administration Bureau, who is here attending the current
session of the National People's Congress (NPC) that opened last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Daqing boasts a proven crude reserve of 5.4 billion tons, said
Zhang. "With our cutting-edge oil recovery technology, it's
hopeful that Daqing can keep its annual output of 50 million tons
till the year 2010," he added.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 was a tough year for Daqing which incurred a loss
of several billion yuan due to weakened demand triggered by the
Asian financial crisis, rampant oil smuggling and, most of all,
the devastating summer flooding in decades.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 1,504 oil wells were inundated, with 569 more
suspending production, which reduced the daily oil output by 1,563
tons, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
But the oilfield quickly emerged from difficulties and achieved
its projected annual output target of 55.7 million tons and
generated 8.6 billion yuan of profits, he added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Improve Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal government
is working hard to stop a further deterioration of air quality in
the Chinese capital and expects to gradually improve it, according
to Wang Jirong, a deputy director of the State Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remarks at a news conference sponsored by the
ongoing session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Of the 45 weekly reports on Beijing's air quality released last
year, only eight record Grade II, or "fairly clean," air quality.
"Beijing is threatened by possible occurrences of photochemical
fog," she said.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that 18 measures have been taken to deal with the
problem.
</P>
<P>
She said that Beijing will do four things in the future to let
its residents inhale clean air again: first, to restructure local
industries; second, to improve the fuel mix with preference to be
given to natural gas; and third, to impose far stricter emission
standards on cars; and fourth, to raise the environmental
awareness of local residents.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Drug Control Body Urges Sri Lanka to Amend Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The International Narcotics
Control Board (INCB) has urged the Sri Lankan government to update
existing legislation in order to control the illicit drug menace
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The INCB said in its annual report for 1998 that it wanted Sri
Lanka to proceed with the consideration of draft amendments in
line with the provisions of the 1998 convention.
</P>
<P>
The INCB, which collaborates with the United Nations
International Drug Control Program (UNDCP), said that the board
has made the same request to the government of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The INCB report, in its chapter for South Asia, said cannabis
eradication campaigns are conducted regularly in India, Nepal and
Sri Lanka, but illicit cultivation of the plant has continued.
</P>
<P>
Most of the harvested cannabis is destined for use within the
region, though a relatively small amount is smuggled into outside
countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The abuse of heroin by injection has spread in the region, with
the exception of Sri Lanka where inhaling the vapors of heated
heroin is the predominant method.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, a significant amount of the heroin that is abused
is brought from India in boats by traffickers operating between
southern India and the western coast of Sri Lanka, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the diversion of acetic anhydride has been prevented
in Sri Lanka, which may be an indication that the island has been
targeted by traffickers as a transit country to be used to ship
acetic anhydride to heroin-manufacturing countries nearby.
</P>
<P>
Also, Sri Lanka has reported the small-scale abuse of two
medicinal products of diazepam and flunitrazepam.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Sunday night called on member states of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to make efforts to shore up
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
All OPEC members should pay more attention to the risks of the
oil price slump, Khatami said in a phone call to Saudi Crown
Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC members should use their oil resources for further
development of their countries, said the Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh and his Saudi
counterpart Ali Bin Ibrahim al-Naimi agreed in Riyadh on Sunday
that the oil production surplus must be eliminated in a bid to
shore up the sluggish prices which have plummeted to 10
U.S. dollars a barrel, the lowest level in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also agreed to conduct further discussions
between themselves, and among OPEC and non-OPEC members, to take a
unified and positive stance in the upcoming OPEC meeting to be
held in Vienna on March 23.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this month, Iran has intensified its
diplomatic efforts to save the sagging oil prices by sending
high-ranking officials to convince OPEC members to join hands in
the OPEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi visited Saudi Arabia
last week and he is expected to go to Venezuela to discuss oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Oil Minister Zanganeh will also meet his
Iraqi counterpart Amir Mohammed Rashid before the OPEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC is hampered by bickerings over compliance with oil
output cuts agreed last year to rescue prices.

LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's People's Democratic Party
(PDP) has offered the senate presidency to former vice-president
Alex Ekwueme in a bid to ensure equitable distribution of offices
to various regions in the country, media reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
At last week's expanded meeting of the National Executive
Committee of the PDP, which has the majority in both the senate
and house of representatives, the party elders were said to have
prevailed on Ekwueme to accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
The elders were quoted as saying that Ekwueme, who is from
southeast of the country and one of PDP presidential aspirants,
would be able to bring his wealth of experience to bear not only
in the senate, but also in the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
The position of the speaker of the House of Representatives may
have been given to the northwest geopolitical zone in the
in-coming government since the president-elect comes from the
southwest and his deputy from the northeast.
</P>
<P>
The PDP agreed that the north-central would produce deputy
president of senate.
</P>
<P>
Confirming this, a PDP senator-elect from Bauchi North
Senatorial District, Alhaji Muhammed Bashir Mustapha, said this
arrangement was put in place by the party so that all zones in the
country would be represented in the government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the party's decision was aimed at wiping away the
too much publicized issue of marginalization in the west African
country, which he said has affected the human relationship of
virtually all Nigerians from different zones.

ASMARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The National Union of the Eritrean
Women said, in a statement here Monday, that the Eritrean women
have have been striving to create a bright future for themselves
and their children.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean women inside the country and abroad are under the
banner of "my country, my jewel" , "fighting Ethiopia's
aggression," according to a statement issued by the the National
Union of the Eritrean Women at a rally marking the March 8
International Women's Day in capital Asmara.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Eritrean women residing inside the
country and abroad have donated their valuables in support of the
nation's defense in the conviction that nothing is more dearer
than national freedom and independence.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that all the efforts that the Eritrean women
have been carrying out for a sovereign and independent nation, for
social change and development, and for equality and equal
participation would be meaningless without a country.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean women are fighting alongside with their brothers
to repulse the "aggression by the Tigray People's Liberation Front
government in Ethiopia", it said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopia's move "has angered and embittered the generous
Eritrean mother," the organization said, adding that the Eritrean
women have demonstrated strong sense of nationalism, love and
dedication even at the cost of self-sacrifice for their country.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 people including Secretary of the Ruling People's
Front for Democracy and Justice, Aalamin Mi Said, and President of
the National Union of the Eritrean Women, Luul Ghebreab, attended
the event.
</P>
<P>
War broke out between the two Horn of Africa neighbors last May
and after a comparative peace of some seven months, the war
renewed on February 6 this year.

The Eritreans have accepted the framework agreement put forward
by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), but there is still no

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Marks International Women's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- "My hope for International Women's
Day is that women of this country may become more aware of their
rights and become more self-sufficient," said State Minister of
Women and Children Affairs Zinatun Nesa Talukdar.
</P>
<P>
Talukdar was speaking at a discussion meeting here on Monday,
part of the many programs such as seminars, rallies and photo
exhibitions organized by different socio-cultural organizations,
to observe this year's International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
At the Children's Academy in the capital city, photos of an
exhibition showed survivors of acid attacks, including a 12-year
married girl being treated at Dhaka Medical College, a mother with
burnt face beside her new-born baby, and six young women preparing
to go to Spain for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The images reinforced this year's theme of the Day, "National
Commitment to Eradicate Violence Against Women," which was
observed throughout the country with a renewed call to eliminate
gender inequality.
</P>
<P>
Very stringent laws and clear policies existed for safeguarding
women, but more needed to be done to address discrimination and
practices resulting in what has been described as the "apartheid
of gender", according to Ms. Shahida Azfar, the representative of
the United Nations Children's Fund in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the Day, President Shahabuddin Ahmed called
upon all concerned to play effective roles for women's development
and their socio-economic emancipation under a national program.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in her message called for greater
coordination between government and non-government initiatives for
rapid expansion of women's education in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The This Day newspaper Monday quoted the Chief Press Secretary

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Meanders in Thinned Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar meandered
aimlessly Monday, almost steady in trade thinned by the public
holiday in Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The local currency oscillated in a tight range on the day to
close at 62.75 U.S. cents, from 62.74 late Friday.
</P>
<P>
There was little in the way of directional cues for the
Australian dollar, especially on the local front.
</P>
<P>
Domestic data due for release this week is unlikely to grab the
attention of the market and developments in the United States
would probably provide the biggest cues for the direction on the
week.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (RBA) will release January
housing finance figures on Wednesday and February employment
figures on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Ian
Macfarlane will give his first speech of this year in Tokyo on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Macfarlane will be keenly listened to for any new information
on the RBA's stance on monetary policy or its view on the economy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will also speak
this week at a Mortgage Bankers Association of America conference.
</P>
<P>
RBC DS Global Markets senior economist Su-Lin Ong said she
expects the currency to trade in a 60-65 U.S. cents range in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
"Continued uncertainty over global growth, commodity prices
remaining soft, a widening current account deficit and signs of a
moderating domestic economy will cap any significant and sustained
up side," Ong said.
</P>
<P>
At the close the Australian dollar was buying 0.5792 euro from
0.5795 and the euro was trading at 1.0835 U.S. dollars from
1.0824.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar was buying 76.51 Japanese yen,
from 76.89 previously.

ABU DHABI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- President of the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed Al-Nahyan Monday met with visiting
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen at the Wasbet Palace here.
</P>
<P>
They exchanged views on bilateral ties and on the current
situation in the Gulf, particularly the Iraqi issue, the official
news agency WAM said, without giving details.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived here in the morning from Muscat, capital of
Oman, is on a nine-leg Middle East tour aimed at explaining
U.S. policy on Iraq and seeking support from Gulf states, media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
In Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia, he stressed Sunday that the
air strikes against Iraq "must continue as long as Baghdad defies
the no-fly zones."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"The best way to deal with Iraq is for Iraq to comply with the
U.N. resolutions, and we think the air strikes are appropriate
considering the threats to our forces," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, visiting French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine
said here that the U.S.-British air raids were serving no purpose
and called for a political solution to lifting the U.N. sanctions
on Iraq imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Turns Around SOE: NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has improved assets-
liabilities ratio of local state-owned enterprises to
international standards, a deputy to the ongoing session of the
National People's Congress (NPC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qifan, deputy secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal
People's Government, said that the city has lowered the
enterprises' assets-liabilities ratio from 84 percent in 1994 to
54 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
"This can be translated into 160 billion yuan of capital
increment or an equal amount of debt decrement," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Shanghai has laid off 40 percent of workers in
state-owned enterprises in the past five years, reducing the total
number of industrial workers from 1.35 million to 850,000.
</P>
<P>
He said that 98 percent of workers in local enterprises are
covered by pension and unemployment insurance service and that 98
percent of local enterprises have bought medicare insurance policy
for employees.
</P>
<P>
Huang, also director of Shanghai Municipal Economic and Trade
Commission, said that 24 percent of local state-owned enterprises
are operating in the red, down from 34 percent five years ago. At
the same time, sales of their products increased by 80 percent
more than that five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has also been restructuring local industries by
increasing the proportion of hi-tech enterprises in 60 percent of
all local enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai has basically solved the problems taxing state-owned
enterprises, such as high assets-liabilities ratio, large number
of redundant workers and heavy burdens of social services," he
said.

<HEADLINE> JETCO Becomes 1st HK Internet Certification Authority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Internet banking in Hong Kong
has reached another milestone as the local banking consortium
Joint Electronic Teller Services Ltd. (JETCO) became the first
Internet certification authority in the Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Following the completion of a major system integration project
led by global computing and Internet provider Hewlett-Packard (HP),
JETCO will be able to provide its member banks with digital
certificates for web-based transactions, thus giving customers
complete assurance that their home banking transactions are secure,
according to HP Hong Kong today.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, JETCO will offer member banks a "virtual ATM"
service that duplicates the look-and-feel of the banks' physical
ATMs on their customers' PCs, enabling them to offer a customized
home banking service without large-scale investment in new
hardware or software.
</P>
<P>
JETCO Chairman Chung Che-shum described this as "another major
milestone" in Hong Kong's history as a world-renowned financial
center.
</P>
<P>
"By becoming a certification authority, we are able to help
virtually all of the SAR's retail banks to enter the on-line age
in one fell swoop," Chung said.
</P>
<P>
Established in July 1982, JETCO began operations in August 1983.
It now has 49 member banks and operates more than 1,500 ATMs in
Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> China's Reunification Inevitable, CPPCC Vice Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- It is an inevitable and great
historic trend for China to realize complete reunification under
the principles of "peaceful reunification" and "one country, two
systems", though the solution of the Taiwan question still faces
considerable difficulties.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by Zhang Kehui, a vice chairman of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National
Committee and chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government
League.
</P>
<P>
Zhang spoke highly of the fact that Premier Zhu Rongji in his
government work report calls for "broadly uniting Taiwanese
compatriots, listening to their views and supporting their
rational ideas that are favorable to the reunification of the
motherland".
</P>
<P>
Zhu's report is full of warm feelings and trust for the people
of Taiwan and at the same time places great hopes on them, Zhang
said, noting that CPPCC National Committee members of Taiwanese
origin support the government's policies and principles for the
solution of the Taiwan question through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The people of the Chinese mainland and the people of Taiwan are
of the same origin and the cohesive force of the Chinese nation is
an important base for the reunification of the motherland, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and Taiwan have
grown from naught over the past two decades, leading to closer
ties between the people of the mainland and the people of Taiwan.
And Taiwan has benefited greatly from its economic ties with the
mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
have eased, he said, referring to last October's mainland visit by
Koo Chen-fu, head of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation,
Koo's meeting with President Jiang Zemin, and the planned visit to
Taiwan later this year by Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-
based Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued, factors hindering the development of
cross-Strait relations should not be neglected, including the
Taiwan authorities' activities in the international arena aimed at
creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The eight-point proposal put forward by Jiang Zemin four years
ago on a peaceful solution for the Taiwan question should be the
guiding thinking for talks between the two sides, he said,
stressing that the cross-Strait issue is a political one.
</P>
<P>
He said that, as a Taiwanese living on the mainland, he will
continue to work hard for the reunification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Look into New Marcos Account Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will look
into the reported existence of a 13.2-billion-U.S. dollar account
registered in the name of Irene Marcos Araneta, the youngest
daughter of the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora Monday told reporters that
Magdangal Elma, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government (PCGG), is now verifying whether the report is "worth
pursuing."
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that while the amount involved may be "fantastic,"
there is an existing guideline from President Joseph Estrada for
government officials concerned to pursue any lead on the Marcos
wealth.
</P>
<P>
"Basically he has told us even before, if there's any lead,
then try and pursue that lead," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Australian investigator Reiner Jacobi, who was hired
by the PCGG in 1988 to help recover secret Marcos deposits in
Switzerland, claimed that Mrs. Araneta is keeping a secret account
worth 13.2 billion U.S. dollars in one of the biggest banks in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Jacobi also accused the PCGG of obstructing efforts to recover
the amount.
</P>
<P>
But Zamora said that while then PCGG chairman Magtanggol
Gunigundo discussed the matter two or three years ago, "it was
only lately" that Chairman Magdangal Elma learned about the
account.
</P>
<P>
"He (Elma) is now trying to verify whether in fact these
fantastic amounts are worth pursuing because it looks like they
are much too large," he said.
</P>
<P>
Elma, in a press statement, vehemently denied that he is
blocking efforts of Jacobi to recover the alleged account, saying
that the PCGG requested that formal representation be made to
verify the existence of the account.

<HEADLINE> China Pins High Hope on Export Restructuring (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Exports are expected to play a
greater role in China's economic growth once a quality-oriented
restructuring is completed, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
During the restructuring, which is already under way, China's
exports will experience a shift from high to moderate growth as
well as a shift from quantitative expansion to qualitative
improvement, according to trade experts participating in the 7-day
East China Fair, which opened on March 5.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring will bring China's export sector, hit hard by
the impact of the Asian financial crisis last year, into a new
period of improvement in overall competitiveness, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
As a result, exports will be reflected by not only contributing
several percentage points to economic growth but also by their
importance to the overall economy, employment, balance of
international payments, and coordination of domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
Xu Bingjin, Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, says that the restructuring, partly a forced result
of the Asian financial crisis, has provided China with an
opportunity to improve its export mix.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China's exports edged up 0.5
percent last year, as against 20.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The sudden plunge in export growth is a direct result of the
spread and deterioration of the Asian financial crisis, and it has
its roots in China's unacceptable export mix, both trade officials
and exports say.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid export growth in past years relied on a great
extent on quantitative expansion, with the majority of exports
being labor or resources-intensive goods, they say.

Hosted by the Information Office of the State Council and the
Tibet regional government, the 9-day exhibition will highlight the
region's achievements, display generations of historical archives
and gifts given to the central government by successive holders of
the position of Dalai Lama and Bainqen Lama.
</P>
<P>
The major event will also feature Tibetan artists' paintings,
Tibetan cultural and religious items, and Tibetan clothing and
decorative art.
</P>
<P>
A giant Buddha woven on a 45-meter-high, 35-meter-wide satin
cloth, which took more than one year's hard work, will also be
shown during the exhibition, representing the world's largest
Thangka, which is a Tibetan drawing of religious themes displayed
on different materials.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign friends have formed misunderstandings about Tibet
due to the separatist activities of the Dalai clique and some
biased reports in the Western press, said Zhao Qizheng, director
of the Information Office of the State Council who hosted today's
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Today's Tibet is actually prospering with economic and social
advancement, and Tibetan traditional culture has been well
preserved, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will continue on an overseas tour in order to
let the world know more about Tibet and appreciate Tibetan culture
as a precious legacy of the world cultural heritage, Zhao added.

<HEADLINE> China Pins High Hope on Export Restructuring (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The exports of general quality products may easily be affected
by a turbulent international market, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
Xu says that while making efforts to increase exports of
traditional products, China will give priority support to the
development and export of products with a high value-added and
high level of technical content, such as complete sets of
machinery and electronics.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China will increase imports of equipment and
technology needed to upgrade domestic industries, he says.
</P>
<P>
However, the experts say that they are not sure about how long
China's export restructuring will take.
</P>
<P>
"I hope it won't be too long," says Du Gongpu, senior economist
of the Shanghai Municipal Foreign Trade and Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Any continued export decline will directly affect China's
economic growth and sour domestic and overseas confidence in the
Chinese economy," he says, adding that it will also be harmful to
economic recovery in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
During 20 years of reforms, exports have had a special
importance in China's economic growth, contributing to 20.7
percent of economic growth in 1997, up from six percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
However, with little signs of a significant recovery in the
Asian financial crisis, many officials and experts warn that China'
s export situation this year will be as tight as last year, if not
tighter.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji last week called for "all possible means" to
boost exports to help realize this year's economic growth target
of seven percent. China reported a 7.8 economic growth rate last
year.

<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Sources close to the China
Construction Bank (CCB) said today that the CCB will expand credit
for car purchase by establishing more business branches all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
The CCB will set up 300 new business offices to extend more
loans to individual car buyers, increasing the number of offices
to 398.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the CCB will provide installment loans for
consumers to buy mini-vans and trucks in addition to a variety of
cars.
</P>
<P>
The loans may promote the production of automobiles amidst a
weak domestic market, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The CCB also pledged to improve the quality of loans and to
find solutions for problems involving mortgage and insurance as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the CCB started its business on car credit for
the first time in China. So far, the bank has extended loans of
300 million yuan (36 million US dollars) to some 3,000 car buyers.

Such remarks would only lead to new confrontations and tensions

<HEADLINE> Australian Union Says Equal Pay Campaign Stalling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Council of Trade
Union (ACTU), the most powerful national trade union in the
country, Monday claimed that the long campaign to even up women's
pay with that of men is stalling under the current Australian
government.
</P>
<P>
In some industries dominated by female employees, wage
disparity is actually starting to blow out again, ACTU President
Jennie George said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard responded by saying
unemployment among Australian women, which is at 7.2 percent, is
at its lowest level since 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said women's earnings are also on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, widely regarded as conservative, was also
criticized by prominent feminists marking the International
Women's Day for favoring women who chose to stay at home and doing
nothing to advance equality.
</P>
<P>
Howard dismissed the criticism as predictable and said his
government has recognized that women no longer want to be told how
to live their lives.
</P>
<P>
George said the ACTU's report, Equal Pay: a Union Priority,
showed that the deregulation policies of Howard and Workplace
Relations Minister Peter Reith were slowing historic gains made
since equal pay test cases in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that more severe wage deregulation
policies in the state of Western Australia have made that state
the worst for women's pay in the country, with men earning 300
Australian dollars (180 U.S. dollars) a week more than women.
</P>
<P>
The report listed statistics on six sectors with a high number
of female employees.
</P>
<P>
They showed that between 1996 and 1998 the rate of women's pay
against that of men had declined in retail, education, property
and business services and most noticeably in hospitality, where it
was down 4 percent over the two years.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also showed small improvements in health and
manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on State Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said that
doing a good job of reforming state-owned enterprises is extremely
important for the country's reform program, development and
stability.
</P>
<P>
"Reform of state-owned enterprises, especially big and medium-
sized ones, is a major economic and political issue that has a
direct bearing on the fate of the socialist system as well as the
healthy operation and long-term development of the national
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks here today during
a group discussion attended by Shanghai deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) in session here since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
China's state-owned enterprises have always had a very
important position in the country's economic and social
development and, over the past decades, they have made outstanding
contributions to, and have been playing a leading role in, the
national economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The period from now to the end of the first decade of the next
century is crucial for China's reform and development," he said. "
It is necessary during this period to push ahead with state
enterprise reform if we want to establish a well-functioning
socialist market economy and maintain a sustained, speedy and
healthy development of the national economy."
</P>
<P>
State enterprise reform is the centerpiece of China's entire
economic reform program, he said, calling for making greater
efforts and taking effective measures to do a good job in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
Jiang talked about favorable conditions for state enterprise
reform as follows:
</P>
<P>
First, principles and polices for state enterprise reform have
been worked out; second, much headway has been made and much
experience gained in two decades of state enterprise reform; third,
a social security system is being established and improved, and
development of a multi-ownership economy is providing job
opportunities; and fourth, the government has gained experience in
exercising macroeconomic controls over the economy.
</P>
<P>
Regarding guiding principles for reform of state enterprises,
Jiang said the following: first, to adhere to a basic economic
system where the publicly-owned economic sector dominates and
develops together with economic sectors of other ownership forms;
second, to actively explore new approaches for developing state
enterprises under market economic conditions; third, to create
favorable external conditions for state enterprise reform; and
fourth, to strengthen Party leadership over state enterprise
reform.

she noted.
</P>
<P>
Females now account for 39 percent of the total employees in
Hong Kong. Out of the three top posts of the SAR civil service,
two are occupied by females, namely Administrative Secretary Anson
Chan and Secretary of Justice Elsie Leung Oi-sie.
</P>
<P>
Of the total civil servants, one-third are females and the
percentage of woman members in the Executive Council is also high.
</P>
<P>
In the professional sectors, women account for 34 percent of
lawyers, 36.3 percent of accountants and 21.3 percent of doctors.
</P>
<P>
Wong said all women in Hong Kong will, as always, take an
active part in social affairs, support the work of the SAR
government and make concerted efforts to safeguard Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability apart from their continued
contributions to families and undertakings.
</P>
<P>
Other women organizations in Hong Kong also held various kinds
of activities to mark their own festival.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Foreign Minister Leaves for New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor
Nam Hong left here Monday afternoon for the United Nations to have
a six-day visit and to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
with focus on a U.N. panel's report about the tribunal for Khmer
Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Hor told reporters that he will have
discussions with Annan on March 12 on the creation of an
international tribunal to try Khmer Rouge leaders, and will notify
him about the Cambodian royal government's attitude on the issue.
But he refused to give details.
</P>
<P>
Hor said it will be up to the United Nations Security Council
to decide whether the international tribunal for the Khmer Rouge
will be set up or not. "I will emphasize that Cambodia's priority
is to sustain lasting peace. Without peace, there will be no
rehabilitation, no development of the country's economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the destiny of Ta Mok, the last Khmer Rouge
leader just captured by the government, the foreign minister said
Ta Mok will be tried inside the country according to Cambodia's
current constitution because he committed crimes in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. three-member panel has recommended in their report to
Annan setting up an international tribunal to judge the Khmer
Rouge leadership.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hun Sen has already sent a letter to Annan
saying that while his government "never rejected the
accountability of the Khmer Rouge leaders for the crimes on
genocide," he was urging caution because a tribunal could risk the
country's fragile national reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> ACWF Holds Reception to Mark International Women's Day (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,500 Chinese and foreign
women representatives gathered today in the Great Hall of the
People in Beijing to attend a reception marking the 89th
anniversary of the "March 8" International Women's Day.
</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, vice-chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), extended greetings to women
across the world on behalf of the Chinese government and the All-
China Women's Federation (ACWF).
</P>
<P>
Peng, who is also president of the ACWF, reviewed the progress
of Chinese women over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
"The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Women held in Beijing
last year affirmed women's outstanding contributions to the
development of material civilization and ethical and cultural
progress," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The congress also confirmed the unremitting efforts made by
women's federations at various levels in the spirit of reform by
initiating new opportunities for women," she added.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 120 million rural women have participated in
activities which have included general knowledge and practical
skills learning projects while competing with each other in
accomplishments and contributions. Almost 100 million women have
mastered one or two practical techniques, and more than 20 million
have become literate.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, some 37 million urban women have actively
participated and rendered meritorious services, and 480,000 laid-
off women workers have found new employment through the assistance
of women's federations.

<P>
Peng referred to 1999 as of special importance in the history
of Chinese national development as it marked the 50th anniversary
of both the founding of the People's Republic of China and the
ACWF, as well as China resuming the exercise of sovereignty over
Macao.
</P>
<P>
She asked the women federations at all levels to sum up the
experience of Chinese women's development over the past 50 years,
and called on all Chinese to make new contributions to the reform
and opening-up drive with the spirit of self-respect, self-
confidence, self-reliance and self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
Peng pointed out that the two major issues of peace and
development should be resolved by the extensive participation of
the great force of women.
</P>
<P>
"Likewise, the advancement of women's status can only by
realized by women's involvement in the national construction and
endeavor for the world peace and development," she added.
</P>
<P>
Peng pledged that China will, as always, promote exchanges and
cooperation with women overseas to deepen understanding and
friendship.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the ACWF had forged ties with more than 550
children's and women's organizations in over 140 countries and
regions and launched cooperative projects with various
international organizations like the UNDP, UNICEF, and Canadian
and Australian international development programs.

<HEADLINE> China Says It Is Determined to Increase Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China plans to encourage 50 large
and medium-sized machinery and electronics manufacturers to open
plants in Latin America and Africa to increase exports, according
to a senior trade official.
</P>
<P>
Xu Bingjin, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said that this is one of China's latest steps to help
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
After 20 years of technology imports and renovations, China has
improved machinery and electronics production and sales and has
become more competitive on the international market, he said at
the on-going East China Fair here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This is especially so for television sets, air conditioners,
refrigerators, washing machines and textile machinery, he added.
</P>
<P>
China and other developing countries in Asia, Latin America,
Africa and Eastern Europe complement each other so it is in their
interest for China to export production lines, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has more than 10 appliance manufacturers in South
Africa and has had good results, according to one official.
</P>
<P>
China's largest motor vehicle producer, the Qingqi Group,
exported a production line with a 50,000-unit annual capacity to
Pakistan four years ago and is now trying to enter the Brazilian
market.
</P>
<P>
Machinery and electronics goods accounted for 36.2 percent of
China's exports last year and were worth 66.54 billion U.S.
dollars, a 12.2 percent increase from 1997. China plans to expand
its machinery and electronics exports to 80 billion dollars by the
year 2000 and 150 billion dollars by 2010.
</P>
<P>
China will soon reveal its policies for encouraging machinery
and electronics exports by increasing tax rebates, financial
support for manufacturers, and an improved insurance system,
according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
Exports have been an important part of China's economic growth,
but, partly because of the Asian financial crisis, export growth
slowed to a mere 0.5 percent last year, compared with the official
target of 10 percent, and an actual rate of 20.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his report on government work last week, Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji stated that exports need to be increased in every possible
way to help economic growth this year. China has set this year's
economic growth at seven percent, compared to last year's 7.8
percent.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Discuss Capital Flow Surveillance Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Secretary-General
Rodolfo Severino said here Monday that the regional grouping will
start a series of meetings next week on a surveillance mechanism
aimed at monitoring capital flows and shifts in economic
indicators.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism would serve as an early warning system to alert
the grouping of impending trouble, Severino said at a press
conference after addressing the AIDCOM (Asian Institute of
Development Communication) Regional Conference here.
</P>
<P>
Severino said deputy finance ministers of the member countries
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will meet
vice governors of ASEAN central banks and of China, Japan and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
This meeting will be followed by a meeting of ASEAN finance
ministers with representatives of the Asian Development Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said a decision might be made on the convening of a meeting
of finance ministers of the ASEAN, China, Japan and South Korea
later to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in his speech, Severino said some tentative projections
by authoritative analysts revealed that 1999 would mark the
beginning of the ASEAN's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN's economy on the average should in 1999 resume growth
or contract only slightly after an average contraction of 9.6
percent in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at the AIDCOM regional conference Monday, Malaysia
called on fellow ASEAN countries to persist in ensuring a new
international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
Unless there exists a mechanism to regulate and stabilize
volatile capital flows, ASEAN economies would continue to be at
their mercy, Second Finance Minister Mustapa Mohamed said in his
keynote address read out by Parliamentary Secretary to the Finance
Ministry Shafie Mohd Salleh at the regional conference.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Improves Forex Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Improvement of the management
mechanism of foreign exchange rates since February has allowed the
Vietnamese dong exchange rate with foreign currencies to respond
to the supply-demand balance on the market, a senior banking
official said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam News Agency Monday quoted Vice Governor of the State
Bank of Vietnam Duong Thu Huong as saying the official exchange
rate has reflected fairly objectively the supply-demand balance on
the foreign currency market and is coming closer to the real
purchasing power of the Vietnamese dong.
</P>
<P>
With the new mechanism in operation, the state's administrative
interference in the forex market will be gradually eliminated and
replaced by indirect tools to suit the market economy, she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that this reflects Vietnam's determination to
integrate into the regional and world economy and direct its
economic development along the market mechanism with respect to
the market's rules and the state's regulation.
</P>
<P>
The State Bank of Vietnam issued on February 25 a decision
allowing credit organizations licensed to deal in foreign
currencies to fix their selling and buying rates within a plus or
minus 0.1 percent daily alteration on the official exchange rate
announced by the state bank.
</P>
<P>
Only one official exchange rate is announced daily based on the
overnight exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Vietnamese
dong on the interbank market instead of the previous two rates
(the official exchange rate and the average exchange rate between
the actual buying and selling rates on the interbank market).

<HEADLINE> Nepal Opens Conference on Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- About 730 Nepalese scientists
and some 30 foreign experts gathered here Monday to assess the
current status of science and technology in Nepal and explore ways
to promote the sector for all-round national development.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Royal Nepal Academy of
Science and Technology (RONAST) Girija Prasad Koirala inaugurated
the third national conference on science and technology organized
by RONAST, an autonomous academic body founded in 1982.
</P>
<P>
Professor Klaus von Klitzing from Germany, a Nobel laureate of
physics in 1985, delivered the keynote address entitled "the
Revolution in Microelectronics: Past and Future."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 research papers will be presented at the four-day
conference, RONAST Vice-Chancellor Dayananda Bajracharya said.
</P>
<P>
The 12 theme papers focus on challenges for implementation of
policies and programs, research for agricultural development,
utilization of water resources, development and promotion of
renewable energy, input of science and technology in industry,
development of indigenous technologies, regional and international
cooperation, science in higher education and investment in
research, RONAST said.
</P>
<P>
Professor G. Thyagarajan from India will present a paper on
"Intellectual Property Rights: Issues in Developing Countries"
while Dr. R.Baudo from Italy focuses on "High Altitude Science and
Technology Research: Nepal's Unique Offer," the organizer said.
</P>
<P>
Also scheduled for the conference are special lectures by
national and foreign participants, a poster presentation and
technical sessions on various aspects of science and technology
and a workshop on intellectual property rights and biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition was also held Monday on models, devices and
publications related to the theme of "application of science and
technology for national development." A renewable energy park
highlighted the research, promotion and development of renewable
energy.
</P>
<P>
Various national organizations like the Ministry of Science and
Technology and the Tribhuvan University as well as international
and foreign organizations such as the Committee on Science and
Technology in Developing Countries, the UNESCO and the World
Wildlife Fund have extended their support to the conference,
RONAST said.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology has played a role in national
development of Nepal in certain areas, but as it is not a priority
sector, investment is very low even by regional standard,
Vice-Chancellor Bajracharya said.
</P>
<P>
The conference is held with a view to raising awareness among
the politicians, intellectuals and the society about the role of
science and technology in national development.
</P>
<P>
The first and second national conferences on science and
technology were held respectively in 1988 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Central Bank to Get IMF Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda (BOU), the
country's central bank, will get assistance from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to improve its supervision over
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in Monday's East African weekly, BOU is
still looking at areas in which it needs technical assistance
from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Zia Ebrahim Zadeh, the IMF representative in Uganda, was quoted
as saying that although the BOU's supervisory department was
established with IMF assistance under the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility, his organization still thinks the department
needs more help.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 the central bank came under severe criticism from the
parliament and the general public for its failure to detect
anomalies in the operations of some commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the commercial banks ran into serious problems,
forcing the BOU to intervene in their operations.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Blast Victims Sue for Washington's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) --Claims have been filed against the
U.S. government seeking individual compensation of up to 1.5
million U.S. dollars for victims of last year's terrorist blast in
Nairobi, the Eastern African newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Documents were lodged in Washington last week by California
lawyer John Burris, who visited Kenya in February collecting
details of people who had been injured or lost their family
members in the bomb explosion of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi on
August 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Burris had lodged 20 complaints covering 2,300 victims in the
first batch of a series against the U.S. government. The claims
for each victim range between 250,000 dollars to 1.5 million
dollars, for Washington failed to protect its Nairobi embassy
from destruction.
</P>
<P>
He said the amounts were based on the severity of a survivor's
injuries or on the potential financial losses suffered by those
whose beloved were killed in the blast.
</P>
<P>
According to Burris, the U.S. government has six months to
respond. If it rejects the claims and the case will go to a
Federal Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than five million dollars were spent by the U.S.
on Kenya's

emergency needs immediately after the explosion. Another 37
million dollars have been earmarked for programs to assist Kenya's
recovery from the attack, which killed 213 people and injured
about 5,000.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Importers Bet On Yuan's Stability (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A stable yuan is one of the major
reasons why thousands of business people from overseas are here
participating in an important trade fair.
</P>
<P>
"If the yuan had been as volatile as many other Asian
currencies, I wouldn't be here today," said Ariy Arthur, Managing
Director of G.M. Arthur &AMP; Co. Ltd, a British company based in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Arthur, a British national, is among 3,700 overseas business
people from more than 90 countries and regions who are
participating in the seven-day East China Fair, which opened on
March 5.
</P>
<P>
"The stability of the yuan has enabled me to escape the worst
of the Asian financial crisis," Arthur told Xinhua, adding that he
has been engaged in entrepot trade in Hong Kong for more than 20
years and that the Chinese mainland accounts for more than 90
percent of his business.
</P>
<P>
Arthur's views are widely shared by other business leaders,
including Tom Gottlieb, President of Two's Company from the United
States which imports an average of seven million US dollars of
handicrafts each year from China.
</P>
<P>
"Although the prices of products in countries with massive
currency devaluations are getting lower and lower, I'm still
interested in doing business in China," Gottlieb said.
</P>
<P>
"Prices are, beyond any doubt, important but quality, the
ability to make timely deliveries and the country's stable
economic policies are more important," he added.
</P>
<P>
"China has made and kept its promises and has successfully
safeguarded the stability of its currency, and this fully reflects
its ability to keep the situation under control," Gottlieb said.
</P>
<P>
"To do business with such a country, you've got nothing to
worry about," he said.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of confidence in trading with China is also being
strongly felt by Chinese exporters at the fair.
</P>
<P>
"We were afraid that there would be few importers from overseas
this year, but the real situation is much better than expected and
we have met more than 20 overseas business people everyday," said
Zhang Bing, a section chief of China Qingqi Group, China's large
motor vehicle producer.

<HEADLINE> Mini-Bus Production Slowing Down In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's stricter automobile
exhaust emission standards are seen as a big challenge to mini
buses.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is the first to announce new regulations with regard to
exhaust emission, which took effect on January 1. Shanghai and
Tianjin followed suit. However, there is a gap between the
performance and the standards, because buses fail to meet the
requirements, according to a Machine Building Industry
Administration official.
</P>
<P>
Mini buses used to be considered a type of transitional vehicle
because the Chinese could not afford more expensive ones and their
low cost and relatively large capacity made them the vehicle of
choice.
</P>
<P>
However, their undesirable characteristics have slowed
production this year after continued market expansion for several
years, International Business Daily reports. And, Beijing has
decided to put mini buses being used as taxis off the road by the
year 2000 to control air pollution, and this will take 30,000 of
them off Beijing's streets.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that this is the beginning of the move to
replace such buses, which account for a quarter of the 600,000
taxis in China. More cities are expected to help make them
obsolete.
</P>
<P>
These buses are even less competitive when engine size, comfort,
and road safety are concerned. Their engines are tiny and not
suited to expressway or highway use and do not allow the use of
air conditioning equipment.
</P>
<P>
Some automobile manufacturers are developing new mini bus
models. Isuzu's joint venture in Liuzhou City of the Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region has a new state-of-the-art model, that is
considered by the industry to be a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts say they are not so optimistic about the
market for the new model, unless its cost is cut substantially.
The new model is more expensive than a car.
</P>
<P>
China has 9 major mini bus manufacturers with a total annual
production capacity of 600,000 vehicles.

<HEADLINE> China's Defense Expenditure Kept at Low level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's defense expenditure
remains at a low level compared with other countries despite a
slight increase in 1999 as is proposed at a draft budget for the
year, a senior officer of the General Logistics Department of the
Chinese armed forces said here today.
</P>
<P>
China's defense spending is projected to grow by 12.7 percent
this year to 104.65 billion yuan (about 12.64 billion US dollars),
according to a report delivered by Finance Minister Xiang
Huaicheng at the ongoing session of the National People's Congress
(NPC), the nation's highest law-making body.
</P>
<P>
Also an NPC deputy, Sun Zhiqiang, head of the Financial
Division of the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People'
s Liberation Army, pointed out that the Party and the State
Council have always attached great importance and attention to
army building and strived to ensure that defense spending meet the
needs of the PLA for the normal operation of its various
activities inspite of financial difficulties faced by the
government.
</P>
<P>
He explained that two factors stand behind this year's growth
in defense spending that is slightly higher than that in previous
years: first, the army no longer engages in business activities in
accordance with a decision made last year by the central
authorities, and this is the main reason; and second, it is an
internationally accepted practice for a country to increase
defense spending to a certain extent along with its economic
development and improvement in people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
Still, he said, the growth in the country's defense spending
this year is still lower than that in overall expenditures in the
central budget.
</P>
<P>
"China's defense expenditure has remained at a low level
because it adheres to a defensive policy in national defense and
has always controlled defense spending strictly," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China's defense spending is expected to account for
about 1.2 percent of its GDP and 8.4 percent of its state
budgetary expenditures, compared with the averages of 3 percent
and 15 percent respectively for the world's main countries.
</P>
<P>
He made some comparisons. In 1997, military spending for the
United States was 258.3 billion US dollars, 3.2 percent and 16.1
percent of its GDP and its federal budget respectively; those for
Russia were 17.89 billion US dollars, 3.9 percent of its GDP and
19.7 percent of its state expenditures; and those for India were 9.
92 billion US dollars, 2.9 percent of its GDP and 14.8 percent of
its state expenditures, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The PLA's per capita defense spending is projected at 4,200 US
dollars in 1999, far lower than that for the armed forces of some
other countries in 1997: 178,000 US dollars for the US army, 144,
000 US dollars for the Japanese army, 12,000 US dollars for the
Russian army and 8,600 US dollars for the Indian army," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China's current defense expenditure still falls short of what
its basic military need in a time of high-tech defense requires,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The PLA needs to make the most of the limited input, practicing
strict economy and fighting against extravagance, allocating the
money to the most needy areas and stepping up financial management,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Developing Central, Western Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today
urged the country's central and western regions to seize
opportunities and tap potentials in order to speed up their
economic development and catch up with the better-developed
eastern coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
"The Party Central Committee and the State Council have always
attached great importance to the economic and social development
in the central and western regions," Zhu, also a Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of
China Central Committee, told legislators from northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Qinghai province this morning.
</P>
<P>
The legislators, who are here attending the ongoing Second
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top
legislature, expressed their views on a Government Work Report
delivered by Zhu at the session's opening meeting last Friday.
</P>
<P>
While affirming the achievements Xinjiang and Qinghai scored
last year, the premier said that in recent years, the central
authorities have granted preferential policies to the central and
western regions in finance and in approving the construction of
infrastructure projects, which are designed to promote the
economic development there.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, as much as 62 percent of the increased
government investment went to the central and western regions,
while fixed assets investment for the western regions increased by
31.2 percent, 14.9 percentage points higher than the investment
growth in the eastern regions.
</P>
<P>
"This is something unprecedented," Zhu said, adding that the
central government has decided to make more investment in a number
of water conservation, transportation and environmental protection
projects in the central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the central government has always encouraged
the comparatively developed eastern regions to develop cooperation
in various forms with the central, western regions, and to help
the latter to attract more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the premier stressed that the economic prosperity
for the central and western regions depends fundamentally on the
hard work and painstaking efforts of the local people.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that these regions should seize the current
opportunities brought by the central government's decision to
boost domestic demand by expanding infrastructure construction,
and concentrate on developing a number of good quality and highly
efficient infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, people in the central and western regions
also need to learn how to make full use of the local rich
resources according to market demand, and always maintain a
pioneering spirit and fine mentality.
</P>
<P>
The premier also highlighted the significance of enhancing
ethnic unity and maintaining social, political stability in
Xinjiang and Qinghai, both of which are home for a good number of
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
"We must resolutely oppose ethnic splittist activities in any
forms," he stressed, hoping that the people of various ethnic
groups in Xinjiang and Qinghai unite closely and make new
contributions to maintaining the unity of the motherland social
stability and lasting tranquility of China.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Member Calls for Early Launch of Water Diversion Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A member of China's top advisory
body called for an early launch of a project to divert water from
rivers in southern China to solve the problem of water shortages
in north China.
</P>
<P>
Han Yingxuan, chairman of the Qinghai provincial committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
suggested that a government coordination office be set up, and
policies concerning the project be formulated for an early start
of the project.
</P>
<P>
Water shortage in north China is a bottleneck for economic and
social development in the region, which prompted people to raise
plans as early as 40 years ago to divert river water from the
upper reaches of the Yangtze River, Lancang River, Nujiang River
and Yarlung Zangbu River to the Yellow River and its valley via a
western diversion route.
</P>
<P>
Han Yingxuan said Qinghai province has submitted several
proposals to the central government to launch the water diversion
project as early as possible, and has put forward a scheme based
on field inspections and a feasibility study done by groups of
water control experts.
</P>
<P>
Han also suggested that a development company be set up to
manage the project and related affairs including power generation
and environment protection.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Probe Alleged Police Insurance Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will look
into an alleged insurance fraud that has reportedly fleeced
Philippine National Police (PNP) personnel of some 6.25 million
U.S. dollars in salary deductions.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said in a radio interview
Monday that President Joseph Estrada would not hesitate to stop
the deductions if the study confirms that the withholdings are
illegal.
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll study this, and if the deduction is indeed
irregular, the president would order it stopped," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Philippine Senate Blue Ribbon Committee
ordered former and incumbent police generals to account for some
250 million pesos (6.25 million dollars) that was supposedly
"illegally deducted" from policemen's salaries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports alleged that the Public Safety and Mutual
Benefit Fund, headed by a retired general, collected the insurance
premiums from the 108,000-member PNP.
</P>
<P>
Blue Ribbon Committee Chairman Aquilino Pimentel Jr. raised the
possibility that the insurance program may be a conspiracy by some
police officials to make money out of the hard-earned salaries of
their subordinates.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Court to Discuss Ban of Political Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's highest court will discuss
a appeal Monday lodged by the Court of Appeals, demanding the
closure of the People's Democracy Party (HADEP) to prevent it from
participating in the coming April 18 elections.
</P>
<P>
If the Constitutional Court approves the demand raised by Chief
Prosecutor Vural Savas, the HADEP will not be permitted to enter
either the local or the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the HADEP presented the Constitutional Court with
a petition last Monday, in which they accounted for their
objections to the closure.
</P>
<P>
Savas has asked the Constitutional Court to ban the HADEP for
its alleged connection with the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK), which has been fighting a guerrilla war since 1984 for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Savas charged that the HADEP was operating as a branch of the
PKK and accused it of inciting separatism based on ethnic lines
and enlisting volunteers for the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The HADEP branches are being used to form the grassroots of the
PKK and to organize activities to send militants to the PKK's
mountain bands, local Daily News has reported.
</P>
<P>
Savas cited a nationwide hunger strike staged by the HADEP
members last November in support of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan,
who was captured by Turkish special agents in Kenya in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Turkey's Constitutional Court has banned 14
political parties.

</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Gesher on Sunday signed a unity agreement with Labor and
Meimad and formally announced itself part of the new One Israel
bloc. A Labor strategist explained that if Labor leader Ehud Barak
is able to win 3 or 4 percent of those who voted for the
Gesher-Likud coalition in the 1996 elections to vote for One
Israel, he will greatly strengthen his position.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat is
expected later this month to ask U.S. President Bill Clinton for
the first time to formally support the Palestinians' right to
establish an independant state. The two leaders are scheduled to
meet in Washington on March 23.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Jerusalem District Court is expected to announce soon
the verdict against Shas leader Aryeh Deri, who is charged with

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Police to Recruit More to Fight Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri confirmed Sunday that the
force had been allowed to increase its recruitment this year.
</P>
<P>
He said while the approved 2,000 new recruits were welcome, the
numbers were still inadequate and negotiations with the treasury
would continue.
</P>
<P>
For several years the police did not increase its establishment
of 20,000 people and new recruits will only replace those who
resigned or retired.
</P>
<P>
Chihuri did not say exactly how big he wanted the police force
to be, it is understood that a force of around 35,000 members will
be adequate to provide the necessary law and order for a nation
the size of Zimbabwe, with a population of about 12 million
people, the Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
Transport problems, which have frustrated police efficiency,
may soon be "a thing of the past" following a deal with the
British government to provide more vehicles, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Armed robberies, car-hijackings, robberies and house breaking
are among the crimes giving the police headaches. More recruits
will ensure improved police coverage.

separatism based on ethnic lines and enlisting volunteers for the
PKK.
</P>
<P>
Daily News:

<HEADLINE> Women Play Integral Part in Vietnam's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hanoi, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese women play an integral
part in the country's national strategy for socioeconomic
stability and development, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) Monday quoted
President of the Vietnam Women's Union (VWU) Ha Thi Khiet as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Khiet said the Vietnamese government has seen the need to
promote the role of women in society with the approval by the
prime minister on October 7, 1997, of a Plan of Action for the
Advancement of Vietnamese Women to 2000.
</P>
<P>
Khiet, who is also a member of the Communist Party of Vietnam
Central Committee and president of the National Committee for the
Advancement of Women (NCAW), was speaking to the party daily Nhan
Dan on the International Women's Day which falls on March 8.
</P>
<P>
With 11 targets, the Plan of Action focuses on employment of,
eradication of hunger among, education of, health care for and
empowerment of women, the VWU president noted.
</P>
<P>
One of the targets in the plan that has been reached is the
participation of women in social activities. Khiet pointed out
that female national assembly deputies make up 26.22 percent of
the total and that all the country's 61 provinces and cities and
48 ministries and central agencies have established their own
committees for the advancement of women.
</P>
<P>
She said the percentage of female students in higher learning
institutions has been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, 22 individuals and six groups of Vietnamese women
scientists have received the Kovaleskaia Prize for their
achievements in math, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine,
agriculture and industry, Khiet added.
</P>
<P>
On membership development, Khiet said the VWU is continuing to
increase its membership in the armed forces, religious areas and
ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
Women make up 51.2 percent of Vietnamese population of 78
million and 50.61 percent of its work force.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Plan on Children Called Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has met almost all
the mid-decade goals spelt out by the country's first action plan
(1995-2000) relating to children's survivability, National Unity
and Social Development Minister Paduka Zaleha Ismail said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia earned international recognition for meeting 11 of the
13 mid-decade goals, she told reporters after opening the 2nd
National Consultative Forum on Children -- Caring for the Children
of Malaysia in the Year 2000 and Beyond.
</P>
<P>
Among the 11 goals achieved are relating to lowering of infant
mortality and post-natal mortality rates, high enrollment of
primary school-leavers in secondary schools and provision of clean
water, she said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is only short of two goals -- namely the strategy to
overcome iodine and vitamin A deficiencies, she said, adding that
the government is working toward meeting the two remaining goals.
</P>
<P>
She urged participants of the three-day forum to address
current issues such as child abuse, child neglect and unwanted
pregnancies, saying the outcome of the forum would form inputs
for the second action plan for the survivability of Malaysian
children for the 2000-2005 period.

<HEADLINE> Legislators Praise Human Rights Progress in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers attending the
ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC), China's legislature, have unanimously given the government a
good mark for promoting human rights progress in this most
populous country in the world.
</P>
<P>
"China has fed more than one fifth of the world population with
only 7 percent of the world's arable land," said NPC deputy Xu
Dunxin.
</P>
<P>
"It also cut the number of poor people in the rural areas to
fewer than 40 million in 1998 from 250 million in 1978 through the
world's most successful poverty-elimination endeavor," he added.
</P>
<P>
These facts indicate the "biggest and most significant"
improvement of human rights, said Xu, vice-chairman of the NPC
Foreign Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to deputy Wu Dexin, an academician with the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, the Chinese people's civil and political
rights have also greatly improved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The people's congress system and the system of multi-party
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China have enabled the Chinese people to
actually become "masters of the State", she noted.
</P>
<P>
Ma Guifen, a female NPC deputy of the Uygur ethnic group, noted
that among the more than 2,000 deputies to the current NPC, 424
are from various ethnic minorities and 650 are females.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is rare in other countries across the world,"
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that over the past two decades, the
Chinese legislature has enacted more than 340 laws and relevant
regulations and decisions to protect the people's rights, and the
average rate of participation of eligible voters in national and
local elections has exceeded 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are over 1,800 national and more than 200,000 local
social organizations protected by law and some 100 million
religious believers who enjoy full freedom to carry out religious
activities in China, while 98.9 percent of the country's school-
age children have entered schools.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the number of international human rights conventions
which China has participated in or signed has totaled 19, more
than many other countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chairman conceded that due to China's nature as a
developing nation with a large population and at a fairly low
level of economic development, it's impossible for it to be
perfect in protecting and promoting human rights.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that as different countries have different
conditions, it's natural for them to have different criteria for
judging the human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
"We're strongly against any attempts to use human rights as a
pretext to interfere in other countries' internal affairs," he
said.

<HEADLINE> 20 Million Infected With AIDS in Sub-Saharan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Giving the statistics on the effects of the AIDS disease at a
two-day seminar for journalists held in Machakos, in Kenya's
Eastern Province, Paul Kavoo of the Kenyan National AIDS Committee
attributed the increase of AIDS to the abject poverty which had
forced many unemployed women to engage in unprotected commercial
sex.
</P>
<P>
Kavoo expressed his concern over the increase in the number of
orphaned children in Africa, saying that the number of street
children and juvenile delinquents had shot up.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, statistics show that more than 300,000 Kenyans have
died from AIDS since the first case was diagnosed in 1984, while
1.5 million others -- 70 percent of whom are aged between 18 and
25 years old -- are infected with the killer virus.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, local economist G. Reriani said that the
epidemic had threatened the entire socio-economic sector since
most of those dying are elites.
</P>
<P>
He noted that those who died of the AIDS include teachers,
health workers and other skilled manpower, and the labor force was
under threat.
</P>
<P>
Funded at a cost of of 4.4 billion Kenyan shillings (around 70
million U. S. dollars) by World Bank, Kenya is implementing the
sexually transmitted infection project which has challenged the
media to launch aggressive campaigns to sensitize the public on
the AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Qatar to Hold First Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Qatar will hold its first-ever
nationwide elections for a central municipal council on Monday,
the Gulf News daily of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six observers from eight countries -- the United States,
Britain, Germany, France, Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait and Iran -- are
to monitor the polls in which Qatari citizens over the age of 18,
including women, are allowed to cast their ballots, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The council will be commissioned with advising on issues of
food and public cleaning to the Minister of Agriculture and
Municipal Affairs Ali Said al-Khayarin.
</P>
<P>
The elections bear great importance as it is Qatar's first
experiment with democracy.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has an estimated native population of 150,000, of which
about 40,000 -- excluding children and those employed in police
and defense forces, who are barred from voting -- are eligible to
exercise their franchise.
</P>
<P>
But only 21,992 voters, 44 percent of whom are women, have
registered for the voting.
</P>
<P>
About 248 candidates, including six women, are running for
the 29-seat council.
</P>
<P>
The council will replace the state advisory council, whose 35
members were nominated by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa
al-Thani.
</P>
<P>
The emir has promised to hold national parliamentary elections,
which he describes as a "stepping stone to full-fledged
democracy."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers scored
their biggest win of the season by toppling hot favorites Utah
Jazz 97-89 on Sunday for their seventh victory in a row.
</P>
<P>
By shaking up the NBA's balance of power, the Lakers defeated
their longtime nemesis for their sixth straight win since Kurt
Rambis was named coach and five-time champion Dennis Rodman came
aboard as a rebounding and defensive forward.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant scored 24 points and Shaquille O'Neal had 23 and 16
rebounds. Both had baskets in an 8-1 spurt midway through the
final period that gave the Lakers control.
</P>
<P>
Derek Fisher added a season-high 20 points and reserve Elden
Campbell scored 10 of his 16 points in the third quarter and was

points.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the Lakers to beat the Jazz since
November 18, 1997.

"We think Utah is still the best team in the West and we know
if we want to go to the big dance we have to go through these guys
and it's not going to be easy," O'Neal said.
</P>

Los Angeles also handed the Jazz their first regular-season

In Portland, the Trail Blazers raced to a 111-71 victory over
the star-studded Houston Rockets for their sixth straight triumph.
</P>
<P>
Playing for the second straight night, Houston's frontcourt of
Hakeem Olajuwon, Scottie Pippen and Charles Barkley -- all among
the NBA's 50 Greatest Players -- were no match for the rested and
talented Blazers, who had all 12 players score at least five
points.
</P>
<P>
Isaiah Rider scored 21 points for Portland, which set a season
high in points in the most lopsided game in the NBA this year.
</P>
<P>
In Indianapolis, Reggie Miller overcame a right ankle injury to
score 12 of his 16 points on 3-pointers and Rik Smits added 14 as
the Indiana Pacers snapped the Miami Heat's four-game winning
streak with an 85-72 victory.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers lead the Central Division and tied the Heat for the
second-best record in the Eastern Conference at 12-5. Orlando (14-
4) leads the conference.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Patrick Ewing scored 18 of his 30 points in the
third quarter and the Knicks held off the New Jersey Nets 97-86
for their eighth straight home win.
</P>
<P>
Keith Van Horn had 22 points and a career-high 16 rebounds for
the Nets, who have lost nine of their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, point guard Jeff McInnis, who had played six
minutes all season, scored six of his career-high 12 points in
overtime and held Allen Iverson, the NBA's leading scorer, without

seconds, leading the Minnesota Timberwolves to an 88-77 victory

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Price Hike Unfair: Oial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some local manufacturers are taking
 advantage of Zimbabwe's high inflation to make unfair increases
in the prices of goods, Governor of the Zimbabwe Reserve Bank
Leonard Tsumba said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tsumba said instead of increasing prices of goods at the
percentage by which inflation would have risen in a particular
month, some producers were hiking prices by rates prevailing at
that moment.
</P>
<P>
"You find that some producers hike their prices by 46 percent
when, in fact, inflation would only have risen by two percent from
44 percent," he told participants at a week-long business and
economic reporting workshop which ended here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank chief said such a scenario was disturbing and
there was need to maintain price stability by increasing prices
using the correct variables,the daily Herald reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Stable domestic prices were central to sustaining rational
consumption, investment and savings decisions by some companies
and individuals, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said stable prices also helped to create confidence in the
economy and minimize the scope for "spurious irrational decisions"
by economic agents.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1991, Zimbabwe's
experience provided little to cheer about as the subsequent
deregulation of prices saw inflation rise sharply.
</P>
<P>
Although it declined to an average of about 22 percent per
annum between 1994 and 1996 and 18.8 percent in 1997, these lower
rates were short-lived.
</P>
<P>
Last year was marked by sustained inflationary pressures with
the year- on-year inflation rate rising from 24.2 percent in
January to 46.6 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
Prices of both basic and luxury goods have been rising rapidly
since 1997 following the dramatic plunge of the Zimbabwean dollar.
</P>
<P>
Tsumba said the government would soon gazette new prices of
bread and flour and examine the prices of other basic commodities
such as milk, mealie-meal, sugar and meat.

<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
today expressed his concern and sympathy over the turmoil in the
Congo (Brazzaville) and said China hopes that stability would be
restored in that country at an early date to help push forward its
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that the Chinese government cherishes its ties with
the Congo and is ready to advance Sino-Congolese friendly
cooperation in various fields on the basis of the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a meeting with Rodolphe Adada,
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation and French Affairs of
the Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that Sino-Congolese cooperative relations have been
growing steadily despite the great changes in the two countries
since they forged diplomatic ties 35 years ago. The two countries
have registered fruitful cooperation in politics, economics and
other areas and they have supported each other in international
affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Citing China as a reliable friend of the Congo, Adada said
that China's "unselfish assistance " to the Congo has greatly
helped the economic development in the African country.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese government rates highly the friendly cooperation
between the two countries and admires China's important role in
international affairs, Adada said.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese government would continue to adhere to the "one
China" policy, Adada said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Air Pollution Highlighted at CPPCC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Ninth Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee, who is attending the annual CPPCC session here in
Beijing, proposed that the State Council, China's cabinet, pay
special attention to controlling the deteriorating air pollution
in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhouqi, a vice chairman of the Subcommittee of Human
Resources and Environment of the CPPCC National Committee, said
that air pollution in Beijing is a unique one, different from
environmental problems in any other international metropolises.
</P>
<P>
The State Council should establish a joint conference system to
discuss the effort to improve the air pollution in the capital by
using modern technologies, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
According to official investigations, the city discharges 235,
000 tons of smog and dust and 340,000 tons of sulfur dioxide into
the air annually, and its 1.4 million auto vehicles make the
pollution even worse with a large amount of harmful emissions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the subcommittee formed a special investigation
group about the capital's air pollution and its control, which is
headed by Hu Qili, a vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,
and conducted a study on the issue from in November-December 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan to build Beijing into a world-class
historic and cultural city and a modern international metropolis,
Chen proposed that the State Council adopt special policies and
give financial assistance to the city with regard to the
restructuring of local industries, energy consumption and
transformation of old urban area, as well as the increase of
vehicles and the distribution of population.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technologies should be used to find out scientific and
relatively economical solutions for dealing with the issue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Since it is too difficult for the Beijing Municipal Government
to handle the issue by itself, the State Council joint conference
may help coordinate the efforts of the city government and
relevant central government and military departments and even
various provinces which have their establishments in the city,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that Beijing city government be granted with the
legislative power on environmental issues by the National People's
Congress Standing Committee.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Begin to Regard Birthday as Occasion for Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The birthday has become yet another
holiday in Tibet, along with the various religious holidays and
festivals.
</P>
<P>
Many people in Tibet still actually have no idea about when
they were born, so birthday parties have not exactly been major
events. But with resident permits and improved medical care in the
Tibet Autonomous Region, birthdays are more easily recognized and
celebration parties are more popular these days, Tibetan officials
say.
</P>
<P>
Wangdui, a 35-year-old medical care worker, says, "My child's
birthday is the busiest day for our family. We now can afford more
expensive items and have time to celebrate together. My family
never celebrated my birthday when I was young and that has always
made me sad. I don't want it to be repeated."
</P>
<P>
There are now more bakeries in Lhasa, the capital, and a lot
more people are buying birthday cakes, at least 10 every day,
according to one shop owner.
</P>
<P>
Annual per capita incomes of Tibetans in cities and towns have
grown to more than 5,000 yuan (about 600 U.S. dollars) and those
of farmers go up to more than 1,000 yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- In the capital of China's
Guangdong Province, women are finding themselves more qualified to
compete for high-salary jobs with men.
</P>
<P>
Female employees now outnumber men in medical services, sports,
social welfare services, education, arts, radio, movies, and
television undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The improvements in their social position has been attributed
mainly to their improved education and to an increase in the
varieties of jobs, especially in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
Women now account for 40 percent of the college educated people
in the city and girls account for 38 percent of the students.
According to recent local newspaper report, mothers usually have
greater expectations for their children's education than do
fathers and are more likely to attend parent meetings at school.
</P>
<P>
Education has been cited as the major reason for women's
improved position in society and greater freedom in married life
in neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which has a under-
developed economy and a high percentage of people of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In much of the region, 98 percent of the school-age girls can
get an education. Women's health problems are also being better
looked after and more than 83 percent of the ethnic minority women
have access to better health information when they get pregnant.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Witnesses Three Leaps in Productivity in 40 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 8 (Xinhua)-- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
witnessed three major leaps in productivity in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The first was in 1959 when the central government ended the
feudal system and brought socialism to tens of thousands of serfs,
who made up 95 percent of the region's population. They had been
referred to as "talking livestock" and were deprived of individual
liberty, land or livestock ownership, and individual wealth, which
was monopolized by aristocrats, lamas and the feudalist government.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the reforms, Tibet's grain output went from 36,000
tons in 1959 to 160,000 tons in 1965.
</P>
<P>
The second leap came at the beginning of the 1980s, when China
began the household contract system, under which collective farms
were divided up, giving each household a share to manage. Because
of the reforms, most people solved their basic food and clothing
needs themselves and Tibet developed its industrial sector, mainly
in light industry and building materials.
</P>
<P>
The third leap has come since 1992, when the 14th National
Communist Party Congress was held. For four successive years,
Tibet had double-digit growth and people gradually replaced
traditional modes of farming with cows, horses, and manual power.
They now have automobiles and tractors and many households also
have computers and access to the internet.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, the private economy has grown as the regional
government led the country in drafting regulations to help it.
Tibet has over 40,000 self-employed business people, more than 200
private companies, and 78 joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Tibetan companies have been issuing shares. Lhasa
Beer and four other companies are traded on the national stock
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Legqog, chairman of the regional government, says that the
three leaps show that whenever the means of production fit
historic development trends, social productivity will move forward
and Tibet is trying for a gigantic a fourth leap in productivity
in information technology.

<HEADLINE> Wool Smuggling to Be Checked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's money-losing wool fabric
producers are asking for greater state efforts to check smuggling,
China Textile News reports.
</P>
<P>
An increase in wool smuggling caused disorder in the domestic
wool market in the past several years and has affected the
industry adversely. A nationwide crackdown on smuggling in the
latter half of last year to some extent helped stabilize the wool
market, but new problems appeared.
</P>
<P>
Because people with wool import licenses don't need woolen
material and spinning mills need a license to buy raw materials,
illegal buying and selling of licenses on the black market began
to increase.`
</P>
<P>
And wool importers can make a large profit from the price gap
between foreign and domestic wool. This led to disorderly wool
imports.
</P>
<P>
The protective measures that have been proposed include more
licenses for state-owned enterprises to meet production capacity
and tightening management of wool imports.

<HEADLINE> Manila Concerned About Filipina in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it is keeping track on the case of a Filipina who
allegedly killed her two sons in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Monday, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora said that the move was made in an effort to prevent another
Flor Contemplacion case which soured diplomatic relations with the
Singapore government in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Contemplacion was hanged after she was found by a Singapore
court guilty of the killing of a fellow Filipina maid.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that the Foreign Affairs Department has already
hired a lawyer to assist Melody Zacarias-Dass, and wanted to bring
her children to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The government is not taking any chances that would again
undermine Philippines-Singapore relations by keeping a tab on the
case since Dass is reportedly not in her physical conditions when
she stabbed her children to death, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Dass is suffering from a mental disorder
that prompted her to do the crime.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Trade Surplus in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia chalked up a trade
surplus due to a bigger drop in imports versus exports in January,
the 15th consecutive month since November 1997 to record a
surplus, according to the Statistics Department Monday.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in the month under review amounted to 4.3
billion ringgit (1.131 billion U.S. dollars) against a smaller
surplus of 2.5 billion ringgit (657.894 million dollars) in the
same month last year, according to the Malaysian External Trade
Statistics released by the department.
</P>
<P>
However, the surplus in January 1999 was lower by 2.4 billion
ringgit (631.578 million dollars) in comparison with the surplus
of 6.7 billion ringgit (1.763 billion dollars) last December.
</P>
<P>
In January 1999, Malaysia's imports declined by 12.5 percent to
17.5 billion ringgit (4.605 billion dollars) while its exports
were lower by 3.3 percent to 21.9 billion ringgit (5.763 billion
dollars) against the imports of 20.1 billion ringgit (5.289
billion dollars) and the exports of 22.6 billion ringgit (5.947
billion dollars) in the same month last year respectively.

<HEADLINE> Spain Calls for Popularizing Family Planning Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 7 (Xinhua)-- The Spanish Family Planning
Association Sunday urged world countries to further spread the
knowledge on family planning to reduce unnecessary "sacrifices."
</P>
<P>
In a report released on the eve of the International Women's
Day, the association said more than 14,000 women died of pregnancy-
and delivery-related diseases every year, among which 99 percent
were from the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
A lack of knowledge and education in this area was one of the
important reasons for the tragedy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient medical service was another reason for the deaths,
it added.
</P>
<P>
Among 260 million women aged between 15 to 19, 11 percent were
not able to obtain effective contraceptive tools, it said.
</P>
<P>
Many young women suffered health problems or even died in a bid
to avoid delivery.
</P>
<P>
World governments had agreed to provide their people with
necessary family planning and contraceptive tools at an
international conference on population and development held in
Cairo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But after five years, many countries still failed to do so, the
association deplored in its report.

WELLINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley called for appointing more women to decision-making
bodies here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an International Women's Day function held at the
New Zealand Ministry of Women's Affairs, Shipley said that the New
Zealanders are pleased to see the number of women being appointed
to government bodies gradually increasing.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998, 35 percent of the appointments approved by the
Cabinet were women, compared to 25 percent in 1993. However there
is still room for improvement," she said.
</P>
<P>
"In New Zealand, we can be proud that women are continuing to
make very real progress. However it remains a challenge to ensure
the diversity of our community is reflected in participation in
decision-making at all levels of our society," the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as our society fails to make the best use of the
skills and abilities of women, we are short-changing ourselves,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand on Track for Budget Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand remains on track
for a budget surplus this year as figures show a surplus of 1.236
 billion NZ dollars (667 million U.S. dollars), 522 million NZ
dollars (282 million U.S. dollars) higher than forecast, for the
seven months from last July to January this year.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Monday that
NZ Treasury deputy secretary Ian Rennie attributes the
better-than-expected operating balance to more tax revenue, lower
expenses of the government and higher surpluses from state-owned
enterprises and crown entities.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the period the government had a tax revenue
of 268 million NZ dollars (144.7 million U.S. dollars), up 1.4
percent on forecasts.
</P>
<P>
This mainly came from 145 million NZ dollars (78.3 million U.S.
 dollars) in Goods and Services Tax, 3.2 percent above forecast
and reflecting an underlying strength in consumption, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rennie said government expenses were 157 million NZ dollars
(84.8 million U.S. dollars) lower than forecast.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Treasury holds the increase in tax revenue will
 remain consistent through the rest of the financial year (from
July 1998 to June 1999), contributing to a full-year surplus
where a deficit of 52 million NZ dollars (28 million U.S.
dollars) was predicted last September, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Gender Gap Narrows Significantly in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The gap between men and women in
Sri Lanka has narrowed significantly over the years, not only in
population, but also in social and economic position when the
International Women's Day falls again on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although the male population was very much higher than the
female population in the past, male and female population gap has
narrowed sharply and today while the male population accounts for
51 percent, the female population is 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is projected that with the dawn of the next millennium,
female population may surpass the male population.
</P>
<P>
As in most Asian countries, male supremacy is generally
accepted but in Sri Lanka the role of women has been vital and
important.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has had the honor and distinction of producing the
world's first Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1960. Today
her daughter Chandrika Kumaratunga is the country's president
while she serves her third term as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
There are also a female cabinet minister and five female deputy
ministers in the country. A large number of Sri Lankan women have
excelled in the fields of medicine, law and administration.
Several government organizations have women at the helm.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's political and ethnic conflict may have traumatized
the country's women, but it has also strengthened their position
in society.
</P>
<P>
A large number of women are now running their homes following
the disappearance or death of their husbands.
</P>
<P>
Human rights organizations have said some 60,000 Sri Lankan
youths died or disappeared in a government crackdown on a radical
youth uprising in 1988 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
Thousands more have died or disappeared in the 16-year ethnic
conflict in which the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
rebels have been fighting a separate state for minority Tamils in
Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
These factors have forced society to change the way they treat
Sri Lankan women, women rights activists said.
</P>
<P>
The migrant of Sri Lankan women as workers to the Middle East
and their employment in hundreds of garment factories in free
trade zones in the country have given thousands of poor rural and
urban women economic independence.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 800,000 Sri Lankan women work in the Middle East and 65
percent of them are maids. In 1998, Sri Lankan migrant workers
remitted 60 billion rupees (880 million U.S. dollars), 60 percent
of which was sent to the country by house maids, according to the
Foreign Employment Bureau (FEB).
</P>
<P>
Although Sri Lanka has achieved much progress in improving
women's rights and status over the years, much leaves to be done
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution provides for equal opportunities for males and
females, but there is very low women participation in the decision
making level of the government machinery.
</P>
<P>
The female workforce in Sri Lanka is 32 percent but only 16
percent is at the decision making level.
</P>
<P>
Many reasons can be attributed for this poor performance by the
Sri Lankan women. But the main reason is that the day-to-day
household chores which consumed much time and energy of Sri Lankan
women apart from a hard day's work.
</P>
<P>
While in the West part of the household work is handled by the
husband, in Sri Lanka it is not so. Only a few could afford the
luxury of hiring domestic helpers. Therefore a woman has little
time to study or attend training programs which are prerequisites
for career development.
</P>
<P>
It is now being realized that the age-old concept of woman
being considered merely as a housewife should be changed. There is
agitation for gender equality and freedom from discrimination be
ensured for women.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Justice Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
accepted Justice Minister Shozaburo Nakamura's resignation Monday
morning and will appoint a successor shortly, government officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura submitted his resignation early Monday morning to take
responsibility for his alleged abuse of office and other issues
that have stalled Diet (parliament) proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura decided to step down amid increasing demands from
Japan's opposition parties for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Japan's second largest opposition party the New
Komeito announced it would support the Democratic Party of Japan (
DPJ), the Japan Communist Party (JCP) and the Social Democratic
Party (SDP) in their demands for the justice minister to step down.
</P>
<P>
The minister caused a furor in January by criticizing Japan's
Constitution and called for a revision of the charter.
</P>
<P>
"Japanese are writhing from the inability to revise the
Constitution, which was made by the Allied forces to prevent Japan
from waging war, defending itself or having an army," he said at
the time, but retracted the remarks later.
</P>
<P>
More recently, Nakamura became involved in an incident in which
U.S. movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger arrived in Japan last
October without a passport.
</P>
<P>
Schwarzenegger was permitted to enter Japan after he wrote an
explanatory letter, making a special request.
</P>
<P>
Nakamura failed to pass on the letter to appropriate ministry
officials, prompting suggestions that he kept the letter as
keepsake.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The 33-day Dhaka International Trade
Fair '99, the largest of its kind in Bangladesh, ended here Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The exposition was originally to end on February 28, but was
extended by one week to overcome the loss of time because of two
three-day countrywide destructive strikes organized by opposition
parties in February.
</P>
<P>
The estimated turnover of the fair was around 1 billion taka
(20.62 million U.S. dollars), an official of the organizing
committee of the fair said. The spot order being calculated would
be made available soon.
</P>
<P>
He said that on average 70,000-80,000 people visited the fair
every day. The highest number of people visited the fair on
February 21, ahead of the February 23-25 shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The Traffic World, a local company taking lease of the fair
bidding at 12.6 million taka (260,000 million dollars), would
exceed the projected income from the sale proceeds of entry
tickets, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the participants made brisk business at the fair, and
several companies declared lottery draws to promote their sales
and products, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 388 companies, including 86 foreign ones from 24
countries, participated in the fair, organized by the Ministry of
Commerce and the Export Promotion Bureau to boost the country's
exports and to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's export sector has developed rapidly in recent
years, earning 5.161 billion dollars in the July 1997-June 98
financial year.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's First Female Lawyer Discusses Her Profession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Yongjim is the first Tibetan woman
to enter the legal profession and the first to open a law office
to arbitrate economic disputes.
</P>
<P>
Her tough, articulate court behavior has won her recognition as
one of the nation's "Ten Best Lawyers". She has worked as a
defense lawyer in more than 310 criminal cases and has won not
guilty verdicts for 41 clients.
</P>
<P>
She graduated from Northwest Politics and Law College at the
age of 21 and was among the first group of people in the legal
profession in the Tibet Autonomous region. When she started work
14 years ago, there were only five other lawyers in Tibet, all
male.
</P>
<P>
"At that time, lawyers were considered bad guys who only
protected bad people," she recalled, "But over the past decade,
changes in legal awareness have been dramatic." It is not only
that companies have found it necessary to hire a lawyer, but
ordinary Tibetans have become increasingly aware of the need for
legal protection of their own interests, she added.
</P>
<P>
Since China allowed law offices to open here in 1985, the
number of law offices has grown to 11 and the number of lawyers to
53, with 40 percent of them Tibetans. They have dealt with some 3,
730 cases, 78 percent of which were economic or civil suits and
have acted as advisors to 300 companies and institutes.
</P>
<P>
Yongjim had early awareness of booming local economy and opened
the first law office to cope with economic disputes in the region.
The firm now provides legal services for 30 companies and units.
</P>
<P>
She said she considers herself feminine, a person who prefers
reading and music in her spare time, but seldom has time for
hobbies because of three or four cases to defend in court every
week. She can't even remember having had a holiday for the past
ten years.
</P>
<P>
But the 35 year-old woman is always gratified by her work and
the fact that she can help local farmers and herdspeople as his
own brothers and sisters. So she is well-respected as a deputy to
the Tibetan Autonomous Regional People's Congress", a member of
the Executive Committee of the Tibetan Federation of Industry and
Commerce, and vice-chairwoman of Tibetan Lawyers Federation.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region's lawyers expect to see their numbers
grow to 100 by the year 2000, Yongjim said.

personnel trainning, and cultural relics protection.
</P>
<P>

north from the south of the country for the western regions.

COLOMBO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands government has
agreed to provide financial assistance to Sri Lanka to construct
3,000 houses under a rehabilitation program, the official Daily
News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The total amount to be spent on this project will be 75 million

(220,000 dollars) has already been released, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>

Trincomalee area which had been found to be the most suitable in a
survey carried out by Netherlands officials, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the houses, to be made available to the users
before September, will be equally divided among the three
communities -- Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The beneficiaries have been selected from nine Divisional
Secretary divisions, it said, adding that each beneficiary will be
given a grant of 25,000 rupees (368 dollars) in three
installments.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing ethnic war between the government and Tamil rebels
has displaced hundreds of thousands of people living in the north
and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Obtain 500 Million Dollars From Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is likely to obtain
another 500-million-U.S.-dollar special loan from Japan for
development of state-owned infrastructure projects, a government
source said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The source said a team of Japanese officials will visit
Thailand later Monday to discuss details of the loan, including
the exact amount to be extended to Thailand and the criteria of
the projects to be financed.
</P>
<P>
Although the exact amount of the loan to Thailand has not yet
finalized, it is likely to be 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
This loan is not related to the loans provided by the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund under the Miyazawa scheme for Thailand's
social safety net program.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister's Office Minister Savit Bhotiwihok said earlier
the loan would carry very good conditions -- 40-year repayment
period with 10-year grace period and interest rate of one percent.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be extended by the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the loan, as announced by Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi at the recent conference of ASEAN countries
in Hanoi last December, is to provide financial assistance to
ASEAN countries facing economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be used for infrastructure projects to stimulate
ASEAN economies.
</P>
<P>
The loans will carry a condition to also stimulate Japan's
economy, including stipulations that borrowers would allow
Japanese contractors to undertake the projects and purchase
materials from Japan.
</P>
<P>
It was likely Thailand and other ASEAN countries in economic
crisis, including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, would
obtain the loans next year, according to the source who refused to
be named.

<HEADLINE> Women's Lives Significantly Improved in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China has made substantial
achievements in improving women's working and living conditions as
well as their health and education level since early 1990s,
according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).
</P>
<P>
Chinese women received an average six-year compulsory education
in 1997, one year more than in 1990, the NBS was quoted by Moday's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
With the introduction of a nine-year compulsory education
system and fast development of professional training, Chinese
women have been granted more access to education.
</P>
<P>
The gap between boys and girls in primary school attendance
dropped from 2.9 percent in 1990 to 0.2 percent in 1997, according
to the NBS.
</P>
<P>
The number of employed women has increased remarkably thanks to
the country's rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
NBS figures showed that women employees accounted for 46.5
percent of the work force, 1.5 percentage points higher than in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The rate of women engaging in heavy manual work has plummeted
thanks to various specialized training programs, and the number of
women participating in governmental institutions, non-governmental
organizations and companies has increased greatly.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Privatize Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will privatize water
supplies nearly next year to ensure the best use of water
resources, a government official has said.
</P>
<P>
An independent regulatory body would be established prior to
the privatization to protect consumers from being unfairly treated
by privatized water companies, Wanchai, deputy governor of the
Provincial Waterworks Authority (PWA), said in remarks made public
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A committee has been set up to oversee the privatization under
the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority (MWA), the Waste Water
Management Organization and municipal and private water companies.
</P>
<P>
The committee was now in the process of selecting a consultant
to make a final study of privatization, which would take some
months to complete.
</P>
<P>
Even before the country entered the International Monetary
Fund's bailout program, Thailand had privatized part of its
water-supply industry in the provinces. This previous
privatization was made in the absence of a proper regulatory
regime and a public water price-adjustment mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The government would have to make a decision on how fast the
country should further privatize its water supplies, which was
usually a time-consuming process as an appropriate regulatory
regime had to be passed by Parliament, according to Wanchai.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank report, there are few opportunities
for introducing competition among water suppliers since the
network of water pipelines, a major element of the total cost of
water, can be operated efficiently only as a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank supports the Thai government's privatization
plan and recently held a workshop for Thai officials on the
privatization of the water and sanitary sectors.

<HEADLINE> Regulation Revised to Handle Medical Errors Fairly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China's health authority plans to
revise a regulation on investigating medical errors in a bid to
ensure a fair and objective settlement of related disputes.
</P>
<P>
The present "Measures for the Handling of Medical Accidents",
which was published 12 years ago, had to be revised because it was
hard to keep the investigation public and fair, Today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the present version, the committee that
investigates the medical errors is totally composed of medical
experts from the hospitals or other departments of the public
health.
</P>
<P>
"Because it is these units of the public health service which
committed the medical errors in the first place, it is hard to
keep the investigation public and fair," the newspaper quoted Wu
Mingjiang, an official of the Ministry of Health, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new version may stipulate that the investigation committees
should invite forensic doctors to ensure legal authoritativeness.
The committees should include deputies of the People's Congress
and People's Political Consultative Conference at all levels,
respectively the country's legislative and advisory bodies.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the present version, the revised measures
authorize the patients or their guardians to copy and keep the
original medical records, which, in the past, were often altered
after the medical errors happened, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that the doctors who cause medical errors
due to negligence would be charged as criminals, receiving a
penalty of over six months or even a lifetime suspension from
practising medicine.
</P>
<P>
The revision may include the amount of compensation. The
highest amount given in compensation for medical errors now is
only 3,000 yuan (360 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Government Procurement Helps Save Public Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China began to promote government
procurement through open biddings last year as one of the e ways
to improve budget management, economize on expenditure and curb
corruption.
</P>
<P>
The practice, which is highly credited by the general public,
was again recommended by financial minister Xiang Huaicheng in his
budget report last Saturday to the on-going annual session of the
National People's Congress, China's top lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
The report calls for accelerating the implementation of a zero-
base budget system and a system for government procurement "pug
the loopholes in terms of their sources and systems."
</P>
<P>
Machinery and electronic sector is the first to experiment with
government procurement. Since 1985, 30,000 purchases involving 50
billion U.S. dollars were made through domestic and international
biddings, reducing the total cost by an average of 10 percent for
imported equipment and 15 percent for domestic-made products.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the State Council decided that all
central government departments should purchase cars, office
facilities and other necessities through open biddings.
</P>
<P>
The first government procurement was made in February of this
year. The Great Wall Group, one of China's major computer
manufacturers, won the bidding as the supplier of computers and
computer-related facilities for 44 government institutions under
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Many local governments are ready to do so in their procurement
as it encourages competition and thus helps substantially cut
their spending in this regard substantially.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest economic and financial center, has
invited tenders to take part in the procurement of part of the
equipment for projects financed by the city's own coffer in Pudong
Development zone. The purchases made over the past two years have
helped cut 10 million yuan, or 15 percent less than the allocated
amount.
</P>
<P>
In what was said as the biggest government procurement so far
in the country, the Jiangsu Province in east China invited tenders
to take part in the bidding for purchasing building materials and
equipment for buildings with a total floor space of 420,000 sq.m.
in the city of Taizhou.
</P>
<P>
The open biddings in July last year initiated by the Beijing
People's Art Theater for the architect design of the Capital
Theater and by the Beijing Municipal government for purchasing
official cars became the landmark in the Chinese capital in
endorsing the system of government procurement.
</P>
<P>
Other cities and provinces including Shaaxi, Sichuan, Yunnan,
Henan, Zhejiang and Liaoning have all introduced the government
procurement system.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers and commodity distributors welcome the system as
it encourages open and fair competition and they should no longer
rack their brains as to how much kickbacks they should offer to
win their customers.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Investment in Western Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China in recent years has
increased investment by a big margin in its western regions in a
bid to prompt new economic growth and narrow the gap between the
country's interior and coastal areas, officials from various
western provinces and autonomous regions said.
</P>
<P>
According to these officials, who are here attending the
ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC), China's top legislature, as deputies, all provinces and
regions in the western part of the country last year scored a
record fixed assets investment.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998, our region invested 57 billion yuan (about 7 billion
US dollars) in fixed assets, which represented an 18.8 percent
growth over the previous year," said Deputy Yang Daoxi, director
of the Planning Commission of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The money was used for the construction of 70 key projects
ranging from express highways to railways and port projects, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The southwest China province of Guizhou last year spent 31.5
billion yuan on local infrastructure projects, which is the
largest investment the province has ever made over the past five
decades, said Deputy Liu Fangren, secretary of the Provincial
Committee of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Some 22 percent of the investment was injected in developing
local transportation and telecommunications sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Sun Ying, secretary of the Gansu Provincial
Party Committee, this northwest China province in 1998 made an "
unprecedented" amount of investment of 33.1 billion yuan in fixed
assets in 33 key infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Construction of infrastructure projects has contributed 4.2
percentage points to the 9.2-percent economic growth the province
achieved last year, Sun stressed.
</P>
<P>
"This proves that expanding infrastructure construction is an
effective way to stimulate domestic demand and promote economic
development in the western regions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the National Statistics Bureau show that in
1998, investment growth for the western regions reached 31.2
percent, 14.9 percentage points higher than that for the eastern
regions.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the money raised last year through the issue of 100
billion yuan of special state treasury bonds for infrastructure
construction has flowed into the western regions," said Liu Hong,
director of the National Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that China has planned to invest more than 750
billion U.S. dollars in capital construction in the three-year
period starting 1998, and that the central and western regions of
the country will remain an investment focus.
</P>
<P>
"This year Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region plans to invest
another 65 billion yuan in agricultural and water conservation
projects," said Yang Daoxi, the regional planning commission
director.

TIRANA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Hashim Thaci, head of the Kosovar
Albanian delegation at peace talks in France, said here Sunday
that Kosovo rebel leaders will be willing to sign a peace deal if
NATO forces are allowed to enter Kosovo and the Kosovo Liberation
Army is to retain its status.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a press conference held after he met
Albanian President Rexhep Meidani, Prime Minister Pandeli Majko
and Foreign Minister Paskal Milo here.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo rebel leaders and politicians will meet Monday to

"We are determined to seek a peaceful settlement to the Kosovo
crisis and will sign the peace deal at a proper time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the KLA should retain its status as a defensive force,
indicating that it does not totally agree with the plan, which
calls for the rebels to turn in their arms and become part of an
ethnic Albanian police force.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that NATO forces must be allowed to station
in the province, saying it is the only way to guarantee the
implementation of the accord.

<HEADLINE> Charlotte Hornets Coach Cowens Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Charlotte Hornets coach Dave
Cowens said last month that he did not expect to be back next
season. He was right.
</P>
<P>
Cowens, who complained openly about his league-low salary,
resigned today, citing what the team called irreconcilable
differences. The Hornets will name an interim coach on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cowens guided the Hornets to 105 wins and a pair of postseason
appearances in his first two seasons. Charlotte was just 4-11 this
season, partially due to a rash of injuries.
</P>
<P>
Cowen's reported salary of 675,000 US dollars was lowest among
all NBA coaches. He was offered an extension by Hornets owner
George Shinn during the offseason, but that offer reportedly was
taken off the table by Shinn, who felt Cowens was unappreciative.
</P>
<P>
In February, Cowens said he did not expect to be back next
season, with his salary the stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
"This is a mutual understanding between both parties," Hornets
vice president of basketball operations Bob Bass said. "The option
year of Dave's contract has been terminated and he is free of any
contractual obligations to the club."
</P>
<P>
The Hornets have been without starting forwards Glen Rice and
Anthony Mason all season. In addition, guards B.J. Armstrong and
Eldridge Recasner have been sidelined for extended stretches.

<HEADLINE> China Not to Increase Imports of Textile Machinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China will not increase imports of
textile machinery in the next few years, according to an official
from the State Administration of Textile Industry.
</P>
<P>
Chen Bin, director of the planning division with the
administration, was quoted by Monday's China Daily as saying that
the current situation stems from the domestic sluggish demand and
shrinking exports to Europe, the United Sates and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The present oversupply of textile products is a consequence of
backward technologies and poor management, and the key task for
the textile industry is to cut out redundant spindles, reduce the
low-level production capacity and make full use of available and
performing machines, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that home-made textile machinery
now accounts for 50 percent of the total market, and the
proportion is expected to rise to 70 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China's textile industry exported 43 billion U.S. dollars worth
of its products last year compared with 45.5 billion dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Experts indicated that the dire situation will not improve soon
due to the lingering impact of the Asian financial crisis and the
export quota restriction from Europe and the U.S.,the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Greater Attention to Social Sciences Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A deputy attending the ongoing
Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress called for
greater attention to be paid to the development of social sciences,
insisting that the sector should develop in parallel to natural
sciences and engineering technology in China.
</P>
<P>
Hou Changjie, president of Wuhan University, made the call here
during a panel discussion examining the government work report
delivered by Premier Zhu Rongji at last Friday's NPC opening
session.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu in his government work report said that developing
China by promoting the development of science and education is a
state strategy and that it is one of the main tasks for the
present government, he said.
</P>
<P>
The university president noted that for every 30 yuan invested
by the government in natural sciences, only one yuan is spent on
social sciences, while the country's 210,000 social scientists
face a severe lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The role of social sciences for economic and social development
in China over the past two decades should not be played down, he
said, adding that the sector should be further developed as the
country is in a crucial period for the establishment of a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The two wheels of economic and social developments can roll on
the right track in China if social sciences, natural sciences and
engineering technology develop in a coordinated and complementary
way, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- American jan-Michael Gambill
outwitted his Australian teenager opponent to take his first ATP
Tour title in the 350,000 US dollars Franklin Templeton Tennis
Classic in Scottsdale, Arizona on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gambill beat a 46-minute rain delay before outpowering Lleyton
Hewitt 7-6 (7-2), 4-6, 6-4, and will jump from 45 to 32 in the
latest tour rankings to be released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The win was an unanticipated dream come true. "I didn't come
here expecting to win the tournament even though it was a dream. I
feel good about it," said Gambill.
</P>
<P>
The rains interrupted play just after Hewitt leveled the match
by breaking Gambill in the 10th game.
</P>
<P>
"The delay helped me rethink what I needed to do," Gambill said.
</P>
<P>
When play resumed, Gambill quickly broke service in the first
game but Hewitt broke back in the sixth to knot the set at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
After holding at 4-3, Hewitt felt he should have had the key
break but a questionable sideline call kept the set even. At 15-40
chair umpire Steve Ullrich over-ruled a linesman's call in favour
of Gambill.
</P>
<P>
Along the way to the final, Gambill became just the sixth
player to notch wins over world number one Pete Sampras and Andre
Agassi, who retired with a right hamstring strain, in the same
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Hewitt had swept past seven opponents without losing a set,
including two-time defending U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter and
another Australian, Mark Woodforde, in the semifinals.

Than Shwe left here Monday morning for Bangkok on a two-day
goodwill visit to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Than Shwe will meet Chuan Leekpai, prime

River were exchanged.

<HEADLINE> Anti-US Protests Staged in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Italian demonstrators held a
peaceful protest in front of the U.S. embassy here on Sunday
against the acquittal of the U.S. marine pilot who was responsible
for the Mt. Cermis tragedy last year.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators urged the U.S. government to send the pilot back
to Italy for a just trial and to pull all its military forces out
of Italy and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another protest was staged out of the NATO (North
Atlantic Treaty Organization) military base in the Italian
northeast town of Aviano, urging European military troops to
replace the U.S. troops in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Protesters in Aviano also called for a nationwide boycott of
Coca-cola which is the symbol of American products.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military court acquitted marine pilot Richard Ashby of
responsibility in the death of 20 tourists killed on February 3,
1998 when his low-flying plane snipped their cable-car wires.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling, based on the fact that Ashby and the crew
were given incorrect maps and having instrumental problems,
sparked indignation in the home countries of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Three of the victims were Italians, seven Germans, five
Belgians, two from Poland, two from Austria and one from Holland.
</P>
<P>
In Washington on Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to see justice was done.
</P>
<P>
Clinton apologized for the incident and said the U.S. would
offer adequate compensation.
</P>
<P>
Italian political parties have unanimously called for a review
of rules governing NATO bases in Italy and the jurisdiction of
trials in such cases.
</P>
<P>
The Italian and U.S. defense ministries have agreed to work out
new rules to prevent a recurrence of the Mt. Cermis tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Gustafsson Defends Title in Copenhagen Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Magnus Gustafsson defended his
singles title in the Copenhagen Open, beating Fabrice Santoro 6-4,
6-1 in Sunday's championship match.
</P>
<P>
"I got two early service breaks and that helped," said
Gustafsson, one of the heroes on last year's Swedish Davis Cup
champion team. "I served well and I'm also happy with my forehand.
Even my tactics worked. That's usually one of my weaknesses."
</P>
<P>
After helping Sweden win its third Davis Cup title in three
years last December, Gustafsson underwent arthroscopic surgery
later that month which forced him to miss the Australian Open in
January.
</P>
<P>
In four tournaments this year, the 32-year-old veteran only won
one match.
</P>
<P>
It was the 13th ATP Tour title in 25 finals for Gustafsson, who
is approaching four million US dollars in career prize money. He'
ll move to No. 26 on the ATP computer rankings next week.
</P>
<P>
Santoro, seeded fourth in the indoor tournament, played his
second ATP final. He won the Marseille Open in his native France
early February.
</P>
<P>
Santoro lost three ATP finals early in his career between 1990
and '94 before finally winning his first singles title two years
ago in Lyon, France.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Myanmar, Thailand Strive to Enhance Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Thailand have striven
in the past few years to enhance their bilateral ties, especially
in the fields of politics, economic cooperation, trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
Politically, Thailand, like other ASEAN countries, adopted a
"constructive engagement" policy towards Myanmar and supported the
country's integration into the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is also actively canvassing for Myanmar in a bid to
get the country to be present at the ASEAN-EU (European Union)
Foreign Ministers Meeting scheduled for March 30 in Berlin,
Germany.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, former Thai prime minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh
visited Myanmar, setting the stage for enhancing trade and
economic cooperation and good-neighborly relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on border crossing was then signed and notes on
jurisdiction over the Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge on the Moei
(Thaungyin) River linking Maesot and Myawaddy were exchanged,
signifying a step forward in facilitating trade, transport and
communications between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, foreign ministers of Myanmar and Thailand
agreed at the fourth meeting of the two countries' Joint
Commission for Bilateral Cooperation in Bangkok to enhance their
bilateral cooperation in the sectors of culture, health,
education, technology, agriculture, tourism, trade, investment,
communications, energy, fishery and drug control.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, one of Myanmar's major trading partners in Asia,
began border trade with the country in March 1996 at three border
points -- Maesai-Tachilek, Maesod-Myawaddy and Ranong-Kawthoung.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, bilateral trade including
border trade stood at 357 million U.S. dollars in fiscal year
1997-98, up from 289.3 million dollars in 1996-97. The balance of
trade was in Thailand's favor.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade in the first 10 months of 1998 was registered
at 370 million dollars with Thailand's exports to Myanmar
amounting to 295.19 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, one of the leading foreign investors in Myanmar,
ranked the third after Singapore and Britain with 1.244 billion
dollars in 44 projects out of 7.089 billion dollars' total foreign
investment in 312 projects at the end of October 1998.
</P>
<P>
The investment covers sectors of oil and gas, hotels and
tourism, livestock breeding and fishery, industrial estate and
transport.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's investment was also highlighted by its involvement
in the development of two Myanmar offshore natural gas fields, the
Yadana and the Yetagun, where gas is to be sold to Thailand under
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Thailand's private sector began to join in the
infrastructural development of Myanmar's Hlaingtharya Industrial
Zone in Yangon in April 1997, bringing the zone to the third
foreign-invested industrial zone status after the Mingaladon and
the Thanlyin-Kyauktan.
</P>
<P>
In the telecommunications sector, Myanmar initiated a lease
contract with the Sinawatra Group of Thailand in March 1998 to use
the Thaicom Satellite transponder for its domestic satellite
communications services. The use of the Thaicom began in May.
</P>
<P>
With regard to transport links, Thailand has granted two loans
of 150 million and 11.5 million dollars respectively for building
Myanmar's new Mandalay International Airport and upgrading the
Tachilek-Kengtung road.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also plan to develop two deep seaports -- one
in Thailand's Bagan Saphan in the gulf of Thailand and the other
in Myanmar's Bokpyin area along the Andaman Sea.
</P>
<P>
As for the tourism sector, the two countries reached an
agreement in July 1998 on cooperation in tourism. Myanmar
sponsored a travel show in Bangkok in September, seeking means to
bring in more tourists from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar designated four border points with Thailand
to admit tourists. These are Kawthoung, Tachilek, Myawaddy and
Phaya Thonzu.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also made efforts to strengthen their
technical cooperation as part of their endeavors to promote
economic cooperation and bilateral ties, holding an annual
consultation meeting on the cooperation in Yangon in August 1998
and discussing the projects in agriculture, health, science and
technology under implementation.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Myanmar also cooperate in drug control, having
bilateral agreement on the effort. The two countries, involving
the United Nations Drug Control Program, concluded a project of
integrated rural development, law enforcement and demand reduction
in Myanmar's Tachilek, Ahdec and Hsanliu areas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The two countries' regional authorities also cooperated in
suppressing drug smuggling along the common border, seeking ways
to reduce the use of narcotic drugs and control HIV/AIDS in the
areas.
</P>
<P>
In the latest development, Myanmar and Thai anti-narcotics
authorities agreed at a cross-border meeting in Tachilek in
January this year to step up drug suppression cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In February, Thai Army Commander-in-Chief General Surayud
Chulanont visited Myanmar and an exchange program on language and
educational training of military officers, proposed by the Thai
side, was agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
On March 8, Senior-General Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar
State Peace and Development Council and prime minister, embarked
on a two-day goodwill visit to Thailand at the invitation of Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two leaders are expected to have
discussions on a wide range of bilateral issues including
economic cooperation, drug control and the recent maritime
clashes on the Andaman Sea.
</P>
<P>
The visit would contribute to the enhancement of the two
countries' bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Thailand established diplomatic relations in August
1948.

<HEADLINE> Over Half of Carjacking Attempts Succeed in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- More than half the annual
average of nearly 49,000 carjacking attempts in the United States
are successful, and almost two-thirds of the incidents occur
within eight kilometers of the owner's home, the Justice
Department said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reporting on data for 1992 through 1996, the most recent
available, the Bureau of Justice Statistics said that each year an
average of 48,787 carjackings are tried, and 24,520, or 50.3
percent, succeed.
</P>
<P>
Victims were injured in 23 percent of the completed carjackings
but in only 10 percent of the unsuccessful ones. A weapon was used
in 83 percent of the incidents.
</P>
<P>
The report said 84 percent of victims were not injured, but 4
percent suffered serious injuries, such as gunshot or knife
wounds, broken bones, internal injuries or loss of consciousness.
The remainder had minor injuries like bruises or chipped teeth.
Some incidents had more than one victim.
</P>
<P>
The bureau defined carjacking as a theft in which a vehicle was
taken or attempted to be taken by force or threat of it. It
counted only carjackings by strangers, not by acquaintances or
relatives.
</P>
<P>
This was the bureau's second study of carjacking. A study five
years ago found a somewhat lower annual average number of
carjackings.

<HEADLINE> Manchested United Held to Goalless Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United was held to a 0-0
draw by the 10-men Chelsea in their F.A. Cup quarter-final tie on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea had midfielder Roberto Di Matteo sent off seconds
before the end of the first half after receiving a second yellow
card for a clumsy tackle on Paul Scholes.
</P>
<P>
The visitors defended superbly throughout the second half which
United totally dominated. United's England midfielder Paul Scholes,
guilty of a number of glaring misses in the second period, was
sent off in the 86th minute for a second yellow card.
</P>
<P>
The home side could find no way past French World Cup defender
Marcel Desailly and Dutch goalkeeper Ed De Goey, who both played
outstandingly and helped secure a replay at Stamford Bridge on
March 10.
</P>
<P>
The nearest either side came to scoring was when United
defender Gary Neville glanced a diving header onto de Goey's right-
hand post after 38 minutes and the ball bounced clear.
</P>
<P>
Both sides' hopes of winning both the league and Cup stay alive
with the draw. Cup holders Arsenal, also in the three-way race for
the league title, beat Derby County 1-0 in another quarter-final
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In other match on Sunday, Newcastle United trounced Everton 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's quarter-final between Barnsley and Tottenham Hotspur
was postponed until March 16 because of heavy snow on the pitch.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Committed to Ensuring Health Care of Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Sunday said that the government is determined to develop
activities for promotion and protection of the health of women
across the country.
</P>
<P>
In his message on the occasion of International Women's Day
falling on March 8, Sharif said his government intends to provide
health facilities to the women folk "through a network of health
services so that in the 21st century rural and urban women are
adequately covered with an efficiently functioning health service
in Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the National Plan of Action for Women, which he
had launched on August 14, 1998, he said it "reiterates our
commitment to serve the women in every sector and in every home".
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's International Women's Day is "Women's
Health", which, Sharif said, "makes us particularly conscious of
our responsibility for ensuring better health care for women".
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Minister of State for Women Development Tehmina
Daultana Sunday also said that the government is fully committed
to economic, political and social empowerment of women.
</P>
<P>
The socio-economic indicators reflect that there is a gap
between men and women in the country in almost all key sectors
like family life, health, mortality, nutrition, education and
employment, she said.
</P>
<P>
The government, nevertheless, is determined to rectify the
existing imbalance through various affirmative actions and
national development initiatives, Daultana added.
</P>
<P>
Her ministry will work to lift women's social, economic, and
political status in line with the policy declarations and
commitments made in the National Plan of Action.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to take every step for ensuring development
and advancement of the status of women at all levels in every
field," she said.

In a statement issued through his spokesman, the U.N. chief
said he had sent condolences to the new Emir, Sheikhh Hamad bin
Isa al-Khalifa, and assured him of U.N. support in the pursuit of
peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Sheikhh Isa, who led Bahrain to independence from Britain in
August 1971, died of a sudden heart attack on Saturday shortly
after meeting visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, who
is on a Gulf tour. He was 66 years old.
</P>
<P>
His eldest son and heir apparent, Crown Prince Hamad, who is
49, was sworn in soon afterwards as the new emir of the small, oil
rich island.

<P>
"He has sent his condolences to the new Emir, Hamad bin Isa
al-Khalifa, and assured him of the support of the United Nations
in pursuing the path of peace and prosperity," the statement

country in the Gulf region.

<HEADLINE> German Greens Reject to Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN March 7 (Xinhua)-- Germany's Greens, junior partner of
Schroeder's red-green coalition government, decided to go without
any radical change of its policy and organization after the party's
congress ending Sunday in the eastern city of Erfurt.
</P>
<P>
The party, officially known as Alliance 90/The Greens, has seen
its popularity sharply plunging after joining the government.
</P>
<P>
Antje Radke, co-chief of the party, dismissed calls for
organizational change and said that the party was adjusting to the
realities of the government.
</P>
<P>
German foreign minister and co-chairman of the party Joshka
Fischer attempted to propose a change of the party's direction but
failed to get enough support.
</P>
<P>
The 650 delegates attending the congress, which opened on
Friday, spent most of the time nominating candidates for the
European Parliament elections scheduled on June 13.
</P>
<P>
Currently the Greens hold 12 seats in European Parliament in
Strassbourg, among which only eight is considered safe because of
the slump in support.
